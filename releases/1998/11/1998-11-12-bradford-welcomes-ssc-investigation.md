Revenue Minister Max Bradford today welcomed the State Services Commission's announcement of its investigation into aspects of the Department of Inland Revenue and Department of Work and Income.

Mr Bradford said he was pleased the investigation was proceeding quickly, and that those appointed to conduct it were well-qualified for the task and independent of the SSC and departments being investigated.

"The public can have full confidence in the investigation to get to the bottom of allegations about the security of information held by the departments," he said.

"The investigation has my, and my department's full support and co-operation.

"While the number of cases of public servants selling confidential information is believed to be very small, allegations of corruption and fraud in our public service are taken very seriously by the Government."
