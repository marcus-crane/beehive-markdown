Labour MP Marion Hobbs has started the week with egg on her face after incorrectly claiming that TVNZ was shifting its archives, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"Ms Hobbs claimed she had information that TVNZ was planning to move its archives. That 'information' is incorrect, she has been set up by someone with an axe to grind," Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall said TVNZ was not planning to move the archives which are considered an important historical resource. Improved technology had meant that fewer staff were required to operate the archives to the same high standard of service.

"If Ms Hobbs had bothered to check her 'information' before she ran off crying wolf she could have saved herself a whole heap of embarrassment. Her press statement has also put the media in the compromising position of reporting her nonsense as news.

"Labour must be held accountable for this kind of nonsense. That's a key reason behind the taxometer.

"What the taxometer already shows is that Labour's tax and spending promises don't add up. Labour's proposed tax rise to 39 cents in the dollar for New Zealanders earning over $60,000 won't deliver anything like enough cash to pay for all of Labour's spending promises. So who's next?

"Labour have over-spent already. The numbers don't add up. If Labour won't acknowledge that, then National intends to keep them honest."
