Health Minister Bill English said today that Coast Health Care would be able to move forward with its business planning now that an interim contract had been agreed between the hospital and the Health Funding Authority.

"While I have not yet supported a business plan for the 1998/99 year for Coast Health Care, the interim contract will allow the hospital to move forward with its business planning for this year and into the future.

"There is no doubt that there are special issues to be considered regarding health services on the coast, in particular the geography of the area.

"I know that Coast Health Care is working hard to find long-term solutions to some of the issues the hospital is facing.

"The HFA and the hospital have agreed to undertake a joint needs analysis for the West Coast. This will confirm the health needs of West Coast people into the future and it is expected that this will form the basis of a long-term contract for services.

"Along with the confirmation of the retention of services at Grey Base Hospital, this will provide long term security for the public and health providers on the Coast," said Mr English.
