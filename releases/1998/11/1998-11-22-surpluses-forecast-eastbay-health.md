Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Eastbay Health's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting surpluses from this financial year.

"A surplus of $0.5 million is forecast this year, followed by a surplus of $0.2 million in the 1999/00 year and break-even the year after. Any surpluses will be ploughed back into health services.

"Eastbay health has also done well in two key performance areas. Its average length of stay is 3.3 days which puts it first in its group of eight, and 74 percent of patients rate its performance as very good, which puts it first out of 22 hospitals.

"A key point in the 1998/99 business plan is the new maternity unit and refurbishment of the operating theatres. Eastbay Health and Western Bay of Health, in Tauranga, have developed a business case for the amalgamation of the two organisations.

"I am pleased that Eastbay Health is in such a sound financial position because this means that the people of the Eastern Bay of Plenty can have certainty and security about their health services.

"The relocation of services from Opotiki Hospital to a new site within the township is a highlight of the current year and is scheduled to be finished by February next year.

"I am confident that Eastbay Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services," said Mr English.
