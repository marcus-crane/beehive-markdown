A report on the West Coast beech proposals prepared by Dr Murray Efford, a Landcare scientist employed by the Forest and Bird Society, was welcomed today by the Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter also acknowledged the efforts Forest and Bird had made providing a comprehensive submission on Timberlands West Coast Limited's sustainable beech proposals.

"Their input adds to the robustness of the process and plans," said Mr Carter.

"The report questions the forest growth model employed by Timberlands used to assess the potential annual sustainable harvest. However, the issues it raises have already been considered by the scientific team put together to independently assess the plans," Mr Carter said.

"Dr Efford has questioned some of the assumptions made by Timberlands and has suggested his own assumptions. At this stage it is impossible to know whether Dr Efford's or the scientific team's assumptions are more accurate."

"This is precisely why a fundamental of sustainable management is the constant monitoring of environmental effects, and the continuous reviewing and adaption of plans. This is already required under the Forests Act." "The scientist who prepared the Forest and Bird report has apparently been working in isolation. It is unfortunate he did not discuss his opinions with the eight other scientists, including one of his Landcare colleagues, who have already been part of the comprehensive assessment process thus far", Mr Carter concluded.
