Secondary school aged students will aim for a new unified and clearer set of qualifications starting from the year 2001, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

"The new qualifications system, dubbed Achievement 2001, contains the best in assessment and learning in our schools at the moment. It will give every student the potential to make the most of their education, and give them qualifications to help set them up well for the future.

"The new system centres on the National Certificate of Educational Achievement. It will become the mainstay of secondary school qualifications in the 21st Century.

"All learning in the senior secondary school, and beyond, will generate credits towards the National Certificate of Educational Achievement," Mr Creech said.

Key features are:

The National Certificate of Educational Achievement will be the main qualification in the senior secondary school. There will be four levels to the Certificate: Students will be able to study at different levels at different years if they wish to.

- Level One For most Year 11 or Form five students
- Level Two For most Year 12 or Form six students
- Level Three For most Year 13 or Form seven students
- Level Four "Scholarship" for highest achieving students

Achievement at each level will be assessed by a mix of external and internal assessment.

School Certificate and Bursary examinations will remain.

Success in these exams will earn a student recognition at Level One or Three of the Certificate.

New Achievement Standards will measure achievement in internal assessment and exams for each curriculum subject.

They will recognise excellence by grading achievement. Unit Standards will remain, measuring success in non-conventional subjects. Success in Unit Standards will earn a student recognition at Level One, Two or Three of the Certificate.

Schools will be able to offer courses that package any combination of Achievement Standards and Unit Standards. The new system will be phased in over three years, starting with Year 11 or Form five students in the year 2001.

"The National Certificate will record a student's individual performance, with grades and marks at each level for Achievement Standards completed," Mr Creech said.

"At present, some students are being assessed against Unit Standards for National Qualification Framework qualifications, as well as being prepared for examination-based awards. This has proved confusing at times for students, parents, and others involved. It also contributes to higher workloads for teachers.

"The changes address these problems. Students will gain credible, quality qualifications that recognise their strengths and allow them to succeed at different levels and in different subject areas.

"Including Unit Standards for non conventional school subjects, exams and a system of recognising achievement will help students, teachers and employers in the future. The new system will provide employers with a clear assessment of a student's achievement across a whole range of subjects and skills."

Mr Creech said teachers would no longer have a dual system of assessment for Unit Standards and exams.

"The new system is very similar to that in tertiary education, where students can achieve on a range of fronts at different levels, and be recognised for that achievement," Mr Creech concluded.
