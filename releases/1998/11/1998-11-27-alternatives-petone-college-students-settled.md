The Ministry of Education has finalised new schooling options for next year for students who would have gone to Petone College, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"While it is sad that Petone College will be closing its doors for the last time this year, I am pleased the local school community and the Ministry have finalised good alternative education for the students for 1999.

"Hutt Valley High School has played a key role in helping identify solutions for the students affected. The best educational interests of students have been paramount in the decisions made about Petone College."

For next year:

Students with special education needs currently enrolled at Petone College will be able to enrol at Hutt Valley High School. Hutt Valley High School will use the special education facility at Petone College.

Hutt Valley High School will offer all existing Petone College students who live in their enrolment scheme area guaranteed enrolment at the school. In addition current and potential Petone College students living in the Petone Borough will be able to attend Hutt Valley High if it is their local school.

Hutt Valley High School will ensure the provision of the technology curriculum from the Petone site for year 7 and 8 students and provide community education programme on the Petone site.

"The Ministry of Education will continue to work with Board and staff at Hutt Valley High School on the provision of special needs, technology curriculum and community education beyond next year," Mr Creech said.

"Other future possibilities for the Petone site will be explored next year," Mr Creech said.
