Associate Minister of Revenue, Hon David Carter, today confirmed that Inland Revenue had lodged a complaint with the Police regarding the alleged release of confidential taxpayer information from IRD.

"At this stage two staff from one office are implicated in the provision of addresses to debt collection agencies."

"The issue came to light in mid-September. Since then the IRD and Police have been investigating the situation."

"The Department has very clear procedures for managing this type of incident. This includes referral to the Police in appropriate cases. In this case the matter was referred to the Police Fraud Squad."

"The two people who appear at this stage to be involved are nowhere near the number that Rodney Hide has been alleging. I have no idea where his information has come from, but it appears to be grossly exaggerated."
