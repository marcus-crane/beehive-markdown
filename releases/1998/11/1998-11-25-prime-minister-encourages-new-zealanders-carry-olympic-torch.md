Prime Minister Jenny Shipley encouraged all New Zealanders to grab the chance to carry the Olympic Torch for New Zealand, when it toured the country in the year 2000.

Mrs Shipley made the special call at a launch ceremony for the Olympic Torch Relay today at The Museum of New Zealand - Te Papa Tongarewa.

"The Olympic Torch Relay is the first of the events supported by the Government's Millennium marketing programme to encourage New Zealanders to celebrate the turn of the Century.

"The torch will arrive from Fiji on June 5, 2000 and will travel from Queenstown to Christchurch, then Wellington, where it will pass through the heart of Te Papa before making its way  
north to Rotorua and Auckland, and then onto Australia.

"Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders will be able to participate in the event, as the eyes of the world focus on us. Everyone will be watching the torch from the time it is lit at  
Olympia, Greece until it arrives at the Olympic stadium in Sydney."

Mrs Shipley said the Olympic Torch was an important symbol for New Zealanders in the build up to the Year 2000. " It captures the essence of the new millennium as it represents the first light of the new dawn - a dawn that will be seen by New Zealanders before anyone else in the world," she said.

"As we contemplate the fantastic opportunities that accompany events such as The Olympic Torch Relay, I would also like to remind New Zealanders of the other significant events in the build-up to the new Millennium.

"Throughout 1999 we will be hosting a series of APEC meetings leading up to the Leaders' Summit in Auckland.

"We have just hosted the World Cup of Golf and next year we will be home to the World Netball Championships, the FIFA Under 17 World Soccer Championships and the world's most famous yachting regatta - the America's Cup.

"And, of course, New Zealand will be the first nation in the world to see the light of the new Millennium. We're inviting guests from around the world to share in being first to the future."

Mrs Shipley acknowledged the generosity of the Australian Government and also the work of the New Zealand Olympic Committee in securing the extra two days for the Torch Relay in New Zealand. She also announced that Air New Zealand had been confirmed as the first major private sector supporter of the relay.
