The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, has reiterated that Fire Service Commission Chairman, Roger Estall, took no part in the review of the Police Service.

He rejected an allegation from United New Zealand Leader, Peter Dunne, that he had misled Parliament when he denied Mr Estall's involvement. Papers released by the Police under the Official Information Act indicated that Mr Estall would conduct a risk analysis as part of the review.

"Doug Martin, who led the review team, decided the risk analysis was unnecessary and Mr Estall took no part in the exercise, as I made clear to Parliament in my answer to a question from Peter Dunne," Mr Elder. "It's about time Mr Dunne ceased boxing at shadows and questioning the integrity of people who are working in the interests of their country."
