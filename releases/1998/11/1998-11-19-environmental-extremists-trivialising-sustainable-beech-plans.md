Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, David Carter, today accused Native Forest Action of trivialising proposals to sustainably harvest beech timber on the West Coast.

Mr Carter referred to a bulletin put on the internet by NFA urging people to make submissions against the plans and claiming "It's not important how you say it as long as you say something. Two sentences is fine! This is purely a number game".

"NFAs bulletin was not only full of emotive rhetoric, it also contained numerous factual errors. For example, NFA claim the up to 250 000 trees per year will be felled. NFA is well aware that this is wrong," he said.

"Even more disturbing is that the bulletin did not even refer readers to the Internet site where the Timberlands West Coast Limited's beech proposals can be seen in full. NFA clearly do not wish people to read Timberlands' plans for themselves and make sensible, well-informed submissions," said Mr Carter.

"Such tactics do not do justice to this important issue," Mr Carter said.

"These decisions not only affect hundreds of jobs on the West Coast but potentially thousands of jobs nationwide. It is simply too important to become 'purely a numbers game,'" Mr Carter concluded.

The full beech management plans are available at selected public libraries and on the Internet: (http://www.maf.govt.nz/Forestry). Submissions close tomorrow.
