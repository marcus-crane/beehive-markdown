Concerns about student loans raised by the Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum have been addressed in changes to the scheme announced by the Government, Youth Affairs Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"When the Youth Advisory Forum met with the Prime Minister last month they recommended that student loans should be drip fed rather than paid in lump sums and that students fee entitlements should be paid directly to the tertiary education institution.

"The Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum was concerned that too many students were taking advantage of the lump sum payments and spending them on things such as overseas trips rather than on their education.

"I am pleased to say that both of the concerns raised by the Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum have been addressed in changes to the Student Loans Scheme announced today by the Minister of Education.

"This Government is prepared to sit down and spend a lot of time listening to young people's concerns about how the Student Loan Scheme works.

"The first meeting of the Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum provided valuable input into Government decisions affecting young people, I look forward to meeting with them again."
