Health Minister Bill English said today he had approved Tairawhiti Healthcare's business plan for the year and noted that the two-year contract negotiated with the Health Funding Authority had brought certainty to the hospital.

"Key points in the 1998/99 business plan are that the hospital is predicting only a very small loss by the year 2000/01. New initiatives planned include increasing co-operation with local GPs and other providers to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital.

"Up to $2.5 million has been committed by the Government as capital investment to support the projects outlined in the plan, including a new maternity unit.

"I am pleased to see Tairawhiti Healthcare in a more secure financial position this year. It is important for the people of Gisborne and the East Coast that they are certain about their hospital services into the future and this will be achieved once the hospital is making a surplus.

"The hospital is forecasting a loss of $6.8 million this year, $1.4 million the year after, and $0.2 million in the 2000/01 year," said Mr English.
