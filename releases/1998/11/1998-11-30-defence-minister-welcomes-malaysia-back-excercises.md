Defence Minister Max Bradford today welcomed news reports that Malaysia expected to resume military exercises under the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA).

The FPDA is made up of New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Britain. Malaysia did not take part in the FPDA's "Stardex" maritime and air exercise held several months ago because of its economic situation.

Mr Bradford said New Zealand and Malaysia had shared a warm relationship for many years now.

"I am delighted to hear that Malaysia expects to resume exercises under the FPDA. The exercises give all parties a valuable opportunity to work together and further enhance our relationships."
