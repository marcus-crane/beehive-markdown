Associate Finance Minister Lockwood Smith would be interested to know whether Labour intends to reverse this year's tax cuts or whether its negative statements on the tax cuts are just more whingeing waffle.

"Labour keeps telling us that the tax cuts were a terrible mistake, but I haven't heard it say it would reverse them," Dr Smith said.

"If Labour really does believe the tax cuts were a terrible mistake, I'd be interested in knowing whether it intends to reverse them.

"In the absence of any clear statement from Labour, I think we can assume its statements concerning the tax cuts are just more whingeing waffle designed to mislead New Zealanders."

In a statement yesterday, Labour Whip Mark Burton described this year's tax cuts as "frittering away $1.2 billion". He said the Government was running "extremist tax-slashing policies", and that Labour would campaign for a "fairer economic policy". In a separate statement yesterday, Labour's Helen Clark described the tax cuts as "mindless tax-slashing".

In response, Treasurer Bill Birch asked Labour whether it intended to reverse this year's tax cuts.

Labour has not replied.
