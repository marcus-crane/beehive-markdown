New Zealand's exporters are doing well despite Asia, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley told the National Party Auckland Division tonight.

"The Asian downturn since July '97 has been a major test of our business environment. Exporters lost $500 million of sales into Asia over the last year but have more than replaced this with a $570 million increase into the United States and a further $500 million into the European Community. Overall, exports are up $1 billion in the 12 months to September.

"Economically we are consistently ahead of most countries and we have every reason to look to the future with confidence. The Reserve Bank is forecasting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1999/00 and 4.0 per cent in 2000/1, and that is good reason for being optimistic.

"In looking to the future, the National Government will continue to live within its means and keep prices under control so that interest rates can remain as low as possible, so that families are better off."

Mrs Shipley said National retained its strong commitment to deliver benefits to all New Zealanders through fair and responsible policies.

"We are continuing to build on the party's plan of providing an open, innovative and successful society that rewards enterprise and endeavour, and invests in our people and cares for those who need support.

"Despite having to guide New Zealand through the eye of a storm in political and economic terms, National intends to continue to provide clear and firm leadership through until the November 1999 election.

"We intend to win the hearts and minds of New Zealanders and will show people that we are the best party to lead our nation into the next century," Mrs Shipley concluded.
