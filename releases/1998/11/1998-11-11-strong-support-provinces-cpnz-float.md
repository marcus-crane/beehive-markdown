Kiwi Mums And Dads Like Govt's New Approach  
Kiwi mums and dads in provincial New Zealand are registering strong demand for shares in the public float of Capital Properties New Zealand, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"There's broad-based demand for Capital Properties New Zealand shares. This confirms the public likes the new approach this government has taken to asset sales. We want New Zealanders to have the chance to participate. Previous government's never gave the public a look in.

"One of the things we learned from the Auckland International Airport float was the need for a fair allocation of shares across as many brokers as possible. This helps build broker and investor support for the float.

"The float of Capital Properties New Zealand is smaller in comparison to the airport so there isn't as much scrip available, but it has been well placed throughout the country's broker network.

"Provincial brokers are reporting particularly strong interest in Capital Properties New Zealand shares."

Mr Ryall said the public can also purchase shares in Capital Properties New Zealand through the public pool. So far, over 12,500 investment statements have been sent out to members of the public through the 0800 2 CAPITAL number and Warburg Dillon Read.

It is expected that shares will be largely bought by New Zealand and Australian investors.

Mr Ryall said Capital Properties New Zealand deserved consideration as an investment but prospective buyers should be aware that shares can go down as well as up.
