The Government has set aside $100,000 to ensure as many people as possible can participate in Waitangi Day commemorations throughout New Zealand next year, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

The Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund is quite separate from monies set aside for traditional commemorations at Waitangi and Government House in Wellington. It will be administered by the Community Development Group of the Department of Internal Affairs.

Mrs Shipley said this was the third consecutive year the Government had supported community commemorations.

"The idea is to increase community interest in Waitangi Day through community driven activities. This will hopefully lead to greater ownership of Waitangi Day as a national commemoration for all New Zealanders.

"The fund is open to community organisations for activities that acknowledge the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in their own community way.

"Funding applications will have to meet specific criteria, and priority will be given to projects that provide increased understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi to people and groups who have had little opportunity to gain this understanding from other sources. A panel will be convened to consider applications and make decisions."

Mrs Shipley said last year's grants, which ranged from $300 to $15,000, went to events offering everything from educational programmes and cultural displays to the chance to celebrate with some of the country's best musicians.

"The successful community groups spanned from central Auckland to the remoteness of the Chatham Islands, from urban marae to the tiny settlement of Okains Bay on Banks Peninsula."

The closing date for applications is Monday, December 14 and all applicants will be notified of the outcome of their funding requests by the end of December.
