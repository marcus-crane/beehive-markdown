Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Waitemata Health's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting an operating surplus from the 2000/01 year.

"Key points in the 1998/99 business plan are that Waitemata Health is projecting a surplus of $2.8 million from the 1999/00 year, which includes the proceeds of asset sales, and an operating surplus of $1 million from the 2000/01 year. These surpluses will be ploughed back into health services.

"Waitemata Health and the Health Funding Authority are currently undertaking a review of what services are best provided for West Auckland. This will involve looking at the needs of people living in West Auckland and the options for the future of the Waitakere Hospital site.

"Waitemata Health has a number of capital investment projects planned over the next three years, including refurbishing the Emergency Department and Womens' Health facilities.

"The hospital is now on a much sounder footing than it has been, and achieving a surplus will mean security for the people in the area about their health services.

"I am confident that Waitemata Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of Auckland," said Mr English.
