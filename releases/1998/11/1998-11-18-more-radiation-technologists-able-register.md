Health Minister Bill English said today an extra 40 medical radiation technologists could potentially be joining the workforce as early as next month following changes to Government regulations which came into force this week.

"The change gives the Medical Radiation Technologists Board more discretion in registering medical radiation technologists regardless of whether they are trained in New Zealand or overseas.

"This will help meet a demand for medical radiation technologists, who do diagnostic x-rays.

"The new regulations mean the Board will be able to recognise the first batch of graduates with degrees in Bachelor of Applied Science (Medical Imaging Technology) from Manawatu Polytechnic and Bachelor of Health Science (Medical Imaging), from UNITEC in Auckland.

"The Board will have to be satisfied that the courses produce graduates that have sufficient skill, knowledge and experience to practice medical radiation technology in New Zealand and in some cases may require applicants to pass a competency based exam once they've completed their course.

"The regulations are designed to allow the Board to recognise appropriate qualifications and examine applicants to assess competence and ensure public safety. The Board will remain responsible for ensuring that all medical radiation technologists are competent to practice in New Zealand.

"The changes will also help make it easier for some overseas trained radiation therapists to demonstrate their competency to practice in New Zealand," said Mr English.
