Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Southern Health's business plan for the year and said this year's $9.5 million revenue increase meant a remarkable turnaround for the hospital.

"The 1998/99 business plan shows Southern Health forecasting a small surplus by the end of the financial year, followed by a small loss the following year and again a small surplus in the 2000/01 year. This is a remarkable turnaround for the hospital compared to its financial situation in recent years .

"Southern Health has also agreed a two-year contract with the Health Funding Authority, which puts it on a firmer financial foundation and will undertake a joint needs analysis with the HFA to confirm contract volume levels for the coming financial year.

"This year's business plan includes $3.7 million to be spent on reorganising facilities at Kew base hospital.

"I am particularly pleased, both as Minister of Health and as Clutha-Southland MP, to see the turnaround achieved by Southern Health. This is a tribute to the hard work of all the staff along with the leadership of chief executive Anthea Green. She has done a great job for the hospital and it will be a tough job filling this role," said Mr English.
