The suggestion today by Damien O'Connor that I have set up a 'slush fund' to assist election year projects is complete rubbish for one very simple reason", Tourism Minister Murray McCully said today.

Mr McCully recently announced a package of additional funding of $12.5 million for tourism initiatives to encourage international visitors to New Zealand.

"When the funding was announced I stated that it would all be spent overseas. I even went so far as to indicate which markets would benefit".

"Mr O'Connor needs to understand that our overseas visitors live overseas".
