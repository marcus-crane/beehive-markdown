Minister of Food and Fibre John Luxton who has Ministerial responsibility for the fish and forestry sectors said today that he was pleased with the progress that APEC Ministers have achieved on Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalisation (EVSL) of nine priority sectors, including fish and forest products.

"The fish and forestry sectors are very important to our economy and provide thousands of jobs in provincial New Zealand. It is good to see progress at APEC that will help improve rural incomes," Mr Luxton said.
