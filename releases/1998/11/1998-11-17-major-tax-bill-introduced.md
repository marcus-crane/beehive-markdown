The year's third major taxation bill - the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill - was introduced into Parliament today.

Treasurer and Finance Minister Bill Birch and Revenue Minister Max Bradford said the bill introduces a wide range of changes to tax law.

"Reform of the rules on the taxation of financial arrangements is a major feature of the bill," the Ministers said.

"It also introduces changes designed to create better, more effective tax law, and to protect the revenue base, which is a continuing focus of the Government's tax policy work programme."

The Ministers said the bill:

- Simplifies and clarifies the accrual rules, the group of rules in the Income Tax Act that govern the taxation of debts, forward contracts and other financial arrangements. This is expected to reduce administrative and compliance costs.
- Introduces legislation that will allow New Zealand to enter into reciprocal tax recovery agreements with other countries, which means participating countries can ask each other to recover tax from absconding tax debtors.
- Includes several changes designed to improve the operation of binding rulings on tax matters. Rulings that are binding on the part of Inland Revenue were introduced three years ago to give taxpayers certainty about the tax treatment of future transactions.
- Counters complex tax schemes potentially used for gaining double deductions from investment in film production and petroleum mining exploration. The changes, effective from today, do not affect the normal deductions available for these activities.
- Includes amendments clarifying tax law or aligning it with administrative practice in several areas, including: the rules for calculating average tax-free allowances paid to employees; calculating GST as part of the cost of fringe benefits; extensions of the statute-barred period for reassessments and remission; and ensuring (effective from today) guarantee fees paid to non residents are subject to New Zealand taxation.
