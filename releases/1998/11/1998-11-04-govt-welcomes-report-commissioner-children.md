Youth Affairs Minister Tony Ryall welcomed today the report of the Commissioner for Children tabled in Parliament.

"The report clearly shows that a great deal of work has been undertaken to get on top of the administration of the Office of the Commissioner for Children.

"Under Mr McLay's leadership, there has been a significant increase in the amount of work undertaken by the Office.

Mr Ryall said he was disappointed that Labour MP Steve Maharey had chosen to criticize the report. "Labour's great policy man offers not one new idea.

"Mr Maharey's criticism is a bit rich -- I understand that he has not made one approach to the Office of the Commissioner for Children in the last 12 months."
