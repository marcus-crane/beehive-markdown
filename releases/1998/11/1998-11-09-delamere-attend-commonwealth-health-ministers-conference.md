Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, leaves New Zealand on Thursday, November 12, to attend the 12th Commonwealth Health Ministers' conference in Barbados.

"A key issue to be discussed there is the ever-rising cost of pharmaceutical drugs and how to control it. As the Minister responsible for PHARMAC, the Government drug buying agency, this is a topic of great interest to me and I intend to share experiences with some of my colleagues at the conference, such as the Ministers from South Africa, who have been having similar difficulties to those experienced here," said Mr Delamere.

After the conference, the Minister will visit New York for talks with the major American drug manufacturers to receive feedback on pharmaceutical pricing and to tour the research facilities of Merck, Sharp and Dohme.

"I recognise that there are difficult issues here and there has been a contentious relationship between PHARMAC and the suppliers.

"I remain totally supportive of PHARMAC's efforts in striving to get the best return for our health dollars, but I also feel it is necessary to listen to the drug companies' concerns in order to maintain good relationships between Government and the drug industry."

Prior to the Commonwealth conference, Mr Delamere will spend a day in Los Angeles talking to the health organisation BREATH about the impact of smokefree legislation in California on bars and restaurants.

"I am very keen to see smoking totally banned in New Zealand restaurants, but I feel this country is not yet culturally ready to see all smoking banned in bars. It will be very interesting to see what impact there has been in California and what the public response has been there," said the Minister.
