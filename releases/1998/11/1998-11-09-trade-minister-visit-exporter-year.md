Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will visit Exporter of the Year Buckley Systems Ltd today.

The visit to its factory at 11 Bowden Road, Mt Wellington, Auckland, will take place at 3.30 pm.

"As part of my programme of visiting exporters throughout New Zealand, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the management and staff of our Exporter of the Year," Dr Smith said.

"It's a company which is evidence of New Zealand's success at the very top end of exporting elaborately transformed goods."

Most of the world's silicon chips are made using innovative technology supplied by Buckley Systems. The company exports more than $20 million of high-tech equipment a year to markets in the USA, England, Asia and Japan.

It was named Exporter of the Year at the 1998 New Zealand Export Awards last week, organised by Trade New Zealand and sponsored by DHL Worldwide Express.
