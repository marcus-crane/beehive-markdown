Health Minister Bill English said today he had not yet supported a business plan for Capital Coast Health for the 1998/99 financial year.

"The hospital is still forecasting substantial losses for the next three years. I want to see a plan which shows Capital Coast Health reaching a sound financial position because this is the only way to give certainty and security to the people of Wellington about their public hospital services.

"On the positive side, the hospital has achieved some outstanding results on some of its key performance indicators, with an average length of stay of 3.4 days and an 85 percent bed occupancy rate, which puts it first in the group of tertiary hospitals on both counts," said Mr English.
