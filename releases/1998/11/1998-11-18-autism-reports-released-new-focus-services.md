Health Minister Bill English today released two reports on services for people with autism and said that the Government acknowledged there was considerable potential to provide better services.

The first report, by Professor John Werry, was under s47 of the Health & Disability Services Act 1993 on Casey Albury. The second was carried out by an interdepartmental "Autism Services Project" team into autism services in New Zealand. Both reports were commissioned by the Director-General of Health following the death of Casey Albury.

"Both these reports make it clear that New Zealand does not have well developed services for the diagnosis and care of people with autistic disorders. There have been gaps in what services been available in the past and the reports recommend action to fill these gaps.

"The interdepartmental report, which has been extensively discussed with the Autistic Association, lays out a detailed timetable for action to improve services, which I have endorsed. I am making this public so parents can have confidence that we are dealing with the issues they are concerned about.

"These steps will see a significant amount of progress made by the middle of next year in improving services. Further recommendations, such as the need for better professional training, will be implemented by 30 June 2000. "Implementation of these recommendations will go along way to addressing the concerns identified by Professor Werry in his report. I will be discussing some of his further recommendations with Professor Werry.

"There is considerable potential to provide better services by building on and improving existing co-ordination arrangements and by raising skill and knowledge levels.

"The reports are largely consistent in their recommendations:

- greater clarity about who was responsible for services through improved interagency co-ordination
- improved early diagnosis and care services
- high priority for emergency and respite care for families
- better education to increase awareness about autism.

"As an initial step in developing guidelines for professionals and improving access to services, an additional $200,000 has been secured for autism services. This new money, which will go to the Health Funding Authority, is part of a bigger child health funding package that I will be announcing at the end of the month.

"The interdepartmental report makes it clear that there may be a need for further funding for services for people with autism, but we won't know the extent or nature of that until after the work outlined in the attached timetable is complete," said Mr English.
