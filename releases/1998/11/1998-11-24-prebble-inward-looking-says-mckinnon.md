"Richard Prebble's claim that hosting APEC New Zealand 99 could be a waste of $44.5 million of tax payer's money is alarmist and inward looking," Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon said today.

Mr McKinnon, speaking to a breakfast meeting of the Rongotai Branch of the National Party, was responding to comments made by Mr Prebble in the Dominion yesterday.

"The APEC goals of free trade in the region by 2010 and 2020 will ultimately help grow our economy and create more jobs for New Zealanders.

"We cannot go it alone. APEC is the way a small island trading economy like New Zealand can be heard."

Mr McKinnon said it is estimated that free trade in the region will grow our economy by $1.3 billion annually.

"This is a huge return for what is effectively a one-off membership fee of $44.5 million dollars.

"Mr Prebble has a right to be concerned if he thinks the agenda is moving away from economic issues.

"However, New Zealand has inherited a forward looking APEC agenda.

"While the headlines were dominated by doom and gloom, in fact the Leaders stayed focussed and endorsed the free and open trade and investment goals at a time when economic turmoil in the region could have tempted some to do otherwise."

Mr McKinnon said that aside from the export opportunities APEC offers, hosting next year's Leaders summit will put New Zealand in the International spotlight as never before.

"We expect about two and a half thousand journalists to arrive in Auckland to cover the Leaders' Summit. This is free publicity we can only dream about."

Mr McKinnon said that New Zealand needed APEC and gains would be realised.

"Battening down the hatches and becoming the North Korea of the South Pacific is not an option.

"Walking away from APEC, would be like leaving the table before the main course was served," he said.
