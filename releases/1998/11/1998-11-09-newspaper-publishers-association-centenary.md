John Maasland, Tony O'Reilly, my parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. Happy Birthday to the NPA on your 100 years.

It is a notable achievement and you have a wonderful document that records your history.

I want to begin by reminding you that you are loved, unlike many others, you are loved. You know it, politicians know it and the public know it as well.

I guess it's born out of the incredible desire of New Zealanders, and indeed I believe it's true of people internationally, to know about the dramas and delights of the lives of others in our country and worldwide. It is that overwhelming curiosity that has everyone so very dependent on you. I'm also a realist though in terms of the relationship between government and news media.

Thomas Jefferson once said:

"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."  
Thomas Jefferson, letter to Col. Edward Carrington Jan. 16, 1787  
And so you see, even politicians know our place.

Over 100 years you have done your job without a doubt. You sell newspapers and you are driven by a desire to increase your readership and circulation. In business that's totally justifiable and you should obviously continue to do that in the interests of your shareholders.

As a politician and one who is responsible for trying to ensure that public policy has a place I also hope that you see you have a role to inform. Obviously we can debate to the ways in which you go about doing that. But clearly it is a main function, whether it's through advertising or editorial comment or any other type of material you include in your papers.

As I thought about what I should say to New Zealanders about your centenary, the first thing that struck me was that the more things change the more they stay the same. Let me explain to you what I mean.

An editorial in The Press in 1898 commented as follows about politician John McKenzie's statements on the BNZ:

"..... considering the reckless manner in which a responsible Minister of the Crown has been talking about the Bank and its affairs during the recess. The Hon John McKenzie, in accusing the officials of the Bank of deceiving the Government and in discussing the affairs of one of its customers on a public platform, certainly seemed to be doing his best to damage the credit and injure the business of the Bank. That he did not succeed to a greater extent is probably due to the fact that the public has now learned to take the honourable gentleman and his public utterances at their proper value."  
It struck me that this could well be the words of someone commenting on a person close to us. You can go on and look for similar consistency elsewhere.

On the issue of more taxes an editorial in The Press in February 1898 says as follows:

"As a colony we have reached the unenviable position of being the most heavily taxed, and of being the most extravagant of all the colonies."  
"To lower the taxes does not seem popular at present. New schemes must be devised to spend more money, and the Premier's personal extravagance has not been condemned by a single journal calling itself 'Liberal' ".

"We are heaping up taxes, but the day of reckoning will come. Unfortunately when it does come the blame may not be put on the right shoulders."

And on the issue of old age pensions, in September 1898, when they were talking about the first government pension bill, they noted:

"..... the Government's Bill, and have discovered that although it involves the expenditure of a large and ever-increasing sum of money year by year, without indicating how it is to be provided,....."  
On this issue again in 1938 Savage noted, and I quote:

"... I do not care how it is described so long as the money is there. Names do not matter so long as the money is all right. It can only come from the productive forces of New Zealand, and all we want to do in this Bill and in other legislative proposals is to give to the people of the country what they are capable of producing. We cannot give them any more. Legislation will not give them any more. It does not matter how much we try to manipulate the money system we cannot give the people any more than they are able to produce."  
It struck me that you may well hear a similar speech reported in Parliament today if we could persuade the media to put that side of the argument in print.

There are other stories that are familiar. You may be interested to know that there was a headline in 1898 that accused the Ministers and Members of Parliament of denigrating the House because of their ongoing use of urgency and insisting that the public had no faith in matters that were pushed through the legislative chamber under such circumstances.

The other thing that struck me as we perused 100 years was that MP's salaries and salaries of the state sector are always good for a headline.

What I would conclude from looking at these issues is that you as newspaper publishers are very familiar with the buttons that need to be pushed to quench the hunger of your readers in terms of their desire to have their prejudices satisfied. And so we go back to the same old stories again, and again.

It's also worth observing, as the first woman Prime Minister, that some prejudices still do apply. I want to say that in my experience in the last decade I have seen an improvement in this area but there is still some progress to be made.

Reflecting on the past 100 years there is language that amuses. One hundred years ago they spoke of 'the shrieking sisterhood' as they described the uncompromising, stroppy, strong-minded, women who insisted that it was their right to stand as equals in the voting booth. Today you still see some similar headlines.

One of the quotes that caught my eye was from Judy McGregor writing on gender politics in New Zealand:

"The news media ...... desire a Beehive Bimbo-Boadicea who combines political energy and power with a stereotypical femininity expressed in conventional prettiness."  
She was describing what she thought people were looking for. I have to say that, as one who tries to get the message through the clutter, there are still people who look at female politicians and get the message and the messenger confused.

It's also interesting to note that international studies conclude that women leaders do, from time to time, struggle to be visible in the news. In New Zealand we could not automatically conclude that that is the case, given that the leaders of both major political parties are women. But that international research also says one or two other interesting things. An issue that struck a chord with me was that when women become Prime Ministers the media tends to be pre-occupied by the gender issues as opposed to the substantive programme that the person may wish to advance.

Secondly, and perhaps more interestingly, women leaders worldwide are also viewed by the media as agents of change. Perhaps this is because there are so few who have held that role and they have to have been agents of change simply to get that far. It was an interesting observation.

To conclude on this point, I want to remind you of some of the language that has been used in the media in relation to myself in the last 12 months.

I went back and looked at how male commentators had tended to describe me as a person, compared to female commentators. You may be interested to know that the male language tended to include words like - battle, amazons, iron lady, stern boss, public enemy - compared with the female language which included - Queen, a farming woman, matron Shipley, Shipley may kiss and cuddle. I guess as you listen to the full range you have to come back to Judy McGregor's views on the desire of the media to be able to describe women leaders as a Bimbo-Boadicea.

The next observation I make is one of personal frustration, as I reflect back on the last 12 months. It's frustrating to count the centimetres printed in terms of this Government's aspirations for the people of New Zealand, compared with the media's interest in what glasses I choose, what clothes I wear, how my hair is cut, whether I decided that for myself or somebody has in fact 'made me over', or indeed who my advisors are, or whether Burton is my single primary adviser, and just on that point I can tell you of the little time Burton and I spend together we do not spend time talking about politics.

I am in hope that that the language will change. In times gone by men were often described as: assertive, bold, rational and passionate; and women with the same qualities were often described as: aggressive, pushy, calculating and emotional.

To be fair, it is my experience that over the last decade there has been a shift. I say to you as publishers, if we are to do well as a nation we do need to see that we harness the energy of both women and men, whether they are leaders in business, in industry, in the community, or in the family. To do justice to that we need to have an open mind and not use stereotypical language that relegates people into a narrower role.

I want to just touch on the issue of press freedom that John raised. I respect your right to describe us in politics as you see fit, for it is the right of the press to commentate on the life and times of the country and I hope that in this small but smart democratic nation that will always be the case. However, I want to observe that it is not a two-way street.

While the media demand the right to speak freely, as you should in a democracy, the media in my experience do not give proportional space to politicians' views on whether that media comment has been fair.

I refer you to this quote from Max Lerner in his book, Love and Hate in Politics:

"A politician wouldn't dream of being allowed to call a columnist the things a columnist is allowed to call a politician."  
Max Lerner, "Love and Hate in Politics" Actions and Passions 1949

I want you to know that we politicians respect the arguments for press freedom, and indeed I believe we always will in New Zealand. However, there is a tension between that right and the responsibility to deliver balance, and I leave you to reflect on that.

You as editorial writers have a special privilege in this country of ours, as you speak to so many people through your print media each day. I am told that the dailies actually deliver papers to 2.4 million readers. I am also staggered to find that 61% of New Zealanders when recently polled said that they spent 33 minutes each day and 44 minutes at the weekend reading the papers.

As you fulfil your vital role in the New Zealand community I want to leave you with a challenge.

At this time where globalisation is happening at a increasingly rapid rate, all of the media in New Zealand in my opinion have a special obligation to be the guardians of our economic, social, political, moral, cultural and ethical identity and individuality.

It is very easy at a time when the world is moving so rapidly for these issues to be swamped. We as politicians are often asked for our vision, but I reply to you as the media - are you capturing the essence of our nation's stories in a way which genuinely reflects our lives? While you must decide how you sell newspapers, because that is your right, I believe one of the challenges is this need to be able to tell the nation about events in a way that is meaningful to them.

Of course you should present the facts, and of course there should the criticism and the condemnation where that is appropriate, but I think over time it is important that you consider whether you are presenting a balanced picture. I am sure whoever the politician was who was standing here they would bring this issue of balance to your attention.

If we could get an even diet of policy, politics and trivia, I would view that as a huge success. I accept that in political life those three things will always be present.

I want to share with you some information from the American Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. Their review of the 1996 primary election campaign they found that journalists got six times as much air time and print space as candidates. I accept that the situation may be different in New Zealand, but I would speculate that it wouldn't be very different.

The analysis found twenty eight per cent of the coverage focused on matters of substance: policy issues, such as taxation, abortion, immigration, or the candidates' backgrounds and qualifications. The candidates during that election spent 86% of their time focussing on substantive issues of policy or candidate qualifications. In other words the media gave 28% of their space to the substantive issues the candidates spent almost 90% of their time on.

The soundbite phenomena is also present here. I accept that this is not relevant to the print media but I think it's worth noting that politics, increasingly, is being left to the opinion of the commentators and the soundbites are getting shorter and shorter.

In the American study in 1968 the soundbite was 42 seconds, by 1988 the soundbites were nine seconds, by 1992 they were eight seconds and in 1996 they were only seven seconds.

I challenge any one of you who is a wordsmith to get a substantive message across in seven seconds. And yet we decide as a country that cherishes democracy that that is the way in which we are going to relay the messages and allow people to form opinions. It is my view that you and I share a challenge. If we are to ensure that the democratic process works then you must face up to the fact that you must mediate and perhaps moderate the level at which the commentators are giving political advice compared to reporting on the substantive issues.

Politicians do value editorial comment and also political commentators and their opinion. But not to the extent that it swamps the ability of the public to engage in the conversation. I'd like to leave with you a quote that I thought was appropriate for this time.

"A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself."  
Arthur Miller, The Observer, Nov. 26 1961

In my experience New Zealanders are wanting us to talk with them, not at them. I believe that as politicians and as newspaper publishers we share a common challenge. People wish to be treated intelligently so that information is given, contrary points of view are available, an editorial comment puts the paper's considered view, and then the reader is left to draw their own conclusions. That question of whether we are leaving the reader to decide or the paper is deciding for them is the challenge that I believe you face as you go into your second century.

As a politician, all I ask of you is an even hand.

You have a wonderful history to be proud of. One hundred years of progress, investment and improvement in your technology and your people, is something that all of you in the New Zealand industry can be proud of. As you look to your next 100 years I congratulate you on your progress. I congratulate you on organising this event so that we can reflect on this worthwhile milestone and I challenge you to think about what people might say in 100 years time as to whether you are serving New Zealand well.

Thank you very much.
