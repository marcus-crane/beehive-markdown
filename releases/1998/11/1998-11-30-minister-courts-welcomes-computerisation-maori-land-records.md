The Minister for Courts Hon Georgina te Heuheu said she welcomed the beginning of a project to computerise Maori Land Court records. The Hastings Court in the Takitimu will be the first to go on line with the Maori Land Information System today.

"The Courts have used a manual record system for 133 years, so making access to land records easier will be of great benefit to all Maori. The lack of easy access to land records has been a serious impediment to the economic advancement of Maori. Often they have had to travel hundreds of miles at great expense to access land records and because the records were stored manually it meant they were often difficult to use."

The move to computerise the records resulted from client surveys, a Royal Commission Report and customer feedback. The Hastings changeover will mark the beginning of a progressive changeover to information technology. The final Registry will go on line on March 15 1999.

"This will mean that people will be able to access information about their land from any one of the Maori Land Court registries throughout the country."

"The saying 'information is power' is very apt when it comes to the issue of Maori land records. Maori have not been able to access land records easily and thus often felt disempowered. This advancement will help change that."
