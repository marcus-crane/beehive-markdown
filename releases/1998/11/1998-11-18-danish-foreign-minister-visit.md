Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen arrives in New Zealand today for a four-day visit, Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today.

Mr Helveg Petersen is the first Danish Foreign Minister to visit New Zealand in 13 years. Mr Upton said, "the visit will provide a welcome opportunity to reinforce the positive relationship between the two countries."

"New Zealand and Denmark share many common interests and values and have traditionally cooperated closely on international issues".

"We have regular contact on a wide range of issues, including agricultural policy, which plays a leading role in the economy of both countries."

Mr Helveg Petersen will have talks with Mr Upton, Acting International Trade Minister John Luxton, and Finance Minister Bill Birch. He will also open the new Danish Honorary Consulate in Wellington and meet with a number of Danish business contacts.
