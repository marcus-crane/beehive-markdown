"It is way past time for the PPTA to set aside their anachronistic and irrelevant attitude to direct resourcing (bulk funding) and concentrate on winning a pay settlement that, on the current offer, will see the top of the regular pay scale for teachers reach $50,000 per year."

"The Government wants a pay settlement before Christmas. The PPTA should try to meet that deadline," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"It is time for the PPTA to move on. The ideological angst and the associated hard-line intimidatory tactics that currently consume their efforts fly in the face of the evidence of educational improvement gained by experience in directly resourced schools.

"They have been proved wrong. In the ten years since the then Labour Government introduced direct resourcing the dreadful consequences the teachers' unions continually predict just have not happened.

"All teachers need to remember that their central professional commitment should be first and foremost to meet the interests of their students - any industrial action harms those interests," Mr Creech said.

"And there is another pressing concern. At the time of the decision to re-enter pay negotiations the PPTA leadership gave a solemn undertaking that they would use their influence to stop any industrial action on this issue. It is hard to see how their recent actions can possibly be consistent with their undertakings.

"I also note one specific aspect of the results of the School Trustees Association survey released today that is deeply concerning. The survey shows 10% of boards felt pressured by teacher unions to reject direct resourcing.

"Boards of Trustees are the lawful governors of schools. They should be free to make their decisions based on their full and honest assessment of the best interests of their students. While the PPTA are free to make their views known, applying unreasonable pressure or duress should never be part of their tactics.

"Schools should chose the Fully Funded Direct Resourcing Option if they believe it will deliver a better education for their students. Wildcat strikes and heavy handed tactics are about pushing a political/ideological agenda rather than an education one.

"The PPTA should note that I will be very concerned if PPTA tactics effectively undermine the "free choice of Boards" policy.

"Direct resourcing now covers over 30% of students and teachers in New Zealand schools. On latest count, 585 schools are now directly resourced for teachers' salaries. More are coming in all the time. More than 250 have come in since the new fair Fully Funded Option Formula linked directly to the top of teachers pay scales was introduced."

Mr Creech said research on directly resourced schools, due to be released shortly, shows the scheme has reduced teacher workloads by employing extra staff. This research will be released at the end of the month.

"Only this week I heard from the principal of a direct resourced school who stated that "being able to self-manage our total resources is an exciting and empowering concept. "For years the PPTA have been trotting out the same arguments against direct resourcing of teachers' salaries. The proof is in the pudding. None of their claims and scaremongering have come true. The PPTA's opposition to bulk-funding is archaic," Mr Creech said.
