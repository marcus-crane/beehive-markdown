The Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today addressed the opening plenary session of the 12th Commonwealth Health Ministers' conference in Barbados.

He told Ministers and delegates that New Zealand had undergone significant reforms in the health sector over the past decade.

Mr Delamere fully supported calls from Tanzania's Mrs Gertrude Mongella 'for politicians being held accountable for health' and for the "need to establish goals for minimum standards of acceptable quality of life'.

The Minister discussed the issue of immunisation as it affects Maori children in New Zealand and compared it with the amazing achievement of India in immunising 120 million Indian children in one day.

"We in New Zealand should bow our heads in shame when we, considered to be a developed OECD nation, compare our statistics to the achievement of India. About 63% of our children are fully immunised which looks pretty good until you realise that breaks down to something like 90% of Pakeha children being fully immunised by age two, but only about 45% of Maori children. That doesn't mean the rest are not immunised, just not fully so.

"Over recent months, I have suggested several times to our Health Funding Authority that they publicly state one of their goals to be a 90% immunisation rate by the year 2000 for all Maori children.

"Unfortunately, to date, my call has met with a lukewarm response amid mutterings of there being too much risk of failure."

Mr Delamere concluded by telling the assembled delegates, "It is my belief that you cannot succeed unless you are exposed to the risk of failure.

"Unfortunately, too many politicians and, for that matter, some top civil servants never succeed because they are never willing to expose themselves to that risk."
