A function hosted by Health Minister Bill English tonight will give MPs a clear message about helping to stop discrimination against people with a mental illness.

"There is still a stigma attached to having a mental illness and this is one of the biggest factors slowing people's recovery.

"Ignorance is not an excuse for perpetuating stereotypes of mental illness and that's what tonight's presentation is all about. I am hosting this function because I think MPs should be in the forefront of breaking down the barriers against people with a mental illness.

"About 16 of the 120 MPs have so far indicated they will be able to come to the presentation by Mental Health Commissioner Julie Liebrich. I hope more will be able to come, though they should be warned that there could be one or two brickbats for nameless MPs who have delivered a few clangers in the past.

"But on the lighter side the food will be "Food for Thought" and will include nuts, crackers, bananas, fruitcake and sandwiches," said Mr English.
