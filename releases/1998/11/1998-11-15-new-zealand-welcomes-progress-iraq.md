"New Zealanders will welcome what appears to be a stepping back by Iraq," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The United Nations' diplomatic effort backed by a willingness to use force if necessary have again brought results. Member States must insist that the United Nation's resolutions be  
upheld in the interests of the people of Iraq and in the interests of world peace.

"The challenge now is for Iraq's leaders to set aside military ambitions and help the people of Iraq by making genuine progress which can lead to the removal of sanctions," Mrs Shipley said.
