"New Zealand will contribute $150,000 through the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for relief work associated with the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch", the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Simon Upton, announced today.

Mr Upton said, "the Hurricane has had a major impact on several Central American countries, including Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Flooding is very severe, landslides are occurring and flood waters are rising. There has been an as yet undetermined number of deaths and hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes.

"The key emergency requirements are for food, blankets, medicines, drinking water and sanitation systems", he said.

The money is part of the NZODA Emergency Disaster Relief Fund.
