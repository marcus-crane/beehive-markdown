Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported South Auckland Health's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting continued surpluses over the next three years.

"South Auckland will continue to re-invest these surpluses into health services. Plans are now being finalised for a $42 million redevelopment of Middlemore Hospital, which is scheduled to start early next year, and the hospital is continuing to invest in improving clinical quality. The costs for the hospital redevelopment will be met from within South Auckland Health's own resources.

"The 1998/99 business plan forecasts surpluses of $1.7 million this financial year, $1.9 million the following year, and $3.7 million in the 2000/01 year. This follows from last year's achievement of a $0.6 million surplus.

"The board, management and staff have worked very hard to get the hospital into such good shape financially and this gives certainty and security to the people of South Auckland about their health services.

"A key strategy in the business plan is the further integration of care with the primary sector, in order to manage the growth in demand for acute services. The SuperClinic is an example of how South Auckland Healthcare has already responded to the need to provide services near where the people are.

"I am confident that the hospital is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of South Auckland," said Mr English.
