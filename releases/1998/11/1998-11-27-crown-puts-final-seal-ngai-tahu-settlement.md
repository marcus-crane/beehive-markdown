The Prime Minister will, on behalf of the Crown, repeat the formal apology to the people of Ngai Tahu, as contained in the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act, passed by Parliament on 29 September.

The apology will be read by Mrs Shipley during her speech to Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, at about 2.30pm, at a special ceremony at Onuku Marae.

Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Doug Graham and his Associate Ministers Georgina te Heuheu and Dr Nick Smith, are also expected to attend the ceremony.

After her speech Mrs Shipley and Mr Graham will present a bound copy of the Settlement Act as a taonga (treasure) to Onuku Marae.

Ngai Tahu is also planning to present a taonga to the Prime Minister.
