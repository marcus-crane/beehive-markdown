Health Minister Bill English said today there had been such a good response to a booklet telling people what public health services were available for them that 25 copies would be sent to every library for their public display racks.

He took the first 25 copies to the Kapiti Public Library in Paraparaumu during a visit to the Kapiti Coast this afternoon.

"More than $6 billion is spent every year on our public health services. People should know what that money buys and what they can expect from it for themselves and their families.

"This booklet, What Can I Expect?, was produced by the Health Funding Authority and tells people exactly what services are available through the public health system. It's written in a very easy-to-read way and I would commend it to anyone who is interested in what services are available to them.

"An initial copy was sent to every GP, mayors, community groups, public libraries, hospitals, Citizens Advice Bureaus, health organisations, and other groups a few weeks ago. The response has been so positive that we are going to have to do a reprint.

"A number of groups, including many libraries, have asked for more copies and I have decided that we should send libraries 25 copies so that anybody interested can take their own copy to keep. These copies, and any more that people request, will be sent out over the next few weeks once the reprint is done," said Mr English.
