Associate Minister for Food and Fibre, Hon David Carter, today opened the extensions to award-winning Yarrows Bakery at Manaia, Taranaki.

Mr Carter said it was an honour to be present at the 75th Jubilee of the company, which recently won a Trade NZ export commendation for earning $10 million a year for its bakery exports from coastal Taranaki.

The Associate Minister opened a newly refurbished administration block and new storeroom at the company headquarters in Manaia today.

"It is certainly heartening to see a company that is doing as well as you are, away from the main centres of New Zealand."

"Manaia, with its 1200-odd population, is no doubt immensely proud of your success and with some justification."

Mr Carter said the success of Yarrows proved that small rural businesses could more than adequately compete in the international marketplace, if they had the right attitude.

"More companies would do well to follow your example and more particularly your market philosophy. I quote from the Yarrow's company profile "We are market driven. We endeavour to be entrepreneurial."

"New Zealand needs more companies prepared to take an entrepreneurial stand, to risk some of what they have , for the potential rewards of higher growth and returns."

Mr Carter said the visit to Taranaki had reaffirmed his belief that New Zealand had some unique advantages, which rural companies could use to their benefit.

"One of the strongest selling points of this company is its use of New Zealand butter. They absolutely swear by it, and it's helped them secure contracts in the United States of America and beyond."

"We've got to get better at concentrating on the things we are really good at, and finding the right markets to sell them to."

"The Yarrows Bakery based in rural Taranaki is a wonderful example of a New Zealand company that has taken entrepreneurialism to new heights. We need more companies like this and Yarrows proves you don't have to be a city-based company to succeed."
