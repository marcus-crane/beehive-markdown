Health Minister Bill English announced today the Government had approved $5 million to build a new hospital in Oamaru.

The new hospital will be built and run by Waitaki District Health Services Limited (WDHS) and will provide integrated health services for Oamaru.

"I am delighted to be able to make this announcement today. The success of this application for funds is a credit to the people in Oamaru who have worked hard to ensure their community has secure hospital services into the future.

"Oamaru's new hospital will be a true partnership between the community and the Government. Communities around the country are asking for a say in how their health services are provided and community groups like this one in Oamaru are giving them that control. Oamaru's success shows what can be achieved when a community has the confidence and vision to plan for the future.

"The new hospital will have 30 beds and will provide the following services: ·

- minor surgery ·
- acute medical care ·
- assessment, treatment and rehabilitation ·
- accident and emergency services, including the stabilisation and transfer of trauma cases ·
- outpatient clinics in the major specialties ·
- maternity services, with GPs and midwives being the lead maternity carers ·
- district nursing, domestic assistance and meals on wheels services.

"Discussions are continuing about WDHS in future providing public health and mental health services.

"The Government funds have been approved under the Community Trust Assistance Scheme. WDHS has negotiated a five-year contract with the Health Funding Authority for services," said Mr English.
