There has been a considerable amount of public comment and controversy surrounding the military sealift ship, Charles Upham. This Committee has discussed the issue and asked the Audit Office to look into the quality of advice provided to the Government. As well, both Defence and Treasury have received requests for information from the media.

In view of this widespread interest and the controversy that has arisen, I consider the public interest would be best served by as full a disclosure as possible of the official information held with the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force on the Military Sealift project that resulted in the commissioning into service of HMNZS Charles Upham.

The information has been put together in a bound volume that I am making available to the Committee now. I will also be disturbing copies to the media later today, and the Ministry of Defence will be releasing copies in response to requests for release of official information.

There are some 690 pages of information, but the issue boils down to seven basic points and I would like to comment briefly on each. The points are:

1.did New Zealand buy the right ship?  
2.was the acquisition process sound?  
3.was the government misled about the ship's capabilities prior to completion of the modifications?  
4.were the modifications jeopardised by a lack of priorities? 6.  
5.why were the modifications deferred? 7.  
6.given the age of the ship, should the modifications go ahead when the current charter is completed?

I do not intend to comment on the need for a military sealift ship as that has been well established and is not in dispute. There is a great deal of information on the requirement in Part A of the volume of information.

Did New Zealand Buy the Right Ship?

The Charles Upham, formerly the Mercandian Queen II of the Mercandian 2-in-1 class, was selected after a very thorough selection process. The possibility of both purchasing a used ship for conversion and building a new ship were looked at. Careful consideration was also given to taking up an Australian offer of HMAS Tobruk.

A total of 33 used ships of 20 different classes were first identified and this was later narrowed down to a total of 21 ships and eventually to four classes of ships that were physically inspected. The inspections included a search of Classification Society records, as well as advice from naval experts on the feasibility of converting ships for military sealift.

My predecessor directed that an external review be undertaken by experts in the field, Pacific Marine Management in association with H.D. Stronach & Associates. It was their conclusion that The Mercandian Queen II is a suitable ship for conversion to the role of a Military Sealift Ship.

The serious options were evaluated properly, and none of the options provided a better solution than the Mercandian Queen II. Further, the concept for modifications considered prior to the purchase could satisfactorily adapt the vessel for its intended purpose.

Was the Acquisition Process Sound?

This question was examined as part of the Pacific Marine Review of the project. It was their view that the process of evaluating the options and making the purchase was carried out in a professionally responsible manner. They also considered that there were no matters of major significance that were either overlooked or inadequately considered.

Was the Government Misled About the Ship's Capabilities Prior to Completion of The Modifications?

The proposed acquisition strategy was a phased approach: Phase 1 - purchase the ship and undertake initial modifications to meet safety and habitability requirements and defect rectification; Phase 2 - a short period of sea trials to gain operating experience and to validate the User Requirement and full modification proposal; and Phase 3 - full modification to meet the User Requirement.

Cabinet approved this strategy and the initial purchase decision was based on understanding that the ship would not be fully capable until all phases were complete. While Ministers and officials were not aware of the severity of the stability problems that arose during the sea trials phase, it was clearly understood that the usefulness of the ship would be quite limited until the final modifications were completed.

Were the Planned Purchase and Modifications Affordable?

While Treasury had raised some concerns about the risks associated with Defence's overall capital investment plan, the Government decided to proceed with the MSS project in 1994, as well as other high priority items, on the assurances of the Defence Chief Executives that they could manage defence capital procurement within their budgets and without prejudicing the NZDF's ability to fund future major replacements. Were the Modifications Jeopardised by a Lack of Priorities?

There has always been a clear set of priorities and criteria against which to determine the relative priorities among the large number of capital investment projects needed to maintain our defence capabilities. Some may disagree with how these were applied, such as the lower priority assigned to the follow-on modifications of Charles Upham, but it would be incorrect to blame the delay on a lack of priority setting. Indeed, exactly the opposite is true - the modifications have not proceeded because the priority setting criteria have been applied.

Why Were the Modifications Deferred?

The 1996 Defence Assessment included a proposal to proceed with the Phase 3 modifications of CHARLES UPHAM beginning in 1997/98. However, Cabinet directed that its blueprint for investing in defence over a five-year period had to be accommodated during the initial two years within the spending cap of the Coalition Agreement. This limited the number of projects that could be started before the 2000/01 financial year.

The Phase 3 modifications was one of a number of projects that had to be assessed to determine their relative importance and time sensitivity against the Government's priorities: it was judged a lesser priority than re-equipping the Army so that it can undertake the more demanding peace support operations; and improving the ability of the Air Force to undertake maritime surveillance tasks in our EEZ and the Southern Ocean. It was the view of my predecessor that in coming to an acceptable balance between operational capability and affordability, the planned modifications to Charles Upham could be delayed by two years.

Given the Age of the Ship, Should the Modifications Go Ahead when the Current Charter is Completed?

As the ship will be 17 years old when the modifications are done, some have questioned whether the modifications would be a wise investment. The original purchase decision was based on a nominal service life of 15 years after conversion, and the Chief of Naval Staff still considers this realistic with Charles Upham.

It is difficult to predict the life of ships with any precision as it depends on usage and the extent of work that is undertaken during surveys. It is relevant to note that the Untied States has eight Vehicle Cargo Ships that were last used during the Gulf War and in Somalia that are already 35 years old. They were originally container ships, acquired in 1982 and converted for military use. Their role is to carry Army equipment, a similar task to that of Charles Upham.

There is no reason for the Government to reconsider proceeding with the modifications on the basis of the age of the ship.

Conclusion

Contrary to the speculation based on misinformation that is being fed to the public, the Charles Upham, once modified, is the right ship to meet New Zealand's military sealift requirement. While it is unfortunate that the current financial squeeze has resulted in a delay to the commencement of these modifications, there are no reasons not to proceed with this work in two years time. We will then have a fully capable ship that will give us at least 15 years service.
