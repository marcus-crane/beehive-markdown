Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Northland Health's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting continued surpluses over the next three years.

"Key points in the 1998/99 business plan are that Northland Health has negotiated a contract that provides for more surgery, it plans to improve integration with other providers of health services, and that it expects to make surpluses over the next three years.

"The hospital's projected net result is a surplus of $1.08 million for this financial year, $1.4 million for the 1999/00 year, and $1.85 million the year after. These surpluses are being ploughed back into health services.

"There is no significant capital investment planned by Northland Health in this business plan, although its strong financial performance means that it would be well placed to consider such investment in the future.

"Current highlights include:

\- achievement of a surplus last year, while providing a further 126 surgical procedures  
\- good progress on the establishment of a Total Healthcare Centre at Dargaville  
\- establishment of a Maori health directorate to improve the coordination and delivery of Maori health services.

"I am confident that Northland Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of Northland," said Mr English.
