The New Zealand Kiwifruit Board today presented their strategic plan and vision on how they are going to improve kiwifruit growers incomes and meet the challenges of the future.

Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, John Luxton, said he welcomed the Boards proposals in response to the Governments request.

"This Government is concerned that rural incomes are continuing to decline. The Kiwifruit Board have now presented their vision for the future to arrest this general decline and to address the challenges of an ever changing international market place for kiwifruit.

"Now that the Board has presented its plan we will start to work through it with the Board over the coming months."

Board Chairman, Doug Voss, said he looked forward to working with the Government and officials on the detail of the plan.

"The Board supports the Governments initiative and are committed to building on the progress we have made to date with industry evolution. We look forward to working with Government through the next stage of this process, which we hope will see the corporatisation requested by the Board given priority," Mr Voss said.

More information on the Board's plan will be available from the Board.
