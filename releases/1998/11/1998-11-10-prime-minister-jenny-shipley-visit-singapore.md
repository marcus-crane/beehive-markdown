Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will visit Singapore on 19 and 20 November on her return from the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur.

Mrs Shipley said the visit will be an opportunity to consolidate New Zealand's excellent relationship with Singapore and exchange views on regional developments. It will also be an  
opportunity to discuss New Zealand's objectives for APEC next year.

"New Zealand has had a long standing and warm relationship with Singapore, encompassing the spectrum from security cooperation to trade and investment, tourism and education."

"Our trade with Singapore is a real bright spot given the general downturn in Asia. Singapore is New Zealand's 12th most important trading partner. Against trends in the region, our  
exports were up 26% last year to $375 million.

"Similarly, tourist numbers from Singapore were up by over 8%. There is no doubt this partly reflects Singapore's significant investment in our tourism industry. We welcome this  
investment," said Mrs Shipley.

"It provides capital for the development of our tourist industry, and employment for many New Zealanders. We are keen to see a broadening of investment into other sectors."

While in Singapore, Mrs Shipley will meet Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan. She will address a business meeting arranged jointly by the  
Singapore/NZ Business Council and Regional Managers' Club of the Economist Conferences. She will discuss the growing New Zealand/Singapore ties in the civil aviation area, including  
catering and pilot training. She will also lay a wreath at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetary at Kranji.
