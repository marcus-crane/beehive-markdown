Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Taranaki Healthcare's business plan for the year and noted that the hospital was forecasting a surplus by the 2000/01 financial year.

"The hospital is forecasting a loss of $4.6 million this year, $2.6 million the following year, then a surplus of $2.4 million in the 2000/01 year. Any surplus achieved will be ploughed back into health services.

"Reaching a surplus will be a significant achievement for the hospital and means that people in Taranaki can have certainty and security about their health services into the future.

"Recently the Government gave the go-ahead for a $7.4 million redevelopment of New Plymouth Base Hospital. When this is completed, Taranaki will have a base hospital which is more flexible and can offer better services.

"Other highlights include negotiating a three year contract with the Health Funding Authority, which will put the hospital's planning on a sound footing.

"The hospital has also done well in two key performance areas. Its average length of stay is 3.2 days, which puts it first in its group of six, and 59 percent of patients rated it very good, which puts it seventh out of 22 hospitals.

"I am confident that Taranaki Healthcare is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of Taranaki," said Mr English.
