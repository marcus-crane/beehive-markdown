Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she was saddened by the resignation of Samoa's Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana today, due to illness.

"Prime Minister Tofilau is one of the most respected and admired statesmen of the Pacific, and has made a major contribution to the social and economic advancement of his country.

"Over many years, Prime Minister Tofilau exercised inspired leadership in the interests of the Samoan people."

Mrs Shipley said Prime Minister Tofilau worked closely with successive New Zealand leaders, who had greatly admired his wise counsel.

Tofilau will remain a Member of Parliament for his local village district.
