Seven training and business grants to support private sector development in the Pacific Islands were announced today by Foreign Affairs Associate Minister Simon Upton.

The grants, totalling NZ$324,193, come under the Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS), part of New Zealand's Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme. They cover private sector activities in four countries.

"PIIDS makes a valuable contribution to the development of a viable private sector in the South Pacific region through promoting more effective business and training links with the private sector in New Zealand," Mr Upton said.

"Given the real constraints facing public sector budgets across the region, the development of a vigorous private sector is necessary to obtain a sustainable increase in living standards in the Pacific," he said.

"PIIDS is an innovative, forward-looking use of our ODA funding, and provides an opportunity for the New Zealand private sector be involved in assisting our neighbours to meet their own developmental needs."

In the July bidding round, 22 proposals were submitted. Grants were allocated according to each proposal's development merit, commercial viability and the likely long-term economic and employment benefits for the recipient country. Proposals were assessed by a panel including development specialists, and New Zealand private sector representation.

Proposals for the next round of PIIDS grants should be sent to the Development Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade by 27 February, 1999.

The seven projects cover activities in four South Pacific countries:

The venture will create 14 new jobs in Samoa, the majority of which will be women.

Background Note: The Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS)

The scheme has developed from a combination of the old Pacific Islands Industrial Development Scheme, and the South Pacific Development Assistance Facility (SPDAF). It is funded as part of the New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme.

Basic Objectives Of PIIDS

To encourage private sector development in Pacific Island Countries in partnership with the New Zealand private sector.

To encourage the development of employment and economic growth in the South Pacific based on Pacific Island economies' comparative advantages.

To encourage New Zealand private sector investment in the Pacific Islands.

To facilitate the transfer of knowledge from New Zealand to the South Pacific through the provision of training, marketing, technical, and managerial support.

How the Scheme Works

The scheme aims to meet the needs of the private sector directly. PIIDS has been designed to be flexible with a range of funding options available including training, feasibility, and equity assistance.

There are six separate grants available under the scheme. PIIDS Investment allows for the funding of up to 50% of the cost of a feasibility study to a maximum of $10,000 and may contribute up to $75,000 as an Equity Grant to the new venture on a dollar for dollar basis. PIIDS Development can provide grants of up to $25,000 to facilitate Training Needs Analyses, Training Programmes, Advisory Missions, and Personnel Attachments to New Zealand.

PIIDS proposals are assessed by a panel made up of Development Division staff and an independent private sector consultant during three competitive assessment rounds each year. Proposals are assessed on the basis of their developmental merit, and in the case of PIIDS Investment - their commercial viability.

The total 1998/99 PIIDS allocation is $1.5 million.
