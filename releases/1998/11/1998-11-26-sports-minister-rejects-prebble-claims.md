Sport Minister Murray McCully said it was "ironic" that Richard Prebble is leader of a political party which wants the Government to spend less money, except when it comes to spending money in his electorate.

Mr McCully was responding to assertions by Mr Prebble about the level of Government support for the 2006 Commonwealth Games bid by Wellington City Council.

The Minister said the Government's offer to underwrite $11.5 million or half of the maximum loss projected by the promoters was "about as fair as you can get".

"And the $500,000 bridging loan was always offered as a loan - never a grant, as is evident from my original press release (attached)."

"No amount of misrepresentation by Mr Prebble is going to change that."
