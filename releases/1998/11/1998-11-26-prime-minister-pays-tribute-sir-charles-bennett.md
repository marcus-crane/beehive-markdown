The passing of Sir Charles Bennett - one of Maoridom's greatest and most respected leaders - represents the end of an era in New Zealand's history, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"I am deeply saddened by Sir Charles' death as I am sure many New Zealanders are - both Maori and non-Maori alike.

"My thoughts go out to his family at this time, especially Lady Bennett.

"Sir Charles will be remembered for his strong leadership, particularly as Commander of the Maori Battalion during World War II, in which he was severely wounded while serving in North Africa in April 1943.

"He will also be remembered for his long and distinguished career in the public service and his promotion of the Maori language through the Kohanga Reo movement."

Lieutenant Colonel Sir Charles Moihi Te Arawaka Bennett, DSO was New Zealand's first High Commissioner to the newly formed Federation of Malaya from 1959 to 1963, and was made a Knight Bachelor in 1975.
