The movement of trained health professionals from developing countries to developed countries was one of the issues discussed at the principal session of the 12th Commonwealth Health Ministers' conference, chaired by Associate Health Minister Hon Tuariki Delamere, in Barbados today.

Mr Delamere reported from the meeting that Commonwealth countries have an admirable reputation for training health professionals.

"Ironically, this strength in building a 'home grown' health workforce is now creating new challenges for many countries, as health professionals who have trained in the developing world can improve their quality of life and income by moving to work in developed countries.

"This movement is significant among Commonwealth countries, most of whom share a common language and similar approaches to clinical practice and training."

Mr Delamere said that some proposed solutions to this problem raise significant concerns about human rights.

"Some suggestions include requiring health professionals to work for a defined period in their home country (or in an under-serviced region of their country) or to pay a 'bond' which is forfeited if they move away.

"While these proposals may be superficially appealing, they can be clumsy, ineffective and ethically questionable.

These proposals may unfairly penalise those professionals who have paid the costs of their training. It may also be argued that other professionals, for example teachers or engineers who are vital to national development, should be similarly constrained."

Mr Delamere proposed that the following approaches to solving the problem be given more consideration

- tailoring levels of training and/or qualification more closely to local health care needs to reduce the vulnerability of locally-trained staff to overseas recruitment
- encouraging countries to develop bilateral agreements to ban or discourage (possibly via restrictions on professional registration) recruitment of health professionals from countries considered to be particularly 'at risk'
- formalising current arrangements by encouraging 'importing' nations to meet all or some of the costs of training health professionals in 'exporting' countries.

The Health Ministers' conference will end on Friday (NZ time), after which Mr Delamere will fly to New York for talks with major American drug manufacturing companies.
