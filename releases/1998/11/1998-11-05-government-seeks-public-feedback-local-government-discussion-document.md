Local Government Minister Tony Ryall today invited members of the public to offer their feedback on the discussion document released yesterday, Local Government Foresight 2010.

Mr Ryall said the deadline for feedback, given as 26 February 1999 in the discussion document, was flexible and feedback from the public would be accepted for a few months afterwards.

"What happens in local government affects every New Zealander. We want to hear the public's views on the three scenarios presented in the discussion document," he said.

Local Government Foresight 2010 is part of the ongoing Foresight Project and has been sponsored by Local Government New Zealand, the Society of Local Government Managers and the Department of Internal Affairs.

"The Local Government Foresight 2010 discussion document has been written to stimulate thought and debate on the future of local government in New Zealand. I am pleased LGNZ and SOLGM invited us to be part of the project. We've worked well together," Mr Ryall said.

"The discussion document is not Government policy and we are happy to accept feedback after the deadline to give the public ample opportunity to express their views."
