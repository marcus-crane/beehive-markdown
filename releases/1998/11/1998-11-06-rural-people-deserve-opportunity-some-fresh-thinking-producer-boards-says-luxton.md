"I know there are some who may disagree with what they believe the Government has set in train," Minister of Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton told the Fruit Federation/United fresh conference on fresh thinking in Auckland today. "But rural people deserve this opportunity to have some fresh thinking," he said

Mr Luxton spent the day talking with growers and farmers on Producer Boards, firstly in Auckland, then Warkworth, and finally Palmerston North.

Mr Luxton said, "Quite simply we cannot continue the downward trend of returns to growers and rural communities. We must take this opportunity for fresh thinking, and ask can we do even better."

The Government had simply asked the Boards for some fresh thinking he said.

" It is vital that the Boards can show you, as growers and owners, that their visions and strategic plans are going to mean that you can take the maximum advantage of the exciting opportunities into the future, and how they are going to turn them into dollars in your bank account.

"Irrespective of who is in government, the international market for fruit, with forecast increases in volumes, is looking challenging.

"While it is important what Government thinks of these plans, what I believe is most important is that you, the growers and owners, are satisfied with the strategic direction and vision which your Board is proposing to take you in to the future.

"After your conference on "fresh thinking", are you satisfied that the fresh thinking of the Boards on their vision and their strategic direction will help meet the challenges of the future for you and your industry?" he said.
