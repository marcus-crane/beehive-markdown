The decision by the Gore District Council this week to set-up a Safer Community Council programme, is a positive step towards tackling youth justice issues in the area, Minister of Youth Affairs Tony Ryall said today.

The Minister was commenting after meeting with the Gore District Mayor, Mary Ogg, and Councillors to discuss youth justice concerns, on the second day of his visit to Southland.

Mr Ryall praised the Gore District Council for deciding to support the Safer Community Council concept.

"It is encouraging that the Gore District Council are dealing with youth justice and not burying its head in the sand on the tough issues," Mr Ryall said.

"Many communities initially resist setting up a Safer Community Council because they fear it's an admission that they have a local crime problem. It's not - it's about making communities safer for us to live in.

"The concept of community-based crime prevention and Safer Community Councils is about finding local solutions to local problems. They provide hands-on solutions and really know how to use their funding to make local communities safer."
