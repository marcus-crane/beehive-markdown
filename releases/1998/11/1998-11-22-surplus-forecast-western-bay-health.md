Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Western Bay Health's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting a surplus in the coming financial year.

"The business plan predicts a loss of $3 million in this financial year, followed by a surplus of $0.2 million in the 1999/00 year and $1.5 million the year after.

"I am pleased to see Western Bay Health move on to a sounder financial footing, because this will provide certainty and security for the people in the Western Bay of Plenty who rely on the organisation for hospital services. These surpluses will be ploughed back into health services.

"The hospital is planning to invest in some major projects over the next three years, including the redevelopment of its Emergency Department, mental health unit, day surgery facilities and wards.

"A business case has also been developed with Eastbay Health, in Whakatane, for the amalgamation of the two organisations.

"Current highlights include:

\- establishment of a patient council to provide direct patient feedback  
\- introduction of a cardiac catheterisation service  
start of project to improve patient care and efficiency  
uccessful initiatives to reduce costs and improve quality and productivity.

"I am confident that Western Bay Health is in a sound position to continue providing good hospital services," said Mr English.
