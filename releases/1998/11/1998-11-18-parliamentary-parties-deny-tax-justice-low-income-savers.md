"The public statements of Labour and ACT make it clear that they intend to vote against tax cuts for up to 600,000 low and middle income super savers," Treasurer Bill Birch said in Parliament this afternoon.

He was speaking as the committee of the whole House resumed its detailed consideration of the tax credit provisions in the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Bill.

These provisions would allow low and middle income super savers to choose to have the income on their superannuation savings taxed at their correct marginal tax rate, 21 percent, rather than at 33 percent as at present. "These provisions are not just a tax cut; they would give tax justice to hundreds of thousands of low and middle income super savers who are currently overtaxed on the income from their superannuation savings," said Mr Birch. "By voting against these provisions, Labour and ACT will ensure that these savers continue to be overtaxed."

Mr Birch emphasised that there was nothing compulsory about the tax credit provisions. Low and middle income super savers would have had a choice about whether or not to elect to take the tax credits.

No one would be forced to lose their family assistance because the tax credits on their super savings income increased their total income. They could simply choose not to go into the tax credit scheme.

"By voting against the tax credit provisions, Labour and ACT are denying this choice to low and middle income super savers," said Mr Birch. "These parties need to be accountable to those savers for denying them the choice of tax justice."
