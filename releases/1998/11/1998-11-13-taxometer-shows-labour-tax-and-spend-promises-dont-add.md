"Labour's tax and spending policies don't add up," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Labour have over-spent already. Labour's proposed tax rise to 39 cents in the dollar for New Zealanders earning over $60,000 won't deliver anything like enough cash to pay for all of  
Labour's spending promises.

"If Labour won't acknowledge that, then National intends to keep them honest."

The Prime Minister was speaking at the launch of National party's "taxometer" which measures the rate required under Labour's new tax policy to fund the Labour Party's spending  
promises.

"What the taxometer already shows is that Labour's old-fashioned spending promises don't add up."

The Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that, in designing the taxometer, the National Party had taken a conservative approach.

The National Party has concentrated only on the 1999/2000 financial year and accepted, for the time being, that Labour's policy is only to raise income tax on the 152,000 New  
Zealanders earning over $60,000 a year. It has assumed that rises in the tax rate would have no negative impact on the economy and would thus achieve the stated goal of increasing tax  
revenue. It has also assumed the Alliance would have no say in a Labour/Alliance Coalition, and has ignored the many "off-the-cuff" spending promises by Labour Party spokespeople.

Mr Birch says as a result the taxometer is based on just four concrete promises, concerning technical changes to housing and superannuation, student benefits and industry assistance.

"The taxometer shows that these four policies already use up Labour's proposed tax rise."

The Prime Minister says this makes it clear either the tax policy is dishonest or that Labour/Alliance would have no more money for education, health, families in need or the Police.

"Labour needs to come clean about whether the ideas being floated by its team are solid commitments the people of New Zealand can rely on, and if so how they will be funded.

"They also must explain how they will accommodate the demands of Jim Anderton and the Alliance.

"We won't let Labour tell the special interest groups and its union buddies that it'll spend more on all their old-fashioned pet projects, without telling hard-working families and the  
productive sector how much it will cost them.

"We will keep Labour honest," Mrs Shipley said.

The taxometer will be regularly updated as Labour promises to spend more.
