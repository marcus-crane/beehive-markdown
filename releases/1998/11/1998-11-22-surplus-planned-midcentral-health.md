Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported MidCentral Health's business plan for the year and noted that the hospital was forecasting a surplus from the next financial year.

"One of the key points in the 1998/99 business plan is that MidCentral Health is forecasting a small loss of $1.3 million this year, followed by a surplus of $0.7 million the following year and $0.5 million in the 2000/01 year.

"Reaching a surplus will be a significant achievement for the hospital and means that people in Palmerston and the surrounding area can have certainty and security about their health services into the future. These surpluses will be ploughed back into health services.

"The redevelopment of Palmerston North Hospital has started. This $55 million capital investment project will ensure that the region has modern hospital facilities in the future.

"One of the issues facing the board is to work with the Health Funding Authority to seek resolution on services for Horowhenua district and the future of the Kimberley Centre. Officials in Wellington are still working through the options for Kimberley in an effort to resolve what has been a very long-running issue.

"I am confident that MidCentral Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of the Manawatu," said Mr English.
