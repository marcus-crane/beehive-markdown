Provisions relating to annual tax rates for 1998/99 in the Taxation (Tax Credit, Trading Stock and Other Remedial Matters) Bill affect the flow of revenue to Government and will, therefore, be a matter of confidence for Parliament, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Other issues covered in the Bill are not confidence issues.

"It will be over to Parliament to decide whether to proceed with a measure that will reduce taxes on low and middle income savers," Mrs Shipley said.

"I want to see an end to over-taxing of low and middle income savers , because the National-led Government believes savings should be encouraged, not penalised.

"I also want those who have derived income through criminal activities to be fully taxed on that income."

The Taxation Bill contains four key measures:

The annual tax rates for 1998/99.  
Reduction of the tax on income from superannuation and life office savings (TOLIS) for low and middle income savers, from 33% to 21%. The 21% rate is the correct marginal tax rate for these savers.  
New trading stock provisions.  
New provisions for taxing the proceeds of criminal activities.

"Each of the parties in Parliament must work through the policy issues involved. It is also a challenge for other parties to decide what they stand for, not what they're against.

This is MMP in action, " Mrs Shipley concluded.

The bill is expected back before the House next week.
