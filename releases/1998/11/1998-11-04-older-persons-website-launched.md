A new website detailing the activities and celebrations that will take place in 1999 for International Year of Older Persons (IYOP) will be previewed tomorrow by the Minister for Senior Citizens, Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter will view the website with members of Wellington's SeniorNet, a group of senior citizens who volunteer their time to teach older adults how to use the Internet and today's computer technology.

He will meet with SeniorNet from 9am to 9.45am tomorrow at their Wellington City Council sponsored Harbour City Centre (first floor) rooms. Media are invited to attend to meet members of SeniorNet and to tour the website with the Minister for Senior Citizens.

The IYOP website will be operational from next week on the website address: [www.iyop.govt.nz](//www.iyop.govt.nz)

Included on the website is an overview of the year, a link to the United Nation's IYOP website page, a map showing areas where local co-ordinators are based, information on how to access Government funds for positive ageing projects and a suggestions page for community involvement in IYOP.

Mr Carter said several Government agencies including the Department of Social Welfare and the Retirement Commissioner would also be linked to the website, and he hoped New Zealanders would search the website for information on upcoming IYOP events in their regions.

"International Year of Older Persons will be a unique experience in New Zealand and the website is one of the best opportunities we have to spread the message about some of the exciting local events celebrating the year."

"It's also appropriate that we are previewing the site with a group of older people who truly represent the face of positive ageing. SeniorNet members are a wonderful example of a group of older people contributing enormously to our community."

"The perception is older New Zealanders have been swept aside by the computer revolution, but these SeniorNet members would put many younger New Zealander's computer skills to shame."

"It's time we celebrated ageing and recognised many of the positive ways in which older people are involved in our communities."

"International Year of Older Persons is our chance to celebrate old age in all its forms and diversity."
