Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Healthcare Hawkes Bay's business plan for the year and noted that the hospital was predicting an improved financial position over the next three years.

"The 1998/99 business plan shows an improving financial position. The loss of $8 million forecast this year is a significant improvement on the loss of $16.9 million in the 1997/98 year..

"It is important that the board continue to work hard towards achieving a surplus because the people of Hawkes Bay need the certainty and security of knowing their hospital is in a sound financial position.

"Current highlights include:

near completion of the Hawkes Bay hospital, with the last two villas of the health village under construction development of the Napier Health Centre, which is due to be finished late next year  
implementation of a plan for clinical audit and review.  
"Hawkes Bay now has the newest large hospital in the country. I am confident that Healthcare Hawkes Bay is in a sound position to continue providing good hospital services for the people of the Bay," said Mr English.
