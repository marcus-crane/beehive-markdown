Health Minister Bill English said today a survey of clinical leaders' views on the elective surgery booking system showed growing support in the public health service for changes in how it handles elective surgery.

"The survey amongst members of the Clinical Leaders' Association of New Zealand shows support for the general thrust of the booking system for elective surgery. In particular, there is support for making the elective surgery system fairer by ensuring those with the greatest need for surgery get it first and making the criteria for surgery transparent and consistent across the country.

"This support from clinical leaders is vital to achieving a better deal for people on waiting lists," said Mr English.

Findings from the survey include:

\- 89% agree that it is desirable to use nationally consistent criteria to assess patients 90% think ability to benefit from treatment should be a major determinant of priority  
\- 88% disagree that it is ethical to 'fiddle' the system to get a higher priority for their own patients  
\- 93% agree that, despite some flaws, the booking system is a step in the right direction  
\- only 21% believe that the current system of waiting lists and individual clinical judgement works well  
\- 75% disagree that the length of the waiting list is a good indicator of the success of the public health service.
