After eight years of National Government the average food bill for New Zealand families has not increased overall, said Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as she officially opened the New World supermarket in Thorndon, Wellington this morning.

"Under National, families today are spending less of their take home pay on food than they were in 1990.

"The cost of the average weekly shop has dropped from 23.7% of the average wage in 1990, to just 17.8% of the average wage in 1998. In November 1998 the average weekly food bill comes to $113.97, compared to September 1990 when it cost $115.02.

"Lower food prices are a direct benefit of the National Government's dedication to low inflation and creating a competitive business environment.

"These policies are contributing to a lower overall cost of living which is making a real difference to the weekly budgets of New Zealand families.

"Low inflation plus lower interest rates are giving new confidence to many New Zealand families," Mrs Shipley said.

Without our commitment to investors and innovators, New Zealand consumers would not receive benefits such as lower food prices which ultimately give individuals and families more choice and free up money for spending on other priorities," said Mrs Shipley.

Mrs Shipley congratulated the wholly-New Zealand owned company Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd, on the opening of the new supermarket which amounts to a $20 million investment in innercity Wellington.

"This new investment is creating 350 new jobs for Wellington, and is expected to serve around 30,000 shoppers every week.

"It is this Government's intention to continue providing an environment where businesses like Foodstuffs have the confidence to invest and in turn create jobs for New Zealanders and choice for consumers," Mrs Shipley said.
