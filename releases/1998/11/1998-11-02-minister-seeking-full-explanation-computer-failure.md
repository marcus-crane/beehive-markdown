The Minister responsible for the Fire Service, Jack Elder, has had a preliminary discussion with the acting National Fire Commander, Bob Sampson, about the reported failure of the service's computerised emergency call system at the weekend.

"I am very concerned at what happened and regard it as unacceptable," Mr Elder said. "I have asked for a full report in writing and in the meantime questions should be referred to the National Commander."
