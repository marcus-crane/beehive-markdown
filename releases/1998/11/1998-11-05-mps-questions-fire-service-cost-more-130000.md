(amended version with clarifying third para)

Providing Alliance List MP, Grant Gillon, with answers about the Fire Service has now cost more than $130,000 this year, according to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder.

So far this year Mr Elder has answered 433 written Parliamentary questions from Mr Gillon about the Fire Service at an estimated cost of $130,154.

Mr Elder says it cost approximately $130 to answer each of the three most recent questions. Others have cost considerably more because of the amount of time spent researching the answers.

Four more questions are awaiting replies.
