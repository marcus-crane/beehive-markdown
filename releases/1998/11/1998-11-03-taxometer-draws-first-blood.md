Labour's social policy is obviously in complete disarray, said the Hon Roger Sowry Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

"First we had Steve Maharey saying he 'would restore access to the Emergency Unemployment Benefit to all students,' (October 13) then today Michael Cullen put out a new release saying 'no final decision had been made'."

Mr Sowry said it was about time Labour stopped traipsing around the country making wishy-washy promises and sorted out its internal communication problems.

"Frankly, I don't know how Labour can expect the public to believe their policy statements when even Labour's finance spokesman can't keep up."

"Within three hours of the Prime Minister launching the Taxometer, Labour have started to back away from promises."

"We will continue to keep Labour honest," Mr Sowry said.
