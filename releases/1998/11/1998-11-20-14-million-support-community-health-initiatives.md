Health Minister Bill English said up to seven new primary health services for New Zealand's most disadvantaged communities would be set up with funds announced today.

Mr English told Health Care Aotearoa's national hui in Auckland today that he had agreed to provide more than $1.4 million funding for two initiatives proposed by the organisation.

"The first initiative will see a fund of $1 million established to provide start-up capital and on-going support for up to seven new primary health services. These will be set up in areas of high health need. A further $200,000 will be made available to Health Care Aotearoa (HCA) to administer the fund.

"In addition, HCA will be given approximately $217,000 to develop a quality improvement programme suited to the needs of its members. This will involve developing and promulgating national standards in consultation with its members, trialling the quality improvement programme in pilot sites, and reviewing the standards prior to being published.

"Health Care Aotearoa has a proven track record in supporting those who provide services for New Zealand's most disadvantaged communities, such as Maori health providers and union health centres.

"This funding will help them extend the network of providers committed to their philosophy which emphasises not-for-profit, community support and community involvement in running services," said Mr English.
