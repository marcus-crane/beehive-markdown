ENZA this afternoon presented its industry reform plan to the Government.

New Zealand Appale and Pear Marketing Board Chairman John McCliskie said the plan represented the views of its growers and was a wide ranging prescription for the future which built from existing restructuring initiatives.

"We welcome this opportunity and the constructive process that the Government has set up," he said.

"We spent over an hour briefing Ministers and Officials on both the state of the market in which we trade and our plans for maximising the business advantages which the New Zealand apple and pear industry currently enjoys," he said.

"Both Government and ourselves share the same objective - improving economic outcomes and increasing grower incomes. Whilst agreeing on the same outcome, we acknowledge both have some different perspectives" he said.

The Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, John Luxton welcomed ENZA's report.

"This is a substantive document and ENZA has clearly expanded its own restructuring programme to address a number of the issues raised by the Government," he said.

"The Government will now study the report in detail and work with ENZA to ensure the best possible outcome for the pipfruit growers of New Zealand," Mr Luxton said.
