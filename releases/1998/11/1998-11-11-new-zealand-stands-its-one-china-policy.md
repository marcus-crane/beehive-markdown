"The New Zealand Government continues to adhere strictly to its 'One China' policy", Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today.

"There has been some suggestion in the media today that the New Zealand Government has somehow upgraded its recognition of Taiwan by extending certain facilities to the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office in Wellington. This is simply not true."

"The New Zealand Government established diplomatic relations with China in 1972. At that time the Government acknowledged the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan was an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China" Mr McKinnon stated. "That remains our firm position today".

"The links we maintain with Taiwan are of an economic and cultural nature only and the extension of certain facilities to TECO does not depart from that."

"I have just visited China and reiterated to all senior leaders I met New Zealand's continuing adherence to our 'one China' policy. New Zealand enjoys a close and substantial relationship with China and this is something we all value" the Minister concluded.
