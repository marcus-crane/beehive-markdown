Police Minister Clem Simich will tomorrow (Friday 6 November) launch another initiative aimed at helping at-risk kids.

The Glen Innes Community Approach Programme is modelled on a similar, highly successful programme operating in Mount Roskill, and is funded by the Crime Prevention Unit of the Prime Minister's Department. The programme works with families to try and resolve problems and get kids back on track.

"It's a tragedy that the root of most young offending lies in the home. The offending is just a symptom of an underlying problem, and what results is a reflection of that early influence."

Mr Simich also praised the efforts of Glen Innes Police in getting the programme off the ground. Programme staff are already working with around 70 people in the Glen Innes area.

"Police and the Government are committed to providing stronger youth intervention and crime prevention programmes than ever before. If we can put in the work and money at the front end, that's a much better investment than when offending has become entrenched."

NB The launch of the Glen Innes Community Approach programme will take place at the Glen Innes Police Station, Line Road, Glen Innes, Auckland, at 10am tomorrow (Friday 6 November). Programme leaders and the Minister will be available for interviews.
