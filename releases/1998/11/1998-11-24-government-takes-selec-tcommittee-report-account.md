Defence Minister Max Bradford said today that the Government will be taking into account the Defence and Trade Select Committee report Defence Beyond 2000 when making it's decisions on the purchase of a third ANZAC frigate and F16 aircraft.

Mr Bradford said the Government would be making a decision by the end of the year, as it has signalled for many months now.

"We will continue to co-operate in providing the Select Committee with the information it needs," he said.

"There are a number of useful parts in the report. I am pleased it doesn't take a position on strike aircraft or a blue water Navy.

"It is important to realise that the Government conducted a major reassessment of the Defence Forces capability which culminated in the November 1997 Defence Assessment. This is based on three fundamental principles, and our procurement programme is based on these:

\- defending New Zealand against low-levels threats such as incursions into our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and terrorism;  
contributing to regional security which includes maintaining our key defence relationships with Australia and our Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) partners - Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore;  
\- being a good international citizen by playing our part in global collective security efforts, particularly peacekeeping.

Mr Bradford said he looked forward to working with the Select Committee's Chairman Derek Quigley over the next couple of weeks as the Government comes to a decision.

"The one pleasing point for all Members, with the possible exception of the Alliance, is that we agree that the first priority is re-equipping the Army," Mr Bradford said.

"The Defence Assessment made it clear that is the Government's first priority, and that continues to be the case.

"The Army's procurement programme, with the exception of armoured personnel carriers (APCs), is on target. The purchase of the APCs is undergoing detailed analysis by the Army and Ministry of Defence on the particular vehicles that should be purchased. This has nothing to do with any re-prioritisation or slow down of the re-equipment programme. Neither is it impacted on by a third ANZAC frigate and F16 issues."
