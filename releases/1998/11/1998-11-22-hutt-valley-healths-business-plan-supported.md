Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Hutt Valley Health's business plan for the year and noted that the hospital's current financial performance was better than that planned.

"The hospital is not forecasting to reach break-even in its business plan, but this is due to it taking a fairly conservative approach. It is forecasting to make a loss of $3 million this year, $5.7 million next year, and $3.5 million in the 2000/01 year.

"It is important that the board continue to work hard towards achieving a surplus because people in the Hutt Valley need the certainty and security of knowing their hospital is in a sound financial position.

"Current highlights include:

current financial performance better than planned  
new operating theatre and emergency complex completed late last year balance sheet restructured in the last financial year to put the hospital on a sustainable footing  
continued reduction in the hospital's deficit from previous years.  
"I am confident that Hutt Valley Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services to people in the Hutt," said Mr English.
