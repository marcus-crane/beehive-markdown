"The warning bells are already ringing for tertiary students over the credibility of Labour's spending promises," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Tertiary students should take a very close look at what has happened with Steve Maharey's promise to students over the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.

"Labour is promising one thing on campus, and another thing to bankers and economists. Where's the honesty in that?"

Mr Creech was responding to a statement issued by NZUSA today, in which it said it was "shocked and appalled" that Labour's Michael Cullen had dishonoured Steve Maharey's promise.

Mr Cullen stepped into the issue after National launched its taxometer earlier this week.

"A lot of people were fooled that Labour would restore the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students from wealthy families.

"Tertiary students need to be very careful of anything Labour promises, not just with the Emergency Unemployment Benefit, but with allowances and tuition fees as well.

"It's better to be honest and up front than to gain support by promising something you know you can't deliver," Mr Creech said.
