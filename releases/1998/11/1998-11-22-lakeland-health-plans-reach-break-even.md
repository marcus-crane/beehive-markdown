Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Lakeland Health's business plan for the year and noted that for the first time ever the hospital was forecasting to reach a break-even point from this financial year.

"Key points in the 1998/99 business plan are that the hospital is planning to reach break-even point for the next three years and that a new maternity unit is planned.

"Getting Lakeland Health on to a sound financial footing will be a significant achievement for the board and will mean that people of Rotorua and surrounding areas can have certainty and security about their health services into the future.

"Current highlights include:

\- better than expected financial performance in the 1997/98 year  
\- refurbished wing at Rotorua Hospital converted to assessment and consultation rooms for specialists increased communication and cooperation among groups involved as a result of the draft proposal for an integrated care pilot  
\- cost saving initiatives instituted as part of the Leading Edge 2000 best practice project.

"I am confident that Lakeland Health is in a sound position to continue providing good health services for the people of Rotorua," said Mr English.
