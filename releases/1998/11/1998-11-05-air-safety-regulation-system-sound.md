The report of the Ministerial Inquiry into aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority Performance was released today by the Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson.

"I am very pleased with the results of this inquiry and I accept its Conclusions and Recommendations as set out in Chapter 9 of the Report," the Minister said.

"It reinforces our belief that the fundamental aviation safety regulatory framework is very robust and the overall safety oversight management programme in the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is very comprehensive, well conceived and based on sound principles and design philosophy. The report comments that in some respects, the systems are world leading.

"It has however indicated the need for further improvement in CAA's operations, to make a good system even better. These improvements have already been made or are being actioned," the Minister said.

The Inquiry was called following the release of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission's (TAIC) report into the loss of Beechcraft BE58 Baron, ZK-KVL in the Tararuas with the loss of the pilot.

The Inquiry was charged with investigating aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) performance arising from TAIC's investigation into the loss of ZK-KVL. (Terms of Reference attached).

"I am reassured by the findings of the Inquiry that the public can have full confidence in the regulatory systems that underpin air safety in New Zealand," Mr Williamson said.

The Inquiry was led by John Upton QC and Don Spruston (former Director General of Civil Aviation in Canada and an adviser to the International Civil Aviation Organisation on safety oversight issues).

"Specifically the Inquiry identified the need for the CAA to develop a system for risk profiling of aviation operators. The Inquiry considered there should be increased use made of operator spot checks in addition to their regular programme of safety audits.

"All of the Reports recommendations are being actioned now and I have asked to be kept informed of progress," Mr Williamson said.
