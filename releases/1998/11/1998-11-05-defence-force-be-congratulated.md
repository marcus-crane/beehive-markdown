Defence Minister Max Bradford said today that the Defence Force must be congratulated for its upfront and open manner of addressing sexual harrassment issues.

Mr Bradford was commenting on the Human Rights Commission Gender Integration Report, commissioned by Defence Force chief Lieutenant-General Tony Birks, which was made public today.

"Defence acknowledges the problems, and I am confident it is genuinely continuing to work to eliminate any unacceptable behaviour throughout the services," Mr Bradford said.

"General Birks particularly should be congratulated for tackling this issue in such a constructive manner."
