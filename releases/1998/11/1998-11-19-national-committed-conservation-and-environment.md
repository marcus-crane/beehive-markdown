Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched National's Conservation and Environment Policy Statement at Arahura on the West Coast, with four major policy packages which build on nine years of repositioning of environment and conservation management in New Zealand.

"National is committed to protecting our national heritage and identity. This is the third leg of responsible government alongside economic and social responsibilities. We have a strong plan, a clear vision and consistent policies to achieve sustainable prosperity and a unique, healthy environment," Mrs Shipley said.

"National is determined to turn the tide on the loss of our indigenous plants and animals. National will complete and implement the Biodiversity Strategy to achieve this. National is making specific commitments to save kiwi from extinction, and will clarify the rights and responsibilities of private landowners under the Resource Management Act," Mrs Shipley said.

"Our ocean areas are estimated to contribute about $4.3 billion a year to the New Zealand economy. This figure could double over the next decade but our management of resources is poorly organised. National will prepare an integrated oceans strategy which will underpin economic activity with sound environmental management and streamlined government structures," Mrs Shipley said.

"Protecting the environment from pollution is a key National objective. By 2003, National will develop environmental performance indicators that will ensure that there is good information and standards on hazardous materials, air quality and water quality," Mrs Shipley said.

"Globally, greenhouse gases are the greatest threat to environmental quality. National will seek to stabilise New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions in a way that imposes least economic cost and without subsidies or heavy handed regulation. National will offset any carbon charges or other pollution charges by reducing other taxes," Mrs Shipley said.

"The four major policy packages are not exclusive. National is committed to continuing its record of achievement in environmental protection, on the land and in the sea, and its record in striking a balance between environmental protection and economic development. That record includes the establishment of 13 Marine Reserves since 1990; increased spending on possum control from $380,000 in 1989 to $13.5 million this year; increased spending on protecting our endangered species like the kiwi, kakapo and kokako, from $7 million in 1989 to $32 million this year; the creation of the Kahurangi National Park, significant additions to Fiordland National Park and the investigation into the creation of a new National Park on Stewart Island; the creation of a new legislative framework covering resource management, minerals, indigenous forests, pastoral lands, fisheries, biosecurity, hazardous substances and new organisms," Dr Smith said.

"Conservation and the Environment are a top priority for the National Party. We are committed to continuing to protect our natural heritage for our children and grandchildren to enjoy," Mrs Shipley concluded.
