The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, has commended Ngaruawahia publican, Jack Robson, for providing smoke alarms for every house in the north Waikato town.

Mr Robson, owner of the Delta Tavern, has donated $12,000 from his hotel's gambling machines to fund about 1600 smoke alarms. Members of the local volunteer fire brigade will start next month checking and installing alarms.

Mr Elder applauded Mr Robson's action saying it will increase public awareness of the need to prevent fire.

"We've just experienced two of our worst years ever for fire deaths," Mr Elder said. "Most of them have occurred in ordinary domestic dwellings.

"We all have to take ownership and responsibility for managing fire risk at home. The public-spirited action of Mr Robson will help Ngaruawahia families better ensure their safety at home.

"I hope Mr Robson's action will be seen as a challenge to other communities to follow suit."

The Ngaruawahia Volunteer Fire Brigade is also establishing a data base to ensure all alarms get an annual checkup.

Mr Elder said he was extremely pleased to observe the positive response of volunteer brigades to the modernising of the fire service.

"This 'top-of the-cliff approach' to fire prevention is the way we must go," Mr Elder said.
