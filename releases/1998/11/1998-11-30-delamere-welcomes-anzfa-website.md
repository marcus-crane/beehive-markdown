Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today welcomed the launch of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority's Internet site [www.anzfa.gov.au](http://www.anzfa.gov.au)

"Food concerns everyone and this new Internet site gives ready access to a wide range of information from ANZFA, New Zealand and Australia's food regulatory body.

"The site has all of ANZFA's latest media releases, speeches and publications, as well as details of how food regulation in New Zealand and Australia works," said the Minister.

"There are many important issues concerning food at the moment, including the production of genetically-modified food and the updating of food standards that were introduced years ago.

"This new Internet site will provide up-to-date information on all those issues that are of interest to consumers, students, professionals, the media and food businesses.

"The changes facing ANZFA at present are challenging and can only be achieved with good communication. I am pleased to see the establishment of this Internet site as one aspect of this communication," said Mr Delamere.

The site has been designed so that information can be updated instantly. ANZFA will be expanding information on the site rapidly and it will also soon be used to distribute information for public comment and submissions.

The site links with other agencies in New Zealand, Australia and around the world. A New Zealand version of the site ([www.anzfa.govt.nz](http://www.anzfa.gov.au)) will be launched shortly. Contact: Dr Hugh Baber ANZFA Wellington 473 9942
