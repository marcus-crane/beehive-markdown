Social Services Minister Roger Sowry says he's pleased the Anglican Bishops have accepted the Government's invitation to discuss solutions to the concerns raised by the Hikoi of Hope.

The Government originally offered to meet the Bishops in October, but they instead asked for a meeting later in the year, and a date has now been set for early December. The Bishops will meet the Prime Minister, Mr Sowry and other senior Ministers.

Mr Sowry says the Prime Minister has written to the Bishops saying she and her Ministers look forward to discussing the challenges that face both the Church and the Government as they seek to meet the hopes and needs of the people they represent within the human and financial resources available.

"The Government is delivering real change in many areas and a number of important developments have been announced in recent weeks.

There is additional funding for rural housing for the East Coast, parts of the Bay of Plenty, and Northland, to provide affordable and equitable housing for New Zealand families. This opportunity has been developed by Ministers in consultation with local iwi and runanga and will make a real difference to housing standards.

We've made changes to the target occupancy rates for Housing New Zealand properties which we expect will see the cost of rental housing come down.

We're setting ambitious targets to improve literacy and numeracy amongst our children, with special programmes for disadvantaged families to assist motivate them in appreciating the value of teaching children to read and do maths. As part of this push, we've provided additional support for the "Books in Homes" programme.

We have recently settled the Ngai Tahu Treaty of Waitangi claim, putting right a long standing injustice.

We are shortly to announce the composition of the Super 2000 Taskforce, which will be charged with seeking community-wide agreement on a savings strategy for New Zealand.

"The Government will continue to work to improve the quality of life and living standards of New Zealanders through sound economic management and fair and affordable social policies that deliver genuine and sustainable hope and prosperity. We look forward to working with any group, including the Churches, who have ideas that will deliver solutions that work," Mr Sowry concluded.
