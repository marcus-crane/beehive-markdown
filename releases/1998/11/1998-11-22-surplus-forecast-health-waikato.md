Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Health Waikato's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting a surplus by the year 2000/01.

"A key point in the 1998/99 business plan is the continuing improvement in Health Waikato's financial performance, with a loss of $7.3 million forecast this year, followed by a loss of $3.7 million the following year and a surplus of $4.8 million for the 2000/01 year. Any surpluses will be ploughed back into health services.

"Reaching a surplus will be a significant achievement for the hospital and means that people in Hamilton and the Waikato can have certainty and security about their health services into the future.

"The business plan notes that Health Waikato is holding discussions and developing options with the Health Funding Authority to ensure health services are maintained in more rural areas.

"Highlights from the last financial year include the opening of the Henry Bennett Centre, and all patients have now been transferred from Tokanui hospital. Reconfiguration work has also been completed at some of the smaller hospitals.

"Health Waikato has also achieved good results in two key performance areas. Its 78 percent average bed occupancy rate puts it second in its group of four, and the 59 percent very good customer satisfaction is eighth out of 22 hospitals," said Mr English.
