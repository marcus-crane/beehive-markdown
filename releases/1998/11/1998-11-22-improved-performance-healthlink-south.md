Health Minister Bill English said today he had supported Healthlink South's business plan for the year and noted the hospital was forecasting an improved performance over the next three years.

"The 1998/99 business plan is forecasting a loss of $2.3 million this year and $2.4 million the year after, followed by a surplus of $0.7 million in the 2000/01 year, as a result of the sale of surplus assets.

"Healthlink South has set challenging targets, but achieving a surplus is important to ensuring the hospital is on a sound financial footing into the future. Any surpluses achieved will be ploughed back into health services.

"The redevelopment of Princess Margaret and Sunnyside Hospitals in on schedule. This $28 million project is a significant capital investment for Christchurch hospital services," said Mr English.
