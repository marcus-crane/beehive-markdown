Immigration Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today he had yesterday withdrawn the special direction given to the convicted German fraudster Ralf Simon that would have allowed Mr Simon to enter New Zealand over Christmas and New Year.

"After six weeks of mulling over this case, and after listening to many representations from Mr Simon and his friends that he wished to come to New Zealand to see his former fiancee whom I was informed was dying, I granted Mr Simon a dispensation that would have allowed him to spend up to ten days in New Zealand over Christmas and New Year.

"Even though Mr Simon had been deported from New Zealand some years ago, I gave the special direction on compassionate grounds.

"Information I have received over the weekend leads me to believe that Mr Simon and his friends have been less than forthcoming with the truth and accordingly Mr Simon will be officially advised today that he will not receive a visa to enter New Zealand, should he apply.

"The original application for a special direction led me to believe that Mr Simon wished his visit to be private, but his own actions in going to the media lead me to doubt his motives in trying to enter New Zealand," said Mr Delamere.
