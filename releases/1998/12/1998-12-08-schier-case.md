Immigration Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today that, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, he had decided not to disturb the decision of the Court of Appeal concerning the German overstayers, G ünther and Petra Schier, of Maruia, who had appealed against a deportation order.

"I have carefully examined the arguments advanced by the Schiers' lawyer in a letter received today, and I can find no good reason why their case should rank ahead of many other people who are seeking special consideration in their efforts to live in New Zealand," he said.

The Schiers are overstayers and Mr Schier has several criminal convictions in Germany on charges involving desertion and dealing in narcotics.
