He's 60cm high, with a shock of golden hair and eyes you could melt into.

But his nose is one of the most lethal in the business.

Brock, one of Customs most experienced drug dogs will be visiting the Beehive tomorrow to demonstrate his impressive drug-finding skills for visiting Cashmere Primary School pupils and Associate Minister for Border Control, Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter is the Minister responsible for the day to day operations of the Customs Service.

The four-year-old golden Labrador retriever is one of two Customs drug dogs based in Wellington, and in his four years of active service he's been responsible for a number of drug seizures in the lower North Island.

David Carter said the demonstration was an ideal opportunity for the visiting pupils, who have travelled to Wellington to tour Parliament buildings, to meet one of Customs best kept secrets while learning more about the border control agency.

"Customs is always looking for opportunities to show these dogs off, as it better helps the public to understand the role of Customs in serving the community."

Accompanied by handler Wayne Batty, Brock will demonstrate some of his talents by attempting to search out illegal substances in the Beehive Theatrette.

Mr Carter said while he didn't expect Brock, who is named after racing guru Peter Brock, to find anything illicit, his visit would certainly be entertaining.

"Children always respond to animals and Brock is a great example of how dogs can work with the Customs Service to deter offenders and maintain security at the border."

"I'm delighted that Brock, his handler Wayne Batty and inspections unit senior supervisor Richard Roberts have been able to find the time to come and visit us."

The Customs drug dog unit is celebrating 25 years of service this year. Currently there are 13 drug dogs working within Customs, nine in Auckland, two in Wellington and two in Christchurch.

Last year a total of 519 hits were made by the drug dog unit in the Auckland region alone.

The demonstration is open to the media, and will take place between 1.15pm and 1.55pm in the Beehive Theatrette. Mr Carter will attend the final part of the demonstration.
