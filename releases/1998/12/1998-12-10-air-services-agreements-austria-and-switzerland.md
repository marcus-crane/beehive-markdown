Austria and Switzerland have been added to the growing number of European countries with which New Zealand has negotiated air services agreements this year", the Minister of Transport, Mr Maurice Williamson, announced today.

"Opportunities arising from the two new agreements will hopefully deliver further benefits for New Zealand's tourist industry, and for companies trading with Europe", Mr Williamson said. "New Zealand travellers also stand to benefit through easier ccess to more destination points in Europe".

Austria

Airlines of each side can operate over any routing between Austria and New Zealand, and without limitations on capacity. There are no limitations on the number of airlines of each side that may commence services. Code-sharing is permitted, including on the aircraft of third country airlines.

Passenger fares can be introduced in accordance with market conditions and with minimal government intervention. Looking to the future, liberal airline ownership provisions have been agreed.

Switzerland

Airlines of each side can operate over any routing, with passenger capacity of three services per week and cargo capacity of two services per week. There are no limitations on the number of airlines of each side that may commence services. Liberal passenger fare and airline ownership provisions have also been agreed. Code-sharing is permitted, including on the aircraft of third country airlines, but any code-share service would count against the agreed maximum total of three passenger services per week.

"I am very pleased with the many new and revised air services agreements that we have concluded this year. In the last month I have announced new air services agreements with the Scandinavian trio of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and significantly enhanced arrangements with Germany", Mr Williamson noted. "Europe, in particular, is a significant source of inbound tourism, with over 280,000 passenger arrivals in the year ended October 1998. Austria and Switzerland both have potential for good tourism growth, and the new agreements should assist in boosting the total number of Europeans holidaying in New Zealand".
