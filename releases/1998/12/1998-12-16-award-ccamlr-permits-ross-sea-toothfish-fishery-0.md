"SS Fishing Ltd has been awarded the available access for this season's exploratory toothfish fishery in the Ross Sea," the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Upton, and the Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, John Luxton, announced today.

"The fishing will take place under strict conditions set by the Commission for the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which is responsible for the management of fisheries in the waters of the Ross Sea. The two New Zealand-flagged and controlled SS Fishing vessels, the Janas and the San Aotea II, will be fishing by longline only. They are the only vessels licensed by CCAMLR to fish in the Ross Sea region during this period, " the Ministers said.

"Their activities will be closely monitored by an international observer appointed under the CCAMLR Scheme of Observation and Inspection, as well as by a Ministry of Fisheries Observer."

"The vessels will also be complying with the requirements of the Antarctica (Environmental Protection) Act which implements the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty in New Zealand law. This will ensure that their activities will have no more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment," the Ministers concluded.
