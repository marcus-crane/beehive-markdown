Health Minister Bill English said a business case presented today by Auckland Healthcare for a new hospital in central Auckland would be given careful consideration by the Government over the next few months.

"We must think carefully about what hospital infrastructure is the right one for Auckland, which is growing much faster than other parts of the country and may be half as big again in 20 years time.

"The Government is keen to solve this particular problem in Auckland. We will be working through Auckland Healthcare's business plan carefully.

"I want to be sure we make the right decision and that means having the right hospitals in the right place not just for today, but into the new millenium.

"We have already seen some exciting developments in health services in Auckland. North Shore hospital is now a 24-hour acute hospital, two new super clinics have been built in South Auckland, and just this week a $60 million plan to redevelop Middlemore Hospital was launched.

"This plan proposed by Auckland Healthcare is the latest in these developments. At this stage I can't confirm the timetable for a decision, but it will be a top priority for the Government next year," said Mr English.
