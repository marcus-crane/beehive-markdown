Tourism Minister Murray McCully has announced the appointment of Commerce Commission Chair Peter Allport as Chairman of the New Zealand Tourism Board.

Mr Allport, who retires from the Commerce Commission early next year, brings a wealth of experience to the role. A former Managing Director of Goodman Fielder (NZ) Cereal Foods Division, Mr Allport also holds the Chair of Totally Wellington (formerly Tourism Wellington) and directorships with TransAlta New Zealand Ltd, the New Zealand Institute of Crop & Food Research, and a number of private companies.

"I am delighted that someone with the important credentials of Mr Allport has agreed to take up the Chair of the New Zealand Tourism Board", Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand, and particularly New Zealand tourism, is entering an exciting phase over the next eighteen months, and I look forward to working with Mr Allport".
