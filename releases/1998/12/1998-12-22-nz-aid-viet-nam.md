New Zealand is to donate $100,000 towards storm and flood relief efforts in Viet Nam, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Three tropical cyclones and heavy flooding have hit Viet Nam's central provinces in recent months, killing 260 people, disrupting the lives of 2.4 million, and causing extensive damage to infrastructure and crops.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand's donation would go towards the emergency appeal launched by the International Federation of Red Cross and Crescent Societies to support relief and rehabilitation activities focusing on providing food, household kits and construction materials.

New Zealand's money will be spent in Binh Dinh province where Volunteer Services Abroad has been involved in health, education and agriculture development programmes
