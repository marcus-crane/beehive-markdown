Despite difficult political conditions in 1998, the National-led government got through a sizeable amount of legislation this year, with Parliament passing 129 bills.

This comprised 121 Government bills, two members bills, 2 local bills and 4 private bills, said the Leader of the House and Minister of Social Services, Roger Sowry.

He said it's clear National has the confidence of parliament, and people can look forward to another year of sound government in the best interests of New Zealanders.

"This year has been particularly pleasing because we've put through some large and historic pieces of legislation like the Accident Insurance Bill, Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Bill, the Education Legislation Amendment Bills and Electricity Industry Reform Bill - to name a few."

Between 1993 and 1996 Parliament averaged 46 Government bills introduced a year, however the pace picked up in 1997 with 52 bills introduced - but this year 80 Government bills were introduced.

Mr Sowry said a large number of items had been left on the Order Paper for action next year which could have progressed a great deal further had the Opposition not filibustered during the year.

The bills introduced in 1998 and expected to come back to the House in 1999 cover areas ranging from de facto and matrimonial property, gaming law reform, the Sale of Liquor Act and animal welfare.
