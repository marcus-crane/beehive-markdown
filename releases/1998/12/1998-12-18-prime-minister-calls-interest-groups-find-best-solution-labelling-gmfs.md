Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today that the Government will be working with all of the interest groups in the food industry to find a workable solution to the labelling of genetically-modified foods, following a decision by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council to enforce mandatory labelling.

"New Zealanders like choice and they also want meaningful information about the food they buy for their families.

"Better food labelling may also provide a unique marketing opportunity for our food industry as consumers may be prepared to pay a premium for foods that clearly provide information about their quality and composition."

Mrs Shipley said Government will continue to work with industry and other interest groups to find a workable solution to how consumers can get the best possible information about their food, without imposing unreasonable or impractical requirements on industry.

"We will be looking at the Food Standards Council recommendations in the new year, and I will also look at how Britain has handled GMF labelling, when I visit the United Kingdom next month, to see what we can learn from their experience. Europe has had more stringent food standards requirements for some time and we may be able to learn from their experience.

"Government is aware of the concerns that this issue has caused for food producers, consumer groups and politicians alike, and will be looking to work with them to find a workable and commonsense solution, and bring forward the appropriate legislation," Mrs Shipley concluded.
