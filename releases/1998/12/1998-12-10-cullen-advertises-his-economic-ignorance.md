The strength of the economic up-turn in the next three years is due in significant part to rises in disposable income including the 1996-8 tax cuts, said Max Bradford, Revenue Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Commerce.

He said Labour 's Michael Cullen had failed to grasp the fact that the changes in tax and family support had helped low and middle income families throughout the country, and were playing an important role in fostering improved growth

"That blind-spot in Labour thinking leads Dr Cullen to imagine no harm will be done if he abolishes the tax cuts, and takes the money away from the public. That has to be a worry for voters," Mr Bradford said.

"The tax cuts do far more for New Zealand's on-going growth than his alternative of increased taxes and higher Government spending.

"New Zealand has ridden out the Asian economic storm far better than other countries in the region because our present framework helps businesses adjust rapidly to changing circumstances in a very competitive way.

"Labour, by contrast, wants to put firms back on phoney industry assistance schemes which undermine their independence, erode their competitive edge, and boost their tax bills. That won't help anybody," Mr Bradford said.
