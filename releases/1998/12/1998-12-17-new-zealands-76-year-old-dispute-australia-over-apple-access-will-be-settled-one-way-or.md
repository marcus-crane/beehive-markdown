New Zealand's 76-year-old dispute with Australia over apple access will be settled one way or the other next year, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said after the annual CER Trade Ministers' Talks in Wellington today.

"We have agreed to identify a process to achieve timely resolution of outstanding Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) issues, including apples," Dr Smith said.

"The timeframe is months, not years.

"Given the strength of the New Zealand case, I believe we should achieve access next year."
