Associate Minister of Justice Tony Ryall said today that the Motor Vehicle Dealers Bill will not now commence on May 1st 1999.

Mr Ryall said the Commerce Select Committee had obtained an extension to the report-back date to late March 1999, making it unlikely the bill would be passed for commencement by next May.

Not withstanding other legislative priorities in the 1999 legislative programme, the bill should be enacted next year, Mr Ryall said.
