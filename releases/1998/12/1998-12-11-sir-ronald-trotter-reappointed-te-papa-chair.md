Hon Marie Hasler, the Minister of Cultural Affairs, today announced the reappointment of Sir Ronald Trotter as Chair of the Board of the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa.

"Sir Ronald has done a superb job in leading Te Papa over the past three years," Ms Hasler said. "Particularly, his work in ensuring the new building on the Wellington waterfront was successfully completed on time and within budget.

"The experience and skills which Sir Ronald brings to Te Papa, especially in the financial area as the former Chair of Fletcher Challenge Limited, continue to be valuable to the Board.

"Sir Ronald's reappointment will provide stability and continuity as Te Papa settles into a new phase of its operations.

"I am very pleased he has consented to serve for a further term of office," Ms Hasler said.
