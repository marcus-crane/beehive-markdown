"It comes as no surprise to me that Native Forest Action's political agenda has been exposed and it is not a "supposedly neutral lobby group," says Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon David Carter.

"Native Forest Action's claims of political neutrality have always been suspect, but comments from a former supporter reported in the Christchurch Press today have totally blown away any facade of political neutrality."

"These people should just own up to being active members of the Labour and Green Parties. At least then people who are genuinely interested in learning more about sustainable forestry operations on the Coast would know they're likely to be politically tainted by getting involved with Native Forest Action."

"This also confirms for many of us that the information Native Forest Action releases is in fact political propaganda from the Labour and Green parties."

A Hokitika conservationist, Barry Nicolle, spoke out about his concerns about the organisation in the Christchurch Press today.

During his three months of involvement with the organisation, he was shocked to see the "supposedly politically neutral NFA" handing over remits to a political representative for tidying up.

The wording of remits calling for an end to logging was almost exactly the same as wording agreed to in a similar remit at the Auckland Labour Party Conference three months later, he said.

Mr Carter said he welcomed contact and interaction with conservation lobby groups, but he expected them to be honest about their motives and agendas.

"Native Forest Action claims to be "politically neutral", yet we hear of them drafting political remits for opposition parties. It's difficult to separate their agendas."
