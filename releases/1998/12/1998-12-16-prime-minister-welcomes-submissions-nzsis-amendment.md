Prime Minister Jenny Shipley is urging groups with an interest in the proposed amendment to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service legislation, permitting NZSIS agents to enter private premises to execute interception warrants to make sure they take the opportunity to have a say on the legislation.

"It's important that people know they have an opportunity to make submissions on the Bill, and I encourage those with an interest in the issue, to be ready to have their submissions in by late January, 1999."

The submissions would be considered by a Parliamentary Committee responsible for the NZSIS legislation, Mrs Shipley said.

"The important thing, now, is for people to get working on their submissions. Once the committee has considered all submissions and made any recommendations, it will refer the legislation back to the House for a third reading early next year.

"There is nothing unusual about this process. We are not rushing it through Parliament as some have said. We have provided the opportunity for people to have their say and I welcome all feedback and comments on the Bill," Mrs Shipley concluded.
