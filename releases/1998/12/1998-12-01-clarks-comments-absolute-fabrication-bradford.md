Defence Minister Max Bradford says Labour leader Helen Clark's so-called sources are leading her up a very long garden path.

Mr Bradford said Ms Clark's claims on Checkpoint this evening - that ACT had scuttled a Cabinet decision to purchase an ANZAC frigate - were an "absolute fabrication".

"The public will see that when the Cabinet papers are released."

Mr Bradford said Cabinet's decision yesterday was the same as announced by the Government today - to proceed with the purchase of F16 aircraft but not a third ANZAC frigate to replace the HMNZS Canterbury when it retires next century.

"To make such claims is extraordinary behaviour for someone who purports to be a future Prime Minister," Mr Bradford said.
