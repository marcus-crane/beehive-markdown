"The Working Party set up to look into schooling in Rotorua is now ready to get down to business," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

The Working Party will provide independent advice on the future arrangements for intermediate, middle and secondary schooling in Rotorua.

"A three member Working Party headed by Judy Keaney, currently the Chair of Rotorua Energy Charitable Trust Education Committee, will seek the views of schools and parents in Rotorua about the future school structures in the region," Mr Creech said.

The Working Party members are:

Judy Keaney Chair of Rotorua Energy Charitable Trust Education Committee. She is also a former Speech Language Therapist. Graeme Searancke tax consultant/accountant of Ngati Maniopoto descent and who has wide involvement in local community affairs. Consumer representative on Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee. Professor Peter Ramsay prominent educationalist. Professor of Education at the University of Waikato and Director of Tauranga University College.

"The Working Party's terms of reference look at parental choice, the quality of education provided, achievement levels of all students and demographic analysis of the Rotorua District.

"Once the Working Party has done its work and reported to me, final decisions will be able to be made on the applications from Rotorua Boys' High School and Kaitao Intermediate to change class," Mr Creech said. "If any changes are made they would be for the 2000 school year. I hope final decisions can be made by mid 1999."
