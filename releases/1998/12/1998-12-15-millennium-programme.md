Announcements made today by the Towards 2000 Taskforce "set the scene for a high-impact, high-value Millennium programme," according to the Chair of the New Zealand 2000 Team of Ministers, Murray McCully.

The Minister said that over $9 million remained for community groups to bid for funding for Millennium projects in the coming three funding rounds.

"There is still huge scope for community and cultural groups to bid.

"But the big picture decisions taken by the Taskforce to build an international television event around Gisborne, Mt Hikurangi and the Chatham Islands celebrations provide an excellent framework from which to maximise international exposure.

"I welcome TV3's appointment as host broadcaster. The potential to access a worldwide audience of over one billion people through TV3's network associations provides huge potential for New Zealand trade, tourism and investment."
