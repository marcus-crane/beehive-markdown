Each politician has been challenged to make a new year's resolution this January to commit to establishing some concrete principles on retirement income policy next year, says Minister Responsible for the Retirement Accord, Hon Roger Sowry.

"The Periodic Review Group's December report offers politicians a range of options that we can progress through some form of multi-party agreement.

"The real challenge for all parties will be to put aside their political differences for the sake of New Zealanders' future economic and social security, and develop principles that are not negotiable.

"The issues raised in the PRG's report are worth discussing and I for one will be working through them over the Christmas break. I hope every other politician will be too," Mr Sowry says.
