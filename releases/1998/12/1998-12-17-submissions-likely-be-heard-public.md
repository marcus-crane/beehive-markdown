"Claims that the SIS bill will be heard in secret are wrong," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"It is very likely that all or most submissions on the SIS Bill will be heard in open hearings. That was the case in 1996 when Parliament last considered security issues. It is very likely that will be the case next year.

"These are important matters for New Zealand. The committee will make the final decision when submissions are received but early indications are that most submissions will be heard in public.

"The Intelligence and Security Committee will take a position on the format in which submissions will be heard at its next meeting in February," Mrs Shipley said.
