Health Minister Bill English today released an interim report into the options for development of hospital services for Wellington.

"I am releasing this report in the interests of good debate on the issue because there is wide public interest in it. However, I would emphasise that it is only interim and I am expecting a more substantive report on the options before Christmas," said Mr English.
