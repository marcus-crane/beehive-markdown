Foreign Minister Don McKinnon this morning expressed his shock at news that New Zealander Stanley Shaw and his three British colleagues have apparently been murdered by their kidnappers.

"We are still awaiting more information but if true, I am deeply saddened by this news," Mr McKinnon said.

"This is an appalling act and those responsible must be brought to justice. At this moment our thoughts are with all members of Stanley Shaw's family and the families of his British colleagues.

"We are working with the British authorities and Mr Shaw's employers to establish precisely what has happened."
