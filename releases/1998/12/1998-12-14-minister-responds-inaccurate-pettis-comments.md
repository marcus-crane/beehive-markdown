The Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon David Carter, today said Labour MP Jill Pettis had again shown her ignorance regarding the public comment process on the West Coast beech logging scheme.

"Jill Pettis is way out of line claiming we are hiding submissions from the public."

"We are expecting a written report on the submissions received on the beech proposals this week. I think the fact that MAF has been able to read and analyse thousands of submissions in just three weeks is highly commendable. This quick turnaround shows how seriously we are taking the issue, and the public comment we have received."

"Despite what Ms Pettis says, this Government has no intention of hiding the outcome of the public comment process."

"Unlike statements made by Jill Pettis, some of the public comment we have received on the beech proposals has been intelligent and balanced, and deserving of serious attention."

"I'm awaiting the final report with interest, and I intend to let West Coast people know as soon as possible any outcome which will affect their future."
