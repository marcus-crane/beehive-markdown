Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon, today welcomed the establishment of a new coalition Government in Cambodia.

"The formation of this Government is a very positive step for the people of Cambodia. I would particularly like to acknowledge the important role King Sihanouk played in bringing together the coalition partners," Mr McKinnon said.

The coalition reflects the outcome of last July's election, which was supported by an international observer group, including four New Zealanders.

Mr McKinnon said he hoped the new Government would mark a return to stability in Cambodia.

"The focus now needs to be on efficient administration and peaceful development in the interests of the Cambodian people," he said.

"New Zealand has helped Cambodia overcome the trauma of the recent past and to restore constitutional government. As a partner country in the Asia Pacific region, we want to continue to work with Cambodia. We expect that a new Government will enhance the opportunities for cooperation in future."
