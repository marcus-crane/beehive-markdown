State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall today provided further detail of the sales process for the Waikaremoana hydro scheme.

Last week the Government announced that the sales process for the power scheme will be passed to the new Huntly State Owned Enterprise if the Government decides to proceed with the split of ECNZ.

Mr Ryall said the Huntly SOE has been instructed to complete the sales process of Waikaremoana so that operational changeover to any new owners will take place no later than 30 June 2000.
