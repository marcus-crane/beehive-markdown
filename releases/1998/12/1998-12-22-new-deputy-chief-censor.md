A Senior Lecturer in Law at Victoria University, Bill Hastings, has been appointed Deputy Chief Censor of Film and Literature, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, announced today. Mr Hastings succeeds Lois Hutchinson whose term had expired.

Mr Elder said Mr Hastings has extensive experience in censorship as a part-time examiner at the Video Recordings Authority and as a member of the Indecent Publications Tribunal. He has also been the Deputy President of the Film and Literature Board of Review since its inception under the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993.

Mr Hastings has practised law and taught in various university law faculties. He was Deputy Dean of Victoria University's Law Faculty from 1995 to 1997.

The Chief Censor, Kathryn Paterson, last month resigned with effect from December 31 and a replacement will be sought in the new year, Mr Elder said. Until then, Mr Hastings will be Acting Chief Censor.
