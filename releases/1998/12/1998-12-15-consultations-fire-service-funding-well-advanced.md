Consultations with key groups over the funding of the Fire Service are just about completed and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, expects legislation will be ready for introduction in Parliament in the new year.

Parliament's Internal Affairs and Local Government Select Committee in its inquiry into the Fire Service Commission recommended yesterday that the government review the way the Fire Service levy is calculated and the service is funded.

"Officials are consulting with key groups over the choice of methodology which will ensure a system that is not susceptible to abuse," Mr Elder said. "It is a very complex area of law, made all the more so by the fact it's open to more than one approach in dealing with the problem.

"I hope to be in a position to implement decisions in the new parliamentary session next year and have secured legislative priority from the government."
