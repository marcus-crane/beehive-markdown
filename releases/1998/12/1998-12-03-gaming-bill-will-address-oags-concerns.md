The Minister of Internal Affairs Jack Elder has welcomed what he sees as an endorsement by the Office of the Auditor General of government plans to tighten controls of gaming machines.

In its report on gaming machine control by the Department of Internal Affairs, the OAG called for controls to be more effective and transparent.

"We are way ahead of the Office of the Auditor General," Mr Elder said. "The Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1977 has long been recognised as an inadequate means of controlling gaming machines outside casinos.

"A much more robust licensing regime is contained in the Gaming Law Reform Bill which will be introduced to Parliament in the next couple of weeks. It addresses many of the issues raised in the OAG's report."
