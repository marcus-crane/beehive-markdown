"Sixty-four community projects around the country have received a total of $100,000 from the Government's Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

The Fund, which is administered by the Department of Internal Affairs, is quite separate from monies set aside for the traditional commemorations at Waitangi and Government House, Wellington.

"The Fund was set up to increase community interest in Waitangi Day through community-driven activities, and promote greater ownership of Waitangi Day as a day of national commemoration for all New Zealanders.

"This is the third year the Government has supported community commemorations and it is pleasing to see there has been an increased interest in the Fund with 87 applications received, 35 up on 1997," Mrs Shipley said.

The grants made, which range from $500 to $10,000, support everything from educational programmes to cultural displays. "These grants will ensure that communities, from as far south as Invercargill to Kaitaia in the Far North, are able to acknowledge the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in their own particular community way," the Prime Minister concluded
