New Zealand's next Ambassador to the Republic of Korea will be career dipomat Roy Ferguson, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand attached great importance to developing its relationship with Korea which, despite the Asian economic crisis, was still New Zealand's fifth largest market with exports worth $750 million to the year ending September.

"I have no doubt that the economic reform measures being put in place will see Korea bounce back and our trade and economic relationship will return to its previous levels of growth," Mr McKinnon said.

The Minister noted New Zealand and Korea were also partners in several regional economic and security fora, including APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

New Zealand's chairing of APEC next year would result in a significant number of visits by Korean ministers and officials, which would further strengthen the close working relationship, he said.

Mr Ferguson, most recently Director of Personnel Division, joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1974 and has previously been posted to Manila, Canberra, and Washington, where he was Deputy Head of Mission from 1991-95.

Mr Ferguson will take up his position in April, replace Mr Gerald McGhie, who is returning to Wellington.
