"It is unfortunate and disappointing that the PPTA is pressing on with strike action. The Ministry of Education is prepared to talk but the PPTA prefers to resort to industrial action," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"There has been a lot of public posturing by the union and attempts to rally teachers to strike. I am still at a loss to know why the PPTA is so adamant about striking. The Ministry of Education negotiators are there ready and willing to talk about the issues that are concerning teachers."

Mr Creech said he was extremely concerned at the misinformation the PPTA is sending to its members to try to get them to walk off the job on Thursday.

A copy of background information that teachers in the Auckland region are receiving to justify this week's industrial action is attached.

"The information is not correct. The PPTA has misrepresented the Ministry of Education's position in pay talks. I take this very seriously. I believe that teachers have a right to know the facts.

"The PPTA's claim that a Cabinet decision was pending which could avert the strike is also wrong. The PPTA was told on Friday what the Government's position was and that there would be nothing going to Cabinet yesterday.

"Instead of all this effort being put into trying to convince teachers to strike, the time and effort would be better served back at the pay talks. The PPTA claims the Government has walked away hands over its ears. This is incorrect. The Government is all ears and wants to talk and get the issues sorted out," Mr Creech said.
