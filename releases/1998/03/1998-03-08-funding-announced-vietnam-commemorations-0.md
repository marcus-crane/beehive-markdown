The Government has agreed to make a grant of $100,000 towards Parade '98-Vietnam Remembered, a programme of events which will pay tribute to the men, women and families whose lives were affected by their experience of the Vietnam War. The funding will go towards the Event Parade and a commemorative service.

The announcement was made jointly by Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon and Defence Minister Max Bradford.

A further $200,000 in funding has been confirmed by the Lottery Grants Board. In his capacity as Chairman of the Lottery Grants Board, Mr Elder said further funding might be available from the Board.

Parade '98-Vietnam Remembered launches on ANZAC Day, 25 April, and will be largely held over Queen's Birthday Weekend, 29 May-1 June. It will feature exhibitions, seminars, parades, services, a programme for schools and invitations to special guests, including the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

"The Vietnam War is part of our history," Defence Minister Max Bradford said. "Whatever the controversy the war created, whatever the outcome, our troops acquitted themselves with professionalism. They came back to a country that in large part did not want to know.

"Their sense of duty and sacrifice, and the hardship suffered by their friends and families, deserve our respect and recognition."

Parade '98 - Vietnam Remembered is also to raise funds from corporate sponsorship and registration fees.

The involvement of New Zealand troops in the Vietnam War began in 1964 and ended in 1972. Saigon fell on 30 April 1975.

Thirty five New Zealand soldiers lost their lives, while another 187 were injured, many seriously.
