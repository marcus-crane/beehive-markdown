UK Customs' decision to appeal to the London High Court the January ruling by the UK VAT and Duties Tribunal that the New Zealand Dairy Board can send spreadable butter and Ammix butter to the EU as part of our WTO quota is disappointing, Trade and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

"A decision not to appeal would have ended the matter," he said. "Now it looks as if the Dairy Board has expensive and time-consuming legal work ahead of it. The board remains confident of ultimate success."

The decision to appeal also means that New Zealand will need to go back to our World Trade Organisation case against the EU on the issue. Dr Smith is talking to the board about the case.
