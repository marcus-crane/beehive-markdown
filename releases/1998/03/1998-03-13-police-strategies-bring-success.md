Reported crime fell over the last six months of 1997, Police Minister Jack Elder announced today.

In an address to a meeting of Zone One of Local Government New Zealand at the Auckland Town Hall, local body politicians were told of the success of Police strategies to combat crime.

Mr Elder had been scheduled to address the meeting, but due to Parliament being in Urgency, was unable to attend. The Northern Regional Commander, Assistant Commissioner Bruce Scott kindly offered to address the meeting instead.

Police statistics show there was a small fall of less than one percent in crime nationwide, but more significant falls in central Auckland and Northland, where crime fell by around 7 percent over the six months from July to January.

"This is a very encouraging result, and demonstrates the value of the community orientated policing policy," Mr Elder said.

"Another encouraging result is that burglary has dropped by 13 percent since 1993. This has not been an accident. It has been a result of the Police targeting burglary as one of their priority result areas."

Police statistics show that reported crime per head of population has decreased over the last five years, he said.

"While the total reported crime increased by 3.5 percent over the five years, the population increase has meant a lower level of offending on a population basis. I am sure this will be welcomed by all law abiding New Zealanders.

"The job of this Government is to ensure the Police have the resources to continue this downward trend.

"That is why they now have their highest ever staffing levels and their highest ever budget."

Mr Elder wanted to thank Assistant Commissioner Scott for attending the meeting, but regretted that a minority of mayors present objected to the arrangement, and he was unable to complete his address.
