The Minister for the Environment, Hon Simon Upton, will chair a meeting of Environment Ministers from OECD countries in Paris on 1 -3 April.

"The meeting will focus on the environmental implications of globalisation. New Zealand is engaged in an increasingly crowded agenda of environmental negotiations. The meeting provides a useful forum for Ministers from developed countries to take stock", Mr Upton said today.

Mr Upton will take the opportunity to host a special closed session for Ministers on the issue of climate change. "The OECD Ministers' meeting is not a negotiating forum", he said, "that is why it is such a valuable chance to discuss complex issues away from the formal and political United Nations setting".

While in Europe Mr Upton, as Associate Foreign Affairs Minister, will visit Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany as part of New Zealand's ongoing bilateral contact.

In Bonn on 31 March he will deliver a lecture to the Centre for European Integration Studies of the Rhineland at Friedrich-Wilhelms University on the subject of Europe and Globalisation - a New Zealand Perspective.

Mr Upton concluded, "the lecture presents a rare opportunity to reach an informed German audience on some of the trade and other multilateral issues raised by European integration and Europe's attitude to global trade liberalisation".
