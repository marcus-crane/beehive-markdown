Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the newly selected National Party candidate will be hitting the road the day after the candidate has been selected, taking National's message to the people in the Taranaki-King Country electorate.

"The National Party has a very positive programme for New Zealand's future and a strong record of past achievements to promote. I am looking forward to discussing and debating the local and national issues that are of concern to the people of this electorate," said the Hon Jenny Shipley.

"National's decisive programme will carry New Zealand into the 21st century. It is based on providing economic stability, promoting growth, lowering taxes, creating choices for individuals and families as well as repaying debt and working for success for all New Zealanders.

"Over the last eight years the National Party has ensured that New Zealand has enjoyed strong economic growth, low inflation, falling unemployment, and five years of Government surpluses. This is a record that no other political party can come close to matching.

"I'm keen to get out into Taranaki/King Country with the candidate. National is very clear about what it stands for. We have a forward-looking programme. We have a record of delivery.

"It is time for other parties such as Labour, which is long on rhetoric and short on policy detail, to start telling the people what they stand for, and not what they stand against."

Mrs Shipley and the candidate will set the pace for the campaign by travelling from one end of the electorate to the other.

The programme is:

10.00am Otorohanga Town centre walk

12.00pm Te Kuiti Public meeting at the Te Kuiti Club

1.30m Piopio Public meeting at the Rugby Clubrooms

5.30pm Inglewood Public meeting at the Inglewood Town Hall Supper Rooms

7.30pm Stratford Public meeting at the T.S.B. Chamber

"I relish the opportunity to debate the issues that matter to the people of the Taranaki-King Country electorate, in the campaign, over the coming days," concluded Mrs Shipley.
