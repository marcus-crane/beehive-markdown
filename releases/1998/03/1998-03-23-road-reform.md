Christchurch City Council's campaign against road reform is misleading in terms of impressions it created of the road reform process," Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson said today.

"The survey appears to have been selective in the questions it asked and neglected to address a number of important issues.

"The survey also appears to be trying to create an impression that the Roading Advisory Group's report is Government policy.

"The Roading Advisory Group's report is only a proposal, it presents a series of options. It is not Government policy.

"Never-the-less, there are aspects of the report that Government supports and is committed to. They are:

- Managing roads in a more business like fashion.
- Establishing a fairer and more transparent system of user pays road funding
- Maintaining ownership of the road network in public hands
- Ensuring the community maintains an input into the way our roads are managed.

"Over 13,000 submissions have been received on the Roading Advisory Group's report which are being analysed and will help  
inform the final policy options for road reform.

"Whatever options we take up, the road network as it currently is will be retained in both extent and standard. The Government has been absolutely clear on this point throughout the reform process," Mr Williamson said.
