Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry today confirmed he was investigating why some communities have not yet received their copies of the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility discussion booklet.

"Delivery of the booklets to 1.4 million households around the country was done over the last two weeks.

"Every complaint of non-delivery is being followed up by the distributor, and I am awaiting a full report on delivery from the distributors which I expect this Friday.

"The distributors have advised my Department that their regional survey showed a 98% coverage.

"Anyone who has not yet received a copy should phone the freephone information hotline on 0800 400 100 to order a copy.

"By calling the freephone 0800 400 100 you can also order translated copies in Maori, Samoan, Cook Islands Maori, Tongan and Chinese, order an audio tape of the booklet, and order a discussion pack if you are holding a group discussion.

"As planned, translated copies will be ready by the end of this week.

"The discussion booklet raises social issues of importance to everyone and it is vital that every New Zealander has the opportunity to have their say, so if you haven't yet received your copy I urge you to freephone 0800 400 100 to get one mailed out," says Mr Sowry.

The Minister urged the Labour party to engage in the social policy debate rather than to sit on the sidelines.

"The issues outlined in the discussion booklet are important issues that need to be debated, and I am heartened by the huge response that shows that New Zealanders are keen to participate in the debate," says Mr Sowry.

Ends.
