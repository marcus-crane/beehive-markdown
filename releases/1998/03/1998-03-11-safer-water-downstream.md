Safer drinking water from new regulations and legislation is intended as a result of two reviews currently underway, Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere announced today.

"Laws used to protect the public from diseases in drinking water are incomplete, outdated, fragmented, and occasionally inconsistent," Mr Delamere said.

This was demonstrated during the Auckland water shortage four years ago where existing legislation exacerbated existing problems and restricted the ability to remedy it.

This was also the case when the small local supply for Waitoa was contaminated with caustic soda. The extent to which some of the current laws apply to privately owned water supplies is unclear.

First to get started is a review of the Building Regulations for water supplies within buildings. These are being reviewed by the Building Industry Authority.

Close on the heels of the review of the water supplies clause of the Building Regulations is a review of the 37 year old Water Supplies Protection Regulations. A discussion document outlining different options and issues for review has been released by the Ministry of Health.

Mr Delamere said it makes good sense for these reviews to be co-ordinated to produce coherent, comprehensive, and seamless, legislation.

Consultation on a comprehensive review of public health legislation will start in three months time. The new laws would need to apply to the many private drinking water supplies in New Zealand, something existing legislation frequently fails to do.
