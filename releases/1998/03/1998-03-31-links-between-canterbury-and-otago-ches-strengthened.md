Health Minister Bill English announced today that links between the Canterbury and Otago Crown health enterprises were to be strengthened with the appointment of both CHE chairs as a director on the other board.

"Mr Ross Black, who I have recently appointed as chairman of Healthcare Otago, will be appointed as a director to Canterbury Health. The chairman of Canterbury Health, Mr Syd Bradley, will be appointed to the Otago board," said Mr English.

"Both Mr Black and Mr Bradley will retire from the board of Healthlink South.

"I am making these reciprocal appointments to strengthen the relationship between the two boards, which are the biggest in the South Island. It is important that the boards work together cooperatively in the best interests of people in the southern region.

"Similar reciprocal appointments have been made on other CHE boards where two boards need to work together closely and cooperatively.

"I am also pleased to be able to announce that the Healthcare Otago board will invite Professor David Stewart, from Otago Medical School, to be an advisor to the board. This reflects the situation in Auckland and Wellington, where his counterparts are advisors to the boards of Auckland Healthcare and Capital Coast Health respectively," Mr English.

Mr English said a few further changes would be made to the boards, but these would be confirmed at a later date. These would not impact on the opportunity for community representatives to be appointed to Canterbury Health, Healthcare Otago and Healthlink South.
