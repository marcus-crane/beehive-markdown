Primary schools have been given a huge boost with agreement to a new pay package for primary school principals, Education Minister Wyatt Creech and Associate Education Minister Brian Donnelly said today.

The NZEI and the Government have agreed to the final shape of the new employment contract for the primary principals the union represents.

"The pay rates of principals have been unified and increased. Principals of the same sized schools on the same employment conditions will have access to the same pay regardless of the age of their students. Performance measures that currently apply to secondary principals will also now apply to primary principals.

"In addition to the large pay increases, fixed term contracts will apply."

The $69 million package over 2.5 years means primary principals will get average base pay rises of 13%.

The new unified pay system will be based on roll numbers with pay rates for principals ranging from a minimum of $52,000 per year for principals of the smallest school to a minimum of $90,000 per year for the largest secondary schools. On top of this principals are eligible for extra grants of between $620 per year for the smallest school to $10,700 for the largest schools.

"The elements of the package will make a real difference for schools and for the quality of their leadership," the Ministers said.

"Despite the allegations and scaremongering from some, fixed term contracts for principals have one goal - to ensure that schools have the best possible leadership.

"There is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that principals play a crucial role in making schools work well. At the time they first select a principal, Boards choose the person best suited for the job. But over time the needs of schools and relevance of the contribution of individual principals can change.

"Term contracts give Boards the opportunity to review whether the person serving their school in this crucial role is still the best available.

"Principals are the leaders of their schools and are responsible for making sure our students receive the best education possible. They manage the school and should be rewarded at a senior managerial level. With the higher pay rates comes more accountability.

"Parents we have talked to want their children to attend schools where the principal has the incentive to perform. The new pay package recognises the importance of principals and their pivotal role in getting a school and its staff really humming," the Ministers concluded.
