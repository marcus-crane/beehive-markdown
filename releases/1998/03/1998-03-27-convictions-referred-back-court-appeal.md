The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today the Governor-General has accepted his advice that Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis's application for a free pardon be rejected.

The Governor-General has also accepted the Minister's advice that Ellis's convictions for indecencies should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for further consideration.

Mr Graham said that as the case would be referred back to the Court, he would be making no further comment on it.

Ellis is currently serving a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment after being found guilty in June 1993 of indecencies with young children who attended the Christchurch Civic Creche at which he was employed.
