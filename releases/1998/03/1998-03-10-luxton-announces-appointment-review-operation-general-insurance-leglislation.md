Today the Minister of Commerce, Hon John Luxton, announced the appointment of Coopers & Lybrand to review the operation of Part I of the Insurance Companies (Ratings and Inspections) Act 1994 and the Insurance Companies Deposits Act 1953. The Minister was required to make such an appointment by section 24 of the Insurance Companies (Ratings and Inspections) Act 1994.

Part I of the Insurance Companies (Ratings and Inspections) Act 1994 introduced a regulatory scheme that requires general insurers to obtain, from an ?approved agency?, a current assessment rating of their ability to pay current and likely future claims made against their policies. The Insurance Companies? Deposits Act 1953 requires general insurers to deposit securities with the Public Trustee before carrying on general insurance business in New Zealand, and prescribes financial statements to be filed with (now) the Secretary for Commerce.

Mr Luxton said today, ?The purpose of engaging Coopers & Lybrand to review of the operation of this general insurance legislation is to provide the Ministry of Commerce with an outline of how the Ratings Scheme and the Deposits Act have impacted on the general insurance industry. This report will then be used as a factual base to assist in determining what, if any, amendments are required in respect of the regulation of the general insurance industry?.

Coopers & Lybrand proposes to initially send questionnaires to organisations within the insurance industry and consumer groups. Coopers & Lybrand will also send a questionnaire to any person who wishes to comment on the operation of Part I of the Insurance Companies (Ratings and Inspections) Act 1994 and the Insurance Companies Deposits Act 1953.

Any person who wishes to comment should contact either Bruce Baillie or Karen Shuttleworth of Coopers & Lybrand (Phone: (09) 358-4888), or Chris Tindall of the Ministry of Commerce (Phone: (04) 474-2666) by 27 March 1998.
