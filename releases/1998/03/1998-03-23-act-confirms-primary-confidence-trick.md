ACT has all but confirmed their primary selection process is nothing but a by-election confidence trick, says Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters.

"Their field officer has said a decision on whether to publicise the results has not been made. This is nothing but a by-election confidence trick and a very underhand way around the Electoral Act which limits campaign spending to $40,000," said Mr Peters.

"ACT tried the same con in 1996 when they released a book by Prebble then claimed it was a best seller. Voters saw it as a cheap publicity stunt then and a way around the laws of the land, and they will see through the latest charade in Taranaki/King Country.

"If ACT is serious, then it should have built into its voting slips a space for voters to nominate an alternative candidate - as is the case in the United States. Then voters could nominate Mickey Mouse."

At least three of the four candidates will have signed a no disclosure agreement covering details of the selection process, said Mr Peters. "That is the way certain big business operate and that is the way ACT will operate in Government if they are given the chance."

Mr Peters challenged ACT to make the primary election results known. "Only then will voters in the Taranaki/King Country electorate be able to judge whether their vote was treated seriously, or whether they were taken for a ride."
