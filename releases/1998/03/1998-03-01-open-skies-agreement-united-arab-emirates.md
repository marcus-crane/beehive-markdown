Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has signed an open skies agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - New Zealand's first open skies agreement with a Middle East state.

Dr Smith signed the agreement, with UAE Communications Minister Ahmed Humaid Al-Tayer, as his first official engagement in Dubai today.

"Both New Zealand and the UAE believe in the deregulation of international air services in order to help reduce prices and lead to better services," Dr Smith said. "It made sense for us to reach this agreement which will give Emirates Airlines and Gulf Air access to New Zealand and Air New Zealand access to the Gulf should the market justify such services."

Dr Smith hoped that would be soon given the growth in trade, investment and tourism expected between the two parts of the world.

While in Dubai, Dr Smith also addressed key UAE investors and traders on New Zealand opportunities for trade, tourism, training, cooperation and investment, at a lunch organised to coincide with his visit.

Prior to the lunch, he met with the Crown Prince of Dubai and UAE Defence Minister General Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.

Dr Smith also toured the 7-star Jumeirah Beach Resort which is being built with assistance from New Zealand's Fletcher Construction, as well as meeting local media at a supermarket stocking New Zealand products.

In 1997, New Zealand exported over $75 million worth of goods to the UAE, mainly dairy produce, acyclic alcohols and sheep and goat meat. We purchased $61 million of exports from the UAE, almost entirely petroleum oil. The UAE has the second highest GDP per capita in the Middle East, trailing only Kuwait.

Dr Smith leaves Dubai for Bahrain tonight.
