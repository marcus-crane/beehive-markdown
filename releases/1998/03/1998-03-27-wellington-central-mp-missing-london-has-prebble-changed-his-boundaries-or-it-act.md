Sometimes Wellington Central MP Richard Prebble should return to his electorate urgently, if he is so worried about proposed boundary changes, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"The ACT leader should have nothing to fear from the proposed changes, unless he's afraid of real democracy and the 60 per cent of the electorate who didn't vote for him," Mr Peters said.

"Of course he's afraid because the wealthy areas like Khandallah, Ngaio and Cashmere have been carved out of his seat, prompting another mad outburst.

"Carpetbaggers don't last long, and Mr Prebble knows he's on a slippery slope," Mr Peters said.

"The trouble with Mr Prebble is that he only represents the Rich Upwardly Mobile People (RUMP), and he's threatened by a more balanced cross-section of voters.

"Instead of facing up to the decent folk of Newtown and Mt Cook, the ACT leader has high tailed it to London but, again it's unclear how Wellington Central voters will be enriched by this latest junket."
