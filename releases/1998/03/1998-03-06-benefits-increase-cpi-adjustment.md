New Zealand Superannuation and social welfare income support payments will increase by 0.83% from 1 April 1998 to account for movement in the Consumers Price Index, Minister of Social Welfare, Hon. Roger Sowry announced today.

The increase in net rates equates to the increase in the cost of living for the year to December 1997 as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

"The adjustment applies to NZ Super, veteran's pension and all income tested benefits such as unemployment benefit, independent youth benefit, sickness benefit and domestic purposes benefit.

"For example, from 1 April the unemployment benefit for a married couple with no children will increase to $245.56.

"The Domestic Purposes Benefit for a sole parent with one child will increase from $239.94 to $241.93 per week, and a single superannuitant living alone will increase from $208.79 to $210.52," says Mr Sowry.
