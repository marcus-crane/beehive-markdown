Business operators risked talking themselves to a standstill, merely because of the Asian crisis, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters said today.

Businesses must make the most of New Zealand's positive economic environment, he said.

"Key indicators suggest we have a sound economy, favourable to business, and they need to take advantage of that," Mr Peters said.

"We've got low inflation, a falling dollar, and continuing reforms that should further benefit exporters," he said.

"Last week, Statistics New Zealand reported a 3.8 per cent lift in exports to December. Exports to OECD countries were up 11 per cent and those countries take 70 per cent of all our exports. By contrast, ASEAN countries only take six per cent of our exports.

"It is time to recognise these positive indicators and view the future with more confidence".

Mr Peters said the Government would continue to maintain an active programme of reforms to maintain a competitive economy.
