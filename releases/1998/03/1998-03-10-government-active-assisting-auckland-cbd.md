Energy Minister Max Bradford will be in downtown Auckland again on Thursday to review progress on restoring the city's CBD power.

He also expects to announce a Government initiative for helping small businesses through the present power crisis and the aftermath.

Mr Bradford said the Government was continuing to play an active and vital role in assisting Auckland's CBD get back to normal.

Since the second failure of central Auckland's oil filled cables less than a week ago, this has included:

Facilitating the fast-tracking of an agreement with Tranz Rail, Mercury Energy and CEG Alstrom (the lead contractor) for construction of overhead lines along the rail corridor. This has reduced the time of the project from 10 weeks to 21-28 days.

Liaising with Transpower which is providing technical advice and assistance to Mercury Energy, particularly in relation to the overhead line. This includes Transpower reconfiguring the Penrose substation for the project.

Facilitating the establishment of a team of experts from Government departments, EECA ( Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority) Transpower, TransAlta, Southpower, Dunedin Electricity and four consultancy companies to develop a Demand Side Management Programme. This includes an awareness and information programme to provide advice and expert assistance on energy efficiency and conservation; a "buy-back" scheme to reward reductions in electricity demand.

Arranging for EECA to be project leader for the Demand Side Management Programme, and personnel to help implement the advice and awareness programme.

Facilitating an initiative to help small businesses through the crisis and beyond. Details of this are expected to be announced on Thursday.

Tourism Minister Murray McCully has been involved in liaison with Tourism Auckland and the Auckland City Council, while the Tourism Board has been working internationally to ensure the situation is not blown out of proportion.

Inland Revenue has advised that the power failure will be accepted as a case for remission from late GST and tax payment penalties where it is impossible for taxpayers to meeting filing or payment obligations.

Inland Revenue Department, Business Development Boards and Social Welfare Department's are involved in the Auckland City Council's "one stop shop" emergency relief fund at the Auckland Town Hall.
