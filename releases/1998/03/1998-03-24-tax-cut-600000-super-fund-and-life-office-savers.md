The Government today introduced tax credit legislation allowing investment income earned by superannuation funds and life office schemes to be taxed at the saver's personal tax rates.

Revenue Minister Bill Birch and Treasurer Winston Peters said the new tax credit system would ensure that low tax rate savers do not pay more tax on their investment income than they should. At present, this investment income is taxed at a flat and final 33%.

The tax cuts will be worth an estimated $30 million per year to these taxpayers.

'The working party which reviewed this issue reported that more than 600,000 low tax rate savers could find less tax has to be paid in future on their retirement scheme earnings.

'A saver with a 21% tax rate and $10,000 invested in a retirement scheme could, for example, receive up to $1600 in extra savings over 10 years as a result of the measure.

'That assumes the investment earns an average 8% a year, and the saver gets a tax credit of 12 cents in the dollar on the income earned by the fund, compounded over the 10-year period.

'The tax credit system therefore increases the effectiveness of the 1 July tax cuts by giving people more money to save. It helps them and the country as a whole to save for greater future prosperity,' the Ministers said.

'These measures reflect the Government's continuing commitment to reduce the burden of tax on ordinary New Zealanders. The same bill also confirms the lower tax rates proposed for 1998/99.

'The new legislation lets funds and life offices offer tax credits to customers after very wide-ranging consultation to ensure a workable proposal with enough flexibility to permit the industry to contain compliance costs.

'Now it's up to the industry to make these tax credits available to savers, as a significant tax cut on the earnings from that investment income,' the Ministers said.

'The legislation will take effect from 1 April, although it will not be enacted until mid-year. We understand the superannuation and life office industry will be contacting its savers about the changes later in the year.'
