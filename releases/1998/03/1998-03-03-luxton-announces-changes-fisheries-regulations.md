Hon John Luxton, Minister of Fisheries, announced today that Cabinet has recently approved amendments to a number of fisheries regulations. The proposed amendments were consulted on with sector groups during December and January.

The amendments will come into effect on 1 April 1998, with the exception of the amateur closed season on the Chatham Islands and the amendment to the Commercial Fishermen?s Levy Regulations which come into effect on 1 March.

The detail of the agreed amendments to regulations are outlined below.

Amendment to the Fisheries (Reporting) Regulations 1986  
The regulations have been amended to introduce new species codes for reporting purposes into the Second Schedule to the regulations. In addition, the amendment has changed the reference in provision 3 of these regulations from the Fisheries Act 1983 to the Fisheries Act 1996.

These regulations have also been amended to provide separate area fishstock reporting codes for the Foveaux Strait oyster fishery (OYU 5) and oyster fisheries outside this area within Quota Management Area 5 (OYS 5). Regulations now also include separate reporting codes for the Northland and Coromandel scallop fisheries.

Amendment to the Fisheries (Commercial Fishing) Regulations 1986  
Regulations have been amended to introduce a fee for the processing of QMS 17 forms. These forms are used by fishers to enter into and vary agreements which provide fishers with authorisations to take freshwater eels. The fee will be $38.00 (GST inclusive).

Purse seine net mesh sizes have also been amended from 50 mm to 40 mm for blue mackerel, jack mackerel, kahawai and trevally in order to prevent meshing of fish and consequent wastage of fish and potential gear loss.

Amendment to the Fisheries (Auckland and Kermadec Area Commercial Fishing) Regulations 1986  
These regulations have been amended to provide for a closure of the intertidal areas at KareKare Beach to the harvesting of shellfish. Localised depletion of intertidal fauna and seaweed resulted in closure of the beach in 1992. Monitoring of the area indicates that shellfish resources are still depleted. The closure will stay in place until such time as the shellfish resources in the area can support harvest.

Amendment to the Fisheries (Southland and Sub-Antarctic Areas Commercial Fishing) Regulations 1986  
Regulations have been amended to remove provisions which are considered unnecessary as the result of introduction of the Foveaux Strait oyster fishery into the QMS. The regulations which have been removed are: the prohibition on dredging during the hours of darkness; the prohibition on the carrying of dredges during closed seasons; and regulations imposing specific oyster container labeling requirements.

"43 metre rule"  
In addition to these changes, the Minister announced that following consultation with stakeholders he has decided to defer, at this stage, his consideration of changes to how the length of a vessel is to be defined in regulation. There are two key issues regarding the "43 metre rule"; measurement of vessel length and existing exclusion areas around the country currently extending beyond the 12 mile territorial sea for these larger vessels. Any changes to both these regulations will be considered along with other possible amendments being consulted on prior to 1 October 1998.
