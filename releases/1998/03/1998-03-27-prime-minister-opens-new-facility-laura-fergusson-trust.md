Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today praised the sense of social responsibility of those who voluntarily support the Laura Fergusson Trust in Auckland.

The Prime Minister this morning opened the indoor heated therapy pool which is the latest addition to the Greenlane rehabilitation centre.

The pool is primarily a therapy facility, but will also be available for recreational use.

"I commend those involved in the hard work of fund-raising for this facility, including the Laura Fergusson Trust women's committee and the Remuera Lions Club, which donated $100,000. A Lottery grant of $750,000 helped reach the total required for the pool," Jenny Shipley said.

"This is just a part of ongoing efforts to fulfil the Trust's philisophy, that the disabled should live, not exist.

"I applaud those involved in the Trust for their commitment, including the businesses that provide financial support. In particular Lady Mary Caughey, who had the vision to form the trust, has given her time and energy for more than 30 years.

"This type of contribution to the community from businesses and individuals is heartening to see. At a time when the Government is encouraging New Zealanders to think about and debate the contribution we each make to the fabric of our society, it is pleasing to see that a genuine desire to help others is still alive and well.

"Many New Zealanders feel the demands of our modern society leave little in the way of time or resources for voluntary projects. The stunning new facility I have the pleasure of opening today is an example of how even the smallest contributions can add up to something truly worthwhile.

"The Laura Fergusson Trust is an example of the partnership that has evolved between the community and the Government to deliver support services to disabled people.

"As more people are supported in the community the Government has increased the funding for disability support services in the Northern region from $4.6 million in 1993-94 to $18.7 million in 1996-97. Government funded home support services were provided to 6,691 people in 1996 - more than double the figure three years earlier," Mrs Shipley concluded.
