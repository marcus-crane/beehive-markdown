The Minister of Social Welfare today dismissed Labour's contribution to the social responsibility debate as nothing more than the tired old rhetoric that New Zealanders have come to expect from a floundering Opposition.

"Again Labour has failed to come up with any alternatives, ideas or new solutions to social problems. Their pack of pamphlets released today amazingly contain not one single policy idea.

"This is the same party that said you couldn't fit a slice of bread between themselves and the United Kingdom Labour party.

"Labour are urging New Zealanders to not take part in the welfare debate, at the same time as their counterparts in the UK are announcing policies which reflect New Zealand's current social policy direction," says Mr Sowry.
