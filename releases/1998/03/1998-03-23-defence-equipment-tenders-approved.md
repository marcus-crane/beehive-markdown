The Government has given the Ministry of Defence the go-ahead to issue tenders for a range of new and updated equipment for the NZ Defence Force, which was agreed as part of the Defence White Paper approved by Cabinet prior to last Christmas, the Minister of Defence, Max Bradford, said today.

He said the equipment included new or upgraded armoured vehicles, communications equipment for the Army, and updated avionics systems for the Air Force's P-3K Orion maritime patrol aircraft.

The cost of the re-equipment project will be funded from within the already approved $663 million allocation for new operating and capital expenditure over the next five years, and from Defence Force re-prioritisation and savings initiatives.

"The decision to proceed with tenders confirms the Coalition Government's commitment to a skilled, professional and well equipped Defence Force capable of serving New Zealand at home, in our region and around the world," Mr Bradford said.

"The Government's first priority for the Armed Forces, as set out in the Defence White Paper published at the end of last year, is to rectify the most critical equipment deficiencies," he said.

"This means equipping the Armed Forces so they can undertake the more demanding peace support operations, and improving the ability of the Air Force to undertake maritime surveillance tasks in our EEZ and the Southern Ocean."

Mr Bradford said the current state of the Orions' current sensors and tactical systems, for example, prevented them from effectively undertaking maritime surveillance at home , as well as making a credible contribution to international exercises.

"The three programmes are all high priority replacement components within the Defence Assessment," he said.

Mr Bradford said the APCs had been in service with the New Zealand Army for over 25 years. Major modifications had to be done in order to deploy our troops to Bosnia because the APCs were insufficiently protected against the increasingly penetrative power of small arms fire and anti-personnel mines.

The Army's current radios are obsolete and no longer compatible with those of other forces.

"The Government's decision gives the Ministry approval in principle to seek tenders for this essential equipment," Mr Bradford said.

"These tenders will then be carefully evaluated before final approval to purchase is given."

The evaluation will include identifying opportunities for involvement by New Zealand companies, Mr Bradford said.
