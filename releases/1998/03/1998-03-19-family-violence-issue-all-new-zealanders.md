"Family violence is the worst sort of violence as it strikes at the heart of the safest institution in the world," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today on launching the Maori Development Unit of the National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges.

"At the best, families provide the greatest strength, support, love and care to their members. But at the worst they present a real danger. That danger must be dealt with. family violence must stop.

"The National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges, and the many New Zealanders who support them, are to be congratulated for their work in confronting family violence in families and amongst Maori in particular."

"The new Maori Development Unit, set up specifically to target the increasingly high levels of violence in Maori families, is a valuable contribution to stopping family violence in our communities, providing policy advice, monitoring and assessment of services for women and children, as well as developing new services.

Mrs Shipley said it was of great concern that Maori women had a higher need for refuge services than non-Maori.

"Around half of the women assisted by the Women's Refuge last year were Maori and there has been a marked increase in the numbers of Maori women and children entering refuges throughout the country.

"Last year 5309 Maori children accompanied their mothers to a refuge or safe house."

The 1996 Women's Safety Survey also found that 25 percent of Maori women with current partners had experienced one act of physical or sexual abuse in the past 12 months.

"These high levels of violence within Maori families are unacceptable and the abuse and neglect of children is a major area of concern in our communities today.

"The Government recognises it has a key role in developing and implementing policies which address the safety and wellbeing of women and children," the Prime Minister said.

The 1996 Budget Crime Prevention Package provided an additional $11.7 million over three years for family violence. This package included:

The development of a Family Violence Resource Kit which has been sent out to all Safer Community Councils and family violence service organisations. It provides practical ways that communities can promote family violence prevention in their communities.

A contestable fund for the development of Maori family violence services.

Parenting programmes for Prison Inmates.

Personal safety training programmes for intermediate aged girls and funding for the Eliminating Violence in School programme run by the Special Education Service.

Funding for the development of specialist services for child witnesses of family violence.

Additional Government funding for Stopping Violence services and Community Based Sex offenders programmes as well as evaluation of these services and additional funding for the development of some rural family violence services.

Additional Government support for victim services.  
Other Government initiatives include:

The Community Funding Agency provides a total of $4.637 million for refuge services. Included in this is $3.6 million for refuges affiliated to the National Collective. The other approximately $1 million goes to non-affiliated refuges.

Two of the seven goals of the Government's Crime Prevention Strategy are aimed at reducing the incidence of family violence and addressing the concerns of victims and potential victims

The Government's 1996 Statement on Family Violence, which outlines objectives and actions to reduce the incidence of family violence. Good-practice guidelines for the co-ordination of family violence services have been developed to increase the responsiveness of government and non-government agencies dealing with victims of family violence.

The Ministry of Maori Development's 1997 report Maori Family Violence in Aotearoa has emphasised the importance of involving Maori whanau, hapu and iwi in developing solutions.

The "Strengthening Families" strategy with objectives to prevent at-risk families from entering into a cycle of disadvantage.

The Domestic Violence Act 1995 came into force in 1996 and provides for greater protection of victims of domestic violence. The Act provides for mandatory counselling for the perpetrator of the violence. Counselling for victims and child witnesses of family violence is also available under the Act.  
"The Government is taking these steps to attempt to reduce unacceptably high levels of family violence," Mrs Shipley said.

"However, Government does not and cannot have all the solutions. Individuals must also take responsibility for their actions.

"This is one of the key questions that has been raised for debate in the Code of Social and Family Responsibility discussion document.

"It is the responsibility of all New Zealanders to face up to the issue of domestic violence because its effect on us all, either directly or indirectly," said Mrs Shipley.
