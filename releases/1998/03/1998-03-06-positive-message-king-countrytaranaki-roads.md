Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson is to visit the King Country/ Taranaki next week (Monday 9/3 and Tuesday 10/3),as part of the wider road reform consultation process.

Mr Williamson will be discussing the broader elements of road reform and the proposals contained in the recently released Roading Advisory Group report.

"The roading system is the essential backbone of New Zealand as it delivers our export drive. It supports our economy, our businesses and our way of life," the Minister said.

"Road reform is vital because without it, our roading networks will fail in the future to provide the social and economic means, we need as a nation to prosper.

"The key messages I will be delivering while in the King Country Taranaki are:

The road network will not be privatised Communities will be involved All road users will keep the right to use roads There will be fairer ways to pay for the roads The current road network will be retained.

"New Zealand can be assured that roads will not be privatised and that keeping the network open is a priority," the Minister said.
