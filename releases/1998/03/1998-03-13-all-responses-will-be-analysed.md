The Social Policy Agency of the Department of Social Welfare will analyse all of the material on response forms of the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility discussion booklet irrespective of whether the responses come from a group or an individual, says Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry.

"Clearly if we have a much higher response rate than the ten percent we have budgeted for, then I will have to make a request to the Cabinet for further resources.

"The proposed discussion booklet is not a referendum or a survey. It signals the beginning of a debate to address the responsibilities of New Zealanders in relation to a range of social issues facing us all.

"This is the opportunity for every New Zealander to have their say on vital social issues and I urge people to read the booklet and fill in the response form," says Mr Sowry.
