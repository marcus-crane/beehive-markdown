The Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry says he is very encouraged at New Zealanders' readiness to take part in the debate on social responsibility demonstrated by over 50,000 responses to the proposed code received so far.

Mr Sowry spent this morning in Auckland viewing the initial analysis process that all responses to the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility are undergoing.

"Every single response counts, irrespective of whether you're a group or an individual.

"With more than four weeks to go before the 24 April deadline responses have been steadily coming in.

"The issues outlined in the proposed code are important and relevant to every New Zealander and it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to have their say.

"If you have not received your copy of the booklet, you can order one by calling the freephone number 0800 400 100," says Mr Sowry.
