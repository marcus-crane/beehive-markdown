"New Zealand remains fully convinced of the continuing need for the Multinational Coalition in the Gulf and has agreed to extend the deployment of its contribution to the force," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

Mrs Shipley said that New Zealand had very much welcomed the agreement the United Nations Secretary-General concluded with Iraq and its endorsement by the UN Security Council on 2 March. It is was important the Coalition forces did not disband prematurely.

"Saddam Hussein has flouted binding obligations in the past - that was why Kofi Annan had to go to Baghdad. We need to see that Iraq will comply in actions as well as words."

Mrs Shipley noted the acknowledgment by the Secretary-General of the crucial role the Multinational Coalition played in his diplomatic success. "That is why we cannot afford to relax now while Iraq's observance of this agreement is being established.

"The Government today agreed that New Zealand's contingent of SAS troops will continue their deployment in Kuwait until the end of April. They will continue to be part of the ANZAC search and rescue group with the Australian SAS. Any extension beyond that date will be considered at the appropriate time. " Mrs Shipley said.

"The Government has also agreed that the two RNZAF Orions which are currently waiting on the island of Diego Garcia for stationing clearance in a Gulf country, will remain declared as part of the Coalition force, but will be repositioned to New Zealand. Two personnel from the RNZAF liaison detachment will remain in the Gulf to work with Coalition partners," she said.

The Prime Minister said the Orions would be available for redeployment to the Gulf if necessary but by being based in Auckland in the meantime, they would be able to carry out domestic and regional duties, such as fisheries surveillance and cyclone disaster assessment.

"Following the agreement reached during the Secretary-General's recent visit to Baghdad, there are encouraging reports of Iraqi cooperation with UNSCOM inspectors in their hunt for weapons of mass destruction programmes. But it is still very early days.

"The Multinational Coalition has to remain ready to back up the United Nations Security Council warning of 'severest consequences' for any violation by Iraq of its undertakings. And significant inspection and verification tasks lie ahead. New Zealand's extended deployment to the Gulf Coalition will enable us to play a supportive role in that effort," said Mrs Shipley.
