"The people of Auckland will be asked to make a choice on how the assets of the Auckland Regional Services Trust will be used in the future," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters announced today.

The Coalition Government has decided a referendum will be held.

The Auckland Regional Services Trust (ARST) $1.8 billion dollar assets currently include its shareholding in the Ports of Auckland, Watercare, Regional Forests, the Americas Cup Village, Northern Disposal Systems Ltd and the Yellow Bus Company.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister say there is general agreement on three issues, and the following will apply across all options in the referendum:

The ownership of Watercare Services Ltd will be transferred to Auckland territorial authorities (city and district councils).

A grant of $10 million dollars will be made to the Auckland Regional Council for investment in regional and marine parks.

A grant of $10 million dollars will be divided between Auckland territorial authorities for cultural purposes such as investment in museums.  
All residents of Auckland who are on the local body electoral roll will be able to vote in the referendum.

The final detailed wording of the questions will be set out in legislation to be introduced to Parliament as soon as possible.

Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters say the questions in the referendum would be along the following lines:

That the Trust should retain all the shares and money and become an organisation to fund infrastructure in the Auckland region.  
OR

That some or all of the Trust's shares and money should be distributed to individual residential electors of the Auckland region.  
A follow-up question would then be asked, along the following lines:

If the majority of electors vote for asset distribution, then should:

65 per cent of the Trust's shares in the Ports of Auckland Ltd be distributed to the individual residential electors of the Auckland region, with the remaining assets going to fund infrastructure in the Auckland region.  
OR

All the shares and money be distributed to the individual residential electors of the Auckland region.  
Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters say the referendum will be run by the Auckland Regional Services Trust, which will also provide neutral information for voters on the options, without advocating any one particular option.

"The referendum will be binding on the Government. We have agreed to introduce legislation as soon as possible setting the framework for the referendum.

"The Government has also agreed to pass a second piece of legislation prior to the referendum being held, so that the outcome supported by a majority of voters can be implemented immediately.

"Members of the Coalition Government have put a great deal of time and effort into analysing the options for the future of the Auckland Regional Services Trust.

"The Coalition Government has concluded that this decision should be made by the people of Auckland themselves rather than imposed on them from Wellington. The referendum represents democracy in action.

"Those with strong views on the issue will be able to argue their case in public. Members of Parliament from both National and New Zealand First will be free to explain to voters what they think about the options in the referendum, but in the end it is going to be Auckland's choice. There are complex issues involved and it will be important for Auckland voters to consider them seriously before making their decision.

"At the end of the day, the Coalition Government has faith in the voters to be able to decide what is in the best interests of themselves and their city," Mrs Shipley and Mr Peters concluded.
