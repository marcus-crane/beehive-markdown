Though disappointed with the court judgement today, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said it had always been his intention to appeal the matter further, should he receive an adverse finding.

"If it is our law that parties can 'document whatever falsities suit their tax avoidance purposes' - the view of former Chief Justice Sir Ronald Davidson - then the highest court in our land will be required to state it.

"That is not a view of the law that has been applied to ordinary New Zealanders, including the overall majority of New Zealand business people, all of whom do their civic duty by paying their taxes.

"I will therefore be lodging an appeal," said Mr Peters.
