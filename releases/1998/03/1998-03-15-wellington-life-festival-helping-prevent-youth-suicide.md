The Lottery Grants Board will provide financial support for the Life Festival, a musical extravaganza aimed at promoting a positive outlook for the youth of New Zealand, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder and Youth Affairs Minister Deborah Morris announced today.

The organisers of the Life Festival are concerned at the rate of youth suicide in New Zealand, and are keen to do something that will focus on positive options - an approach supported by the Ministry of Youth Affairs.

The Lottery Grants Board's Youth Committee has agreed to make a $10,000 grant toward the festival which is scheduled to take place in Wellington's Civic Square and Town Hall on Thursday 9 April.

"It is great that a young Wellington woman, Rebekah Campbell, has led this initiative and is committed to helping other young people. The Ministry of Youth Affairs has also helped Rebekah source funding from other sources, including the business community.

"I salute Rebekah's hard work and dedication. As I have said before, Government alone cannot prevent youth suicide; everybody has a role to play. The Life Festival is an excellent example of the positive things that can be done by promoting positive life options and raising awareness of what people can do themselves to help prevent youth suicide," said Deborah Morris

The Festival aims to have 10 top quality bands playing, confirmed artists include Darcy Clay, DLT with Che Fu and Wrekognise, Head Like A Hole, Neil Finn, and Breathe.

"Events which promote positive messages to young people should be supported, I'm particularly pleased that the Lottery Grants Board has been able to help the Life Festival," Mr Elder said.
