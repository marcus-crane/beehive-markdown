Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters visited Tairangi School, Porirua today, as part of Alan Duff's "Books in Homes" programme for children.

Mr Peters said all children, regardless of race and socio-economic background, should be encouraged to learn through reading.

"As a person who grew up in a family of 11 children on a remote farm in Northland, I was able to share with the Tairangi school pupils my experience of learning about the world through reading.

"Books are not only a source of knowledge and learning but they instil in young people dreams and aspirations for the future," Mr Peters said.

The Alan Duff "Books in Homes Programme" has reportedly improved reading skills by 35 per cent, since it was implemented in schools throughout the country.

Mr Peters said whilst the Code of Social Responsibility was different to Mr Duff's programme, the motivations were very similar.

"The Code is not about preaching, moralising or casting personal judgements on others. It's about addressing the cycle of poverty or the prevalence of abuse that affects many New Zealand families.

"We can't turn away from these issues in some spineless hand wringing disavowal of the facts. We must address them now.

"This Code is about individuals and families aspiring for a good education, future prosperity and personal happiness.

"We all want those things for our children and we acknowledge that for some those things come easier than others. But, for most of us to make our dreams a reality, we must be prepared to make a greater personal and financial sacrifice.

"Alan Duff's programme of increasing literacy and reading standards is another key component to social advancement," Mr Peters said.
