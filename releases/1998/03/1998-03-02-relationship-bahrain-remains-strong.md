New Zealand's relationship with Bahrain remains strong, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith reports, following his one-day visit to the Gulf state.

Dr Smith met this morning with the Amir of Bahrain, His Highness Sheikh Isa bin Salman al Khalifa, and Bahraini Commerce Minister Ali Saleh Al Saleh.

"Bahrain was New Zealand's first post in the Gulf region in 1977 and we continue to have excellent relationships with its leadership and business community," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith told the Amir, who has visited New Zealand, that he wanted to see trade between Bahrain and New Zealand increase. In 1997, New Zealand exported under $10 million of products to Bahrain, nearly half of which were dairy products. Bahrain exported $8.6 million to New Zealand, almost all of which was aluminium.

In discussions on regional issues, Dr Smith expressed New Zealand's relief that efforts to end the crisis with Iraq had made considerable progress.

Bahrain is the base of several New Zealand businesses which are active in the region, specifically the New Zealand Dairy Board and one or two meat companies. Dr Smith had the opportunity to meet regional representatives of these businesses to discuss their commercial prospects in the region.

Dr Smith drives to Saudi Arabia this afternoon. Enroute to Riyadh, he will visit the New Zealand Dairy Board's Saudi Arabian joint venture factory in Dammam.
