A French study prize awarded to four New Zealand French-language students reflects the value of strong bilateral relations between the two countries, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said at a special presentation today.

The contest was launched by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the aim of uniting youth from different countries as part of France's World Cup Soccer celebrations. The competition in New Zealand was organised jointly by the French Embassy and its New Zealand partners in education, the New Zealand Council for Teacher Education.

Mrs Shipley said, on presenting the awards, that New Zealand?s links with France are warm and wide ranging.

"In business, tourism, diplomacy and people to people links, we have much to learn from each other.

"Language skills are a vital tool in enabling New Zealanders to successfully engage in international travel, business and in hosting visitors to our country. New Zealanders able to speak French are equipped to live work and travel with confidence not only in Europe, but also in Africa and in those parts of Asia and the Pacific where French is a day-to-day medium for communication. In addition, French remains a rich language of culture, literature and science.

"I am sure this talented group of young New Zealanders are well-placed to contribute to that relationship as well as benefiting from the skills their study will give them in future years.

The New Zealand France Working Holiday scheme, details of which are close to being concluded, will provide a further outlet for young people with requisite language skills to gain direct experience of living and working in each others country, Mrs Shipley said.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE AWARD  
The contest was launched by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Soccer World Cup theme, with the aim of uniting youth from different countries around a major international sporting event.

The object was to reward the best students of French in all the participating countries.

The competition in New Zealand was organised jointly by the French Embassy and its New Zealand partners in education, the New Zealand Council for Teacher Education.

There were four prizes to be won in New Zealand and the selection process was started at the beginning of the school year in February. A total of 90 candidates were interviewed. A New Zealand teacher will also be chosen to accompany the small group.

The winners will represent New Zealand in France. During their two week stay they will travel extensively throughout France and have numerous meetings with top ranking officials and journalists. They will be proud ambassadors of the quality teaching of French in New Zealand.

They will also see one quarter-final match, one semi-final match, the deciding match for third and fourth place and the final. They will also attend a party hosted by President Jacques Chirac at the Elysee Palace and will be guests during the 14th of July celebration of the French National Day on the Champs Elysees in Paris.

They will also be guests at the Paris Town Hall where they will have breakfast with the Mayor of Paris.

This contest has been an excellent opportunity to promote French Language and Soccer in New Zealand and New Zealand in France.
