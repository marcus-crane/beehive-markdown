Max Bradford, Minister of Energy and Labour, will launch "A Drive to Succeed" on Tuesday lunchtime, March 17.

"A Drive to Succeed" is a training package designed to help give drivers of heavy trucks practical information on how to drive safely and courteously, while also saving on fuel and maintenance costs. Sponsors include EECA (Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority).

Mr Bradford will be picked up from outside the front of Parliament Buildings at 12.30pm on Tuesday in an unladen 15-tonne truck. He will be driven to Shell NZ?s Seaview premises in Lower Hutt for the launch.

Mr Bradford will have an opportunity to talk with some of the drivers who took part in the training package video before the official launch at 1pm (speech notes will be available Tuesday lunchtime).
