The Minister of Fisheries, the Hon John Luxton, today announced that he has appointed Judge Peter Trapski to conduct an inquiry into a dispute between commercial and non-commercial fishing interest groups regarding fishing activity in the Tauranga Harbour.

The dispute is associated with claims by recreational fishers and local iwi that harbour fish stocks are seriously depleted, and that catch rates obtained by non commercial fishers are unacceptably low. The fishing method held responsible is known as drag netting, or beach seining, which has been used on the harbour at varying degrees of intensity, for many years.

The drag net fishers disagree with such claims, pointing out that they do not fish in the harbour over the summer months. In the remainder of the year they are catching mostly trevally, and only small quantities of the species more sought-after by non-commercial fishers like snapper and kingfish.

In announcing Judge Trapski's appointment Mr Luxton noted that 'The various local groups involved in fishing on the Tauranga Harbour have spent much time and effort in negotiations and in promoting their views on how fishing activity in the harbour should be managed. Over recent months Murray McLean, the Member of Parliament for Coromandel, has assisted by holding discussions with representatives of these groups to gauge whether a consensus agreement on management of fishing in the harbour might be possible.

"However, it is clear both to me and to Mr McLean that there remain major differences between these groups. Accordingly, I believe that the best way to break this deadlock is to invoke new provisions in the Fisheries Act which enable me to appoint a Fisheries Dispute Commissioner to conduct an inquiry.

"I believe having someone of Judge Trapski's capabilities and experience review all aspects of this situation will enable everyone with interests in this issue to have them carefully considered in detail by someone with an independent and 'fresh' perspective. I expect that the recommendations he is required to make at the conclusion of the inquiry will be a good basis for decisions I will then make on how this dispute should be resolved.'

The inquiry is expected to commence shortly.
