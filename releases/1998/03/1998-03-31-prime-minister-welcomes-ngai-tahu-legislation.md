Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed the progress on the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Bill and reinforced her strong commitment to continuing to work for settlements of outstanding Treaty of Waitangi claims.

Mrs Shipley says the legislation, which was today debated and referred to the Maori Affairs select committee is a historic step forward.

"It is a tribute to the Minister of Treaty Negotiations Doug Graham, Ngai Tahu chief negotiator Sir Tipene O'Regan and my predecessor Jim Bolger that we have made so much progress towards the resolution of historic land grievances.

"It is important to continue the momentum, because standing back and doing nothing is a recipe for trouble.

"Settlements like the Ngai Tahu will prove to be the key to Maori New Zealanders having an equal economic stake in the future, and in my opinion that will lead to a new era of optimism and opportunity for all New Zealanders.

"As a South Island MP, I have closely watched the progress towards this point of settlement of the Ngai Tahu claim, and I congratulate everyone involved," Mrs Shipley concluded.
