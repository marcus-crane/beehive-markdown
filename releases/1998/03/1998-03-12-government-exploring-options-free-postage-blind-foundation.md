The Government will work with NZ Post to explore options to continue the free postal service provided to the Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind after the current sponsorship ends in two years' time, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

'The Foundation's Braille and Talking Book Library provides a valuable service to blind people and the Coalition Government is concerned that the provision of free postage should continue after NZ Post's sponsorship is withdrawn,' Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall said he conveyed these concerns in a letter to the NZ Post chairman, Ross Armstrong, following a meeting with representatives from the Foundation earlier this week.

In the letter, Mr Ryall proposed that the Government and NZ Post consider a post-March 2000 contract to continue free postage for the Foundation under Section 7 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986, and the possibility of the Crown funding the service and tendering it out to postal operators.

'Mr Armstrong has confirmed that the sponsorship provided by NZ Post to the Foundation will continue until March 2000,' Mr Ryall said.

'NZ Post's management have agreed to work with the Government to explore the options outlined in my letter to continue free postage for the Foundation after the sponsorship is withdrawn.'
