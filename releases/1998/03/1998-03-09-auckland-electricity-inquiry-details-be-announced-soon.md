The terms of reference for the Government's inquiry into the electricity failure in Auckland's central business district will be announced in the next couple of days, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

Details were still being finalised, including the names of who would head the inquiry, he said.

At this stage an announcement was expected to be made on Wednesday morning.

"Meanwhile, the priority remains to get central Auckland back to normal," Mr Bradford said.

Details were also still being finalised on Government initiatives to help facilitate businesses recover from the power crisis, he said.
