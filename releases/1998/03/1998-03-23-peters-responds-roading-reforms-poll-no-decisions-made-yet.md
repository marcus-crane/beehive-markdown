Responding to a Christchurch City Council poll on the proposed roading reforms Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said the public had every right to express their concerns.

"But it needs to be remembered that we have taken the Roading Advisory Group's Report to the public in an attempt to consult with the people of New Zealand and obtain public input on this issue.

"If that process is going to be misinterpreted by certain groups arguing that parts of the Report are government policy, then the whole consultation process will be abused and misused by those same groups," Mr Peters said.

"It follows, and this needs to be remembered, that government is going to the public as part of a consultation process to assist us in coming to policy decisions, and at this time no decisions have been made.

"If New Zealanders want consultation, as I believe they do, then that process requires public participation in a mature, logical way, particularly from local government leaders," Mr Peters said.
