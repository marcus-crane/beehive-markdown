Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters has made good on his promise to award full war pensions to nuclear test veterans.

The decision applies to sailors on the frigates HMNZS Pukaki and HMNZS Rotoiti who were engaged in "Operation Grapple" - a British hydrogen bomb testing programme at Malden and Christmas Island in 1957 and 1958.

"Those sailors, some as young as 17, were exposed to considerable risk from nuclear fall out while observing detonations, and it is only fitting that we recognise the sacrifice these veterans made while serving their country," Mr Peters said.

"The Nuclear Test Veterans Association has said the risks of Operation Grapple cannot be considered a normal peacetime activity and I agree with that view."

Mr Peters took up the Association's cause after it approached him last year complaining about the inaction of previous governments.

The decision to award full war pensions will apply to veterans and widows.
