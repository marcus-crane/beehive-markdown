Landowners will now have much more certainty about their responsibilities to recreational users following today's passing of the Coalition Government's Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Bill, Labour Minister Max Bradford said.

"Some farmers had been restricting access to their land, such as for trampers and hunters, because they were concerned Section 16 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act made them liable for the safety of recreational visitors," he said.

"In a country that prides itself on our recreational use of the countryside this is a hopeless situation."

Mr Bradford said Opposition allegations that the changes lower health and safety protection for workers, and that there has been insufficient consultation, were completely unfounded.

"Workers are still fully protected under the amended Act," he said. "There has also been wide consultation, particularly with landowners and recreational and sport groups, over a long period of time."

Mr Bradford said the changes to the Act clarified the duties land owners have to people visiting their property, as opposed to working on their land, by introducing a "warning duty".

This means, for example, farmers must warn visitors of any significant or work related hazards, such as crop spraying in progress. The requirement to warn visitors does not extend to trespassers.

Mr Bradford said it was important to note that the amended act still includes "full duties" in relation to workers.

Full duties to mitigate hazards will continue to be owed to employees and contractors employed by the person controlling the workplace, and to people who are present for the financial benefit of the person in control of the place of work, he said.

Mr Bradford said that the Government's amendment was clearly understood and supported by farmers and recreational users.

"I have received letters of support from Federated Farmers and Transpower, two of the key groups affected by the change", he said.

Mr Bradford said OSH would soon be undertaking an educational programme to help farmers comply with the new warning duty.
