Health Minister Bill English today confirmed that when the changes to income and asset testing are introduced, people will not be asset tested if they are assessed as needing long-term care in a public or private hospital, irrespective of age.

"When the changes are introduced, all people who are aged 50 - 64 who are single without dependants and needing long-term residential care in a public or private hospital will have asset testing removed."

"Information provided from my office to Alliance leader Jim Anderton said that policy decisions on this issue had yet to be made.

"This was incorrect and I apologise for the confusion caused," said Mr English.

Mr English confirmed that the response given by the Treasurer to Question for Oral Answer No 5 on 24 March was correct.
