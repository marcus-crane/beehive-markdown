Minister of Employment Hon. Peter McCardle said he was delighted that around 5,000 job seekers were taking part in Community Taskforce Projects throughout the country.

This is an increase of over 100 percent on the last financial years average," he said.

Mr McCardle said there had been no evidence of displacement of real jobs under the scheme, despite the large expansion and participants were enthusiastic about the programme.

A visit to the Hawkes Bay last week confirmed that job seekers are involved in a large range of projects and are gaining new skills and retaining links with the community, he said.
