Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today announced that Cabinet has agreed to a series of reforms aimed to overcome some of the constraints to efficient resource use in the commercial fishing sector and improve its overall management.

"We want to build from and adapt the current managment system to ensure we are sustainably managing our important fisheries resouce in the best way possible," Mr Luxton said today.

The decisions that were taken by the Cabinet recently follow decisions made in principle by the Cabinet last November and submissions received on a Ministry of Fisheries consultation document Towards Better Management of New Zealand's Commercial Fisheries.

'In terms of the sustainable management of our fisheries the New Zealand Quota Management System has been very successful. It has enabled partial efficiency gains through secure tradable harvesting rights. However at present there are limitations on the ability of quota owners assuming greater responsibility for managing those rights. Such opportunities are constrained in part, by a lack of flexibility in the means to deliver required fisheries services'.

'The current regime is heavily prescriptive and centralised with all required services currently being provided by the Crown or purchased by the Crown.' said Mr Luxton.

The reforms that have been agreed to are:

\- an improvement in fisheries management decision-making processes through:  
\- the development of multi-year fishery sustainability plans which would replace the two existing annual processes required by law to make fisheries management decisions (such as the TACC setting process) and for determining the level of required fisheries services (such as research);  
\- aligning the roles of the Minster of Fisheries and the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Fisheries in respect of determining required services to match roles normally applying in the State sector;  
\- providing the flexibility for required fisheries services to be purchased outside of Mfish, subject to certain criteria such as meeting appropriate standards and specifications, the establishment of an effective monitoring regime and the adequate management of risks to the Crown, including the cost-effective delivery of services;  
\- providing for the registry function currently provided by the Ministry of Fisheries to be privately operated in much the same way as the Stock Exchange is, again subject to certain criteria.

'All four reforms will require amendments to existing legislation. As a result Dr Brent Wheeler will incorporate these agreed principles in his current review of the Fisheries leglislation. Following this it is expected that the leglislateve changes will be made later this year.
