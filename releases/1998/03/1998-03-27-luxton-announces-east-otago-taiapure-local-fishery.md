The Minister of Fisheries, John Luxton, has released the report and recommendations of the tribunal of the Maori Land Court into East - Otago taiapure-local fishery proposal and has announced that he has decided to accept the recommendations of the tribunal.

The taiapure - local fishery was first proposed in 1992 by Kati Huirapa Runanga ki Puketeraki, but processing of the taiapure was delayed by legal proceedings taken by the Fishing Industry Board against another taiapure proposal at Manukau Harbour.

After the Minister of Fisheries approved in principle Kati Huirapa Runanga?s proposal in 1996 a tribunal hearing was constituted under the Maori Land Court to hear objections and submissions on the proposal in June 1997. The recommendations of the tribunal were that the taiapure - local fishery should proceed, with 50% of the taiapure management committee membership coming from Kati Huirapa Runanga ki Puketeraki and 50% coming from other community and local fishing groups.

Establishment of the taiapure - local fishery which covers the inshore area between Waikouaiti and Purakanui north of Dunedin places the prime responsibility for management of the fisheries in the hands of the local community. The management committee, when formed, will work over time to restore and further develop the fisheries within the taiapure - local fishery.

A copy of the tribunal?s report and recommendations can be viewed at the Ministry of Fisheries Office in Filleul Street, Dunedin.
