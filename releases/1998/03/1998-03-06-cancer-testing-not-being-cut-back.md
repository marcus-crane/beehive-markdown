Health Minister Bill English said a headline in the Otago Daily Times today stating that cancer testing was being cut back was wrong and irresponsible.

"There have been no cuts to the amount of money being spent on the breast cancer screening programme. This programme will benefit the women of New Zealand and the Government is committed to properly funding it.

"Funding of $40 million was allocated to the programme when it was announced in 1995. By the end of June the Health Funding Authority expects to have spent $12 million on two pilot schemes, some extra treatment and screening services, plus developmental costs.

"The fact that money has been spent in advance of the nation-wide programme being up and running most certainly does not amount to a cut back in cancer testing.

"Possible financial issues in years two or three will not hold it up. If there is going to be a gap in the funding then the Government will have to consider allocating more money," said Mr English.
