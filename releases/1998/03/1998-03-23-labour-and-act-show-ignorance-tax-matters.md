Helen Clark, Michael Cullen and Rodney Hide have all shown their total ignorance of tax issues in criticising the appeal of the Winebox findings, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"Ms Clark and Dr Cullen have completely missed the point about the Winebox appeal and the need to redress historical wrongs," Mr Peters said.

"If a rape happened 20 years ago in this country, we don't ignore it. We investigate it and bring justice to the case. That's what we are doing in the Winebox appeal.

"An amendment to the law will not address past wrongs, and nor will it address Sir Ron's finding that parties "can document whatever falsities suit their tax avoidance purposes".

"That cannot be the correct view of the law as it stands, and therefore I'm appealing it. There's only one law for taxpayers and it cannot be bent to suit the needs of a select few as Mr Hide and his sponsors would prefer," Mr Peters said.

"Contrary to what Dr Cullen says, the appeal to Sir Ron's findings will not prevent Inland Revenue from collecting taxes from all corporates. Instead, it will confirm its obligation to do so."
