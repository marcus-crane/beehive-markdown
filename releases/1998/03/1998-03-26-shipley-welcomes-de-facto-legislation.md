Prime Minister and Minister of Women's Affairs, Jenny Shipley, says the Matrimonial Property Amendment Bill and the De Facto Relationships Bill being debated in Parliament today are a positive step forward.

"The issues dealt with in this legislation, of ensuring property rights for widows and those in de-facto relationships, are complex and it has been important to take the time to get these issues right.

"If a legislative framework is to be provided for same-sex relationships then a similar approach needs to be taken, of starting with a discussion document and public submissions.

"It is my personal view that it would be wiser to put the issue of same-sex relationships up for debate separately and independently, rather than trying to tack it on to legislation that only deals with property rights.

"Gay and lesbian people tell me that they have many concerns about the legal status of their relationships other than property rights. Issues such as who is named as "next of kin", and legal recognition of same sex partners in relation to employee or insurance benefits will not be tackled simply by including same-sex relationships in the De Facto Relationships Bill.

"I asked the Ministry of Women's Affairs in December last year to collect information about international approaches to this issue, especially from the Netherlands.

"I would like to see more public discussion, especially in the Gay and Lesbian community, about the options.

"If there is an amendment proposed during the passage of the De Facto Relationships Bill then the National caucus has already agreed that it would be subject to a conscience vote," Mrs Shipley concluded.
