Health Minister Bill English today launched Immunisation Week beginning a nationwide campaign to drive home the immunisation message.

"This year's immunisation week is significant because it coincides with a growing trend among doctors, nurses and other health professionals to focus on preventative health," Mr English said.

"Health professionals' are also forming new relationships to work together in the community, GP surgeries and hospitals so they can combine their skills and knowledge to better serve the people they see.

"Health professionals focus on prevention, coupled with this greater co-operation makes high immunisation rates for our children more achievable.

"The benefits of immunisation are clearly documented. Already in New Zealand the incidence of serious infectious diseases has been dramatically reduced by immunisation," he said.

"Last year's MMR immunisation campaign successfully controlled the measles epidemic. Instead of the expected 40,000 to 70,000 sick children, there were 2096 reported cases.

"However, there is clearly more work to be done to inform parents of the need to maintain children's vaccinations. Although most parents accept the importance of immunisation, less than two-thirds of children have up-to-date immunisations by the age of two years," Mr English said.

"This year's Immunisation Week is a joint promotion organised by the NZ General Practitioners Association, the Ministry of Health, Immunisation Co-ordinators, some GP groups and the Health Funding Authority.

"In the Government's proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility, immunisation is identified as one of the key expectations on parents to maintain their children's health. The Government's aim is to have 95 percent of children in New Zealand fully immunised by the year 2000," Mr English said.
