The Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today announced that Dr Brent Wheeler of Brent Wheeler and Company Limited would review the Fisheries Act, 1996.

Mr Luxton said today, "I personally have some reservations with the complexity of the 1996 Act, and its initial and ongoing compliance costs. One result of this complexity is the increasing, and on going cost of the Act Implementation Project.

"I have become increasingly concerned with some elements of the framework by which New Zealand's fisheries are managed, and the associated general compliance costs of doing business.

It is for this reason that I recently announced a review of the policy settings in the Fisheries Act 1996, focusing on simplifying its operation, ensuring efficient resource use, and if possible reducing compliance costs on stakeholders. I expect to receive the outcome of the review in the next 3-4 months.

"I am pleased to have someone of Mr Wheelers calibre who has considerable experience in both the Government and private sectors, to conduct the review of the Act. It is important for the sustainable utilisation of our fishery resource that we ensure the Act is as user friendly as possible. Mr Wheeler can now get underway with this important review.

"In the meantime the Ministry of Fisheries will be suspending work on implementing those parts of the Act that are subject to review," Mr Luxton concluded.
