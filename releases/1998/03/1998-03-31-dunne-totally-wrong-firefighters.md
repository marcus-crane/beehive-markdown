Peter Dunne is comprehensively wrong over his allegations 400 firefighter jobs are to be lost, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

"Mr Dunne's allegations are based on his claim the Fire Service operating budget has been cut. This is totally wrong.

"There has never been any suggestion the Fire Service operational budget would be cut."

Mr Elder said the Government had not required the Fire Service to run down its reserves, as falsely claimed by Mr Dunne.

"Mr Dunne does not appear to understand the statutory provisions regarding the levy in advance account, which is not a reserve."

The current high level of the account was due to Mr Dunne's failure when he was Minister to achieve a reduction in the levy rate with the result that levy payers were forced to pay at a higher level than necessary, Mr Elder said. The Fire Service Act requires the Minister of Internal Affairs to review the size of the levy on an annual basis.

"As Minister, I have taken the action to reduce the levy rate which has the effect of returning money to levy payers, which includes insured homeowners.

"Mr Dunne should understand there is no necessary connection between the rate of levy and the amount of money the Fire Service is authorised to spend."

The number of firefighters, both paid and unpaid, was a matter for the Fire Service Commission to decide, and the Government has full confidence in its judgement, Mr Elder said.
