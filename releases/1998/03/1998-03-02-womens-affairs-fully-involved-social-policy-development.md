The Minister of Women's Affairs Jenny Shipley and the Associate Minister Deborah Morris said today that the Ministry of Women's Affairs is actively involved in the development of Government social policy.

"The Ministry of Women's Affairs has been fully involved in the development of the policy issues which have contributed to the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility.

"The Ministry recommended that there be full public consultation, debate and discussion on the issues at the centre of the proposed Code, and the Government has taken that advice.

"The Ministry was not specifically involved in the development of the wording of the material which was sent out for public discussion. The material was signed off by the full cabinet, including the Minister of Women's Affairs.

"The Ministry will be fully involved in any follow-up which is likely to flow through into Government policy as a result of this public consultation.

"It will continue to provide high quality gender-specific advice throughout the ongoing policy development process," the Ministers concluded.
