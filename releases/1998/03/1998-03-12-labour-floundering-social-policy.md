Once again the Labour Party's answer to an innovative approach to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing New Zealanders today is just waffle, says Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry.

"It is laughable that Labour's welfare spokesman believes that the Government's discussion booklet on social and family responsibility clearly demonstrates the difference between Labour and Government on social policy.

"How can there be a difference when Labour has no policy? We are still waiting for their response to the discussion booklet, which Labour promised with much fanfare to the nation's media two weeks ago.

"Labour is showing its sad inability to cope with a Government tackling them on tough social issues and they are floundering.

"This is no wonder when Mr Maharey dreams of another academic theory called the 'intelligent welfare state' which has no bearing on the real needs of New Zealanders.

"The Coalition Government is not only thinking and talking about social policy it is taking action, and consulting with New Zealanders, offering everyone the opportunity to have their say in the debate on social policy," says Mr Sowry.
