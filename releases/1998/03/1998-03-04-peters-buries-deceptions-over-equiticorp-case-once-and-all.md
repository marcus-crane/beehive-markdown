Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters has finally buried the Crown's involvement in the Equiticorp case by dispelling misinformation spread by former Labour Ministers.

In answers to oral questions in Parliament today, Mr Peters said the Crown had never turned down offers to settle the case for less than the $268.5 million settlement announced in January.

ACT Leader Richard Prebble and Labour Leader Helen Clark had made assertions about the Crown's refusal to settle the case early.

But, Mr Peters said he had received advice from the Equiticorp statutory managers refuted those assertions.

"I have a fax from Helen Winkelmann, solicitor for the statutory managers, which reads:

"I am instructed by the statutory managers that they have never stated that if they had settled the matter earlier, it would probably have been $200 million less than the Crown is now paying.

"I also confirm that the statements made on Morning Report by Peter Watts were not made on behalf of the Statutory Managers."

"Signed, Helen Winkelmann.

"Mr Speaker these are the facts, and Mr Prebble cannot deny them, and he cannot hide from the mess he and his colleagues created when they were in Government.

Mr Peters also dispelled rumours the Crown could have settled the case for $90 million as alluded to by Labour Deputy Leader Michael Cullen.

"The figure of $90 million was suggested by Kim Hill in an interview with Peter Watts (a lawyer for the statutory managers), on Wednesday 4 February, 1998.

"In that interview Mr Watts stated he was not privy to any settlement discussions and I quote from the transcript of that interview:

"I \[Mr Watts] was not involved in the settlement process."

"Mr Speaker, assertions that the Crown could have settled for less than it did... are completely untrue and the facts prove it so, time and time again," Mr Peters said.
