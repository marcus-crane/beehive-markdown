Health Minister Bill English announced today that the chair of Healthcare Otago, Glen Dillon, was to retire from that position at the end of March.

"Mrs Dillon advised me at the end of last year that she sought to relinquish the chair at a time convenient to the Government and without disrupting the board from a business planning perspective. I agreed, with regret, to Mrs Dillon's request.

"Mrs Dillon has made a substantial contribution to the board and the company and it has now reached the stage where she is able to hand the reins to a new chairperson.

Mr English said the new chair would be Dunedin businesman and company director, Ross Black. Mr Black was a director of Healthlink South and would take up the position on 1 April 1998.

"Mrs Dillon has agreed to remain as a director on the Healthcare Otago Board for a further month to assist in the change over. She has also agreed to accept a position to provide advice to the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit during the Crown health enterprise business planning round," said Mr English.
