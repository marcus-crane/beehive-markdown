The Government has brokered an arrangement between Mercury Energy, GEC (the principle contractor), Transpower and Transrail to dramatically accelerate construction of a temporary electricity supply line to Auckland's central business district, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

"We expect the temporary line through the rail corridor will provide 120 Megawatts of power to Auckland's central business district in 21 to 28 days, assuming there are no further disasters," Mr Bradford said.

"Mercury will then be able to meet the normal CBD peak load of 150 to 160 megawatts from the temporary line, the two gas filled cables, generator sets and the Union Rotorua."

Mr Bradford said Transrail had agreed to close the rail corridor from Penrose to Newmarket to all rail traffic. This meant contractors would therefor have 24 hour, seven day a week access to the corridor for construction work.

"All necessary resources from the Government will be available, including Defence Force personnel and equipment if this proves necessary," he said.  
"Other measures to assist businesses to manage their way through the extended crisis are being worked on."
