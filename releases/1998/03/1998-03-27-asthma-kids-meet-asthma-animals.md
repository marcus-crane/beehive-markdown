Auckland kids with asthma will get a chance on Monday to see an orangutan, a chimpanzee and a baboon that, like them, have all got asthma. The children will meet some of the animals at Auckland Zoo who have respiratory problems and learn how veterinary staff manage their conditions. Some of the animals even use the same medication as the children.

Hon Deborah Morris, Minister of Youth Affairs, will help launch Asthma week with a group of children at Auckland Zoo.

Deborah Morris said, "Asthma is a major problem for young New Zealanders with one in five young New Zealanders suffering from the disease.

"Recent research into an asthma vaccine by the Malaghan Institute is exciting, but it is likely to be a long time until we see a vaccine that is safe for humans to use. While we wait for a vaccine we have to do everything we can to support people with asthma and ensure that others, such as teachers, are aware of what they should do if someone has an asthma attack.

"It is vital that we spend time teaching people to get their asthma under control, the earlier we get in the better. I hope that Asthma Awareness Week will encourage more people to look after themselves and raise awareness of the disease. The Coalition Government's initiative of free health care for under six year olds is an excellent step forward for treating diseases such as asthma," said Deborah Morris
