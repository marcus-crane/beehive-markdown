"New Zealand's reputation for world class excellence has been taken to a new level with the accreditation of four local wineries to ISO Standards," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Palliser Estate, Martinborough Vineyard, C.J. Pask and Vidals Wineries are the first group of wineries in the world to be certified to International Environmental Management Standard ISO14001:1996.

ISO14001 is a method of structuring environmental management and gives it credence by international auditing.

Speaking at a function in Wellington to mark the accreditation, Mrs Shipley commended the wineries for their innovation and excellence.

"To continue to do well as a growing export-led economy, New Zealand businesses need to focus on efficiency and how we can do things differently.

"This group of wineries is an example of what can be achieved.

"These wineries are leading the world in the development of an Environmental Management System, controlling the effects on the environment based on a system of continual improvement.

"In a practical sense, they are also proving that sustainable development is not only good business, it is also good for business.

"This accreditation is no small achievement and I am sure they will continue to benefit from their hard work and vision by capatalising on growing local and international demand for high quality, environmentally-friendly products," said the Prime Minister.
