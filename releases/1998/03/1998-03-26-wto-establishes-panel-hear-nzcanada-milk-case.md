Trade and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed last night's decision by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute settlement body to establish a disputes panel to hear New Zealand's case against Canada's special milk classes scheme.

"The decision means we will have a final ruling by the end of the year, hopefully one which demands the end of this subsidy scheme," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith announced in late December that New Zealand was exercising its rights under WTO rules to hold formal consultations with Canada on the special milk classes scheme. The consultations were held in late January but failed to resolve the issue, leaving New Zealand with no choice other than to ask the WTO disputes settlement body to approve the establishment of a WTO disputes panel to rule on the matter.

The United States was also seeking the establishment of a WTO disputes panel on the same issue and its application was also successful last night. One panel will be established to hear both cases. The three panellists who will hear the cases will be selected over the next few weeks.

The special milk classes scheme at issue enables Canada to subsidise dairy exports by making milk available to processors at reduced prices when it is to be used to manufacture products for export, compared with domestic prices. Under WTO rules, this is an export subsidy. While Canada is allowed some subsidisation of dairy exports, albeit at a reducing level, the scheme puts it above these levels agreed to during the Uruguay Round. Were other dairy exporters to copy the Canadian scheme, it would have serious consequences for the New Zealand dairy industry in international markets and would seriously undermine the WTO's export subsidy disciplines.
