"The attempt by Christchurch City Council to seek a High Court declaration against road reform clearly illustrates the Council's lack of understanding of the issue," Hon Maurice Williamson Minister of Transport said today.

"The Government is in receipt of a proposal from the Roading Advisory Group which contains a number of recommendations. This is only one of many options that the Government will be considering.

"The Roading Advisory Group's Report was released for public comment in December and drew over 13,000 submissions.

"However the Government has agreed on a number of key principles:

- New Zealand roads will not be privatised
- The current New Zealand road network will be retained
- Maintaining ownership of the New Zealand road network in public hands

"So what the Christchurch City is seeking a declaratory judgement on, is a mystery.

"As Minister of Local Government I appreciate ratepayers concerns about the level of rates and if I was a Christchurch ratepayer I would be concerned and angry at this waste of money in seeking a declaratory judgement

"I am heartened by the fact however that the Council agrees that changes are needed to the roading system. I look forward to clarifying this issue for the Christchurch ratepayers at a public meeting on Road Reform on Monday night in Christchurch to be chaired by Ilam MP Mr Gerry Brownlee," said Mr Williamson

The meeting is being held at Christchurch Boys High School Hall at 7.30pm
