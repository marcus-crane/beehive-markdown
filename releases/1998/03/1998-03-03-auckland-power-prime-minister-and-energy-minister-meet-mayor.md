Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Energy Minister Max Bradford are to meet Auckland Mayor Les Mills on Friday to discuss the power failure in Auckland's central business district.

Mrs Shipley and Mr Bradford will also meet the chief executive of Mercury Energy.

The Prime Minister says the Government is already helping where it can, in the following ways:

The SOE Transpower is actively involved with Mercury Energy on erecting a new emergency line into the CBD.

Social Welfare is looking at what assistance it can offer in the way of emergency benefits to employees, if required.

Inland Revenue has said it would accept the power failure in central Auckland as a case for remission from penalties for late payment of GST, PAYE and provisional tax payments.

The Ministry of Civil Defence continues to be actively involved with Auckland Civil Defence and the Auckland City Council in providing assistance and advice.

Defence Forces have been on standby to assist should the Auckland authorities declare a state of civil emergency  
"In addition, the Ministers of Tourism and Business Development are working with local agencies on a number of proposals that may facilitate business recovery once the power is back on," Mrs Shipley says.

"I have also instructed my officials to double check whether there is anything more the Government can do under existing provisions".

The Prime Minister says she is continuing to get regular daily briefings on the power crisis, and a pre-planned trip to Auckland provides a good opportunity to discuss the issues first hand.

"This is a very serious situation, and does have implications for the whole country, as well as just the Auckland central buisness district. I am being kept fully informed of the difficulties being faced by the businesses affected.

"The primary responsibility for restoring electricity supply lies with Mercury Energy, and issues of compensation are between Mercury and their customers.

"When I see Mercury Energy, I will be repeating my concern at this event and urging them to explore all options for assisting those affected.

"The Government shares Aucklanders' concerns about how they ended up in this position, and is determined to find the answers through a formal inquiry," Mrs Shipley concluded.

As previously announced, the Terms of Reference for that inquiry are to be considered by Cabinet on Monday.
