Trade and Forestry Minister Lockwood Smith is shocked that the New Zealand Forest & Bird Society has sent a submission to the United States Department of Agriculture attacking our biosecurity and putting our forestry exports to the US and thousands of jobs at risk.

The act of "economic sabotage" comes just before a San Francisco Court considers whether to reopen the US market to imports of forestry products.

"It is fair enough for a New Zealand NGO to take an interest in our biosecurity, which received a $20 million funding boost in 1996 and is arguably the strictest in the world as any New Zealander returning from overseas knows. But to send a submission to another government, attacking New Zealand's biosecurity falsely and unfairly, damaging our clean, green international reputation, and putting thousands of jobs at risk along with $100 million in export receipts, is economic sabotage," Dr Smith said.

"In July 1997, the San Francisco Court issued an injunction stopping the issue of new import permits, or the re-issue of import permits, for certain types of sawn timber, logs and solid wood products from several countries including New Zealand. The New Zealand Embassy in Washington is working hard for the injunction to be lifted at a court hearing on 15 May.

"However, it now transpires that the New Zealand Forest & Bird Society has sent a submission seeking to undermine our case. The submission provides a false impression of our biosecurity, does not include reference to the $20 million funding boost to biosecurity I announced in 1996, and reveals Forest & Bird's real agenda of opposing trade liberalisation.

"The irony is that were New Zealand's biosecurity regulations and programmes inadequate, it would be the forestry industry which would be putting the most pressure on the Government for improvements because it has more of a stake in our biosecurity than almost any other industry.

"And interestingly, in June last year, Forest & Bird didn't bother to prepare a submission when the Government attempted to consult them on our new Forestry Biosecurity Strategy.

"Even if its claims about biosecurity were true, Forest & Bird's action would still be reprehensible. One could understand, if we had lax biosecurity, Forest & Bird being concerned about imports to New Zealand but exports from New Zealand would be irrelevant to its concerns.

"The Forest & Bird submission puts our growing $100 million forestry export trade to the United States at risk, potentially putting at risk many of the 25,000 jobs in our forestry industry.

"What's more, because of the 70% increase in the radiata harvest over the next few years, New Zealand will have to increase our exports of wood products from 10 million cubic metres to 25 million cubic metres because our local market is not big enough to take the increase in wood. Expanding our exports to the US is therefore essential.

"I find it difficult to believe that any New Zealand organisation would commit this kind of economic sabotage."

In 1996, New Zealand exported $97 million worth of wood products to the USA, up from $2 million in 1986.
