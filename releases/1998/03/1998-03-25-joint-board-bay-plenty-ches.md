Health Minister Bill English and Associate Health Minister Tuariki John Delamere, announced today that a single board of directors would be appointed to both the Whakatane and Tauranga Crown health enterprises.

"The two CHEs, Eastbay Health and Western Bay Health, are not being merged. But we see considerable benefits for both organisations in having the one board. Both CHEs will retain their separate trading names," said Mr English.

"There will be real advantages for the people of the Bay of Plenty in having the two organisations working closely together because this will ensure cooperation at the clinical and management level."

Mr English and Mr Delamere confirmed that the Rotorua Crown health enterprise, Lakeland Health, would not be part of the new arrangements.

"Options for Lakeland Health working more closely with Eastbay Health and Western Bay Health were fully explored last year. At this stage we don't see any benefits in Lakeland sharing the single board, although all three organisations will benefit in closer working arrangements.

"Directors to the single board are expected to be appointed by mid-April. The five local councils in the area, Tauranga, WestBay, Whakatane, Opotiki and Kawerau, will be invited to nominate people for the two community representative positions on the new board," said Mr English.
