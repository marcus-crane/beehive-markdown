The Minister for Senior Citizens, Hon Robyn McDonald said today she was pleased that new legislation announced today by the Minister of Health, will provide greater protection and safety for older New Zealanders needing residential care in hospitals and rest homes.

"The residential care sector has for some time raised concerns over the differing pieces of legislation which are outdated and have required varying levels of safety specifications," said Hon Robyn McDonald.

"It is important that the Coalition Government makes this commitment to delivering consistency of safety regulations, and transparency of responsibilities to ensure better protection for older people who are, in my view, particularly vulnerable in residential care.

"I was very pleased with the consultation undertaken by the Ministry of Health when it released the Taking Care II discussion document. Community organisations dealing with older people responded with useful comments and my Ministerial Advisory Council for Senior Citizens also contributed to the consultation process.

"In the area of residential care for older people, it is essential that the Coalition Government consults and listens to the issues and concerns raised. The safety of older people is paramount and I believe that the new legislation agreed to by the Coalition Government meets the concerns raised," said the Minister.
