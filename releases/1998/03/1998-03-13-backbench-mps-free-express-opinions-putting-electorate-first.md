New Zealand First backbenchers were free to express concerns on behalf of their constituents, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said in response to Tukoroirangi Morgan's comments on the Government's tariff policy.

"New Zealand First, in contrast to other political parties, has always promoted freedom of opinion in Parliament," Mr Peters said.

"Our MPs are free to express their own views because we are a democratic party that believes in fairness and freedom of speech.

"It's disappointing that the Labour party doesn't share this belief, preferring to muzzle its more outspoken members."

Mr Peters said the New Zealand First Caucus would discuss the tariff policy further, to address the concerns raised by Mr Morgan, on behalf of his constituents.
