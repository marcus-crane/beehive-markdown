Less bureaucracy and speedier facilities at the border are essential for Events Tourism to fulfil its potential, the Minister of Tourism Murray McCully has told an international symposium of tourism ministers in Berlin. Addressing 60 tourism ministers and 300 delegates from 181 countries at the ITB (Internationale Tourismus Boerse), Mr McCully said that Events Tourism had "the opportunity for very significant growth over the next decade".

"For New Zealand, we have particular opportunities around the Millennium celebrations and major events. However bureaucratic red tape and slow facilitation at the border are major inhibiting factors. Governments have a real responsibility to simplify passport and visa requirements, and airlines could do a great deal more to improve check-in and processing requirements."

The Tourism Minister, who is also Minister of Sport, Fitness and Leisure, praised the way in which European Union countries had managed to resolve border facilitation issues.

He predicted that major sporting competitions, like the rugby union's 'Super 12' held the prospect of a boost for tourism but, he said, "we are being held back by lack of progress on border facilitation".
