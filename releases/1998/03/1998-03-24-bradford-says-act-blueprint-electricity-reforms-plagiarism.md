"If plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, to paraphrase an old saying, then the Coalition Government is very flattered by ACT's copy cat 'blueprint' for electricity sector reforms," Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

"All of a sudden we are hearing from ACT's Energy Spokesman (Owen Jennings) after months of silence," Mr Bradford said when commenting on ACT's so-called blueprint for reforms of the electricity sector.

"If the ACT party had bothered to read my speeches, and statements of direction by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the Treasurer, Winston Peters, they would have seen that the Coalition Government is determined to implement electricity reforms which for once give power to the consumers. The shape of the reforms has been clear for months."

The options the Government is considering are well known: further break-up of ECNZ, enhanced information disclosure regulations, structural separation of distribution and energy businesses, and ways to promote the early introduction of low cost metering and switching systems so that domestic consumers have real choice of supplier.

Mr Bradford said the Government's focus throughout had been to ensure consumers get real choice in who they buy their power from.

"This will involve significant reform, as we have signalled over many months now," he said.

"This will be the last chance for instituting major reform in the electricity sector to ensure we get the choice for consumers and security of supply that we can't get out of the present system.

"Who knows, even Mr Jennings may be pleasantly surprised by the Coalition Government's decisions."

Mr Bradford said that to pretend, as Mr Jennings had, that ACT's so-called electricity reform blueprint was "unique in its approach" was little more than pre-byelection self-gratification.
