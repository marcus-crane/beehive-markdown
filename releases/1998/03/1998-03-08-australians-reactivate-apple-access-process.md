Trade and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed today's announcement by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) that the Import Risk Assessment (IRA) process for New Zealand apple exports to Australia is being reactivated.

"That's consistent with the commitments I was given in Hobart on 26 February when I met with Primary Industries Minister John Anderson and representatives of the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Association," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith was also given commitments that the issue would be dealt with promptly and today welcomed the timetable for the process announced by AQIS. Australia has set 30 April as the last day for public submissions on the IRA.

"AQIS will now be able to make a decision by the middle of the year," he said. "New Zealand can be confident that if that decision is based on science, our application will be successful."
