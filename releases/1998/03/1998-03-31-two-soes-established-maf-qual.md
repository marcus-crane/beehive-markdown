State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith confirmed today that two new State Owned Enterprises will be established from MAF Quality Management (MQM).

Establishment of the SOEs was signaled in the Prime Minister's statement to Parliament in February and is part of the Government's ongoing programme to reduce costs to the primary sector.

The first SOE will provide front-line meat inspection services and other services to the meat processing industry.

The second SOE will provide tb screening and other services to the livestock industry, and quality assurance services for a wide range of food products.

The Ministers emphasised that services currently provided by MQM would continue uninterrupted. In particular, services providing emergency responses to exotic diseases and pests, such as the response to the fruitfly incident in 1996, will continue under contract.

Establishment boards for each of the new SOEs will be announced soon. The target date for the full establishment of the SOEs is November 1st.
