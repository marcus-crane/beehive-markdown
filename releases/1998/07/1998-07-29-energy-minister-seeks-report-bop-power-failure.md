Energy Minister Max Bradford said today that he had sought a report from Transpower on why power to the Eastern Bay of Plenty failed earlier this week.

Mr Bradford said he expected to make the report public in due course.

He said that given recent events, he had also invited Transpower's Chairman and Chief Executive to discuss with him wider security of supply issues for the Transpower network.

"Given the findings of the Mercury Inquiry, and now the Bay of Plenty failure, I am giving serious consideration to a wider examination of security of supply issues on key parts of New Zealand's electricity network," Mr Bradford said.

"Before making my decisions though, I want to discuss my concerns - the same concerns which I imagine many New Zealanders hold - with Transpower, ESANZ and major power companies."
