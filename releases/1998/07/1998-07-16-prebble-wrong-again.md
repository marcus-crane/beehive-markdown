Richard Prebble's claim today that the Evening Post's series on Wellington Hospital was the reason that Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters decided to visit the hospital were false and mischievous, Mr Peters said.

"I announced in a media statement on 12 June that I would be seeking a briefing from management of Wellington Hospital, which is what I had today as part of my visit. In contrast, the Evening Post series on the current state of Wellington Hospital started on Saturday 11 July.

"Given that ACTs policy is to cut public health funding by 60 percent, I find it hypocritical that he is saying that more money should go to Wellington Hospital.

"The Coalition Government's policy, on the other hand, is the wise expenditure of adequate health funding and therein lies the challenge for both Wellington Hospital and the Government.
