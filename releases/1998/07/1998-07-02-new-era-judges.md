The establishment of an Institute of Judicial Studies signals a new era for the judiciary, Minister for Courts Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech officially launched the Institute in Wellington today.

"The need for an Institute of Judicial Studies was one of the very first issues raised with me when I took over the Courts portfolio six months ago.

"The Institute is designed to enhance the quality of justice delivered in our courts by ensuring Judges are keeping their skills and knowledge up to date.

"There are real merits in ensuring that Judges have the right training and professional development to improve the quality of justice," Mr Creech said. "The Institute of Judicial Studies will improve co-ordination of continuing education, information and research services.

"Our courts, court staff and Judges, ike every other sector of the community face big challenges as we move into the new Century. The Institute will help Judges keep pace with developments in the law and judicial administration.

"I also hope it will foster an awareness of developments in the law, judicial administration and social and community issues," Mr Creech said.
