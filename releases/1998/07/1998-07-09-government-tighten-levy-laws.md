The Government will be moving quickly to ensure that all Fire Service levies due are in fact paid, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

The report of the Auditor-General on the adequacy of the current collection regime was released yesterday, and concluded flawed legislation made it difficult for the Fire Service to ensure the Fire Service levy was fully and properly paid.

"If necessary, I will be asking my Cabinet colleagues for a slot on the legislative timetable So that the recommendations of the Auditor-General can be addressed," Mr Elder said.

"However, even before the report was released, I had instructed the Department of Internal Affairs to investigate ways of tightening the existing regime to prevent any possible avoidance of levy payment," Mr Elder said.

"The public has the right to be confident all liable people and organisations are meeting their obligations to help fund the Fire Service."

Mr Elder said the Department would be assessing whether the recommendations made by the Auditor-General are feasible or whether the comprehensive and integrated reforms recommended by the Working Party on the Fire Service Levy, the Harrison Report, would be preferable

"My intention in directing the Department to begin work on the Auditor-General's recommendations is not to wipe out the idea of a longer term change in the funding mechanism for the Fire Service. Work will be undertaken on assessing the merits of the Coopers and Lybrand property based funding proposal," Mr Elder said.

"However, there is a demonstrated need to fix the current legislation as soon as possible."
