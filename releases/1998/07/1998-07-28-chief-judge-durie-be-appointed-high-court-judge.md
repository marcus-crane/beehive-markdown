The Attorney-General, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced the intention to appoint the Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal, Chief Judge Edward Taihakurei Durie, as a Judge of the High Court.

The appointment will be temporary in the first instance but become permanent when the next available vacancy arises.

Chief Judge Durie will remain Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal, but he will no longer be the Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court.

'This will, however, require an amendment to the Treaty of Waitangi Act which presently provides that the Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal shall be the Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court

'I have discussed this with the leaders of other political parties and the Minister of Maori Affairs intends introducing an amendment to the legislation.'

The appointment will take effect in October.

Mr Graham said by arrangement with the Chief Justice, Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, Chief Judge Durie will spend half his time sitting as a Judge of the High Court and half as Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal.

Chief Judge Durie was educated at Te Aute College and Victoria University of Wellington. He graduated BA LLB in 1965 and he was admitted to the Bar the same year.

Chief Judge Durie was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Victoria University in 1990 and a Honorary Doctorate of the University of Waikato in 1994.

He practised as a Barrister and Solicitor in Wellington and Tauranga until he was appointed Judge of the Maori Land Court in 1974. He has been Chief Judge of the Maori Land Court and Chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal since 1980.
