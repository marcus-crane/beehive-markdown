Minister of Finance and Revenue, Rt Hon Bill Birch, welcomed the passing of the Electricity Industry Reform Act today saying that it "was a further step in the Government's micro-economic reform programme which would enhance the international competitiveness of New Zealand, and ensure that the full benefits of electricity reforms would be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices."

He congratulated Electricity Minister, Hon Max Bradford noting that "The Bill is the result of extensive consultation with the sector, including ECNZ, the Electricity Supply Association, consumers and Trusts." Extensive work has gone into the legislation, however given the changing dynamics of the electricity sector, Mr Birch would not rule out the possibility of the need for further legislation over the course of the next eighteen months.

"Today's legislation largely completes the reform of the electricity sector which has included the split of ECNZ, the introduction of a wholesale electricity market, and the previous reform of retail markets. It will be a major contribution to a more competitive sector, and bring substantial gains for the New Zealand economy as a whole." he said.

Mr Birch acknowledged that for some Trusts and companies the reforms will invoke additional change, but change is necessary to achieve wider economic benefits.

"The tax provisions in the Act provide exemptions from stamp duty, and in relation to the creation of Mirror Trusts, gift duty. In other respects, such as depreciation clawback and distributions to shareholders, normal tax laws will apply.

Today's legislation confirms the Coalition Government's commitment to reform in the best interests of the nation, and the will to see it through" he said.
