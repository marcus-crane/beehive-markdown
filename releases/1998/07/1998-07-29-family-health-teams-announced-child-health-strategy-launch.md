Health Minister Bill English today launched a Child Health Strategy for New Zealand to the year 2010 and announced Government funding had been approved for three pilot family health teams.

"The health of most New Zealand children is good, but for a significant number it is not and we have to do better.

"We need to give children the best start possible in life and the pilot family health teams will help by reducing duplication of services and helping to identify children who are missing out. For instance, we want to reduce the number of children who start school with hearing problems and the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough and mumps.

"The pilots will be run by Starship Children's Hospital in Auckland, Eastbay Health in Whakatane and Healthcare Otago in Dunedin with funding of $500,000.

"Each pilot team involves staff from the hospital working with other providers such as Plunket, Maori and Pacific Island providers, education and welfare services, to improve services for children, particularly those with high health needs.

"This is the kind of service we want to see more of. People who look after children have to start working together.

"It is appropriate that this pilot is announced today at the launch of the Child Health Strategy, which is a major milestone towards implementing the Government's commitment to child health outlined in the Coalition Agreement.

"The Child Health Strategy aims to make real change by:

- preventing illness and disability rather than concentrating on treatment
- co-ordinating service delivery
- improving child health information
- developing the child health workforce
- encouraging research and best practice
- developing leadership

"New Zealand's infant death rate has decreased over the past 50 years, but it is still high compared to other OECD countries. Sudden infant death syndrome is the most common cause of death for infants under one year accounting for nearly one in three deaths between 1992 and 1994.

"Injury and poisonings account for nearly half of all deaths each year for children aged 1-14. Maori and Pacific Island children have worse health status than other children and the strategy directly addresses their health needs.

"This strategy looks out to the year 2010 and proposes practical and effective directions to deal with these pressing issues. Change will not happen immediately, but it is vital that everyone looking after children works together.

"Along with family health teams, other Government initiatives to improve child health are:

- free doctors' visits and prescriptions for children under six
- Family Start, an intensive home-based support programme for families who need extra help
- the appointment of a Chief Advisor, Child Health, within the Ministry of Health
- a review of all child health programmes
- the establishment of a Child Health Advisory Committee
- the introduction of a code covering child-resistant packaging for toxic substances

"In the last financial year $69 million was budgeted for free doctors' visits and prescriptions for children under six and $30.5 million was spent on well child services delivered by Plunket, Tipu Ora and others.

"The Government is determined to improve child health and we will create more new services, such as the family health teams, where there continue to be gaps," said Mr English.
