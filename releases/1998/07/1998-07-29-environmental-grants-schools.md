The Hon Deborah Morris, Associate Minister for the Environment, today announced environmental grants to 11 schools, totalling almost $15,000.

The grants from the New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund are sponsored by ACI NZ Glass Manufacturers to encourage studies which give young people an understanding of the importance and fragility of the environment.

"Equipping young people with the skills and knowledge to develop a clean, and healthy environment is vital in this day and age.

"ACI are committed to encouraging young people to value and relate to their environment, and I hope ACI will continue to support quality projects such as these, " said Ms Morris.

The Fund was set up in 1983 and has a national committee which helps decide on funding allocation for each year's recipients. This year the response was excellent, with over 60 expressions of interest from all over New Zealand.

"I am thrilled by the large number of applicants this year. It's good to see young people taking such an interest in their environment, " Ms Morris concluded.
