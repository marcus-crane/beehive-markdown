The Minister of Fisheries today presented to Parliament the Government's response to the recommendations of a report on the fisheries cost recovery regime by the Primary Production Select Committee.

"The New Zealand Fishing industry makes an important contribution to our economy, exporting around NZ$1.2 billion per year. It is vital that we continue to develop and manage our fishery in a sustainable manner," Mr Luxton said today.

"In February this year the Government announced a review of the 1996 Fisheries Act and its implementation. I personally have some reservations with the complexity of the 1996 Act, and its initial and ongoing compliance and implementation costs. The review of the policy settings in the Act, by an independent reviewer, focusing on simplifying its operation, more efficient resource use, and if possible reducing compliance costs on stakeholders, is due in the next few months.

"Details of the user charges for 1998/99 are currently being discussed with fishing industry members. They are based on a range of fisheries management services which were also recently announced. Although the levies have yet to be finalised, the initial proposal for an increase of $11 million in charges to the industry has been removed. This increase would have largely been driven by the costs of implementing the 1996 Fisheries Act, which process has been largely suspended pending the outcome of the independent review.

"These initiatives are positive steps towards reducing costs to the fishing industry. The Government has now responded to the Select Committee Review of the Cost Recovery Regime. This review has been helpful as we improve the overall cost recovery strategy for the fishing industry. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their work," Mr Luxton said.

In response to the Select Committee's review, the Government has adopted a number of the Select Committee's recommendations. This includes the treatment of costs over recovered in respect of the ?transitional? quarter as the regime changed to charging for activities undertaken over a fiscal as opposed to a fishing year. This over recovery, to some degree offset by under recoveries accumulated in preceding years, will result in a net reduction of $1 million in the levies charged to industry in 1998/99 as compared to 1997/98. More...... The Government has also acknowledged the concerns of the fishing industry over the basis on which it is charged levies and the degree where this may be inconsistent with other sectors of the economy. The Select Committee recommended that an immediate review be undertaken into these matters.

It is expected that recommendations on this issue will follow the work currently being undertaken in the contexts of the independent review of the Fisheries Act and a broader Government review of a consistent approach to user charges across the public sector as a whole. These recommendations should be presented to Ministers later this year.

The review of the Fisheries Act will examine the underlying principles of cost recovery including the avoidable cost principle.

In the light of these recommendations and the Government's longer term strategy for managing New Zealand's commercial fisheries, the balance of the Committee's report will be considered over time. Practical relief from the burden of government charges can only come in the context of a longer term strategy. Such a strategy will see increased responsibility for self management and devolved services to fishing industry participants.

The Minister noted that the Committee also made a number of recommendations to provide more immediate fiscal relief to the fishing industry via a reduction in cost recovery charges which it was claimed would be fiscally neutral. However, this would not in fact have been the case and was seen by the Government as inconsistent with a desire to treat the fishing industry on the same basis as other sectors of the economy.

"I am pleased that the work of the select Committee, the independent review of the Act, the review of the implementation of the Act, and the broader review of Governments charging are all coming together so that we can get the best outcomes for the sustainable utilisation of our fish resource and New Zealand.

"The approach of both the industry and of the Government is jointly to minimise the costs to the industry long term. This common approach will lower costs over time, while still ensuring the protection of the sustainable use of the fishery," Mr Luxton concluded.
