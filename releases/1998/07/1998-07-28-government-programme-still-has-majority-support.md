Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says New Zealand continues to have a majority Government, with the majority of the Parliament supporting its programme.

"United MP Peter Dunne has given me an assurance that he will support the Government programme over the next week. Consideration and negotiation over a more permanent arrangement will take place over coming days.

"The National-led Coalition also has the ongoing commitments of Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata MP Alamein Kopu and ACT to support the Government on confidence and supply.

"New Zealanders, including businesspeople, can be confident that the Government's programme will proceed despite the challenges posed by MMP," the Prime Minister said.
