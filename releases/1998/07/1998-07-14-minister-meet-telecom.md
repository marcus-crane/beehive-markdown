Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson and Telecom Chief Executive Dr Rod Deane will meet this Thursday to discuss the recent failure of the telephone system in Palmerston North.

"My meeting with Dr Deane was called Monday morning and is quite independent of the call for an inquiry by the member for Palmerston North, Steve Maharey," the Minister said.

"In fact Mr Maharey's letter was only received in my office today (14/7).

"I will be asking Dr Deane for a full report on the Telecom exchange failures and will raise other service issues with him.

"It is vital New Zealand has confidence in its telecommunications infrastructure for social and economic reasons, therefore it is essential we have a clear understanding of what's happening and receive the necessary assurances of ongoing service, " Mr Williamson said.
