Health Minister Bill English today launched a pilot project in which two Wellington doctors will be the first GPs to be given access via the Health Intranet to New Zealand's National Health Index (NHI).

The pilot is a joint project between the Wellington Independent Practice Association and Capital Coast Health.

"The GPs will get discharge information from Wellington hospital to add to their patient records. In turn, the doctors will forward referral information to the hospital which will avoid the need for duplication of laboratory tests.

"Avoiding duplication of tests and making sure GPs get fast discharge information sounds like common sense from the patients' perspective. People regularly write to me complaining of having to spend hours at hospital having tests repeated that they have had at their GP surgery. GPs complain about getting information from the hospital six months after their patient has been discharged.

"At the moment GPs can get information from the NHI, but it has to be done in person over the telephone and that is slow and inefficient for the GP. The Health Intranet, which uses internet technology with added security provisions, allows much faster access to information and that means better care and better service.

"The pilots will be evaluated after two months. When the pilot phase has been successfully completed and evaluated, the full Health Intranet will be progressively rolled out over an expected 18 months, to be completed in the year 2000.

"The NHI was set up in 1977 through the Ministry of Health's New Zealand Health Information Service as a unique identifier for hospital patients. Since 1991 all babies have been given a number at birth and numbers have now been allocated to 90 percent of New Zealanders.

"The Health Intranet is being trailed as a way of providing the NHI for all health care providers so they have access to the right information for the right patient at the right time.

"It is vital that information used via the Health Intranet is secure. Questions were raised about this by the Privacy Commissioner earlier this year and in response to that the NZHIS commissioned a Privacy Impact Assessment on the Health Intranet Project.

"That report was released last week and its recommendations have been acted on or are being considered.

"The Privacy Commissioner has praised the report, noting that it is the first time an independent and objective health privacy impact assessment had been commissioned with a view to its being published," said Mr English.
