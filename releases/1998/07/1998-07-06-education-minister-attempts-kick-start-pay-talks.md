Education Minister Wyatt Creech made public today that last Friday he contacted the PPTA directly to appeal to them to begin the teacher pay negotiations immediately in the interests of all concerned.

"The Government wants to see this matter settled," Mr Creech said. "The money is allocated. Teachers are missing out.

"I took this personal initiative as a step on my part to try to break the deadlock and get these talks going as soon as possible."

Mr Creech said he was very disappointed that the PPTA had responded to his approach by almost immediately making a public statement that a complaint had been laid with the Human Rights Commission claiming he had breached teachers' human rights.

"During my phone conversation not a word of what they were doing was disclosed," Mr Creech said.

"The complaint is complete nonsense. I already know from a very similar complaint made by an organisation with similar views to the PPTA that the Human Rights Commission will reject the claim.

"I have never said that the PPTA should stop opposing bulk funding. What I have said is that we will not talk while the PPTA leadership is threatening, orchestrating or carrying out industrial action.

"I had not intended to publicise my initiative, but this unconstructive reply from the PPTA leadership has led me to the view that I should publicise the move so that the rest of the sector, teachers at the grassroots and trustees and parents, know that I am trying to get talks going."

Mr Creech said he had approached the PPTA leadership to point out that he had won a significant pool of funds from Cabinet to finance the offer that has been approved for the Ministry of Education to put before secondary teachers.

"Given recent economic developments, this offer will be seen as generous.

"The Ministry of Education remains ready and willing to put its offer on the table," Mr Creech said. "The goodwill from the Government is more than evident, it is time for the PPTA to show similar goodwill."
