Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has welcomed UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's announcement that all political prisoners in Nigeria were to be released.

Kofi Annan, after discussions with new Nigerian leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar, said Nigeria's military government would release all political prisoners, including prominent detainee Moshood Abiola.

"It is very encouraging to hear that all political prisoners are to be released, and that the release of Moshood Abiola is imminent. Although there has not been any mention yet of a date for Moshood Abiola's release, an announcement is expected to be made soon" Mr McKinnon said.

"It's quite evident now that General Abubakar is committed to improving relations between Nigeria and the international community. I hope this reflects also a determination to move towards democratic rule. The position of political detainees is fundamentally linked to the credibility of Nigeria?s reform programme, and their release and ability to operate freely politically is an essential element of that" Mr McKinnon said.

"The important thing now is for Nigeria to be able to go through a transition process so that free and fair elections can be held which will reflect the will of the Nigerian people. I welcome Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Anyaoku's announcement that General Abdulsalam Abubakar sees a role for the Commonwealth in restoring democracy to Nigeria".

Mr McKinnon is the Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) which was formed after the Auckland CHOGM to monitor Commonwealth countries', including Nigeria's, compliance with the principles of democacy and human rights enshrined in the 1991 Harare Declaration.
