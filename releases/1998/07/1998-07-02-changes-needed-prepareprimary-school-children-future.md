Primary school principals have been given a clear message today that the Government's proposed assessment of primary school children is needed to improve academic achievement.

Education Minister Wyatt Creech has told the New Zealand Principals' Federation Annual Conference in Palmerston North that fighting fires in the education sector was a thing of the past, and the focus was now on getting better results for young people.

"Improving student academic achievement is by far the most important and fundamental issue for our schooling system. The national assessment proposals are at the heart of this.

"There will be those who say they are convinced their teaching programmes are good and because testing programmes will only show that, they are unnecessary. The Government wants more accountability than that, objective checks are required to ensure that teaching programmes are working for the young people concerned."

Mr Creech reiterated that the assessment package did not advocate league tables.

"The Government will not be publishing league tables. The information which is proposed to be collected would not rationally support the publication of any comparison between schools because it is too narrow and limited."

Mr Creech also explained progress with the Information Technology Strategy for Schools.

"Information Technology in our schools does not lie in the New Zealand Ministry of Education policy section. We need to bring in outside ideas. The Ministry of Education has now formed a Reference Group with people both from the education sector, the Government sector and the private sector who have made commitments and have knowledge in this area.

"The reference group will liase with those in the sector to help formulate an Information Technology Strategy to come out later this year."
