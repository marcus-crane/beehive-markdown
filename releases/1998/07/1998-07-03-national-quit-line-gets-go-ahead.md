Health Minister Bill English announced today that funding had been approved for a national quit-smoking line.

Mr English told the Public Health Association Conference in Christchurch today that the Health Funding Authority would spend $600,000 on the line and that it was likely to be up and running by early next year.

"National quit lines have been proven to work overseas. People can call in on a free-phone line and are offered an information pack on stopping smoking as well as someone to talk things through with if needed.

"The main benefit from the line is in helping people get ready to quit by giving them the information they need about how to quit, helping them prepare mentally, setting a date, and being aware of likely side-effects when they give up," he said.

Mr English told the conference that this programme was one of three major public health initiatives the Government had undertaken this year.

"The mental health destigmatisation campaign, which is being run by the Ministry of Health, is a significant public health initiative. I hope it will be successful in changing people's attitudes about how they treat those with mental illness.

"Public health legislation in this country is also to be totally re-written. This will involve a major overhaul of existing legislation and will improve, promote and protect public health.

"Public health initiatives must become part of the everyday health services people use. We can make significant improvements in the health of our communities if every GP, every nurse, and every health worker understands how they can contribute. Public health goals are too important to be kept separate from day-to-day services.

"Funding currently designated for public health initiatives will stay in place. What I want to see is the ideas that drive public health embedded in everything we do," he said.
