"New Zealand is providing additional financial support for the programme to wind back North Korea's nuclear weapons potential," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

"Our contribution of $500,000 will go to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO)," the Minister said.

KEDO is building light water reactors in North Korea to replace that country's older graphite-moderated types, which are capable of producing material which can be used in nuclear weapons. New Zealand's funds are used to purchase oil for North Korea as an alternative fuel source until the new reactors are ready.

"KEDO is helping to avert on the Korean peninsula the kind of nuclear development programme that has been pursued by India and Pakistan. Wide international support for this effort is essential."

"This is New Zealand's fifth contribution to KEDO, bringing our total support to $2.5 million. I wish to record New Zealand's continuing backing for KEDO, and to applaud the efforts of the US, South Korea and Japan to bring the KEDO project to completion," the Minister concluded.

Concerns that North Korea was using its graphite-moderated reactors to produce nuclear weapons material sparked a crisis in 1994 that led to the establishment of KEDO by the US, South Korea and Japan. Other countries providing funds to KEDO include Australia, Canada and the EU.
