Health Minister Bill English said today that the Government had instructed the Crown Law office to discuss a settlement proposal with a group of Hepatitis C claimants.

Details of the proposal would remain confidential at this stage, he said.

"The Government wishes to resolve this issue. Crown Law has now been instructed to make a settlement proposal to the claimants' solicitors.

"Details of the proposal and possible compensation will not be made public until settlement is reached," he said.
