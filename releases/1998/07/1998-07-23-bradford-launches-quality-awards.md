Business Development Minister Max Bradford today encouraged New Zealand businesses to get behind the 1998 Business Development Quality Awards at their launch in Wellington this evening.

The Awards, open to any public or private sector New Zealand organisation, promote the principles of business excellence and quality management while also recognising the year's success stories.

"One of the very real benefits of the Awards is that they encourage businesses to adopt up-to-date quality management techniques," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said that as part of the Awards the Ministry of Commerce is running a series of workshops to allow potential applicants the opportunity to learn more about the Awards criteria.

"Last year's winners, Mountain Air and the Regulatory Group of the Hamilton City Council are both first class examples of what can be achieved," said Mr Bradford.

Representatives of the Award winners will be invited to attend a study programme with similar winners of the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Awards in the United States.

Public Sector Guidelines had also been released and Mr Bradford noted that it was pleasing that the Public Sector had also recognised the benefits of quality management and business excellence.

Applications close on 7 September 1998, with the Awards being presented  
in late November. Application booklets are available from the Ministry of  
Commerce, Fax 04 4712658.
