Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder today welcomed the release of the Auditor-General's report on the collection of Fire Service levies.

"The report finally rebuts the baseless claims by opposition members of Parliament who have alleged impropriety by the present Commission over the collection of levies.

"The conspiracy theorists have yet again got nowhere with their wild allegations. They have been peddling the same fantasies for 18 months and have absolutely nothing to show for their vindictive personal attacks on members of the Commission," Mr Elder said.

"In particular, it has been alleged by the Opposition and members of the previous Commission that the termination of a contract with Coopers and Lybrand to review possible levy avoidance was to "please big-business mates".

In vivid contrast, the Auditor-General's report states:

"We are satisfied that the engagement was concluded for good reasons. The Commission had completed its planned programme for that period and took the view that key issues needed to be addressed before more audits of brokers or insurance companies were undertaken.

The report also cast doubt on the judgement of the previous commission in this matter, Mr Elder said.

"The former members of the Commission told us that they believed the engagement should have continued. However, the new Commission took the view that, until guidelines could be issued on the meaning of 'fair and reasonable indemnity value', further audit work would be impractical because of the lack of any 'standard' to audit against. We believe that judgement to have been appropriate, in that an audit programme was being developed by the audit manager."

The Auditor-General noted a lack of guidance for insurance companies and brokers from the previous Commission on how a 'fair and reasonable indemnity value' should be calculated, saying this would have been expected.

The report notes the current Commission reconsidered the possibility of guidelines, and issued a directive following the decrease of the Fire Service levy rate in March 1998.

Mr Elder said this Commission was the first to face up to the difficult task of creating guidelines, which will substantially reduce uncertainty on the appropriate practices for collecting the Fire Service levy.

"The members of the Commission are to be congratulated for their pro-active approach," the Minister said.

The Auditor-General also recommended the Commission continues implementing its risk profile and audit programme. The Commission has been encouraged to explore new ways of obtaining information for insurance companies and brokers in an effort to make sure the amount on which the levy is determined is correct.

"With the opposition charges having yet again been proved without foundation, it is interesting to note the three worst offenders are now clamouring to be on the select committee which is considering the so-called 'evidence' they have submitted."
