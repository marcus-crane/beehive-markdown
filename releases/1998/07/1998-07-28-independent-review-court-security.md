The Minister for Courts announced today that former Deputy Secretary of Justice, Mr Mel Smith, will carry out an independent review of court security.

The review follows the fatal stabbing at Palmerston North District Court on Friday.

"I have sought the independent review to ensure that the Department for Courts is doing everything practicable for the safety and security of the people use the court system," Mr Creech said.

The review will:

- review the current security arrangements the Department for Courts has in place for Court operations
- test those arrangements in the light of the Palmerston North incident;
- review existing proposals for improved security
- recommend any improvements that should/could be implemented immediately and any longer term issues to be addressed together with recommendations for progressing them.

The review is expected to be completed within a month.

"Former Deputy Secretary Mel Smith was responsible for Penal Operations in the former Justice Department. He spent early parts of his career in Courts and has an excellence working knowledge of their operations," Mr Creech concluded.
