The Lottery Grants Board has helped secure the purchase of an extremely significant William Hodges painting, Board chairman and Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

The Southland Museum and Art Gallery was given a $300,000 Lottery grant in June to buy the painting, 'A Maori before a Waterfall in Dusky Bay', from its English owners and bring it to New Zealand. The purchase price was 170,000 British pounds, with The Southland Community Trust and the Invercargill Licensing Trust also contributing funds.

William Hodges was the artist on board Captain James Cook's ship 'Resolution' which embarked on its voyage of discovery in 1772, Mr Elder said.

"Hodges is arguably the greatest of all the artists who travelled with Cook and this work is regarded as the first oil painting ever to depict the New Zealand landscape and southern Maori. As such it is tremendously significant to New Zealand and the Fiordland region."

Mr Elder said the timing of the acquisition was also significant with this year marking the 800th anniversary of the first known Maori settlement in the Fiordland area, and the 150th anniversary of the first organised migrant ship to Otago/Southland.

"And the painting itself turned 225 years old this year, having reportedly been painted on April 12, 1773."

William Hodges painted 14 known works, both oils and watercolours, which directly related to Dusky Sound and only one other is held in this country, in the Auckland City Art Gallery.

Great care was taken by the Southland Museum and Art Gallery to establish the painting's authenticity before the purchase, Mr Elder said.

"I am really pleased the Lottery Grants Board has been able to help them bring this work back to New Zealand and make what I believe is a very worthwhile investment in the heritage of our country."
