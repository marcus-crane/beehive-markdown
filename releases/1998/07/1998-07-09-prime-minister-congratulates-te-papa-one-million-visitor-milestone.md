Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today congratulated Te Papa on reaching the one million visitor milestone, less than five months after its opening.

"This milestone is a wonderful achievement, particularly as it was initially estimated there would be 723,000 visitors in the first year of operation.

"At Te Papa's opening, I said that I was sure it would quickly become part of our national fabric. This one million visitor milestone has more than proved that.

"It shows that Te Papa is New Zealand's museum. Of the one million visitors, about 800,000 have been New Zealanders who are showing they want to celebrate our heritage and our identity.

"Nearly 200,000 visitors have come from overseas, confirming Te Papa's role as an important New Zealand tourist attraction.

"Te Papa has challenged and redefined our concept of a national museum. It is bold, dramatic and creative. It brings together the things that reflect and represent our uniqueness as New Zealanders.

"The greatest pleasure I have had on the number of occasions I have visited Te Papa, in both a public and private capacity, has been to see the enjoyment in people's faces as they wander around. New Zealanders want to be proud of who we are and what we have achieved and Te Papa certainly helps us do that.

"Te Papa and this visitor milestone is a testament to the vision and work of those who have worked so hard to make "Our Place" a living treasure for all New Zealanders and the world to enjoy," the Prime Minister concluded.
