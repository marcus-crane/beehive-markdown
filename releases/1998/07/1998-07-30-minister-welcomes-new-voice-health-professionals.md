Health Minister Bill English today welcomed the establishment of a new group for doctors, nurses and other health professionals who have taken on management and leadership responsibilities.

Mr English told the inaugural meeting of the Clinical Leaders' Association of New Zealand (CLANZ), held in Wellington, that health professionals can play a positive leadership role in health.

"Doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists and other health professionals can lead change in the sector. But for too long their public voice has been blurred by industrial issues and patch protection. Health professionals who have wanted to contribute in a constructive way to shaping the future of health services have been unsure how to get their message across.

"I welcome the chance for lively and positive debate with leading professionals on health issues. CLANZ and I probably won't always agree, but that is to be expected and welcomed in the interests of finding the best solutions.

"This new group will give health professionals an independent voice. Already 120 people have joined CLANZ which shows the support within the sector for this new group of leaders," said Mr English.
