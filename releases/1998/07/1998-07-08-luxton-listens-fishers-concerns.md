Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton met representatives of the commercial fishing fraternity in Motueka yesterday to hear their concerns on a range of issues.

"Our fishing industry is very important to our economy, exporting over $1.2 billion per year. It was good to again have the opportunity to discuss issues of concern directly with fishers," Mr Luxton said today.

Issues discussed with Mr Luxton included the 43 Metre Rule, scallops, compliance issues, cost recovery charges, consultation, new species into the QMS and permits.

On the 43 Metre rule Mr Luxton said, "I have written to SeaFIC challenging them to develop a consensus industry proposal regarding the two aspects of this issue - how we measure the length of the boats and how far out from the beach we allow them to fish.

"The closest to shore that boats longer than 43 metres are currently allowed to fish is to the 12 mile limit. There are no proposals for this to change. However it is now up to industry to come back to me with proposals and suggestions about exclusions beyond this 12 mile limit," Mr Luxton concluded.
