The Minister of Defence, Max Bradford, today announced that the Governor- General has approved six-month extensions of appointments for the Chief of Defence Force and the Chief of Air Staff. Both were due to retire this year.

The Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General Tony Birks, is to continue in his appointment until 24 February 1999. The Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Carey Adamson, is to continue in his appointment until 25 March 1999.

Mr Bradford said he was delighted both had accepted his invitation to extend their appointments.

"The past three years had seen a period of major reform for the Defence Force, most of which had been undertaken on the initiative of Lieutenant General Birks," Mr Bradford said.

"The Defence Management Review, a concurrent review of the New Zealand Defence Force's support functions and infrastructure is nearing completion and beginning to yield significant efficiencies and savings.

"The further extension of Lieutenant General Birks and Air Vice-Marshal Adamson in their present appointments will enable them to provide seamless stewardship of these reviews to their conclusion."
