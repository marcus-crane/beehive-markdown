Health Minister Bill English said today he hoped the number of children poisoned each year from toxic substances would drop with the introduction of a code covering child-resistant packaging of these products.

Household items like methylated spirits, turpentine, dishwashing machine powders, dry-cleaning fluid, paint strippers and oven cleaners will be covered by the code.

"Too many children are harmed each year from accidental poisonings. It is estimated that at least one child a year dies, another 10 suffer serious harm, nearly 1,000 are admitted to hospital and 10,000 more suffer some harm due to poisonings. Two-thirds of these are due to toxic substances, with the remainder due to medicines.

"The code will be voluntary at this stage. However, if voluntary compliance doesn't have the desired effect of bringing down the number of of poisonings, the Ministry of Health is likely to make it compulsory.

"Child-resistant packaging won't necessarily stop children getting at toxic substances, but it will slow them down. It is one of a number of things which can be used to help stop children poisoning themselves. Children should always be adequately supervised and toxic substances should be out of reach and appropriately labelled.

"The code will provide industry with clear guidance as to which substances and products should be packed in child-resistant packaging. The onus is now on industry to ensure their products are appropriately packaged to prevent harm, and the code," he said.

Mr English said if it was decided to make the code compulsory, it would be done through an amendment to Regulation 15 of the Toxic Substances Regulations 1983. Any such amendment would follow consultation with industry and allow for an appropriate lead time. International evidence showed signficant reductions in accidental poisonings in children from common toxic household substances following new laws introducing child-resistant packaging.

Under the Medicines Regulations 1984 solid dose forms of certain medicines had to be supplied in strip or blister packs. An initiative had been introduced by the Health Funding Authority to ensure safety caps were used when dispensing certain medicines in liquid forms, he said.
