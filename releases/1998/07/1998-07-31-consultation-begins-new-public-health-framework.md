Health Minister Bill English said today the first round of public consultation over the planned overhaul of public health legislation would begin in August and would be based on a discussion document released today.

"Public health legislation covers the management of risks to public health from things like communicable disease, environmental hazards eg, drinking water, sewage and other waste disposal, food and the misuse of drugs.

"What we are looking at is a total overhaul of the legislation.

"Much of our existing public health legislation is designed to deal with only those public health risks we knew about 40 years ago. It is outdated, complex and inflexible. It is easier for health authorities in this country to get a rubbish bin emptied than to respond to an outbreak of cryptosporidium in public drinking water. This is the bug that caused huge problems in public swimming pools earlier this year.

"This review sits along-side major changes planned for the legislation governing the safety of hospitals, which will be introduced to Parliament later this year. Both legislative overhauls will mean higher quality health care for New Zealanders and their significance should not be underestimated," said Mr English.

The new public health legislation would be designed to improve, promote and protect public health, he said. It would include provisions designed to:

- manage actual and potential risks to public health
- give clear responsibilities and accountabilities
- ensure monitoring and reporting of public health
- give explicit emergency powers
- co-ordinate with other laws and regulations, including international obligations
- avoid undue infringement of human rights and privacy
- provide flexibility within a nationally consistent approach but allow local solutions to local problems.

Submissions on the discussion document, Public Health Legislation Review , close on 30 September 1998, with a draft Bill planned for introduction to Parliament in September 1999.
