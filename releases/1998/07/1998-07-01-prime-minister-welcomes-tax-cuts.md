"Most New Zealanders will receive more money in their pockets as the final part of the Government's three-year programme of tax cuts and family assistance comes into force today," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said.

"This Government is committed to this package because we believe hard working New Zealanders deserve some reward for their contribution to creating a stronger, more dynamic and wealthier New Zealand.

These moves return another $1.2 billion to taxpayers and will see a family on the average wage of $34,500 will hold on to about $15 more per week after the tax cuts.

From 1 July, the middle income tax rate drops from 21.5 to 19.5 cents in the dollar and the income level for the 33 cent top tax rate moves up from $34,200 to $38,000.

"Coming on top of the recent AMP share issue of $2.3 billion, the tax reduction package is a major and timely boost to the economy," Mrs Shipley concluded.

"The longer term benefits of tax cuts are clear. Lower taxes will improve opportunities for New Zealanders by boosting economic growth, creating jobs and by increasing the disposable incomes available to New Zealand families to spend and save.

"New Zealanders will make their own decision, as to whether they spend, they pay off debt or they save. That's as it should be.

"New Zealanders who save are not only helping themselves, they are helping their country. If New Zealander save more, we borrow less from overseas. That reduces the pressure on the current account deficit. As the Retirement Commissioner has set out, even a few dollars saved a week makes a difference.

"As New Zealanders receive the extra money from their tax cuts, I urge everyone to think about their future and the future of their families," the Prime Minister concluded.
