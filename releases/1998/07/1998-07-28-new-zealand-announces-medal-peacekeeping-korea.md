Defence Minister Max Bradford announced today that Her Majesty The Queen has approved the award of the New Zealand General Service Medal to members of the New Zealand Armed Forces who served with the British Commonwealth Forces as part of the United Nations Force in Korea between 27 July 1954 and 31 December 1957.

Mr Bradford said it was particularly timely to announce the awards this week because Korean armistice was signed on 27 July 1953.

He said members of K-Force who served in Korea prior to 27 July 1954 were awarded either the Commonwealth Korea Medal, or the United Nations Medal with clasp "Korea", or both.

"The retrospective issue of a New Zealand General Service Medal with Clasp 'Korea' for those members of the New Zealand Armed Forces who arrived in Korea after 27 July 1954 will finally recognise the significant contributions they made to peacekeeping in the Republic of Korea during that period," he said.

Those personnel who have already received medallic recognition for their service in Korea will not be eligible for the New Zealand General Service Medal with Clasp "Korea".

The medals are being produced by the Royal Mint in Australia and will be presented later this year. All applications or enquiries should be addressed to Mr W Walker, Staff Officer Medals, Trentham Military Camp, PO Box 905, Upper Hutt.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
NEW ZEALAND GENERAL SERVICE MEDAL  
WITH CLASP "KOREA 1954-1957"

NZ forces were deployed to Korea between 1950 and 1957 as part of a United Nations force. The NZ contribution was known as "K Force".

There were two distinct parts of service for K Force:

1.The Korean War from 27 June 1950 to 27 July 1953; and  
2.Post Armistice period from 27 July 1953 until the last of the NZ  
personnel were withdrawn in 1957.

Two medals have been awarded for service in Korea:  
1.The Korea Medal. This is a Commonwealth medal issued to all commonwealth personnel for operational service in the Korean War from 1 July 1950 to 27 July 1953.  
2.The United Nations Medal with clasp Korea (UNSM). This medal was awarded for both operational and non-operational service in Korea from 27 June 1950 to 27 July 1954 (correct).

The cut-off date of 27 July 1954 for the UNSM was set by the United Nations General Assembly, yet NZ service personnel served on non-operational (peacekeeping) duties from 27 July 1954 to 1957 in Korea. It was the fact that this additional service was not medallicaly recognised that caused the grievance for many NZ ex-Service personnel. The award of the NZ GSM with clasp "Korea 1954-1957" rectifies the anomaly.

A total of 3,794 New Zealand soldiers served in K Force during the Korean War - 33 died on active service.
