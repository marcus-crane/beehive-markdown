The Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, the Rt Hon Don McKinnon urges all Pacific people to ensure that they are correctly enrolled for this year's local authority elections and that they are on the general electoral roll.

"We are concerned that Pacific people make the most of this opportunity to exercise their democratic right in the local authority and general elections," Mr McKinnon said.

Research by the Electoral Enrolment Centre shows that in areas with a high Pacific population electoral enrolments are around 10% lower than enrolments in other electorates. Nationally 91.75% of the eligible population have enrolled.

Local Authority Election Enrolment information forms are being posted to all voters whose names and addresses are correctly listed on the local authority electoral roll. It is absolutely essential that people check that their enrolment details are accurate and to correct any mistakes.

"To help Pacific people understand the election process, information forms are available in the different Pacific languages. This is an ideal opportunity for Pacific people to take a democratic part in the New Zealand way of life."

All adults over the age of 18 must be enrolled to vote in the local authority elections, which will take place between 25 September and 10 October this year. The last day to enrol is 28 August 1998.

People can check their details on preliminary rolls from 31 July at Post Shops and public libraries. Enrolment forms and information forms in the different Pacific languages are also available via freephone ENROL NOW (0800 367 656).
