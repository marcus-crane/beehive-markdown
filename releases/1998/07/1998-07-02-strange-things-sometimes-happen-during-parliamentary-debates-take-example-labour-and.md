Strange things sometimes happen during Parliamentary debates. Take for example Labour and Alliance's support this afternoon in the House for Act's proposal to privatise the Electricity industry!

Energy Minister Max Bradford said this unexpected turn of events happened when Act tabled a Supplementary Order Paper proposing the Bill's title be changed to the "Electricity Industry Privatisation Bill" and amendments which had the effect of privatising the industry.

"Apparently wanting to support the proposed title change, Labour and the Alliance supported the full SOP, and therefore privatisation of the industry.

"Bizarre things happen in the House," Mr Bradford said, "but none more bizarre than this!"
