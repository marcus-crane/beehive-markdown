Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson will be in the King Country tomorrow (Wednesday 15 July) to inspect damage and the repairs to State Highway 3 at Mahoenui which has been closed due to a slip.

"I want to see for myself progress on the repair work, I want to ensure that all that can be done is in fact being done and see the status of the detour road.

"Dr Robin Dunlop, Transit New Zealand's General Manager will be with me on the inspection and I can assure road users in this region the Government views the ongoing predicament of State Highway 3 as very serious," the Minister said.
