Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has set time aside during his visit to the Waikato today to tour flood-damaged land with Waikato District Council representatives.

"Extensive information on the flood damage has been made available to me by officials," Dr Smith said before leaving Wellington. "However, it is also valuable to get a good grasp of the situation on the ground and to check that people are getting the appropriate assistance with the clean-up."

Dr Smith will arrive at the Waikato District Council offices in Ngaruawahia at 2.30 pm today.
