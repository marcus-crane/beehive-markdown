The National Pest Management Strategy for Bovine Tuberculosis comes into force this week, Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

"This is the first National Pest Management Strategy to be given formal effect under the Biosecurity Act, although most elements of the strategy have already been implemented under existing and transitional legislation," Dr Smith said.

Under the strategy, responsibility for bovine Tb will rest with the Animal Health Board. Funding will continue to come from the Government, regional councils, levies and industry group contributions. Regional council officers and contractors will also continue to be directly involved in controlling vectors such as possums and ferrets.

One new element is the intention to introduce a compulsory identification scheme for farmed cattle and deer. The scheme will become compulsory from 1 July 1999 for cattle and deer born after this date if they are over one month old when moved from a property. It is intended that the scheme will become compulsory for all farmed cattle moved from a property from 1 July 2002.

The National Pest Management Strategy for Bovine Tb will be reviewed in 2001.
