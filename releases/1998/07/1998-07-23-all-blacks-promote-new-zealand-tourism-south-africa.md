The All Blacks are to join forces  
with the Minister of Tourism and Sport, Hon Murray McCully, and the New Zealand  
Tourism Board (NZTB) in South Africa during August to launch New Zealand as a  
tourism destination.

A number of high profile All Blacks will be special  
guests at the launch of the NZTB's 'Discover New Zealand, the Home of the All  
Blacks' tourism promotion in Johannesburg on 10 August local time. Former All  
Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick will MC both the launch and several other  
promotions in South African cities during that week.

The All Blacks will  
be in South Africa for the Tri-Nation test against the Springboks in Durban on  
15 August local time. (Note: this is on 16 August New Zealand time.) Said Mr  
McCully: "The All Blacks have a huge international presence, capable of drawing  
$100 million in sponsorship. The fact that they are placing their profile behind  
New Zealand?s tourism push into South Africa will be of enormous benefit."

"I want to express my gratitude to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union  
and to the All Blacks for lending their considerable promotional weight behind  
this venture."

Mr McCully said tourist numbers from South Africa were  
growing steadily, and had the potential to remain strong.

"We believe  
that this is just the tip of the iceberg. The upcoming promotion will leverage  
off the popularity of the All Blacks in rugby-mad South Africa to create an  
awareness of New Zealand and all its attractions."

Mr McCully will lead  
a delegation of top New Zealand tourism operators to support the NZTB promotions  
in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.
