Foreign Minister Don McKinnon is heartened by reports that Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar has announced a new plan to return Nigeria to civilian rule. General Abubakar has said he will hand power to a democratically-elected government on 29 May 1999.

"The international community had of course hoped that the handover to civilian rule would take place earlier than next year. But General Abubakar's moves since coming to power have encouraged us to believe that he is serious about political reform. The new date for elections should allow enough time for real democratic parties to emerge rather than the artificial parties created by General Abacha, and for orderly elections to be held" Mr McKinnon said.

"We will be looking to see a comprehensive and credible transition agenda within a realistic time-frame. But so far so good," the Minister added.

The 29 May date for elections moves the transition programme deadline beyond the 1 October 1998 timing set by previous Head of State, General Abacha. The October timing had been accepted by most of the international community, including the Commonwealth.

It was also announced yesterday that General Abubakar had pardoned 10 people sentenced over the alleged 1995 coup plot and ordered their immediate release. Mr McKinnon welcomed the release of the prisoners and urged the Government of Nigeria to release all of the remaining political prisoners without delay.

"General Abubakar's express acknowledgment of the imperatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy in Nigeria is very encouraging. The release of all political prisoners is an essential component of those imperatives," he said.

Mr McKinnon is the Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, established at the 1995 Auckland CHOGM to monitor Commonwealth countries' compliance with the principles of democracy and human rights enshrined in the 1991 Harare Declaration.
