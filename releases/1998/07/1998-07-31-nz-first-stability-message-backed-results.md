New Zealand First's claims of a stable Coalition Government and sound economy were vindicated by a recent upturn in business confidence, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"I am heartened by the results of the latest National Bank business outlook survey and the general positive trends in the economy.

"A steady recovery will mean more money in people's pockets, more jobs and a better standard of living for everyone.

"I've said all along that a recovery will come and we need to remain calm. Our economy is fundamentally sound and we need to avoid talking ourselves into a recession.

"We should now turn our minds to how we can all help our country in this recovery by managing our money well and saving for a rainy day. We also need to get New Zealand working with all New Zealanders playing their part in the workforce," Mr Peters said.
