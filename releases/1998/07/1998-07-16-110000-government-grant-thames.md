Business Development Minister Max Bradford today announced a Government grant of $110,040 to the Thames Coromandel District Council to help it attract new businesses to the region.

"The grant acknowledges the impact on the region of the pending closure of the Thames motor vehicle assembly plant given the Government's decision to speed up the removal of the remaining tariff on the motor vehicle assembly industry," Mr Bradford said.

"The Thames Coromandel Council had been proactive in its approach, and put forward an excellent case for Government funding to match local contributions to a project encouraging new businesses to start-up ventures in its region."

"I wish the councils and the community well in their search for new opportunities. Certainly the Thames community is well assisted by their local MP, Murray McLean, who has been a tireless advocate for his electorate," said Mr Bradford.

Commerce Minister John Luxton also welcomed the announcement. Mr Luxton said he looked forward to seeing the positive results of the project flowing through to the region.
