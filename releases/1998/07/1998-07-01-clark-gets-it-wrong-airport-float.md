The float of the Government's 51.6% shareholding in Auckland International Airport Limited may actually reduce, rather than increase, the current account deficit given that the proceeds will be used to pay off debt, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"The float has also been structured to ensure that as many Kiwi mums and dads as possible can obtain their shares through the large public pool and the guaranteed share allocation.

"This will increase the savings opportunities for many New Zealanders -- also contributing to a reduction of the current account deficit. Kiwi mums and dads are taking an unprecedented level of interest in the float -- already over 18,000 Kiwi mums and dads have called the 0800 AIRPORT number.

"Helen Clark's comments on the float display a poor understanding of the economic effects of private investment and a selective memory.

"After all, she was a key minister in the Labour government which sold Telecom lock, stock and barrel to an American consortium without a word about the current account deficit.

"The same Labour government sold Air New Zealand to an Australian, Japanese and American consortium, State Insurance to an English company and forestry cutting rights to a Japanese consortium.

"It is important to the health of our economy that critical infrastructure assets like Auckland International Airport perform to the best of their ability. Private ownership of the company is likely to lead to it making better quality commercial decisions, contributing to a stronger, more efficient economy.
