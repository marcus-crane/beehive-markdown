"The first New Zealand flight carrying emergency relief to the tsunami stricken region of Papua New Guinea is scheduled to depart this evening," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon confirmed today.

"Our High Commission reports that the situation is very serious, with at least four villages in the Aitape area wiped out. Initial estimates placed the death toll at more than 1000 people but this is expected to rise, as a further 5000 people are still missing," he said.

"We have been working closely with the Papua New Guinea authorities as well as other regional partners to get a team of medics and medical supplies up to the region as soon as possible.

"The RNZAF aircraft, carrying an advance medical team, medical supplies and basic materials such as blankets, water bottles and tarpaulins, is scheduled to depart for Papua New Guinea tonight. A further flight is to depart on Tuesday morning carrying a 12 persons medical team to undertake first aid and triage.

"The Government has allocated an initial sum of $200,000 to assist with emergency relief for the victims of this tragedy," said Mr McKinnon. "This includes a cash grant of $20,000 to the Catholic Diocese in Aitape for humanitarian assistance, who have been working around the clock to provide help to those directly affected by the disaster."
