The Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry, today announced that Roger McClay has been appointed permanently to the position of Commissioner for Children.

Mr McClay has filled the position in an interim capacity since February.

"Mr McClay has considerable experience with education and welfare issues relating to children and young people and has demonstrated over the past five months his ability to provide children and youth advocates with a confidential and independent avenue of redress," says Mr Sowry.

Mr McClay was previously a primary school principal and has taught in New Zealand and in the United Kingdom, and as a Member of Parliament he held the positions of Minister of Youth Affairs, and Associate Minister portfolios of Education, Social Welfare and Pacific Island Affairs.
