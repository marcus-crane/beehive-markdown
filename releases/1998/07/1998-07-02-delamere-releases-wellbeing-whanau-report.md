Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today released a Ministry of Health report that refocuses attention on the central role of the whanau in the provision of health services to Maori.

The Public Health Group report, Whaia Te Whanaungatanga: Oranga Whanau, is the latest in a series of papers developed by the Ministry on public health issues and is based on advice and contributions from dozens of individuals and academic bodies, as well as public and private health agencies.

"This report brings together in concise form the various statistics and arguments relating to Maori health status. But it is important to note that this is just a foundation stone for action that will greatly improve those health outcomes," said Mr Delamere.

"For example, it discusses in some detail how the co-ordinated care/co-operative model of health service provision has the potential to fit well into a holistic, whanau-centred approach to health care.

"I congratulate the ministry's Public Health Group for the work that has gone into producing this report and I look forward to seeing it being used to produce tangible health results for Maori," said the Minister.
