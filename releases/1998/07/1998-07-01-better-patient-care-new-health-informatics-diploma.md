Health Minister Bill English said today combining information and communications technology with medicine was an excellent way of improving health services for patients.

Mr English today launched the country's first post graduate Health Informatics Diploma.

The Diploma is a distance learning programme taught by CD-ROM and over the Internet. The two-year postgraduate course includes the study of telemedicine, diagnostic test interpretation, personal use of a computer, computer-based medical records, and finding up-to-date information from electronic databases and on the Internet.

"Better services and better care for patients means using all the information available, and improving communication between health providers. The 30 people doing the course all have a lot of health experience. That experience, combined with this new qualification, will make them extremely valuable to the health sector.

"Electronic information systems are beginning to revolutionise healthcare practice, research and education. Increasingly healthcare professionals need skills in finding and using information, and in assessing the information systems. It makes good sense to ensure that people are appropriately trained and this Diploma is helping to fill that gap.

"It's clear that these tasks can no longer be managed by paper methods. Escalating costs of health care means providers are increasingly required to justify treatment decisions and to audit outcomes," said Mr English.

Informatics provides opportunities to improve patient education, and delivery of modern health care services. Used appropriately, efficient management of information should improve patient satisfaction and make time available for new aspects of practice and for learning, all of which would improve the quality of care.

The Diploma is a joint initiative by Capital Coast Health, the Wellington School of Medicine, and the Department of Information Science at Otago University.

It is one of the projects supported by the Ministry of Health as part of the Health Information Strategy for the Year 2000 and funded through the $3.95m announced in last year's Budget for health information initiatives.
