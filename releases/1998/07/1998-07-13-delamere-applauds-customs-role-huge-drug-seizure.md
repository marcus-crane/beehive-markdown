Customs Minister Hon Tuariki Delamere today congratulated the Customs Service for its role in seizing more than $50 million worth of high quality heroin at Auckland International airport last Thursday.

"This seizure, the highest-value drug haul ever in New Zealand, was made possible by the international contacts the New Zealand Service has developed through its drug liaison officers in Bangkok and Sydney," he said.

"The relationships developed over several years have produced a magnificent result for the New Zealand Customs Service, whose officers have received much unjustified criticism in recent times.

"I hope those critics, who have been so vocal in demanding that Customs spend all its time and resources on checking imported secondhand cars, will now have the grace and humility to apologise to our Customs officers, who have shown what they can achieve when they are allowed to get on with their real job, which includes protecting New Zealand from the international drug trade," said the Minister.
