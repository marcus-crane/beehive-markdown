"Offers of help from the New Zealand public to the tsunami stricken region of Papua New guinea have been very encouraging," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said this afternoon.

"We have received numerous offers of assistance from members of the public and organisations offering their own services and basics such as food and shelter," he said.

"Some of these contributions are already on their way by RNZAF Hercules, including medical supplies from local organisations such as Rotary Clubs of New Zealand, Caritas, Catholic Overseas Volunteer Service and Medical Aid Abroad."

The Disaster Relief Forum of the Council for International Development (ph. 04 499 4983) has been established as a central contact point for offers of assistance from the public. Offers received yesterday have been forwarded to this organisation.

"Organisations such as Caritas, the Christian World Service, Oxfam, the Red Cross, the Save the Children Fund, and World Vision have set up appeals for the victims of this tragedy. It is wonderful to see New Zealanders contributing so generously to help out their neighbours in the Pacific," said Mr McKinnon.

"An RNZAF Hercules left for Papua New Guinea last night, and another leaves today, laden with medical supplies, a medical team and relief materials. It is expected that the first Hercules will arrive in the Aitape area today.
