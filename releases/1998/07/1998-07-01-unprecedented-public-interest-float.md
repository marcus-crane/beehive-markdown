Kiwi mums and dads are taking an unprecedented level of interest in the float of Auckland International Airport, State-Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"As at 4.00pm today, over 18,000 Kiwi mums and dads have called the 0800 AIRPORT number since the advertisements were first shown on TV on Sunday," Mr Ryall said.

"3,500 calls were received in the first three hours of the opening of the offer between nine o'clock this morning and midday.

"The opportunity to invest in Auckland International Airport Limited and the nation-wide communications campaign have led to a response that far exceeds any previous float.

"To meet this demand, we have doubled the number of telephone operators and put in 300 lines for an automated service as well.

"But even so, such is the demand that I am going to have to ask people to be patient when making their calls.

"NZ Post Shops are reporting strong demand and more investment statements are on the way.

"The original print run of 200,000 investment statements has been expanded by a further 50,000.

"At last Kiwi mums and dads have been given the opportunity to take a stake in an asset sale and they have responded in their thousands.

"We've made it easy to buy the shares. You don't have to go to a broker to get an investment statement. You can pick one up at your local NZ Post Shop or get one sent to you through the mail by calling the 0800 AIRPORT number.

"After that, all you have to do is write out your cheque and send it in with your application. And there are no fees for the Kiwi mums and dads who choose to buy their shares through the public pool."

Mr Ryall said Auckland International Airport Limited deserves consideration as an investment but prospective buyers should be aware that shares can go down as well as up.
