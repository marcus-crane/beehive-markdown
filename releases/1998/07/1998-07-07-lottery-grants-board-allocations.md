The arts, sporting interests and community-based organisations have the opportunity of dipping into a Lottery Grants Board pool of almost $132 million this financial year, Internal Affairs Minister and Board Chairman Jack Elder announced today.

The Grants Board met late last week to decide its annual allocations to the three statutory bodies responsible for fostering the country's sport, arts and film and to the Lottery distribution committees, he said.

Of the statutory bodies, the Hillary Commission for Sport, Fitness and Leisure received $27 million with a further $3.72 going to the special Sports 2000 Fund, Creative New Zealand picked up $20.25 million, while the New Zealand Film Commission share is $8.78 million. These allocations maintain the level of funding enjoyed by the three bodies in the 1997/98 financial year.

Mr Elder said at $14 million Lottery General has the largest slice of the funds available to the distribution committees.

"Lottery General provides substantial annual funding to the country's major outdoor safety organisations, and will distribute $700,000 to drug education initiatives in the coming year."

Lottery Welfare has been given a 1998/99 budget of $11.9 million while its special sub-committee which makes grants to individuals with disabilities has $3.2 million to distribute.

The 'bricks and mortar' committee, Lottery Community Facilities, has $11.4 million to service community building projects around the country, and the Lottery Marae Heritage and Facilities Committee received $6 million.

A $9.3 million budget is available to Lottery Environment and Heritage which provides annual funding to Te Papa ($1.25 million) and the New Zealand Film Archive ($675,000).

Lottery Youth has $5.6 million to distribute, Lottery Aged $3.35 million, and Lottery Health Research received a $3.45 million budget for the new financial year.

Mr Elder said that in other decisions, the Grants Board made a further $2 million contribution to the Lottery Millennium Fund and set aside $1 million to establish a capital endowment base for the proposed Arts Foundation of New Zealand.

"The Board was keen to show its support for this initiative which will help the arts in this country become more self sufficient, but before the grant is handed over, Creative New Zealand wants to make sure all the accountabilities are in place."

The Grants Board also decided on a $280,000 budget for the Ministerial Lottery fund, Mr Elder said.
