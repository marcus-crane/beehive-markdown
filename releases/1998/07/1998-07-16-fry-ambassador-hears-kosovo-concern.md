The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's first-ever Ambassador to New Zealand was given a direct message over recent events in Kosovo by the Government today.

Ambassador Dragan Dragojlovic, who presented his credentials to Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie-Boys at lunchtime, heard the Government's concerns in a meeting with Trade Minister Lockwood Smith. Subsequently, Dr Smith said that the Government was concerned about the conflict in Kosovo which had forced tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians and Serbians to flee their homes.

"As a member of the international community, New Zealand doesn't want to see another Bosnia-type crisis. Restraint is needed on all sides," Dr Smith said.

"New Zealand does not support independence for Kosovo, but a large degree of autonomy is essential."

Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which, along with Montenegro, comprises the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).

The current crisis in the province was triggered by the emergence of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which has demanded independence for Kosovo. More than 300 people have been killed since February as a result of clashes between the KLA and Serbian security forces.

"New Zealand recognises the FRY as one of the five successor states to the former Yugoslavia, along with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," Dr Smith said.

"Since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, we have not had a direct link with the FRY. Mr Dragojlovic's appointment will allow us to discuss matters of common interest, including security issues, with an important player in the Balkan region

"The dissolution of the former Yugoslavia has created a great deal of instability. We support the efforts of the United Nations, NATO and other international and regional groupings to bring about a lasting peace in the area."
