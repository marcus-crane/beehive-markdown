"The Labour Party must stop talking the economy down," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"They are hurting New Zealand's prospects by their negative comment and their threat of putting up tax rates and increasing spending.

"Labour refuses to offer New Zealanders anything sensible. Instead they cause alarm among international investors and in doing so, they lead employers to stop creating new jobs.

"While the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto causes concerns for New Zealand, we are doing well despite the external economic factors impacting on us. Exporters are leading the way and Government is doing its share with a three-step approach:

We will put aside a further $300 million of Government expenditure in order to help us ride out the current environment.

We are progressing policies, set out in the Budget, which will improve how business can do well in our own country and abroad. This will contribute to growth, jobs and improved wages.

Looking ahead at further options to maximise returns to producers and exporters  
"Labour wants higher taxes and higher spending, which would cost jobs and knock back any recovery. New Zealanders should view with great concern their negative and unproductive comments," Mrs Shipley concluded.
