Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will tomorrow visit Christchurch-based success story Tait Electronics Ltd.

"When I travel overseas as Trade Minister, there are two New Zealand companies I find right around the world," Dr Smith said today. "One is New Zealand's biggest company, the New Zealand Dairy Board. The other is Christchurch-based Tait Electronics Ltd. It is a Christchurch, New Zealand and international success story. I'm looking forward to visiting its headquarters and meeting its New Zealand-based staff tomorrow."

Tait Electronics Ltd was established as a 12 person operation in 1968 by Angus Tait, who remains chairman.

Since then, it has grown to employ over 1,000 people with sales in the last financial year of well over $100 million.

Its main products are trunked and conventional mobile radio products and systems. Ninety percent of its product is exported, to around 80 countries from Australia to Zimbabwe.

Dr Smith will arrive at Tait Electronics Ltd, 540 Wairakei Road, Christchurch, at 4:00 pm tomorrow.
