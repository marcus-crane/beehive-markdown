The Prime Minister and Minister of Women's Affairs Jenny Shipley today described as most encouraging figures showing a fall in the teenage abortion rate.

Figures released today show that in the year to December 1997 the rate of abortions among 15-19 year olds fell by 2.2 per cent to 22.2 per 1,000, after increasing every year since 1987.

"There are also positive signs in the slowing in the increase in the number of abortions overall, although it is early days and the total figure is still disappointingly high.

"It is my hope that these figures reflect an increasing level of awareness about sexual and reproductive health.

"The Government last year introduced a sexual and reproductive health strategy which included free contraceptive advice for at risk groups. In addition many secondary schools now have health services available on site, which I believe has improved young New Zealanders' access to sexual health advice.

"Much of the solution to the abortion rate lies in the hands of families, who should be open in discussing issues of sexual and reproductive health. Our young people, both young women and young men, should be able to learn about all the options available to them, from celibacy to safe sexual behaviour, so they can make informed choices.

"Older women who appear to be continuing to have abortions in increasing numbers need to be supported and encouraged to seek alternative forms of contraception.

"The Government is responding by making contraceptives available to at risk groups. The New Zealand community, including ethnic groups, must also play a part in seeking to reduce the number of abortions," Mrs Shipley concluded.
