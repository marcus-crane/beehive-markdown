The release of the Ministry of Fisheries ' five year strategic plan emphasised the importance of the fisheries sector to New Zealand, Fisheries Minister Hon John Luxton said today.

'The Ministry's first strategic plan is a timely reminder of just how much the fisheries sector contributes to the social, cultural and economic well-being of our country,' said Mr Luxton.

'New Zealand's fisheries are one of our most valuable natural and renewable resources, capable of yielding significant benefits for future generations if we manage our fisheries properly today,' he said.

'Our seafood industry employs over 10,000 people, harvests 650,000 tonnes from the sea and earns New Zealand between $1.1 and $1.5 billion per year,' said Mr Luxton.

'It is estimated that at least one in five New Zealanders enjoy recreational fishing and the importance of traditional fisheries to Maori is well documented.

'To manage the interactions of these groups and balance the environmental needs of the sector will require the Ministry to take a leadership role and develop consensus amongst stakeholders as to how our fisheries can be sustainably managed.

The strategic plan was a blueprint for the way in which the Ministry will contribute to managing fisheries, Mr Luxton said.

It clearly spells out the key areas of focus for the Ministry over the next five years and links these to the Government's strategic result areas of protecting and enhancing the environment, enterprise and innovation, the Treaty of Waitangi, and external linkages.

'Detailing the Ministry's approach to these issues in a five year strategic plan is a significant step towards ensuring we get the best outcomes for New Zealand.'

'I congratulate the Chief Executive and his staff on the production of the five year strategic plan,' Mr Luxton concluded.
