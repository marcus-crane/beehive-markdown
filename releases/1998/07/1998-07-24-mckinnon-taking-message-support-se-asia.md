Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, departs tomorrow for meetings in the Philippines and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

Mr McKinnon will attend the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) meetings in Manila. These meetings provide Mr McKinnon with the opportunity to hold discussions with his counterparts from the nine ASEAN and 10 dialogue member countries.

Mr McKinnon said the Asian Financial situation is likely to dominate discussions in the PMC and he would be taking a strong message of support from New Zealand.

"In my meetings with the foreign ministers of those countries affected I will be pledging New Zealand's continued support and commitment to the region," he said.

"It is important we make it clear we are still very much engaged in business activity in the region and will not desert these countries suffering from the economic turmoil in their time of need."

In the ARF ministers will discuss regional security developments. Nuclear proliferation in South Asia, and Cambodia where elections are taking place at the same time as the meeting will be key issues.

In Hong Kong SAR Mr McKinnon is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with key ministers including the Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR Tung Chee Hwa. The visit will enable him to assess the impact of the regional crisis on Hong Kong SAR and on broader developments following the return last year of sovereignty to China.

Mr McKinnon will also address the Asia Society in Hong Kong SAR providing a NZ perspective on the Asian Economic turmoil.

Mr McKinnon returns to New Zealand on Friday 31 July.
