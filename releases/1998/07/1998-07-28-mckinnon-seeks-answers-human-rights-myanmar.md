Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, US Secretary of State Madeline Albright and other foreign ministers today sought answers from the Government of Myanmar on human rights issue.

Mr McKinnon and a number of other foreign ministers sought a meeting with the Myanmar Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in Manila.

"We conveyed our concerns about human freedoms in Myanmar, and in particular for the security of democratic political leader Aung Sun Suu Kyi.

"We made it clear there is an urgent need to resolve the situation and allow Aung Sun Suu Kyi freedom of movement within her own country."

Mr McKinnon said that while the subject had been taken up in the formal sessions of the ASEAN Regional Forum, the countries represented had sought a separate meeting because they placed great importance on finding a way forward.

"Ohn Gyaw has undertaken to report urgently to his Government, and has said he will report back to the group through myself," Mr McKinnon said.

Foreign Ministers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, the European Union and the United States attended the meeting.
