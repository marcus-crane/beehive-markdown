"The Government is working on a number of measures that should see improved returns for farmers," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley told a dairy industry audience in Hawera this afternoon.

The Prime Minister officially opened the expansions to the Kiwi Co-operative Dairies Whareroa Manufacturing Complex.

"The Government recognises that New Zealand's wealth is built by producers and exporters.

"The dairy industry accounts for 20 per cent of New Zealand's export earnings, with Kiwi responsible for a quarter of those earnings.

"All New Zealanders benefit from a strong performance by the export sector, because the more wealth they earn and bring back to our country, the more there is to share around.

"It is still true that in many ways the agricultural sector is the backbone of our economy. The resilience and resourcefulness of our farmers is part of what makes New Zealand strong. The Government has heard farmers' concerns about the costs and bureaucracy they face, and is addressing those issues.

"We have a number of measures in the pipeline that will make it easier for people in the dairy industry and other export businesses to maximise their returns. Our moves in the electricity area will reduce power prices, which I know are a significant factor in the cost of dairy farming in particular. Other areas where we are making rapid progress include changes to ACC, reorganising the way roads are managed and funded, and a review of the Resource Management Act.

"In addition we have said this week we will look at further measures including a possible reduction in the business tax rate.

"We are also wanting to ensure that the industry structures are delivering the best possible returns to farmers, and so we are requiring the producer boards to scrutinise their operations. As you know we have asked all the boards including the Dairy Board to report back to us by November 15 on options for moving to operate without the current statutory monopoly status.

"I am very appreciative of the leadership being shown by many in the dairy industry. As always, this industry is demonstrating good sense and an innovative approach.

"The announcement that Kiwi and NZ Dairy Group are to establish an alliance and eventually a joint venture is a positive development in the evolution of the dairy industry to a fully commercial structure and I congratulate those of you who have been involved.

"I look forward to continuing discussions with representatives of the Dairy Board and other producer boards. Our end goal is to see the dairy sector grow and develop in a successful and profitable way where returns to producers are maximised," Mrs Shipley concluded.
