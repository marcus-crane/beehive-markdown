"Introducing contestability into property valuation for rating purposes and devolving the National Property Database will give local councils more flexibility and help reduce the cost to ratepayers", Minister of Lands, Hon John Luxton said today.

This follows the implementation of the Rating Valuations Act 1998 from 1 July 1998.

"From today Valuation New Zealand (VNZ) will cease to exist as a government department and there will no longer be a Minister in charge of the Valuation Department," Mr Luxton said. The statutory responsibility for the Rating Valuations Act and the Valuers Act will form part of the Minister of Lands' portfolio, while the shareholding Ministers for the new Crown owned company will be the Minister of Finance and the Minister for State Owned Enterprises.

"VNZ will be split into 2 parts; a commercial entity, called Quotable Value New Zealand Ltd, which will provide commercial valuation services, and the Office of the Valuer General (OVG), incorporated into Land Information New Zealand, which will undertake the Crown's core valuation policy and regulatory function."

"The Government has also decided to devolve the valuation data held in the centralised National Property Database to Territorial Authorities to give them greater flexibility.

"Devolving the database to Territorial Authorities will happen over a 2 year period, in recognition that TAs will incur initial start-up costs to enhance the capacity of their systems. Land Information New Zealand will manage the devolution of the database and the Office of the Valuer-General will be available to advise TAs on the issues that will need to be considered.

"Giving Territorial Authorities control of their own data will allow them to sell it to other potential users in order to offset any maintenance costs and/or pursue options such as resource sharing or clubbing together which may result in further efficiency gains.

"During the devolution process, the central system will continue to be maintained and TAs will be required to update it. This ensures that commercial users of valuation information still have access to the information while TAs are adjusting to the changes brought on by the contestable valuation services market," Mr Luxton concluded.

Following this process the Government will consider offering the central database for sale by competitive tender to third parties with any successful tenderer needing to contract TAs for the ongoing supply of valuation data updates.
