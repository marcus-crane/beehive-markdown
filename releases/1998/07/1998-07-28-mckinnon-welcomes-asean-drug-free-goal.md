Speaking at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in Manila, Foreign minister Don McKinnon today congratulated ASEAN for its commitment to be drug-free by 2020.

"I am delighted that the issue of drugs, transnational crime and other cross-border issues such as \`the Asian haze' have been tackled at this meeting.

"These are issues that can only be resolved by like-minded countries working together. It is a step forward that these matters are now firmly on the ASEAN agenda."

New Zealand is not immune from the problems caused by transnational crime and has joined international efforts, particularly those focused on the risks within our own region.

"New Zealand has strongly supported moves such as intelligence sharing among South East Asian nations and also the need to empower indigenous people to deal with drug issues," he said.

"We are also active in efforts to address money laundering and welcome the formation of a regional group to monitor this issue."

Mr McKinnon also congratulated the efforts of the ASEAN countries to improve co-ordination of forest fire prevention which New Zealand has helped to fund.
