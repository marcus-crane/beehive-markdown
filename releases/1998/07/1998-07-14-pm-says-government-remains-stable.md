Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says that New Zealand still has a stable government, with a majority in Parliament.

"Following the New Zealand First party's decision on its deputy leader, Mrs Shipley says Tau Henare has given her an assurance that he still intends to support the Government, and continue in his role as Minister of Maori Affairs."
