Health Minister Bill English said he was disappointed to learn today that the New Zealand Nurses Organisation had withdrawn its support for the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing.

"The Taskforce has undertaken the first major review of nursing in New Zealand in more than 15 years. It is important that we get nursing moving forward in a positive direction and nurses from around the country have made submissions and had input into the report.

"I am disappointed the taskforce wasn't able to reach consensus, but equally I am sure that nurses would not want to see differences within the profession hold back progress in nursing in this country.

"The Taskforce is due to present its report to me tomorrow. Over the next few weeks I will be considering the recommendations made before releasing the report publicly," said Mr English.
