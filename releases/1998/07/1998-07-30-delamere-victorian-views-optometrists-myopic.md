The New Zealand Associate Minister of Health, Hon Tuariki Delamere, has rejected a proposal put forward by the Victorian State Government that New Zealand withdraw its recognition of the qualifications of British-registered optometrists.

Mr Delamere is in Sydney attending the annual conference of Australian health ministers.

Under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement, British-trained and registered optometrists who practise in New Zealand are entitled to do the same in Australia and Victoria has objected to this.

Mr Delamere said "No evidence of safety concerns with these people has ever been submitted. The issue is really one of restraint of free trade and patch protection. The proposal reduces the number of options for those in the community seeking quality care for their eye problems.

"Consequently, I will continue to advocate for consumers to have the greatest range of choice possible in terms of how they get their health care needs met, so long as this is safe.

"I invite the Victorian State Government to do the same," Mr Delamere said.
