Health Minister Bill English said today the latest statistics on abortions in New Zealand showed there were still too many women having abortions.

"The latest statistics show an increase in the number of abortions since last year, although the rate of growth has slowed considerably. This is a positive sign, but it is too early as yet to know whether it is the start of a downward trend. There is certainly no room for complacency.

"Most people agree that the rate of abortions in this country is too high. I would like to see it reduced and there are a number of programmes underway, including free contraceptive consultation, free access to two oral contraceptives, pilot public health programmes with Pacific Islanders, and on-going health education programmes through our schools.

"The aim of the Government's Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy is to promote responsible sexual behaviour, minimise unplanned pregnancies, reduce abortion rates, and reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS," said Mr English.
