Reports that phones were running hot with people seeking copies of the Auckland International Airport Investment Statement were pleasing, Treasurer Winston Peters said today.

"We have heard reports of some Post Offices running out of copies and of telephone operators being besieged by over 14,000 calls.

"I am pleased that large numbers of Kiwis are taking the opportunity to get a copy of the offer document to acquaint themselves with the details of the float.

"This float was designed with New Zealanders in mind, and the demand for the Investment Statement indicates that they are keen to examine this investment option," Mr Peters said.

Additional copies of the Investment Statement are being printed to keep up with demand.
