Australian states and territories and New Zealand have agreed to implement law that will ensure child protection orders and proceedings may be transferred between the various jurisdictions with the original intent of the proceedings and orders preserved.

This was announced tonight by the Associate Minister of Health, Hon Tuariki Delamere, after attending an all-day conference in Sydney of Australian Community Service Ministers.

Mr Delamere said the meeting had approved in principle the drafting of new law in all states, territories and New Zealand that will give significant new protections to children who move between the two countries.

"The states and territories of Australia are to be congratulated on putting jurisdictional differences aside and reaching a significant inter-country agreement," he said.

There is also a proposal to ensure that indigenous children of Australia and New Zealand living in the other country are especially protected when their circumstances change, a proposal strongly supported by Mr Delamere.

Ministers also considered the progress being made on screening people employed to work with children for their suitability and, in particular, determining the existence of any police record of offences against children.

This work arises out of the concerns of both countries to ensure children are protected from paedophile activity.

All ministers agreed that officials should develop proposals to arrive at common definitions of child abuse and neglect in Australia and New Zealand and examine common service outcome measurement and compatibility of data between the two countries.

"All these initiatives will improve protection for children and young persons and bring the two countries closer together in the way child protection issues are managed," concluded Mr Delamere.
