Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson has today congratulated Transit New Zealand, the roading contractors and emergency service crews who have worked on re-opening State Highway 3 at Mahoenui.

Mr Williamson was in the King Country today to inspect the slip damage at Mahoenui on State Highway 3.

"I'm now getting my officials to investigate the programme required to ensure that where secondary routes exist, running parallel to State Highway 3, they are upgraded to provide a secure back up," the Minister said.

"The work could be undertaken outside of the benefit/cost ratio in a similar way we completed the upgrade of the Thorndon Over Bridge in Wellington," Mr Williamson said.
