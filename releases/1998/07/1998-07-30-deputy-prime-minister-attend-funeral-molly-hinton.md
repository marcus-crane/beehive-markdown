Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters will this morning attend the funeral of Molly Hinton - widow of the late Jack Hinton VC.

The funeral will take place at Kerrs Chapel, Lindwood Christchurch at 11am today.

Both Molly and Jack were New Zealand First supporters and shared a close relationship with Mr Peters and the party.

Jack was New Zealand's last holder of the Victoria Cross - the highest military honour for gallantry. He died in June last year.
