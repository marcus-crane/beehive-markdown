Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson and Telecom Chief Executive Dr Roderick Deane met this morning (16/7) to discuss the recent Telecom system failures in Palmerston North, Masterton and Porirua.

The Minister had sought detailed explanations from Telecom about how these problems arose and assurances of steps being taken to avoid future failures.

"I had strong concerns Telecom's systems, including back-up systems were not operating in accordance with best practice. Telecom provided satisfactory explanations of the detailed back-up systems and steps taken to minimise the prospects of future exchange failures," the Minister said.

"Telecom explained further reviews were being undertaken to ensure it has a full understanding of all possible contributing factors to their recent system failures, especially in Palmerston North. At the same time Telecom is conducting a review of the accessibility to its faults service.

"I expect further information from Telecom as those reviews are completed," Mr Williamson said.
