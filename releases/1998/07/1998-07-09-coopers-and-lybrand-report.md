Ex-minister Peter Dunne shows a lot of nerve complaining about delays to the consideration of the Coopers and Lybrand report on Fire Service levies, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

"After all, he authorised delays to work on it."

In September 1996, Mr Dunne as the-then Minister of Internal Affairs, agreed to delay analysis of the report until the following year, Mr Elder said.

"It is a bit rich to now have to put up with his pomposity and mock outrage that delays to the consideration of the report are scandalous."

The Coopers and Lybrand report on a property-based funding scheme for the New Zealand Fire Service was commissionedin 1995 by the Fire Service Commission, with impetus from the Insurance Council and Valuation New Zealand.

A copy of the report was given to Mr Dunne on 30 August 1996, and shortly afterwards he agreed to defer consideration of it until February 1997.

A joint Internal Affairs and Treasury working group began analysis in February 1997, and reported back to the Ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs on 24 October 1997. The report focussed on the issues and criteria for deciding between the proposals outlined in the Coopers and Lybrand report, and the proposals outlined in the earlier Harrison report on insurance-based levies.

It concluded the property-based scheme merited further investigation, but that there were substantial implementation issues which required further evaluation.

It is important to note that the Coopers and Lybrand report was incomplete, as noted in the report itself, and requires considerable detailed information and work in order to develop a scheme for implementation.

Such a scheme would then need to go through Cabinet for final approval and to get a place on the legislative programme.

Further work on the two schemes has been forestalled due to other high-priority work in the Department of Internal Affairs, but is being considered as part of the Department's work programme for 1998.

The Department's workload has been greatly increased this year, with opposition MPs mounting a concerted campaign to tie up the Department's resources, Mr Elder said.

"Since the beginning of the year, opposition MPs have made well over 1,000 requests for information relating to the Fire Service. Most of these have been trivial in nature, and I believe some MPs are abusing their privileges, and forgetting that they are in Parliament to represent the public of New Zealand, not their own egos."
