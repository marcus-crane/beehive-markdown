Health Minister Bill English announced today that an additional $13 million would be going into small hospitals during the current contract negotiations as a rural premium.

"This is the first time that there has been an attempt to get a consistent and fair approach to a rural premium right across the country. It is not yet perfect, but is a step in the right direction.

"I accept the argument that small hospitals should be paid a rural premium because of the higher costs of health services in rural and provincial New Zealand. People in rural areas can be reassured that the Government will continue to fund services for them.

"Just under half the premium will be allocated according to a formula based on the number of discharges from the hospital. Hospitals which see less than 10,000 patients a year and which provide 24-hour cover are eligible for the premium. There are about 25 hospitals in this group.

"The remaining money has been allocated to the four Health Funding Authority divisions and will be negotiated on a case by case basis, because each region has its own unique characteristics.

"In future years we will be able to refine this payment. It is all about making our support for health services in the regions more transparent so everyone has the certainty of knowing what we are paying for and why," said Mr English.
