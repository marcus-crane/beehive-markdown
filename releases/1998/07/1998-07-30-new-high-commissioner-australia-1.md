A new High Commissioner to Australia was announced today by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.

Simon Murdoch, currently Chief Executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet will become New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Australia.

"This appointment reflects the importance of our relationship with Australia, New Zealand's single most important bilateral partner. We are probably closer than any two other sovereign nations. It is a complex relationship that affects every aspect of our day-to day lives. Government -to Government links are extensive."

"Mr Murdoch not only has an extensive background in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade with previous postings in Canberra and Washington, but he has also been one of New Zealand's leading public servants of his generation. He has had extensive experience at the heart of government, culminating in his service as Chief Executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet since 1991."

Mr McKinnon commented that the emphasis in the relationship is on trade and economic ties with two way trade under CER now worth some $10 billion, and growing. Investment flows in both directions are significant. Australia is our most important ally, with close integration of our defence forces and shared security concerns.

"It's hard to imagine anyone better-equipped than Mr Murdoch to further advance this important relationship".

Mr Murdoch will take up his appointment in February 1999. He replaces Mr Graham Fortune who will be returning to Wellington.
