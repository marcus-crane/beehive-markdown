"A positive step forward in bringing criminals to justice" was Foreign Minister Don McKinnon's reaction to this weekend's decision to establish an International Criminal Court.

Over 100 countries voted for a Statute establishing the Court at a conference in Rome, attended by New Zealand, on Friday night. The Statute allows independent prosecutors to investigate genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and establishes an 18-judge Court in The Hague to deal with the crimes.

"The Court marks a new stage in cooperation to respond to atrocities of the sort we have witnessed in Bosnia and Rwanda. I am particularly pleased that it will allow for the hearing of crimes against women and children, including sexual violence during armed conflict" the Minister said.

"It is disappointing that some voted against the Court because they thought the Statute went too far. For our part we would like its jurisdiction to go even further to cover a wider range of conflicts. We also want to see the use of nuclear weapons and landmines brought within the ambit of the Court" the Minister added.

"I am encouraged that the Statute would allow these to be added in the future" he said.

Mr McKinnon praised the role played by Non-Governmental Organisations in promoting the concept of an International Criminal Court.

"Without their strenuous efforts in support of the Court we would not have a Statute at this stage" the Minister concluded.

The Court will be formally established once 60 countries have ratified the Statute.
