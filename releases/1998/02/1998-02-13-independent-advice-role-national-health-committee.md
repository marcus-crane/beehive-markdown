Health Minister Bill English announced today that the role of the National Health Committee is to change to focus on providing independent advice to him on what health services should be funded by the taxpayer.

"We need to give the public more certainty about health services by being clearer about what services are available.

"The Committee will provide me with an independent assessment of the quality and mix of services that it thinks should be funded by the Health Funding Authority.

"That mix is changing and I need advice that quite clearly tells me whether or not the services being provided actually match the needs in the community.

"The committee has good links to the community and the health sector and will be able to use those links both to get information from the community and feed back information to the community.

"In recent years the committee has spent a lot of its time on encouraging the use of clinical guidelines and this work has been very successful. The time is now right to progressively hand that job back to the health sector and this will be done over the next year or so," he said.

Mr English said the position of Committee chairperson was currently vacant and the opportunity was being used to ensure the widest range of people and talent were considered for the job.

Advertisements were being placed in tomorrow's metropolitan morning newspapers seeking nominations for the chairperson. Letters were also being sent to community groups and other organisations asking for nominations.
