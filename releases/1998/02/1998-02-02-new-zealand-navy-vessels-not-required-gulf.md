The Government has not been asked to consider, nor has it considered sending a frigate to the Persian Gulf, Defence Minister Max Bradford said today.

Mr Bradford said the Government had indicated to the United States that New Zealand might be able to offer the supply ship HMNZ Endeavour as a support ship, perhaps to an Australian frigate. Australia has not been asked to send a frigate to join the International Coalition.

"But as far as I am aware, it is a hypothetical question," Mr Bradford said. The response from the United States had been "thank you, but it's not needed". In practical terms, a naval vessel would take several weeks to reach the Gulf from New Zealand, by which time it was hoped a diplomatic or other solution would have been found, he said.
