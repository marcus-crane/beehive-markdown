"Over ten thousand submissions from groups and individuals on their ideas for road reform have been received by Government,"  
announced Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson today.

The submissions were called for following the release of the Roading Advisory Group's report on road reform, "The Way  
Forward."

"I believe the number of responses (10,000), clearly indicates the road reform consultation process has a high public awareness  
and the public understands the importance that is being placed on road reform," said the Minister.

"Road reform is vital because without it, our roading networks will fail in the future to provide the social and economic means,  
we need as a nation to prosper.

"New Zealand can be assured that roads will not be privatised and that keeping the network open is a priority.

"We need to make changes to the roading network because currently, charges for roading do not reflect use. Those who provide roading services are not accountable to those who use them. Road providers are not free to make long term investments to improve roading in New Zealand for everybody's benefit.

"Reform is necessary because the roading system is coming under rapidly increasing pressures, yearly in Auckland at 8% and nationwide at nearly 4%.

"The roading system is the backbone of New Zealand. It supports our economy, our businesses and our way of life. We must make the best changes possible and I believe the quality and number of the submissions made to this process will deliver the best result possible," said Mr Williamson.

It is expected the 10,000 plus submissions will be made available from the Ministry of Transport.
