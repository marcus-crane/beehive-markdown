Health Minister Bill English released figures today showing the number of doctors and nurses per 100,000 New Zealanders is steadily increasing.

"There is a widespread belief that changes in the health service mean we now have fewer doctors and registered nurses. The reality is the opposite. New Zealand now has more health professionals than ever before," Mr English said.

"The most recent New Zealand Health Information Service data shows the ratio of medical practitioners to New Zealanders in 1996 was 211 per 100,000 population, up from 156 per 100,000 in 1980. The same data shows New Zealand had 81 GPs per 100,000 population in 1996, up from 58 per 100,000 in 1980.

"In figures for the 13 years from 1984 to 1996 inclusive, the number of specialist doctors had increased from 55 to 64 per 100,000 people.

"Registered nurse numbers show New Zealand had 642 registered nurses for every 100,000 people in 1984. By 1996 that number had increased to 866 nurses per 100,000 people.

"The number of physiotherapists per 100,000 people increased from 52 to 64 per 100,000 population from 1984 to 1996.

"The number of dentists per 100,000 people remained almost static over the 13 year period, increasing from 36 to 38 dentists per 100,000 people.

"The data shows pharmacist numbers have also being fairly constant since 1987 after a drop in numbers from 1986. New Zealand had 67 pharmacists per 100,000 people in 1996," Mr English said.
