"New Zealand will consider the United States' formal request for assistance in the event of military action against Iraq," Foreign and Trade Minister Don McKinnon, said today.

Mr McKinnon met with US Ambassador Josiah Beeman in Wellington this morning, where Mr Beeman formally asked for New Zealand's support.

"We have had a request to be part of a coalition of countries that will provide support for multinational military action, should it be necessary, against Iraq," Mr McKinnon said.

"Ministers will be discussing the request over the next few days and at Cabinet on Monday." Mr McKinnon said it was New Zealand's strong preference for the situation in Iraq to be resolved through diplomatic means. "But if Iraq continues to flout Security Council resolutions authorising UN Weapons Inspectors full and unobstructed access to suspect sites containing weapons of mass destruction,including chemical and biological weapons, then clearly stronger action should be expected.

"These weapons pose a very serious threat to security. It is the express will of the international community that they are found and destroyed."
