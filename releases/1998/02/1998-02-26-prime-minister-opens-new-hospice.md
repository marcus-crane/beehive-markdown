"The Nurse Maude Centenary Hospice is an excellent example of a cooperative and collaborative approach between the public and other health providers in delivering health services to the community," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said on opening the new facility in Christchurch today.

"For those who have expressed concerns about the 'privatising' of health services, the opening of this new hospice is a classic example of what can be achieved through partnership between public and other health providers.

"The wider Canterbury area now has a brand new hospice/palliative care facility which is second to none in terms of quality and improved services. This has been achieved with half the funding coming from central government through the Health Funding Agency and the other half being raised by Nurse Maude.

"Hospices world-wide are either fully supported by their communities or have approximately half of their costs met by public funding.

"In the past, palliative care and New Zealand's 37 hospice services had relied entirely on community support. But in 1993 the Ministry of Health identified hospice/palliative care as a core health service and public funding for these services now covers 50 per cent of their costs, with the balance being funded by the community.

"Nurse Maude are to be congratulated on building a new eleven bed purpose-built hospice which will provide palliative care and hospice services to the wider Canterbury region. The Hospice will look after 300 - 400 patients each year as well providing 20,000 - 25,000 hours of palliative care to people in their own homes.

"Nurse Maude has a long and impressive record of providing not-for-profit quality health care services to the people of Canterbury. The hospice is a fitting centenary project.

"This Hospice, as a medical and nursing facility will provide free support and relief to the terminally ill, their family and carers, including day care, bereavement care and counselling, home help, occupational and physiotherapy and information and education.

"For those facing a terminal illness this Hospice will help alleviate pain and suffering and ensure that patients and families are supported in a loving and caring environment.

"The Nurse Maude Centenary Hospice will provide an invaluable service to the people of Canterbury, " said Mrs Shipley.
