Health Minister Bill English announced today that international health representatives would be in the country next week to learn about New Zealand's health system.

"Worldwide, advances in medical science and aging populations are pushing up health costs. New Zealand is not immune from these real and increasing pressures on health dollars as we try to get the best health care from available funds," Mr English said.

"We are recognised for putting initiatives in place to improve our public health services. The 25-strong delegation is on a fact finding tour of New Zealand, Australia and Singapore to study recent experience of modernising health systems.

"The tour is organised by the World Bank which funds health projects in developing countries. I welcome the interest in New Zealand's experience and hope lessons drawn from here can benefit others," he said.

"During the four-day visit, delegates will visit the Orakei Marae and the Auckland Medical School and hear from a range of speakers, including myself, and Associate Health Minister Tuariki John Delamere.

"This visit provides us with an opportunity to make a realistic assessment of the changes we have made and to discuss which have been more successful than others and why," Mr English said.
