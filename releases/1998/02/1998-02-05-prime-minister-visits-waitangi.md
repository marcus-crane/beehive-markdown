Prime Minister Jenny Shipley is today visiting Waitangi. "It is my earnest desire to see the official commemoration of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi return to Waitangi in the not too distant future.

"However this can only be achieved if both parties to the Treaty accommodate and communicate with each other on the how that can happen," Mrs Shipley said.

"My decision to visit Waitangi is in support of the progress Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has made in seeking to restate the importance of the two parties to the Treaty being represented at Waitangi to commemorate the signing of the Treaty.

"For both parties, Waitangi can be a place where we renew our commitment to honour the Treaty as we progress New Zealand's interests."

On Waitangi Day tomorrow, the Prime Minister will begin the day by attending the flag raising ceremony on the Treaty Grounds at Waitangi before returning to Wellington to attend a community event at the Cannons Creek Fanau Centre in Porirua and official Waitangi celebrations at Government House.

"It's good to see a wide range of events marking Waitangi Day in communities all around the country, and that should also continue into the future." Mrs Shipley said the Coalition Government was committed to settling Treaty claims in order to address and remove the sense of grievance caused by historical injustices.

"This process is a bridge to a future where these matters can be put behind us and new opportunities can unfold for all New Zealanders. "The Coalition Government has made significant progress negotiating and implementing durable settlements of claims under the Treaty of Waitangi and we remain committed to settling all major claims by 2000.

"I hope that my presence at Waitangi will affirm that the Coalition Government is serious about commemoration, reconciliation and progressing New Zealand's interests," Mrs Shipley said.
