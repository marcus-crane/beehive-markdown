The number of youth crimes committed in Wellington has been dramatically slashed by over one third - proof that Government initiatives to combat youth crime are working, says Hon Deborah Morris, Wellington List MP and Minister of Youth Affairs.

"The partnership approach taken by the Police, the Wellington Youth Network, the Safer Community Council, local schools and the Children Young &gt;Persons and their Families Service, is at the root of the tremendous &gt;success in cutting crime in Wellington.

"Most crime is carried out by a surprisingly small number of people, and it is by working on habitual offenders that local Police have been able to tackle crime effectively. In particular a crack down on local gangs has &gt;been successful in cutting crime.

"It is important to help young people reform before becoming hardened habitual offenders. The Family Group Conference process is one of the keys to helping young people get back on the rails. New Zealand has taken the lead internationally when it comes to the use of Family Group Conferences and they are now being considered by Tony Blair for use in England.

"The Government has done a lot during the last year to help combat crime. We have provided: $3.13 million to expand Police Youth Aid; 200 extra police; $10 million extra funding to combat truancy; and $3 million extra for drug education.

"Wellington is now beginning to see the fruits of the Coalition Government's commitment to tackling youth crime," concluded Deborah Morris.
