The Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today expressed his disappointment at the outcomes of the latest round of talks with Japan and Australia on the conservation of southern bluefin tuna (SBT).

The talks, held in Canberra late last week, have failed to come to a satisfactory agreement on the ongoing management of this fishstock, including agreement to catch limit. Japan continues to insist on an increase in catch of 3000 tonnes.

'The Japanese continue to threaten to move away from the tripartite forum that has operated for the last 15 years between New Zealand, Australia and themselves. Japan has also stated it will take a 2000 tonne increase in catch to carry out what they call "experimental fishing" on southern blufin tuna despite strong objections from New Zealand and Australia,' said Mr Luxton.

'These measures place an already stressed stock at further risk and are unacceptable,' he said.

After heavy exploitation in the 1960s and 1970s the Southern Bluefin Tuna stock is now estimated to be less than 5?8% of its original size.

'This highly migratory species must be carefully managed. The New Zealand Government will make every effort to ensure that the sustainability of southern bluefin tuna on the high seas and within our EEZ is assured,' said Mr Luxton.

"The Government will continue to suspend any decision on access to Japanese licence vessels to fish for non-New Zealand SBT quota in New Zealand waters."

Access was initially denied after the last round of talks held in Canberra in late January failed to reach an agreement on sustainable catch levels.

'It is likely that this action will continue until an acceptable limit is agreed upon.'

The Government is also fully committed to the appropriate management of SBT through the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Blufin Tuna involving New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. The Commission is the best international mechanism to ensure the sustainable management of southern blufin tuna," Mr Luxton concluded.
