Health Minister Bill English said today it was likely around 6,000 hospital admissions a year for heart disease and strokes could be prevented by people eating less salt.

"An ounce of prevention is quite clearly worth a ton of cure," he said.

Mr English was commenting on the latest report to the National Health Committee, which showed that eating roughly a teaspoon less salt a day was likely to reduce strokes by 22 percent and heart attacks by 16 percent. It was also more likely to reduce strokes and heart attacks in older people than current treatments for high blood pressure.

"We all know that we shouldn't smoke, that we should do more exercise and eat healthier foods. But this latest report really brings it home that something so simple and so cheap like cutting down on salt will probably do more good than all the medicines available.

"It would also mean about 6,000 New Zealanders would not be admitted to hospital with heart disease and strokes.

"People who don't take what steps they can now to keep themselves healthy are really burying their heads in the sand. There are always going to be people who need the high-tech treatments, but the rest of us should do what we can to make sure we don't end up needing surgery and other expensive treatments for heart disease," he said.

The report Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older New Zealanders is open for comment until 31 March 1998 after which final recommendations will be made to the Minister.
