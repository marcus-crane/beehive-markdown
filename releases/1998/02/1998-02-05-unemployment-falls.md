Minister of Employment Peter McCardle said today that he was pleased by a drop in official unemployment in the December quarter.

Household Labour Force Survey results for the December 1997 quarter released today show seasonally adjusted unemployment at 6.7%, down from 6.8% in the August 1997 quarter.

Many commentators predicated a significant increase but the information we &gt;had was that New Zealand was weathering international developments, Mr McCardle said.

He said the majority of forecasting agencies predict strengthening economic &gt;growth in the next financial year.

New Zealand can continue to take confidence from the fact that today's result maintains our official unemployment rate lower than the OECD average of 7.2%," he said.

The Government?s priorities over this term continue to be to foster stronger economic growth, while focusing employment policy on addressing &gt;the stubborn long-term unemployment statistics that have been persistent in New Zealand since the late 1980s, he said.
