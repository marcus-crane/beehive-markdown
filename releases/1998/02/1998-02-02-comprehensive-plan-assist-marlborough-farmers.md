Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has announced a comprehensive plan to assist Marlborough farmers.

"It has not rained significantly in Marlborough for eight months, and there is now little feed and some farms are without sufficient water. Farmers have been forced to begin selling capital stock while remaining stock is at risk from a deteriorating water supply," Dr Smith said. "That is a disaster for the Marlborough region and in particular for the 300 farmers and their families who are worst hit."

Dr Smith announced a Government Recovery Plan to assist:

- A commitment to fully support the Federated Farmers Drought Coordination Programme in order for it to continue for a further three months.
- The army has generously agreed to assist in transporting water and feed to stock. A grant will be made to assist in negotiating the purchase of additional services such as Cook Strait transport.
- A grant to the local drought management committee for it to purchase urgent technical advice such as farm surveys and model farm budgets.
- A grant for rural support coordinators to provide independent advice to farmers, and assist them with dealings with banks and government departments. Such financial advice would provide a basis for the Department of Social Welfare to consider applications for assistance.
- Providing Rural Assistance Grants to farmers who are unable to meet day-to-day living costs but who are ineligible for Special Needs Grants. Dr Smith and Social Welfare Minister Roger Sowry will shortly finalise criteria for the grants, which provide $180 per week for a married couple with one child and are assessed monthly.

The package, excluding the army assistance and Income Support provisions, will cost up to $83,500.

Dr Smith said the package was comparable with assistance provided in the past to farmers hit with extreme climatic events, such as the 1996 hailstorms, and therefore does not set any new precedent.
