The United States has not said it will not sign the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said tonight.

"The Reuters report was a beat up," Dr Smith said. New Zealand's trade negotiators spoke today with the US's Ambassador to the OECD who consulted with US Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the State Department, Stuart Eizenstat, who gave assurances that the US negotiating team was on its way to Paris for negotiations scheduled to begin tomorrow night (New Zealand time).

The US reported that it intended to work as hard as possible to make as much progress as possible. The US believed progress would be made but that it could not make the April deadline.

"The confusion over this issue has nevertheless been helpful because it demonstrates that the Alliance's campaign against the MAI is as misplaced as its premature celebration of its demise," Dr Smith said. "Should the MAI be concluded, it will not lead to any of the extraordinary things the Alliance claims.

"What it would do is help protect the approximately $30 billion New Zealanders have invested overseas, and help contribute to job growth in New Zealand and internationally." Should the MAI not be concluded, Dr Smith said that would be disappointing but not the end of the world. "New Zealand already has an open and competitive economy so we could expect to continue to be a preferred destination for job-creating overseas investment."

Any failure to conclude the MAI would not see the end of efforts to reach agreement on fair international rules for overseas investment, Dr Smith concluded.
