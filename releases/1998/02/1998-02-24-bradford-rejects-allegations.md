Energy Minister Max Bradford totally rejects allegations that the Government had known about the "impending crisis" with Auckland's electricity for at least a year.

Mr Bradford said the Government was informed on Friday night of the central Auckland supply failure, and as such, had decided to hold a formal inquiry into it.

"The first priorities must be for Mercury Energy to urgently repair the failed electricity cables, and for emergency services to meet any problems during the black-out period," he said.

"During this time, the Government's primary role is to ensure that the Civil Defence and public health and safety issues arising from the supply failure are well managed."

On the broader question of electricity reforms, Mr Bradford said that rather back off, the Auckland crisis was an example of why the Government needed to move forward.

"The reforms will do more for avoiding a repeat of the crisis Auckland faces now, than returning to the policies of the past," he said.
