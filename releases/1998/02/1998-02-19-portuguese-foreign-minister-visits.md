Mr Gama is the first Portuguese Foreign Minister, and the second Portuguese Cabinet Minister to ever visit New Zealand. Mr McKinnon will talk to Mr Gama about current Asia-Pacific issues, such as the Asian economic crisis and the Bougainville peace negotiations. They will also discuss East Timor and the situation in Iraq.

"Portugal has an economy of a similar size to New Zealand and is a well-established member of the European Union," Mr McKinnon said. "Mr Gama and I will also discuss a proposed visit by a Portuguese trade delegation to NZ later this year."
