Tourism Minister Murray McCully has welcomed news that Australian officials have withdrawn their advice warning Australians to defer travelling to Auckland because of the power crisis.

Mr McCully complained to the Australian High Commission that the advice was inaccurate, unfair and very unfriendly.

Today, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade responded with updated Consular Travel Advice that power has been restored to all major hotels and both New Zealand citizens and visitors are being welcomed back into Auckland's CBD.

Mr McCully said he was pleased that Australia had altered its position in light of the new information.

"I have been to Auckland and met with the major hotel operators myself," he said. "The main problem is the perception of the situation not the reality.

"I would like to assure both Australians and the rest of New Zealand that the Auckland hotels are able to offer a high standard of accommodation and service and there is absolutely no case for any messages to the contrary. "
