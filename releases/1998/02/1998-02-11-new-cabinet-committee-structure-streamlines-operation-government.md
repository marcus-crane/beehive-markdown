Major changes to the structure of Cabinet Committees were announced today by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

"In consultation with the Deputy Prime Minister I have decided that major Cabinet Committees will be reduced to four, with three subcommittees. In 1997 there were 12 Cabinet Committees."

The four major Cabinet Committees will be:

Cabinet Strategy Committee  
Cabinet Social Policy Committee  
Cabinet Economic Committee  
Cabinet Legislation Committee  
The three subcommittees of the Cabinet Strategy Committee will meet as required.

They are: the subcommittee on Expenditure Control and Government Administration, the subcommittee on Appointments and Honours and the subcommittee on Intelligence and Security.

"In December when I took up office as Prime Minister we set clear goals for the Coalition. Among those was improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Government and the use of Ministers' time," said Mrs Shipley.

"The redesign of Cabinet Committees and streamlining of their business is aimed at focusing the Government's attention on its social and economic goals, as well as improving the efficiency of decision-making. "Ministers are now working in clusters and expect to resolve the detail of policy and legislation proposals prior to bringing them into the committee system.

"The organisational changes are intended to improve the quality of the decision-making process and free up Ministers so that they can spend more time working with the public," said Mrs Shipley.
