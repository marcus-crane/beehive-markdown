The Labour Party is adopting the "all talk and no substance" approach to tertiary education with the launch of its tertiary education campaign for 1998, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Labour is very quick to make sweeping claims about the state of tertiary education in New Zealand and about the Government's tertiary education policy, but where are Labour's answers? Labour has again failed to come up with concrete detail about what it would do instead.

"The Government on the other hand is developing a range of policies designed to improve the delivery of tertiary education for students.

"At the heart of the Tertiary Education Review is a Government commitment to making certain that as many young people as possible are able to access tertiary education. We want all tertiary institutions to deliver a quality education and to use the taxpayer funding they receive from the Government wisely and well."

Mr Creech said Labour was trotting out the same old arguments against tertiary fees and student loans.

"But like it or not the student loan scheme has opened access to tertiary study for many students who would never have attended. In addition the Government is working on developing a system of universal student allowances for tertiary students," Mr Creech said.

"It is all very well to get emotive and scaremonger about tertiary education, but anyone who looks behind the rhetoric will realise that the proposals in the Tertiary Education Review are about quality and accountability and delivering for students."

Mr Creech said Labour's use of statistics to try to back its claims of "dropping participation" was misleading and exaggerated.

Labour expresses concern that there are fewer first year students enrolling in tertiary education - a 4.3% decrease in 1997 from 1995.

"The main reason for the fall in first year enrolments is the fact there are fewer students of school leaving age to go on to tertiary study so of course there will be a reduction in first year enrolments," Mr Creech said.

The following table shows the number of student enrolments and the relationship between reducing number of school leavers and first year students.

Year # Tertiary Students # First Year Tertiary Students # School Leavers in previous year 1995 208 833 53 551 56 061 1996 208 729 51 826 53 819 1997 (as at 31 July 1997) 214 228 49 942 51 487 % Change 95-97 2.6% -6.7% -8.2% % Change 96-97 2.6% -3.6% -4.3%

"Labour also seems to imply that the growth in enrolments in the polytechnic sector and Colleges of Education is something to be concerned about. The fact is that this is where we train our teachers and where people get the technical skills business need and we should be encouraged by this growth.

"The biggest revelation from Labour's tertiary education campaign launch today is that Labour won't commit to what it will do for tertiary education in the future. It again begs the major question of what does Labour actually stand for," Mr Creech said.
