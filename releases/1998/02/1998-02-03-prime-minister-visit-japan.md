Prime Minister Jenny Shipley is to visit Japan from 8-12 March as an official guest of the Japanese Government, in her second overseas engagement as Prime Minister.

"This will be my first visit to Japan as Prime Minister, and will be the first official visit to Japan by a New Zealand Prime Minister since 1976. "We have many interests in common and our relationship with Japan is strong and broadly based," the Prime Minister said.

"Japan is a major economic partner for New Zealand, with two-way trade in the last June year totalling $6 billion. There are also extensive contacts through shared business interests, tourism, schools, sister cities, and working holiday programmes for young people."

The visit will begin with a meeting and lunch with the Emperor and Empress. The Prime Minister will also have talks with her counterpart Prime Minister Hashimoto. Issues which are likely to be covered include bi-lateral relations, economic and political developments in Asia and international issues of common interest.

During the visit, Mrs Shipley is scheduled to deliver a speech at a lunch hosted by Japan's major economic organisations and give a press conference at the Japan Press Club.

Mrs Shipley will open New Zealand displays at FOODEX, a showcase for New Zealand food exporters. Mrs Shipley will also visit Osaka, and will launch a New Zealand Tourism Board promotion aimed at increasing New Zealand's share of Japan's tourism market.

"I am looking forward to consolidating links with one of our most important bilateral partners," said Mrs Shipley.
