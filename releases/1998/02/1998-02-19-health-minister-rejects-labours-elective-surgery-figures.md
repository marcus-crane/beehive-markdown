Health Minister Bill English today totally rejected figures released by Labour showing future cuts to elective surgery.

"The cuts Labour keeps talking about will not happen. Labour has been predicting cuts in elective surgery for years. The reality is the number of people getting publicly funded elective surgery has increased each year for the last three years.

"I am working right now to make sure our public health service provides more certainty for people needing elective surgery, regardless of their income, and that those people are told when their operation will take place.

"That is why we're implementing a booking system on July 1, so every person waiting for publicly funded surgery will know the day they will get their operation.

"We're using any new money we receive in the Budget to fund elective surgery. We are also asking the Health Funding Authority find ways to allocate funds so that any increases in costs in pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests, and others areas do not mean the amount left for elective surgery is constantly under threat.

"That system of funding elective surgery from what's left over, after we pay all the other bills in health, is no longer good enough. New Zealanders expect and are going to get a better system, with more certainty round elective surgery, this year. " Mr English said.
