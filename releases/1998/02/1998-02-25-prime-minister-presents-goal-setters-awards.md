"For business and New Zealand's overall economy to stay competitive we must be prepared to adapt and change if necessary," said Jenny Shipley in addressing the Rotary Club of Port Nicholson this morning at the Goal Setters Awards.

"To continue to do well as a growing export-led economy, with the problems in Asia, we need to keep focussing on efficiency and how we can do things differently.

"We also need to recognise opportunities as they arise and pursue them vigorously.

"It is timely to firstly remember that while we have been experiencing strong export growth in the Asian markets, the majority of our trade is in Australia, Europe, Japan and the United States.

"Secondly, that at times like these, greatest opportunity for businesses exists at the top and lower ends of the market. When people are making spending choices consumer psychology shows that people will buy essential goods at the lower end of the market and substantial high quality goods at the upper end.

"Manufacturers and exporters need to think through how they can turn this to their advantage.

"Accepting challenges, pursuing opportunities and setting goals are all hallmarks for not only successful businesses but also successful individuals.

"The five finalists of the Rotary Club of Port Nicholson Goal Setters Award have all shown determination in overcoming the odds and pursued opportunities through training to improve their lives.

"Their stories demonstrate what is possible when people believe in their own ability to make changes in their lives and create a brighter future.

"It is pleasing to see this year the Education and Training Support Agency who run the TOPS programme, have been involved in selecting the finalists.

"The TOPS programme continues to make a positive difference for hundreds of New Zealanders each year as it gives people a second chance at gaining new skills.

"I commend the Rotary Club of Port Nicholson for their ongoing commitment to recognising achievement through their Goal Setters Awards. I congratulate all the finalists and am delighted to present the prize of $1000 each to this year's joint winners Polly Anna Karaitiana and Nikolic Milivoje.

"We can all learn from their determination to remove barriers, overcome the odds and succeed with flair," concluded Jenny Shipley.
