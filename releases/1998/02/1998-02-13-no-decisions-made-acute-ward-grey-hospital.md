Health Minister Bill English said today he had made no decisions yet on a new acute mental health ward at Grey Hospital.

"A business case for the reorganisation of mental health facilities on the Coast, including a new acute wing at Grey Hospital, was received from Coast Health Care just prior to Christmas.

"The Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU) is now evaluating the business case and is expecting to report to me by early March," he said.

Mr English denied a report today that he had said the acute wing was unlikely because of funding constraints.

"I have made no decisions yet and will not be making any decisions until after I have received CCMAU's report on the business case.

"Around the country mental health services are being changed so that, where possible, people with pyschiatric illnesses are cared for in the community. Hospital-based services will continue to be provided for people with an acute need.

"The changes proposed to mental health services on the Coast are part of this process," he said.
