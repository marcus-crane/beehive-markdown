Health Minister Bill English said today that there were no quick-fix solutions to resolving historical funding inequities for Canterbury Health.

"The Canterbury Region is not under-funded on a total per head basis, as figures from the Health Funding Authority show. However, within the hospital sector in the southern region it is accepted that Canterbury has been historically under-funded.

"Efforts have been made in recent years to improve funding for Canterbury Health. In the 1995/96 year it was $180.3 million. This financial year it will be $195.6 million including Waiting Times Fund allocations.

"I look forward to the day when all the managers and chief executives of South Island hospitals can agree on how to organise hospital services in the southern region in a way that is fair to everyone.

"Every hospital I have visited in the South Island firmly believes it is worse off than the rest. I would be keen to see Canterbury Health present its case for more funding to the Timaru, Dunedin and Invercargill hospitals.

"There just aren't any quick-fix solutions to this issue.

"Canterbury Health knows this. It also knows that there is work it must do, for instance work to bring down the rate of growth in acute admissions. Canterbury needs to work with its general practitioners, as other hospitals have done, to do this.

"The Government expects both sides of the health sector - the people who pay the bills and the people who provide the services - to work together co-operatively. I am pleased that Canterbury Health and the Funding Authority have met recently and agreed a process to share information to address the funding issue," he said.

Mr English said a suggestion from Labour MP Annette King that Canterbury's problems stem from the Population Based Funding Formula was nonsense and showed how little she understood about health.

"Changing the formula, as Annette King suggests, will simply transfer money from one part of the public health service to another.

"Labour has already admitted it is not in favour of increasing health spending to a set portion of GDP as a number of people suggested last year. Annette King needs to front-up to the people of Canterbury and say what health services she thinks they should lose so that more can be spent on the hospital," he said.
