Labour Minister Max Bradford said today about 14,000 submissions and about 20,000 trade union campaign postcards had been received in response to public consultation on the Government's review of the Holidays Act. The vast majority of submissions were form letters, with about 500 substantive submissions.

Mr Bradford said the Government would be taking a long hard look at the response over the next month or so. "Anyone who suggests the Government is not consulting the public about potential changes to industrial relations legislation is mistaken," he said. "Public consultation is an integral part of any legislative change under our democratic system."

"The fact is that all the initiatives require thorough investigation of issues and options. That process should be able to happen without the prejudice of ill-founded speculation so that we can get sound, reasoned options." Mr Bradford said it was important to note that there would be further opportunities for submissions during the select committee process that precedes any legislative change.

He said the Government had made it clear from the start that it wanted to know what people really thought, not what others decided they should think. "The review of the Holidays Act is about modernising laws which are half a century old, and giving people the freedom to negotiate what suits them - while still protecting their present entitlements to holidays," he said "None of the options provide for employees to be forced to give up their holidays. None provide for employees to force employers to allow them to work on holidays."

The four options put forward for public consultation last year are: * Essentially the status quo - three weeks annual holidays which cannot be traded for cash, 11 public holidays which may be exchanged for days in lieu but not for cash, and five days special leave which can not be traded for cash;

\* Three weeks' annual holidays which cannot be traded for cash, 11 public holidays which can be exchanged for days in lieu or cash and five days or one week's special leave which can not be traded for cash;

\* Two weeks annual holiday which cannot be traded for cash and one weeks annual leave which can be traded, 11 public holidays which can be exchanged for days in lieu but not cash and five days special leave which can not be traded for cash

\* Two weeks annual holiday which cannot be traded for cash and one weeks annual leave which can be traded, 11 public holidays which can be exchanged for days in lieu or cash and five days special leave which can not be traded for cash.

"Neither the Government, nor I personally, will be taking holidays away from New Zealanders, " Mr Bradford said. "Holidays are an important part of all our lives - a time to take a break from our work, relax, spend time with our families and friends, and recharge our batteries.

"The question we have put to the public is what sort of choice they want in the way they enjoy their leave entitlements. This is exactly what the Holidays Act review is about."
