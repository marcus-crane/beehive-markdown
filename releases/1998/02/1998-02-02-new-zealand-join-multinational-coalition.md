New Zealand will participate in the multinational Coalition formed to pursue Iraq's compliance with United Nations obligations to abandon its illegal weapons of mass destruction programmes, the Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

The Government's decision was announced following Cabinet consideration of a United States request for New Zealand to support the Coalition. New Zealand's contribution to the Coalition will include up to 20 Special Air Services (SAS) personnel for the principal role of search and rescue. They will work in collaboration with an Australian SAS unit, whose contribution has already been announced by Australia.

"In addition the Government has agreed to commit two RNZAF Orions to carry out surveillance and search and rescue functions. An RNZAF C130 Hercules aircraft will be employed to carry personnel and equipment to the area, but will then return to New Zealand.

"New Zealand strongly supports the efforts underway through the United Nations to find a diplomatic solution to the impasse with Iraq," the Prime Minister said. "We will continue to push for a diplomatic resolution prior to force being used. New Zealand hopes that by supporting the Coalition a diplomatic solution may be more likely. "None of us wish to see military action ensue with the loss of life this may entail.

"The central issue is that Iraq's government has failed to meet legally binding obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687. These are legal obligations under Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter, the breach of which provides a basis, if necessary, for enforcement action by the international community," the Prime Minister said.

"Decisions to deploy New Zealand military personnel overseas, into situations which may require them to act in support of military operations, are never easy. "Our hope remains that diplomacy will prevail and that Iraq can be brought to comply with its obligations by peaceful negotiation rather than by military means.

Regrettably, however, the failure to date of diplomatic efforts to persuade Iraq to meet its UN obligations mean that direct military action to enforce the Security Council's resolutions may shortly commence.

"The Government is fully satisfied that its decision to participate in the Coalition is consistent with New Zealand's longstanding support for the provisions of the United Nations Charter and collective security, our abhorrence of chemical and biological weapons, and our tradition as a responsible international citizen.

"In the final analysis, when diplomacy fails, New Zealand must be prepared to act in concert with others to uphold and if necessary enforce international peace and security. Our decision today reflects that policy," said Mrs Shipley
