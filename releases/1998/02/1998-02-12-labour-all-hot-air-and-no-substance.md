Labour leader Helen Clark's speech today was a fizzer, despite promises it would provide a thunderous start to 1998, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"She had the chance to outline her party's programme for the year, but failed to do so.

"Labour has been in opposition for eight years and still has no detailed policy or programme," Mr Peters said.

"By contrast, this Coalition Government has a successful plan, based on the Coalition Agreement and detailed in The Budget. Our plan is pro-growth, and includes an effective social investment programme."

Mr Peters said it was long overdue for Ms Clark to put the rhetoric behind and clearly state Labour's position.
