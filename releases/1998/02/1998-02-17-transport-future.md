"Road reform is a continuation of the 15 year move to establish a strong transport system that looks to the future," Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson, told delegates at the New Zealand Land Transport Conference today.

"The transport sector is enjoying an innovative, competitive and service orientated environment in all modes except for roading. It is now time to bring about change ," the Minister said. "Reform of shipping, railways and aviation has supported economic  
growth by providing flexible, cost efficient services.

"While the road transport sector has changed considerably over the last decade the roading network which they operate on is still encased in a system that looks to the past not the future. "Submissions on the Roading Advisory Group's report are due in by the end of this week. We will then have a much clearer idea of where there is support and where there are concerns.

"We know that most people support a user pays system and many now appreciate the fairness of road pricing. What we need to know is, what people think of this specific detailed model. "I can assure that whatever the decision on Road Reform the Government sees keeping the network open and maintaining appropriate standards as essential.

"Many of the ideas in the report are on the cutting edge of transport models and are being looked at world wide. I find that encouraging," said Mr Williamson.
