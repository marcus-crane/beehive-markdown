Hon Philip Burdon has been appointed Chair of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation's Business Advisory Council (ABAC) from next year, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

The appointment will be concurrent with New Zealand's term as chair of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) process in 1999. ABAC Leaders agreed in 1995 to establish a permanent source of business advice for APEC.

Since 1995, Mr Burdon has been one of New Zealand's three representatives on ABAC, together with Roseanne Meo and Kerry MacDonald. Mrs Shipley said ABAC plays an important role in enabling a direct business input to the work of APEC.

"The accelerated reduction of trade barriers in such sectors as forest and fish products, and support for economic and technical co-operation between APEC economies will be among the areas where ABAC is placed to contribute direct business advice to APEC Governments in the coming year," said Mrs Shipley.

In addition to his ABAC responsibilities, Mr Burdon is the current Chair of the Asia 2000 Foundation and is a member of the International Board of Advisors to the Romulo Foundation for Peace and Development, based in Manila. He is also active in the commercial world and holds directorships in a variety of public and private organisations, including the World Wildlife Fund and Lincoln University Holdings Ltd.

Mr Burdon was a Member of Parliament from 1981 to 1996. From 1990 he held the Trade Negotiations and Commerce and Industry portfolios and from 1993 he was Minister of State Owned Enterprises.

"We are lucky to have Mr Burdon's extensive business and political experience available to help support the success of our Chairing of APEC in 1999," said Mrs Shipley. "I wish him and his fellow New Zealand representatives on ABAC, every success as they continue their worthwhile work," she said.
