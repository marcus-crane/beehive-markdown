Peters Supports Calls for Full Inquiry and Public Accountability  
The Hon Winston Peters MP, Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, today called for a full inquiry into the events surrounding the power supply crisis in Auckland.

"The public have a right to know the facts. This crisis is having a grave impact on daily life in Auckland, especially in the commercial and business sector, and all Aucklanders have a right to hold Mercury Energy accountable." said Mr Peters.

Mr Peters said the matter would be discussed at this morning's Cabinet meeting.

"Canada has recently faced a similar, and prolonged power crisis that brought cities like Montreal to a virtual standstill. But that crisis was due to weather. To date there are no such answers for the people of Auckland for the present crisis," said Mr Peters.
