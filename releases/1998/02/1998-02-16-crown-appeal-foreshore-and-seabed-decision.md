The Attorney-General, Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today the Crown will appeal an interim decision from the Maori Land Court on the Marlborough Sounds foreshore and seabed.

The appeal, to the Maori Appellate Court, will be filed before the 22 February 1998 deadline set by the Judge. In an interim decision issued in December, Judge Hingston found that there may be Maori customary rights to New Zealand's foreshore and seabed.

Because of the complex legal issues involved the Judge granted leave for the parties to appeal his decision to the Maori Appellate Court.
