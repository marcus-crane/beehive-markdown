"It is totally erroneous to suggest the Government is already committed to a strategy for road reform," Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson said today.

"The Government supports the principle of a more commercial approach to the management of and funding of New Zealand Roads but how this might be achieved will be shaped by the public consultation currently underway. "The decision on the future of roading is not being made in isolation. "In fact the process of public consultation on this issue began in 1994 and will continue throughout this year in various transport forums, and select committee meetings.

"The Government will not be privatising the roading network or system and intends to maintain the existing roading network. "New Zealand is not alone in trying to fix national roading problems. "From the Economist, 6 December 1997 I quote: ' If roads continue to be operated as one of the last relics of a Soviet-style command economy, then the consequences will be worsening traffic jams and eventual Bangkok - style gridlock..... persuading motorists that road pricing is good for them is a task that politicians around the world are only just beginning to take up.'

"The Government is committed to creating a fair and efficient roading system that works for all New Zealanders," said Mr Williamson
