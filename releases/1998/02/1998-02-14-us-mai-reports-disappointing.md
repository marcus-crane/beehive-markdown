Trade Minister Lockwood Smith says reports that the United States does not intend to sign the Multilateral Agreement on Investment are not entirely unexpected but disappointing, and New Zealand is urgently seeking their confirmation.

"Since 1995, OECD members, including New Zealand and the United States, have been seeking a high-standard investment agreement which would lead to the freer flow of investment capital under agreed international rules, helping to create jobs," Dr Smith said.

"Recently, the negotiations have been leading towards a less comprehensive MAI which would not have had the same job-creating impact New Zealand hoped for.

This would inevitably lead some countries to reconsider whether the MAI was worth signing at all.

"It is ironic that on one hand the United States is concerned about the proposed agreement because it may do very little, while in New Zealand we have witnessed an entirely dishonest campaign by the Alliance in which it claimed, falsely, that the MAI would do all sorts of weird and wonderful things."

Dr Smith said the Government was seeking urgent confirmation of the reports which, if verified, would call into question the likelihood of the proposed agreement being concluded. New Zealand officials arrive in Paris tomorrow (New Zealand time) for further negotiations on the proposed agreement.
