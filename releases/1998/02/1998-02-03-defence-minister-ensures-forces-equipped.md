Defence Minister Max Bradford, in releasing the Defence briefing papers, said today his first priority as new Minister was to ensure our forces had the people and equipment to do the job - in peace, or should our security ever be seriously threatened, in combat.

"But first we have to get the people issues right. The forces have suffered a steady erosion in manpower in recent years as highly trained specialists leave for better jobs in the private sector," he said.

"In place right now is a Defence Force initiative called Service 21, led by the Chief of Defence Staff, Lieutenant General Tony Birks, which is designed to attract good people into the forces on terms that better mirror conditions in the modern workforce. It is a focus I thoroughly support. Without happy people in their job, all the best equipment in the world won't help."

Mr Bradford said it was also important to ensure that the recommendations of the recent Defence White Paper were put in place as quickly as possible. "That means replacing old and obsolete equipment with the best that can be bought for the price. It means reversing years of slow decline in the fighting capabilities of our forces, brought about largely by cuts in defence spending as governments worked to resolve our fiscal problems and put the New Zealand economy back on track.

The 1997 Defence Assessment has done just that, and it is doing so within the Coalition Government's spending cap," he said. "I give my full support to Defence personnel, and to ensuring that the men and women in the defence forces are properly resourced to do their task," he said. Mr Bradford was appointed Defence Minister in December.

He made his first field visit last week - a short familiarisation tour of Bougainville. Mr Bradford said he was impressed with what he saw of the New Zealand men and women involved in the Truce Monitoring Group. "If every New Zealander could see the great job our Defence Force does to establish peace and help with reconstruction of a shattered society, they would be proud," he said.
