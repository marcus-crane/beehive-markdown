The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, departs New Zealand on Saturday 28 February for a two week visit to the UK and Africa.

Mr McKinnon, who is the Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), will attend the CMAG meeting in London 2-3 March. CMAG was established at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Auckland in 1995. This meeting will focus on Nigeria's progress towards democracy and consequently on their future membership of the Commonwealth. Sierra Leone, where the military regime has just been overthrown, is also under review.

In London Mr McKinnon will also meet with the UK Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. The UK currently holds the Presidency of the European Union, and New Zealand holds six-monthly consultations with the Presidency. This meeting provides an opportunity to discuss significant foreign policy issues with a major player on the world stage. Sir Leon Brittan, Vice President of the EU will also participate.

While in Africa Mr McKinnon will travel to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique and Botswana.

Mr McKinnon said he is making this trip in his capacity both as Vice Chairman of CMAG - which so far has focused solely on African countries, and as the New Zealand Foreign and Trade Minister.

"As the African economies open up they present us with trade opportunities which we must explore. New Zealand has only two diplomatic posts on the whole of the continent. This visit will see New Zealand continue to build bilateral relationships with African countries, many of whom we have already worked with extensively in United Nations fora."

Mr McKinnon described New Zealand's relationship with South Africa as very promising but said it is important to keep up the momentum.

"South Africa is emerging as an influential voice on world affairs and a major power in Southern Africa. This visit is another step for New Zealand in advancing our relationship with this emerging power."

While in South Africa Mr McKinnon will meet with Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Trade Minister Alec Erwin. He will sign an arrangement for the exchange of observers - who play a critical role in monitoring fishing for toothfish-under the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

New Zealand currently enjoys a solid bilateral relationship with Zimbabwe. While there, Mr McKinnon will further the bilateral relationship through meetings with Foreign Minister Mudenge and other Ministers.

New Zealand has less extensive relationships with Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.

"In my meetings with Ministers from these countries we will be exploring ways to maintain closer contact. As their economies grow we should be well placed to maximise any opportunities which arise."

While in Mozambique Mr McKinnon will also meet the two New Zealand Defence Force de-miners stationed there.
