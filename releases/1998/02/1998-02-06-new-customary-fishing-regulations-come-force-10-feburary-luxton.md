Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today said that he had been advised by the Ministry of Fisheries Chief Executive Officer, Mr Warwick Tuck, that the new conditions for customary fishing will come into effect on February 10 1998.

The new conditions have already been circulated to Maori over the last week and are being gazetted on Monday Feburary 9.

This follows recent activities by a small group of Maori who sought to abuse legitimate Maori customary fishing rights

Mr Luxton said today,"The new conditions clearly state that permission must be obtained from an authorised representative of a marae committee, Maori committee, Runanga or Trust Board, which represents the Iwi or hapu of that area before going fishing.

This permission must state -

\- who can fish;  
\- which species and how many can be caught;  
\- where and when the fish can be taken;  
\- the purpose for and place where the fish will be used;  
\- the signature and name of the person giving permission to take the fish.

"Secondly, the new conditions make it clear that any fish caught under a customary right must not be exchanged or traded for money or any other items under any circumstances.

"These interim conditions will stop abuse of customary fishing rights, while the comprehensive customary fishing regulations continue to be developed by the Crown and iwi representatives.

"This is a complex issue, which we are working constructively through for the benefit of all New Zealanders, Mr Luxton concluded.
