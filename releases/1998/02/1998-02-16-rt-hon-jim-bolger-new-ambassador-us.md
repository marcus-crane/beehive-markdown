New Zealand's next Ambassador to Washington will be the Rt Hon Jim Bolger, Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

"The United States is the pre-eminent power in the world today. Whatever the issues - climate change, global or regional security, or the future of the world trading system - the United States is the central player. The relationship between our two countries is a warm and productive one - close enough to accept some differences.

We have many shared political and economic interests which we pursue in regional and global forums; joint peacekeeping under UN auspices, APEC, the WTO, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and Antarctica are merely some of the more prominent examples.

"The bilateral relationship is vital to NZ. When the total picture is taken into account - trade, investment and tourism flows - the United States is our single largest economic partner. It is our third largest export market and our second large source of imports. Investment from the United States has responded remarkably to the opportunities in NZ. Since 1990 Americans have invested an estimated US$7 billion in our economy. "Mr Bolger, as our Prime Minister for some seven years, is uniquely placed to build on this relationship.

He has played an important part in developing the bilateral relationship. In March 1995 Mr Bolger visited Washington for meetings with the President and his Cabinet - the first visit at the level of Prime Minister for twelve years.

The contacts Mr Bolger has at the highest level of US politics, and the respect that I know he enjoys internationally, make him uniquely well placed for the position. "We are, I consider, very lucky that he and his wife Joan, have agreed to serve NZ once again.

I know they will perform their duties with distinction, integrity and with the support of the large majority of New Zealanders." Mr Bolger is expected to take up his appointment in June.
