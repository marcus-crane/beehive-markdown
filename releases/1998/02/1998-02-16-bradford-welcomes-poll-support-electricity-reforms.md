Energy Minister Max Bradford today welcomed news that a poll had found businesses expressing overwhelming support for further breaking up of the electricity industry to increase competition.

The New Zealand Herald reported it's latest Business Herald- University of Auckland Business School executive poll found only 17 per cent of respondents supported the status quo.

The Government announced it's direction on electricity reform in December, saying the key objective was to get strong downward pressure on costs and prices for consumers, as well as achieving improved economic outcomes.
