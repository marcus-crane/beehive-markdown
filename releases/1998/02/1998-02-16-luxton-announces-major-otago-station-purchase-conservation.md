The Crown has brought Camberleigh Station and exchanged land to create a major new conservation and recreation area in Otago's Rock and Pillar Range, Minister of Lands, the Hon John Luxton said today.

"This is an excellent outcome for both conservation and farming," Mr Luxton said today. The purchase will see Camberleigh and the neighbouring Glencreag Station joined. The new property will be split into a 900 ha sheep and cattle farm on the lower slopes and a 1500 ha conservation area with public access on the upper slopes.

The conservation area will be administered by the Department of Conservation (DOC). The 1500ha of conservation land borders an existing scenic reserve and other areas which farmers have agreed to release for conservation as a result of tenure review.

This has created a continuous 25km conservation area on the eastern face of the Rock and Pillars. The purchase of Camberleigh for over $500,000, is a first in Otago under the Crown pastoral lease tenure review programme. Important conservation land from the current Glencreag Station will be exchanged for freehold interest in the new farm.

"The new conservation area is a prime example of mid to high altitude alpine vegetation which will now be free from the pressure of grazing stock. The change in native plants from grassland at 400m to alpine vegetation over 1000m is highly significant in conservation terms. The upper areas are a breeding ground for the internationally important giant weta," Mr Luxton said. " Important historic features such as Maori plantings and an early survey trig will be preserved. "The Rock and Pillar Range is an key recreational area close to Dunedin city.

Guaranteed public access should enhance existing recreation opportunities such as cross country skiing and tramping. A viable wool and fat stock farm has also been created in an area of good quality pasture land. " I want to thank the owners of Camberleigh and Glencreag for their willingness to help create this national conservation asset," Mr Luxton said.
