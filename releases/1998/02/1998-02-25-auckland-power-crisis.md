Tourism Minister Murray McCully says he is annoyed at some unnecessarily negative international media coverage of the effect the Auckland Power Crisis is having on New Zealand's tourism industry.

Mr McCully has just met with Major Accommodation Providers and other key players from the tourism industry in Auckland to be briefed on how the crisis is affecting them.

"From what I have seen this morning I am much more worried about the perception than the reality," he said.

"I think that the fact that the major hotels are providing pretty much the full range of services for our international visitors is absolutely remarkable and a great testimony to their professionalism," Mr McCully said.

" But there is a very real risk that unwarranted damage will be caused to the industry if the message circulates that Auckland is not able to perform its function as the gateway to New Zealand."

"We need to deal robustly with any unwarranted negative coverage as it occurs," he said.

Mr McCully says he will also be ensuring the New Zealand Tourism Board communicates to its commercial partners and offshore posts that Auckland is able to deliver services to visitors to the city.
