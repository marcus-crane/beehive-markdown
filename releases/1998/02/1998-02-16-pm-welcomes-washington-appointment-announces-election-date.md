Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says the appointment of Minister of State Rt. Hon. Jim Bolger as Ambassador to the United States means New Zealand's interests will continue to benefit from his very significant skills and experience.

"I welcome his appointment, which has my full support. "He will bring to the diplomatic role many years of experience in building strong international relationships on behalf of this country, especially through the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) Leaders' meeting. In addition his renowned negotiating skills mean he is the best person to be representing New Zealand in the United States as we seek to make progress on trade issues," said Mrs Shipley.

Following Mr Bolger's resignation from Parliament on April 6, a by-election will be held in the Taranaki-King Country electorate on Saturday May 2. "As leader of the National Party, I relish the opportunity a by-election provides to highlight the many positive programmes the Coalition Government has underway, and to draw from other parties what they stand for, not simply what they oppose.

"The National Party is ready for action and will be selecting a candidate shortly. The people of Taranaki-King Country have been very well served by an excellent MP in Jim Bolger, and I am confident the National Party will find a worthy new candidate who will win their support again on May 2," Mrs Shipley concluded.
