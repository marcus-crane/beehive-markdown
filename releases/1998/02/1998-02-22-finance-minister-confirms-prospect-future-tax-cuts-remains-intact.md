The current track of the Government's operating surplus confirms that prospects for future tax cuts remain intact, the Minister of Finance, Rt Hon Bill Birch said tonight.

Nothing whatsoever has occurred to date in the economy or the international situation to prejudice our long-standing expectation that we can, by 1999-2000, start thinking seriously about further tax cuts,' he said.

Bearing in mind that we are reducing the middle rate by a further $1.1 billion during 1998-99, it never was at any stage our view that a further additional round of tax cuts could occur as fast as one year after that.

It has however always been our belief that, a year of so after the 1998 tax cuts, the surplus is likely to start building above 2% of GDP towards 3%, and we can start thinking about the design of the next round of tax cuts.

I have always made it clear that, before we cut taxes further, the Government will want to see net public debt below 20% of GDP. On current forecasts, we will achieve that within this term of Parliament.

Obviously, nobody can fully predict the future course of the Asian crisis. But its actual and anticipated impact on New Zealand to date has not so far significantly damaged our prospects for further future tax cuts.

As the surplus builds closer to 3% of GDP, the Government can certainly consider policies based on a mix of further debt reduction, higher priority spending in key areas, and tax cuts to encourage growth and jobs.

The Sunday Star Times headline this weekend, 'Shrinking surplus spells end of further tax cuts' and any suggestion that I endorse that view is therefore mischievous and inaccurate.

Nothing in the current track of the surplus so far leads to that conclusion.

On the contrary, current Treasury forecasts projecting a surplus rising from 1.7% of GDP in 1998-99 to 2.4% in 2000-01 confirm that we continue to move towards territory where it is logical to think about further tax cuts.

Unlike Labour and the Alliance who both want to raise taxes, the present Government is fully committed, at that stage, to ensure that further tax cuts remain part of a growth-enhancing economic and fiscal mix.

Obviously, we have not at any time to date reached a position where we could spell out a precise implementation time for the round of tax cuts we propose for New Zealand following this year's $1.1 billion reduction.

The suggestion that the Government's announced timetable has been set back by recent events is therefore totally incorrect. Taxes reductions are and remain a key defining issue on the New Zealand political scene.

As I made clear to the House only last week during the debate on the Prime Minister's Speech, National is more fully committed than ever to cut taxes further if and when economic and fiscal conditions permit,' he said.
