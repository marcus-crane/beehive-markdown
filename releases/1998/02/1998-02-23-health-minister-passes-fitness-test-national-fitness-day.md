Health Minister Bill English was put through a fitness test today to support this week's National Employee Health and Fitness Day.

Speaking as BNZ corporate gymnasium staff put him through his paces, Mr English said he supported moves to encourage health and fitness in the workplace. Studies show a fitter and healthier workforce will be more productive. Healthier, people also enjoy a better quality of life.

"Every New Zealander has a responsibility to do all they can to keep themselves healthy and that doesn't necessarily mean jumping on an exercycle or pumping weights. There is strong evidence that even moderate, regular, physical activity such as a brisk walk or lawn mowing can improve people of all ages health.

"The Ministry of Health promotes 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week.

The Hillary Commission's 1996 Sport and Physical Activity Survey found one third of adult New Zealanders undertook less than 2.5 hours physical activity per week. We've all got to take stock of our own activity levels," Mr English said.
