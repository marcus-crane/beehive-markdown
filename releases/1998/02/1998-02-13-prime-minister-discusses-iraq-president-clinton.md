Prime Minister Jenny Shipley supported continued efforts towards a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis during a telephone call she received this morning from the President of the United States, Bill Clinton.

"I was pleased to have this opportunity to discuss this issue with the President," Mrs Shipley said.

"I told the President of New Zealand's deep concerns over Iraq's retention of chemical and biological weapons and our position that the United Nations weapons inspectors must be able to carry out and complete the mandate given them by the Security Council in 1991.

"I emphasised to the President New Zealand's position that every diplomatic effort should be made, including through the United Nations, to achieve a peaceful outcome. Mr Clinton underlined his commitment to, and support for, efforts underway to resolve the matter by diplomatic means if at all possible.

"Clearly however the ability for UNSCOM inspectors to locate and eliminate Iraq's chemical and biological weapons is crucial if the threat they pose to regional security is to be removed. "That is why the Cabinet will on Monday consider the question of New Zealand participation in the multinational Coalition being formed to support, and if necessary, take military action to enforce the 1991 Security Council Resolutions aimed at identifying and eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

It is helpful, as we and other countries draw closer to a point of decision, to have had a first hand briefing from the President on the efforts which are underway to achieve a solution to the crisis," said the Prime Minister.
