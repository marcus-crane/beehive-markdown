Research into the clover root weevil problem is likely to increase substantially, Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

The Government, through the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and AgResearch, has so far allocated $400,000 for research into the pest. AgResearch is now negotiating with the New Zealand Dairy Board for funds to accelerate initiatives to find solutions to the weevil problem.

"This is consistent with the principle that the Government and the industries concerned should share the costs of such research," Dr Smith said. The research effort is going into four areas:

- developing a better understanding of the life cycle of the weevil
- identifying biological controls for the weevil
- identifying types of clover which may be tolerant to the weevil
- developing methods to prevent reinfestation of newly-sown pastures

Dr Smith has been advised that while a clear picture of the weevil's life cycle had not yet emerged, the areas of particular promise include selection of tolerant plant material and the use of biological controls. AgResearch's roadshow had attracted 600 farmers to five meetings.

"Like farmers, the Government views this problem as serious," Dr Smith said.
