Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today said a Labour Party spokesperson, Jill Pettis, was wrong to say Ministers were ignoring the sea lion problem in the sub Antarctic Islands.

"Along with the rest of New Zealand, I am very concerned about the mystery deaths of these sea lions. It is vital that we find out why they are dying to see how we can help this terrible situation.

"Despite what Ms Pettis says, the Government is taking action. Officials and scientist have been working very hard to find answers. To date we are still awaiting advice from the scientists. Until we have more information, we are not in a position to make decisions about any possible changes to the management of the squid fishery.

"In the meantime, I am informed that currently there are no squid trawlers fishing for squid in the area. However if they do, observers will operate in a similar manner to previous years. These boats will also be monitored by satellite." The by-catch trigger point of 79 still applies. If this is breached, the fishery will close, as was done last year.

"This is a very concerning problem and it is in everyone's interest that we get some answers. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the scientists, the answers are not available just yet.

"I would welcome any constructive input from Ms Pettis, or any other politician, to assist finding out why these deaths are occurring. If Ms Pettis is genuine in her concern about the sea lions she will focus more on solving the problem, than trying to score political points at the expense of dead sea lions," Mr Luxton concluded.
