Tourism Minister Murray McCully is in Sydney tomorrow to discuss the effects of the Asian crisis on the tourism industry with his counterpart in Australia and to explore areas for greater cooperation.

The Minister says he has been monitoring Australia's analysis of, and response to, the Asian crisis.

Mr McCully, who is travelling with New Zealand Tourism Board Chairman Bryan Mogridge, will also meet with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Tourism Commission to attempt to progress co-operative initiatives.

"In the past month, I have had discussions with the New Zealand Tourism Board and consulted with industry leaders around the country, I am convinced that there are opportunities for New Zealand and Australia to co-operate more fully both in coping with current difficulties and in pursuing new markets," he said.

Mr McCully described December visitor arrival figures released by the Government Statistician, which show a 2% drop in visitor numbers for the 1997 calendar year as "about what we expected".

"The New Zealand Tourism Board is forecasting a $250 million drop in income for the 1998 year, although some private forecasters are taking a more pessimistic approach."

"I am currently engaged in a comprehensive review of existing expenditure with the Board to make sure that our priorities are re-ordered to meet changing circumstances."

While in Sydney, Mr McCully will also be updated on developments in the Sydney Olympics by representatives from: New Zealand's Sydney 2000 group, Tradenz, Air New Zealand, the New Zealand Tourism Board and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
