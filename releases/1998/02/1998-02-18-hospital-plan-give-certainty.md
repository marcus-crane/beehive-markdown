Health Minister Bill English said the hospital plan announced in the Prime Minister's statement to the House yesterday would give people more certainty about future hospital services in New Zealand.

"This plan will give a national overview about what level of hospital services we can expect and where.

"The Government is investing significant amounts of money in new hospitals and hospital services right around the country. We need to be sure that this investment fits into an overall plan that takes account of what we need now and over the coming years.

"People need to feel secure about the future for hospitals. When a small hospital closes people perceive a threat to all hospitals. The plan will provide a national context for local decisions.

"Putting the plan together involves clearly defining emergency services in rural areas and ensuring systematic coverage and training," he said.

Mr English said the plan would be ready in the second half of the year.
