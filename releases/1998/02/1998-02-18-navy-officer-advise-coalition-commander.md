Defence Minister Max Bradford today announced that Navy Captain David Anson had been appointed as Senior National Adviser (New Zealand) for Operation GRIFFIN, New Zealand?s contribution to the Multinational Coalition in the Gulf. Mr Bradford said Captain Anson would provide national advice and liaison between the Multinational Coalition Commander, the New Zealand contingent Commander and their respective Service Chiefs of Staff.

Captain Anson will be located in the Gulf, and will ensure New Zealand's contributions to the Multinational Coalition are used in accordance with New Zealand Government approved roles. The appointment has been made by the Chief of Defence Force and follows a Cabinet decision to send up to 20 Special Air Service personnel and two Air Force Orions, plus ground crew, to the Gulf. Captain Anson is a former commanding officer of the frigates Canterbury, Waikato and Southland.

He is also a qualified warfare officer. He has only recently returned to New Zealand from his most recent appointment as the Naval Advisor on the Defence Staff at the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra. In addition to commanding all New Zealand force activities, Captain Anson will also be the link between the New Zealand Government and the Multinational Coalition commander on how and where these personnel can be employed.
