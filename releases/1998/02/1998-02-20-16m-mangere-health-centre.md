Health Minister Bill English announced today the Government has allocated $1.6 million so that a community trust can buy the Mangere Community Health Centre.

"The $1.6 million will allow the Mangere Community Health Trust to buy the health centre from South Auckland Health. The trust intends spending a further $1 million upgrading and extending the centre.

"This funding comes from a scheme which has enabled communities throughout New Zealand to take more control of publicly-funded health services provided for them.

"With this boost from the Government it is my hope that the Trust will develop into a unique community organisation for Mangere offering health and other social services," he said.

Mr English said the Trust would in future be able to offer its full range of services from one site, including general practitioner, pharmacy, laboratory, maternity and some emergency radiology services.

Three physiotherapists and a dentist now operated from the centre and once the building had been extended there would also be room for the hospital's community clinics, public health and district nurses, and its Medical Officer of Health to operate.

"The new centre will be a wonderful asset for the people of Mangere. Full credit must go to the Mangere Community Health Trust which has been so determined to make an improvement to the health services available to local people.

"The benefits of having all these health services under one roof are obvious. But beyond that, the integration of services is a key factor in people actually getting better health services and this is possible when everyone is working together," he said.

Mr English said the money had been allocated under the Community Trust Assistance Scheme.
