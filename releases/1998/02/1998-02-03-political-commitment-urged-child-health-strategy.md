Health Minister Bill English said today he hoped politicians from all sides of the political spectrum could make a commitment to implementing the proposed National Child Health Strategy.

"Our child health statistics are not good, but we can do something about it. We must agree a strategy now so that people who work with children can have confidence in implementing it over the next 10 years and beyond.

"Last week I released a discussion document which is the first step in agreeing this strategy. I have written to the leaders of all political parties urging them to consider the document and make submissions.

"As politicians we need to set an example which shows commitment from all of us to this first National Child Health Strategy. The health of our children is too important for political point-scoring," he said.
