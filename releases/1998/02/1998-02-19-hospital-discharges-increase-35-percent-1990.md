Health Minister Bill English said today total discharges from public hospitals had increased 35 percent since 1990.

"The biggest increase was 51 percent in disability services, followed by 48 percent in obstetrics, 45 percent in medical services, and 23 percent in surgical services. The lowest increase was 8 percent for mental health.

"This increase shows again that our public hospital services are doing more and more.

"A breakdown by hospital does show a decrease in throughput from some of the smaller hospitals. This reflects the trends toward the greater specialisation of services, less low-priority elective surgery being done in small hospitals and changes with long-term care of the elderly moving out of public hospitals," said Mr English.
