Hon Maurice Williamson today called on Local Government to focus on a constructive contribution to the current road reform process.

Mr Williamson was speaking today at a meeting of the Local Government New Zealand Transport Forum in Wellington. "Road reform will only succeed with co-operative goodwill and commitment between central and local government," said the Minister.

"No decisions have been taken, we have one report on the table, the Roading Advisory Group Report, now Government is  
asking for your input."

This quote from an article in the December 6 edition of the Economist, is I feel pertinent to our road reform issue.

"In 20 years' time, when paying for road space will be regarded as the norm, people will look back and wonder why they were ever prepared to put up with the pollution, noise and paralysis of today's cities."

"I am looking forward to receiving the Local Government New Zealand submission and the opportunity to work through any outstanding issues," the Minister said.

Road reform submissions close Friday 20th February 1998.
