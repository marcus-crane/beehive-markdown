New agri-business SOEs Asure NZ and AgriQuality NZ are operating legitimately under license agreements with MAF, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

Mr Ryall was responding to accusations made by Labour MP Paul Swain that the SOEs were flouting the law.

"It was always our expectation that the two SOEs would operate under license agreement. This is standard practice, many SOEs operate under license agreements for a period of time," Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall said Parliament would consider the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Restructuring) Bill this week.

Asure New Zealand and AgriQuality New Zealand replace the existing MAF Quality Management. Both SOEs began trading on Sunday.

"The two new SOEs were signaled in the Prime Minister's statement to Parliament in February as part of the Government's ongoing programme to improve services to the rural sector," Mr Ryall said.

"Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. Asure NZ and AgriQuality NZ will provide improved services to our most important export sector. The SOEs introduce competition into primary sector services with the aim of making them more cost-effective and responsive to customers."
