Education Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of the establishment Board of Trustees for the new Elizabeth Park College to be opened in Invercargill in 1999.

The board members are:

John Cumpstone  
David Kerr  
Kevin Mulrooney  
Maureen Slow  
Carolyn Weston  
Mr Creech said nominations for the board were sought from local schools, community groups and the Invercargill City Council. A large number of high quality nominations was received.

"The members of the board were chosen because of the skills and backgrounds that each is expected to bring to the establishment of the school. I also wanted to ensure the board has an appropriate gender and ethnic mix."

The establishment board appoints the principal and other staff as well as determining policy for the school and putting in place sound governance practices.

The board will be in place until a new one is elected. School elections are likely to be held in mid 1999.

The college will enrol students in form 1 - 7 (year 7 ? 13).
