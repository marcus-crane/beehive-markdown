Health Minister Bill English said today that Central Health, which was now a division of the Health Funding Authority, had spent less than 0.1 percent of its budget on consultants since being established.

"The popular wisdom is that consultants are employed extensively in the health sector and are being paid far too much for little work.

"The reality shown by the figures for Central Health is quite different. It has been responsible for spending $4.87 billion of taxpayers' money since 1993 and has spent only $4.6 million on consultants in that time. This amounts to less than 0.1 percent of the budget.

"Every organisation needs to bring in outside expertise from time-to-time. Central Health can be confident that its level of expenditure will stack up against other organisations in both the public and private sectors."

Mr English said the information had been gathered in response to a Parliamentary Question from Labour MP Annette King.

"Annette King was clearly on a fishing expedition for a cheap headline. She would be better advised spending her time finding out and promoting all the positive things happening in health and supporting health staff who are trying to do a better job for New Zealanders," said Mr English.
