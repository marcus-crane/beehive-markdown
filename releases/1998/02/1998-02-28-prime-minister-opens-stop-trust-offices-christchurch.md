"Stopping sexual abuse is everybody's business," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today on opening Christchurch's STOP Trust - an independent community-based treatment programme for sexual abusers.

"Sexual abuse by adolescents and adults is one of our society's most serious social and mental health problems.

"This programme alone will cater for some 35 young people a year and about 90 adult men who are ready to stop abusing.

"But for each of these offenders there are also family members who are affected both directly and indirectly. STOP's adolescent treatment programme will help about 120 family members and in the adult male programme, 250 family members."

Mrs Shipley said the STOP programme was one of a spectrum of treatment programmes available nationally for adolescents and adult males who have sexually abused others.

"This programme is one of about ten similar community-based programmes in the country and shows the importance of central government and the community working in partnership to find solutions to the problems facing our modern society.

"Central Government, through the Community Funding Agency of the Department of Social Welfare, is a major funder of the STOP programme, with contributions also from Lottery Welfare, the Trustbank Community Trust, Community Corrections, the Health Funding Authority and other charitable trusts.

"But if we are to really succeed in stopping and reversing the devastating problem of sexual abuse, everyone in the community must learn to recognise the symptoms of sexual abuse and direct abusers and their victims to the help that is available.

"With that in mind, I hope that the issue of sexual abuse will become a significant part of the debate arising from the recent release of the Coalition Government's discussion document Towards a Code of Social and Family Responsibility," said Mrs Shipley.
