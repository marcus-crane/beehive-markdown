The Minister of Social Welfare today announced the appointment of a manager to help implement the new Pacific Island Cultural Social Services strategy within the Department of Social Welfare to improve communication and service to Pacific Island children and young people.

Kuresa Tiumalu-Faleseuga has been appointed as Pacific Island Cultural Social Services Implementation Manager to assist the Department in implementing this policy.

"The Government's primary aim in implementing the policy is to continue our drive to provide quality service to specific cultural groups that are over represented in the number of children coming to the notice of the Children, Young Persons and their Families Service."

Section 396(2) of the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act 1989 provides for the Director-general of Social Welfare to approve any incorporated body as a cultural social service.

Kuresa, who takes up the position at the end of February, is Samoan and holds both Bachelor of Social Work and Master in Business Administration. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Social Welfare between 1981 and 1989 including social worker, Maatua Whangai Social Worker and Manager of the Regional Training Unit in Palmerston North. Subsequently he was employed as a lecturer at Massey University, and as Director of the School of Social Work at the Auckland College of Education.

He has also worked as Director of the Pacific Island Education Resource Centre in Auckland. "Kuresa's wide range of experience in the fields of social work and Pacific Island relations, makes him ideal for the job and I look forward to seeing the results of his work over the next year in this new and innovative policy area," says Mr Sowry,

The creation of a Pacific Islands cultural social services policy follows the successful establishment of iwi social services for Maori. There are now eight iwi social services approved, four of which are contracted by CYPFS to provide specific services to children and young people by Maori for Maori.
