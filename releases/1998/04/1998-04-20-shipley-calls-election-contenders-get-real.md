Prime Minister and National party leader Jenny Shipley says Labour should get real and explain the gap between their promises and their ability to fund them.

"Taranaki/King Country voters are entitled to know the cost of Labour's lolly scramble."

Mrs Shipley was commenting on Labour's promises yesterday of more spending in many areas including roading, central government agencies such as the Tourism Board, health, student loans, student allowances and student fees.

"Labour has failed to explain to voters whether it will pay for those expensive promises by raising taxes, or by plunging New Zealand back into deficit and increased debt.

"If Labour wants to be a serious contender in this by-election or as an alternative Government it has to get real, because voters will see straight through the political charades that are going on at the moment.

"Voters in Taranaki/King Country are too intelligent to be hoodwinked. They want clear answers. Will Labour stick with this year's tax cuts, or would a Labour Government take even more tax out of New Zealanders' pockets? Labour's senior people must get their stories straight on these issues because they are lacking credibility."

The Prime Minister and other National Ministers and MPs will continue a programme of visits to the electorate this week, explaining how the National Government's programme will benefit Taranaki/King Country voters and all New Zealanders.
