New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters today questioned the motives behind Helen Clark's meeting with Auckland Mayors over the Auckland Regional Services Trust, since her party refused to give Aucklanders their say on the Trust's future.

"Is it that Ms Clark will let the Mayors have their say, whilst denying the people of Auckland the same thing?," Mr Peters said.

"The Labour Leader said she will adhere closely to the position taken by the five Mayors but, she was not prepared to consider the view of the average Aucklander - denying them their democratic right.

"The party of the left has shown itself to be truly anti-democratic, much to the disappointment of the people of Auckland," Mr Peters said.
