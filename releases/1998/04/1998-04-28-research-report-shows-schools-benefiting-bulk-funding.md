Education Minister Nick Smith today released a Ministry of Education report on bulk funded schools which concludes that the controversial system for resourcing schools is enhancing student learning, and improving delivery of the curriculum by giving increased flexibility in employing teachers and support staff. The report is based on a survey of 328 schools carried out last year by the Research Division of the Ministry of Education.

Key findings in the report were:  
78% of schools attributed enhanced learning opportunities for students to bulk funding.  
66% of schools cited improved curriculum delivery from bulk funding. 83% of schools reported employing at least one extra teacher from bulk funding.  
75% of schools reported employing additional/specialist support staff for special needs, administration, technology, counselling etc.  
43% of schools attributed renovations or new building projects to bulk funding.  
32% of schools reported some disadvantages of bulk funding, the most common downside being the extra work involved in budgeting and finance management.

"This research is hard to refute. It is not based on some ideology or academic theory, but the collective wisdom of educational practitioners who are working with the system. The fact that only 2 of the 328 schools surveyed would prefer to return to central resourcing speaks volumes."

"The Government's policy is that bulk funding will remain optional. As the research shows, there is additional administrative work in schools managing their full budgets. Not all schools have the skills and expertise to pick up this responsibility and so we will leave that choice to individual school boards. The policy of voluntary bulk funding is also consistent with National's philosophy of school self management and choice. This position might be revisited if teachers unions illegally undermine or sabotage decisions of parents' elected representatives to take up bulk funding."

"The most common and often only reason cited by schools for not taking up bulk funding is not the effect on student learning but the reaction it will cause from the teacher unions. It is a sad indictment that improvements in student learning are being held back by conservative unions resistant to change. I invite them to study this research and reconsider their position."

"For schools to make sound decisions they need good information. This report helps by giving a summary of school experiences with bulk funding. The Ministry will be forwarding this report, and a further study on the benefits of bulk funding by the University of Otago, to all schools."
