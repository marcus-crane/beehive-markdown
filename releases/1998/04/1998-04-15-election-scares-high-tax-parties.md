The Taranaki/King Country by-election is the reason Labour and the Alliance are musing about not raising taxes quite as much, Finance Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

Mr Birch was speaking at a lunchtime meeting of businesspeople in New Plymouth.

"While it is encouraging that the left is at least talking about not raising taxes, or in the Alliance's case, not raising them for people earning less than the average wage, this posturing is about politics rather than economics or people.

"The left is finally realising that higher taxes are a big turnoff for New Zealanders. New Zealanders believe that the way for them and their families to get ahead is through paid work, and that this shouldn't be punished.

"This is something Labour and the Alliance should have learned a long time ago. At the last election, lower-tax parties won 70 of Parliament's 120 seats.

"Tuesday's by-election poll shows heartland New Zealanders have no attachment to the high-tax, high-spending policies of the left.

"What is important now is that we take this debate forward."

Mr Birch said while it was one thing for parties to be rattled by political polling and talk of changing policy, low taxes are an economic rather than a political necessity.

"It's one thing to say you won't put taxes up, but if your party wants to be a big spender in government the choices are simple - more borrowing, or higher taxes.

"The proof of that is the Labour Government's legacy.

"National's approach has been to control spending, run surpluses, pay back debt - and cut taxes.

"Lower taxes increase household incomes, give a greater return and incentive for paid work, and help to drive economic growth."

Mr Birch said consistent economic growth was what allowed increased spending on health and education, debt reduction and tax cuts all at the same time.

"I wish Michael Cullen well in his attempt to convince the left that taxes shouldn't be seen as a punishment for people who have jobs.

"The sad fact is Labour and the Alliance are philosophically attached to high taxes ands can't be trusted on this issue.

"Too many Labour and Alliance MPs don't understand how the economy works and that people in paid jobs are the ones who provide government income.

"They are out of touch with the desire of New Zealanders to build a future for themselves and their families. That future depends on them not being clobbered for doing a decent day's work."

The Minister said he was still waiting to hear Labour and the Alliance say that spending more money wasn't their answer to every issue.

"They have to be honest. If the left remain big spenders then their only choice is high taxes or more and more debt.

"National, by contrast, wants all New Zealanders to be able to increase their incomes - and that opportunity comes from a growing economy, paid work and lower taxes."
