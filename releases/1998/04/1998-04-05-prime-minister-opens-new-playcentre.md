"The Government is committed to helping parents meet the early childhood education needs of their children," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today at the opening of the new Opoho Playcentre in Dunedin today.

"Since 1990 there has been an increase in the number of children participating in early childhood education, with parents able to choose from a range of services.

"The number of children enrolled has increased from 126,134 in 1990 to 163,925 last year, an increase of about 30 per cent. Over the same period, government funding has increased at an even greater rate - from $153 million in 1990 to $253 million last year, an increase of about 65 per cent.

"The Government sees early childhood education as a priority area. As we said in the discussion document Towards A Code of Social and Family Responsibility the early years of life are crucial to a child's development.

"We asked a number of questions in that document about how both parents and the Government can further improve the learning opportunities of their young children, and I look forward to seeing the responses to that.

"The Government supports a range of early childhood education options, because families have different requirements.

"The Playcentre movement is an important part of the early childhood scene. It holds a special place in my heart because both my children were Playcentre kids and, like all Playcentre parents, I was closely involved in their experiences" Mrs Shipley concluded.

"Playcentre offers mothers in particular opportunities to further develop their own organisation and leadership skills. Many women have used their Playcentre experiences as a stepping stone to becoming involved in community service, local government and national politics.

"I commend the parents here at Opoho on all the hard work that has gone into providing this facility for their children - they've not only raised funds, but they've also put their own time and labour into the project.

"When I see New Zealanders taking responsibility themselves in this way, rather than expecting someone else to provide for them, it gives me renewed confidence in the future of this country."
