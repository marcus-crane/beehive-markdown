"Women working at all levels of an organisation should value themselves and lead with confidence," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today in a speech to the Society of Executive Secretaries, on International Secretaries Day.

"Leadership is not simply the responsibility of those at the top. At all levels of an organisation, everyone has an opportunity to take a lead. If everyone did that, an enormous amount would get done.

"It's my observation that the New Zealand environment is more conducive to women acting with confidence, in the workplace and elsewhere, than many other countries in the world."

Mrs Shipley says International Secretaries' Day is a good opportunity to demonstrate to staff that they are valued, but that should not be confined to one day a year.

"Every day you should value yourselves and take whatever opportunities are available to be the best that you can be.

"Believing in yourself and liking yourself will make you a more valuable person to any team of which you're a part," Mrs Shipley concluded.
