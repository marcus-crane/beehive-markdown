Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister, Don McKinnon, who left for Papua New Guinea this morning to attend the historic ceasefire signing ceremony on the island of Bougainville tomorrow, has handed over $100,000 to the Red Cross.

During a press conference at Port Moresby's Jackson International Airport, Mr McKinnon presented a cheque for NZD $100,000 to National Red Cross head Janet Philemon. The cheque is New Zealand's contribution to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 1998 Emergency Appeal for Bougainville on behalf of the PNG National Red Cross.

Mr McKinnon praised the work of Red Cross and said they had made a vital contribution to the peace process on Bougainville.

"Red Cross personnel have delivered many services to those in need. Often they have gained access to people living in areas which are off-limits to others."

During 1998 the Red Cross on Bougainville will provide services in addition to family relief packs and medical supplies. They will establish programmes for resettlement support, primary health care rehabilitation, training for health workers and counselling for ex-combatants.

Later this afternoon Mr McKinnon will visit the PNG Parliament, Waigaini, and call on Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister Roy Yaki and the Leader of the Opposition Bernard Narakobi.

This evening he will attend a state reception along with Foreign Ministers from Australia, Vanuatu, The Solomon Islands and Fiji who have travelled to PNG for tomorrow's ceremony.

The ceasefire ceremony is being held at Arawa, the former provincial capital of Bougainville. Also attending will be a high level ministerial delegation from Port Moresby led by PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate.

Mr McKinnon departs for Bougainville by RNZAF C130 Hercules early tomorrow morning. He returns to New Zealand on Friday 1 May.

For the last nine months New Zealand has played a key role in bringing peace to Bougainville. In July last year, NZ successfully brokered talks between rebel factions (Burnham I) at Burnham Military Camp. New Zealand hosted talks between Bougainville and PNG (Burnham II) in October 1997 which led to the Burnham Truce, where all parties agreed to immediately cease armed conflict. From November 1997 New Zealand led a regional Truce Monitoring Group on Bougainville.

In January 1998, the leaders of all parties involved in the conflict, including PNG Prime Minister, Bill Skate, were hosted in New Zealand at Lincoln University. They signed the Lincoln Agreement, resulting in a permanent and irrevocable ceasefire coming into effect on the Island from midnight 30 April 1998.
