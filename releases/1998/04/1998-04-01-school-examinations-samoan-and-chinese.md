Samoan and Chinese will be included in national school examinations for the first time next year, Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced today.

Samoan will become a School Certificate subject and Modern Standard Chinese will be examined for University Bursaries.

"There are increasing numbers of students studying Samoan and Chinese and increasing demand for national school exams in the two subjects. There is an obvious need to recognise the achievements of the many students already studying the two languages.

"Offering Samoan as a School C subject and Modern Standard Chinese as a University Bursaries subject meets the level of demand for exams in the two areas. If there is demand for exams in Samoan and Chinese at different levels the Qualifications Authority will respond."

They will replace Russian as exam subjects.

"There are now very few candidates taking Russian, and it is being phased out,? said Mr Creech.

?This decision acknowledges the importance of Samoan and Modern Standard Chinese in New Zealand today.

?This does not signal a wholesale review of the range of subjects included in School Certificate and University Bursaries. Once final decisions are reached through the Qualifications Review about examinations and qualifications in the senior secondary school, we can look at other subjects. We can also consider examining Samoan and Chinese at other levels,? Mr Creech said.

The New Zealand Qualifications Authority will develop prescriptions in Samoan and Modern Standard Chinese this year, in time for schools to plan courses for 1999.
