"Alliance MP Matt Robson's claim that 'political interference' was behind the Police decision not to prosecute any individual over the Cave Creek Tragedy is mischievous," Police Minister Jack Elder said this evening.

"The Cave Creek tragedy was fully investigated by the Police and once the investigations were complete the file was reviewed by the Police Legal Adviser for the Southern Region and the Chief Legal Adviser at Police National Headquarters.

"Both of these experienced lawyers concluded that there was insufficient evidence to institute criminal proceedings for manslaughter against any person.

"An independent legal opinion was also obtained from the Solicitor-General and he agreed with the Police legal opinion."

Mr Elder said the families of the Cave Creek victims were all advised of that following receipt of the Solicitor-General's opinion in January 1996.

"Mr Robson was advised of that by the Police in December last year and I think it is unfortunate that he has chosen to raise this issue again on the back of the anniversary of this tragedy," Mr Elder concluded.
