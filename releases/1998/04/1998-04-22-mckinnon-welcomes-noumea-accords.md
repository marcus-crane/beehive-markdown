Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today welcomed the initialling of the Noumea Accords which sets out a programme for increasing autonomy in the French colony of New Caledonia.

The signing of the Accords, after 10 years of negotiations, is expected to take place in Noumea on May 4. A referendum seeking the approval of the people of New Caledonia is scheduled for December.

"New Zealand warmly welcomes the signing of these Accords, which sets out a 20-year programme for increasing autonomy in New Caledonia," said Mr McKinnon.

"All three parties, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the RCPR (Rally for New Caledonia in the Pacific) and the French State, have clearly demonstrated a mature and thoughtful approach to what has been a difficult political process."

Mr McKinnon said the agreement demonstrated a shared will and determination by all concerned to carry the relationship between France and New Caledonia forward.

The 20-year life of the Noumea Accords will see a progressive transfer of control from France to New Caledonia, although defence, justice, fiscal control, public order and some areas of foreign relations will not be excluded.

Executive authority will move from the French High Commissioner to a Local Collegiate Executive elected by the Legal Congress, which will be able to vote on decisions carrying the weight of local laws.

A referendum in New Caledonia is proposed after 20, or possibly 15 years, to decide whether the remaining controls should be transferred, which would carry New Caledonia to full nationhood. "New Zealand recognises that more work remains to be done before the agreement can come into force, but we warmly welcome the open approach of each partner to the negotiations and in particular, the innovation and flexibility demonstrated by the French State," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealand looks forward to continuing its regional partnership with Franch, as well as building on its already close friendship with New Caledonia."
