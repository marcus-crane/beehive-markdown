Job seekers on the community wage will never work for less than the minimum wage, Employment Minister Peter McCardle said today.

Mr McCardle said job seekers taking part in community work, training or organised activity would receive the community wage and a flat payment of $21, and up to another $20 for actual additional expenses.

"Processes have been put in place to ensure that job seekers do not work for less than the minimum wage. To suggest that they will have to work for $1.05 per hour is ludicrous," he said.

"Maximum weekly hours of up to 20 for full-time work tested community wage recipients and up to 10 hours for part-time commuity wage recipients have been set to ensure job seekers never work for less than the minimum wage and have time for permanent job search."
