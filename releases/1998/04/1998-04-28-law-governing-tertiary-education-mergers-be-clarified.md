Education Minister Wyatt Creech announced plans today to put amendments to the Education Act before Parliament to clarify the provisions that allow tertiary education institutions to join forces.

"The policy of the Government in this situation is clear. Where educational opportunities for students can be improved by institutions joining forces, they should be allowed. New Zealand already has a very high number of tertiary institutions (7 universities, 25 polytechnics, 4 colleges of education, and 3 wananga). Many are by international standards very small," Mr Creech said.

Wellington Polytechnic and Massey University have applied to merge. This application is being challenged by Manawatu Polytechnic and the Association of Polytechnics in the Wellington High Court.

"The legal challenge raises questions as to whether the current legislation governing the amalgamation of tertiary institutions is sufficiently clear. To avoid any confusion, and waste of taxpayer dollars intended for education on legal bills, I intend to urgently promote an amendment to the Education Act.

?The amendment will make it clear that tertiary institutions, whether they are polytechnics or universities, are able to merge. That is the intention behind the current legislation," Mr Creech said.

Tertiary institution mergers would only be approved where there are educational benefits for students, such as more choice and quality and a better range of courses.

"Legal advice to the Government indicates that the best way of ensuring the desired outcome is to clarify the law. Were this decision left to the court processes, the result is not certain. Getting a result would be very expensive.

"Parliament appropriates taxpayer funds to tertiary institutions to provide education for their students; not to spend it on lawyers' bills. It is appropriate to ask Parliament to make its intentions clear."

Mr Creech said he planned to introduce the amendment to the 1989 Education Act as soon as was practicable.
