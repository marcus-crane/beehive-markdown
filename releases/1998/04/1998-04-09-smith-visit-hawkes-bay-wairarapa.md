Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has brought forward his visit to the Hawke's Bay to next Thursday, 16th April.

Associate Agriculture Minister John Luxton has agreed to cover Dr Smith's previously arranged commitments in Tokirima and Te Whakarae.

"Given the severity of the drought, a visit to the Hawke's Bay was much more important than byelection campaigning, and I appreciate John having agreed to cover for me," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith will also visit drought-stricken Wairarapa on the morning of Thursday 7 May.

The Hawke's Bay visit will be organised by National Party List MP Annabel Young and the Wairarapa visit by Wairarapa MP Wyatt Creech, both in consultation with local Federated Farmers branches.
