A new Alternative School Programme that helps pupils who have been alienated from mainstream education was opened in Whangarei today by the Minister of Youth Affairs, Hon Deborah Morris and Associate Minister of Education, Brian Donnelly.

"In our first Budget the Coalition Government provided extra funding to help young people who had previously been alienated from the mainstream education system. It is now nearly a year since the Budget and it is great to actually see our rhetoric in Parliament being turned into action here in Whangarei, where it matters. This really is a Government that delivers.

"So often I hear of young people who appear not to fit in with the system. I often wonder if it is the young person or an inflexible system that is at fault.

"I really believe that if Government pretends that one policy or one service will fit all we'll fail lots of people. We have to provide a variety of services that can cater for a range of needs.

"Today is an acknowledgment of that. It is about the youth of Whangarei having the chance to participate in something that suits their needs," said Deborah Morris.
