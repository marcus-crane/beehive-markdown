The Minister of Local Government, Hon Maurice Williamson, announced today that the Government is in the process of appointing a new Local Government Commission as the term of the existing Commission has expired.

The Commission is a quasi-judicial body which makes decisions on the structure of councils and which can report to the Minister of Local Government on local government matters.

"Mrs Barbara Durbin and Mr Bruce Anderson, both of Auckland, have been appointed as members for the next three years. Mrs Durbin has had previous experience on the Commission and Mr Anderson has previously been the Chief Executive of the Auckland City Council," the Minister said

"A further announcement on the appointment of a new Chairperson will be made in the near future.

"The Commission will now progress its existing work programme including the reorganisation proposals relating to the Hawke's Bay Region, Banks Peninsula District and Rangitikei District," Mr Williamson said.
