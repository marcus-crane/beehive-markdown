Health Minister Bill English today called on the Labour Party to apologise to the Health and Disability Commissioner for attacking her right to carry out an inquiry into Canterbury Health.

"Labour's health spokesperson tried to take out an injunction to stop the Commissioner carrying out her inquiry. She was later forced to admit it was inappropriate to initiate an injunction herself, proceeding then to support others who sought a judicial review of the Commissioner's right to carry out this inquiry.

"On 8 April 1997 I wrote to Labour Leader Helen Clark expressing my concern at the campaign being conducted by Labour against the Commissioner. I received no response from Ms Clark.

"Labour now acknowledges that the Commissioner's report is a comprehensive and thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of patients which sparked this inquiry.

"The Commissioner deserves an apology from Annette King on behalf of the Labour Party. No independent statutory officer has been subject to such personalised harassment from a political party," said Mr English.
