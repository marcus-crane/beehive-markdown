"The Government has no intention of privatising roading and it was mischievous at least and untruthful at best to suggest money would be stripped from rural communities to fund city highways," said Hon Maurice Williamson Minister of Transport today.

The Minister was responding to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition during a Taranaki - King Country by-election rally.

"Clearly Ms Clark didn't read the chapters between roads paved with gold and reality when she announced, Labour would change the benefit cost ratio threshold for roading from 4:1 to 3:1 by 2005.

"The bill for that fantasy would cost New Zealand well in excess of $200 million dollars. I don't think there is anyone in New Zealand who would sanction such expenditure.

"We need a roading network that enables New Zealand to maintain and generate wealth while providing the fullest range of community services possible.

"Roads are not free today and they have never been. It is already a user pay system but a very poorly focused one.

"There are no knowledgeable observers of road reform who do not acknowledge the need to realign the way we fund and manage our roading network. However there is also considerable disagreement on the shape of a future management system.

"One proposal finding favour was turning Transit New Zealand into a state owned enterprise. Local networks would be managed by and owned by local authority trading enterprises.

"Despite some media commentary to the contrary Government has not abandoned key features of its road reform package.

"Our vision for road reform will result in; road charges that reflect use, road providers that are accountable and have ongoing investment for the future of a sustainable and safe roading system for New Zealand, remains unchanged," the Minister said.
