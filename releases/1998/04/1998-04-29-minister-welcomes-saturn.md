Saturn Communications launch of a local residential telephone service in Wellington, to supplement the company's other service offerings has today been welcomed by the Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson.

"This is a further indication of the effectiveness of the New Zealand telecommunications regime" said Mr Williamson.

"Businesses and, for the first time, residential customers will have access to an alternative land-line provider of local telephone services. This is in addition to the substantial competition which already exists for long distance and international services.

"The willingness of another international player to invest in sophisticated technology in New Zealand telecommunications is an indicator of the robustness of the regulatory regime," the Minister said.

The Saturn cable TV network has the potential for reaching an estimated 135,000 homes in the Wellington region by the middle of next year.

"The company's integration of pay TV, telecommunications and high-speed data services on one bill, and the pricing schedules it has announced indicate that the customer will gain from Saturn's entry into this market," Mr Williamson said.
