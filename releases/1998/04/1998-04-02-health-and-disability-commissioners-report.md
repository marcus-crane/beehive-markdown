Health Minister Bill English today welcomed the report of the Health and Disability Commissioner on her inquiry into Canterbury Health and said it brought to completion a difficult period in the CHE's history.

"This is a comprehensive report covering a complex set of issues. The Commissioner has described the context of the patient deaths which sparked this inquiry in a great deal of detail.

"The Commissioner has found that some patients at Canterbury Health did not get the level of services that everyone who uses the public health service should be able to expect.. I regret that. I know that the families of the patients at the centre of this report have been under enormous stress over the last couple of years as they have searched for answers over the loss of loved ones. I am sorry that the public health service has caused that stress.

"The report does not have answers for the families in that it does not lay blame with any individual or organisation for the deaths. However, I hope the families can take some satisfaction that the matters around the care their relatives received have been thoroughly investigated, first by the Coroner and now by the Commissioner.

"The report also shows clearly that things have changed at Canterbury Health and I hope the families can take reassurance from that.

"I welcome the report because it shows us where things went wrong at Canterbury Health, and confirms that the changes made there over the last year in particular are on the right track.

"The report I commissioned into the current state of services at the hospital's emergency department, which I released earlier this week, also shows that the changes made were the right ones. I can reassure the people of Christchurch that they now have emergency services they can be confident in. I know that management and staff at Canterbury Health have worked very hard to make improvements and to ensure they provide the best service possible.

"However, no-one involved can take comfort from this report and there are lessons for everybody involved. The Commissioner has made a large number of recommendations and I will be ensuring that the Government agencies concerned address those recommendations where appropriate.

"The Commissioner's concerns on standards will have implications for the whole public health service and I see the report as providing the impetus for some significant positive progress towards getting clear and consistent standards embedded across the health sector.

"Many of the Commissioner's comments about changes relate to areas where work is already in progress. Work is well under-way on developing nationally consistent prices for hospital services and that is being reflected in the latest contract round between the Health Funding Authority and the CHEs. This will resolve the issue of deficit funding which the Commissioner raises.

"The Government has also recently announced that it intends to introduce legislation which will simplify and clarify the rules governing the safety of hospitals.

"The Commissioner raises a number of important issues regarding accountabilities in the public health service and these will be addressed and clarified. This will bring more clarity to the respective roles of the different public agencies and that is to be welcomed," said Mr English.
