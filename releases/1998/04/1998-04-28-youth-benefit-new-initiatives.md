The Coalition Government is to fund two exciting new initiatives that will help young people lead safer lives, said the Minister of Youth Affairs, Deborah Morris.

In a pre-budget announcement at the Manukau youth centre, Deborah Morris said the Coalition Government will create a youth development fund for community projects and a national resource centre for the prevention of youth suicide. The Government will provide $2.025 million for these new initiatives.

"This Government is committed to helping young people. This new funding is a graphic illustration of our commitment to young people as it represents the first ever budget increase for the Ministry of Youth Affairs," she said.

Youth development fund  
"Together with Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Youth Affairs will manage a youth development fund. The fund will support community programmes that help vulnerable young people to turn their lives around. This could include programmes that tackle mental health problems, behavioural difficulties and help with drug and alcohol abuse. Six to seven community projects will be funded for up to three years.

National resource centre  
"A national resource centre will be established to collect research, resources and information relating to the prevention of youth suicide. This centre will be available to communities and professionals.

"A recent consultation exercise showed that people wanted more information about suicide prevention. The new resource centre will allow individuals and agencies to work together in prevention related areas as well as distributing up-to-date information to improve the effectiveness of projects and initiatives helping young people.

"Both of these initiatives complement the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy which includes over 45 current services that can help prevent youth suicide.

"As announced in December, the Ministry of Youth Affairs is developing resource material to assist parents and caregivers, peers, Maori communities and health professionals to recognise and support troubled and depressed young people. This further funding will enable the work to continue for two more years.

"This Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that young New Zealanders grow up in a safe, healthy and enterprising New Zealand. These new initiatives, together with current services, will support the valuable work that families and communities are already doing across the country," said Deborah Morris.
