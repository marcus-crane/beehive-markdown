The Hon Winston Peters MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, today said that he had sought assurances from the Labour Minister, on behalf of the New Zealand First Caucus, on proposed industrial relation changes to the Employment Court.

Mr Peters said he was releasing this statement because of the erroneous view leaked by unnamed sources that the work of the Employment Court was proposed to be handled by a division of the District Court.

"It is not a matter of semantics to say that one proposal is for the Employment Court to become a specialist division of the District Court. It is all in the wording and, in this case, the wording is extremely important if workers are to have confidence in the integrity, status and standing of the Employment Court.

"In particular the New Zealand First Caucus will need to be reassured that any change made will be structural only and in line with more cost effective delivery of governmental services and, in this case, judicial services.

"And that if the jurisdiction for employment matters is to be the District Court:

\- that the proposals are not a downgrading of the Employment Court

\- that there will not be any undue delays in proceedings which add to the employee's costs

\- that representation in the District Court is not confined to lawyers, where an employee advocate is in some circumstances more capable of acting on an employment matter

\- that an employee will not effectively be disenfranchised by the overwhelming resources of the employer versus the employee in a District Court environment and that there will therefore be appropriate changes to the District Court Rules"

Mr Peters said that the New Zealand First Caucus had yet to consider this issue and that any decision would be dependent on receiving the Minister's assurances.

"We will only sign up to this if it is fair and right and in the best interest of the ordinary New Zealander as well as the employer," said Mr Peters.
