Health Minister and Clutha-Southland MP Bill English today offered his condolences to Mrs Christine Morrison and her family over the sudden death of her husband Colin.

"The Government has been working for some time on the matters raised by Mrs Morrison.

"However, I don't believe it is appropriate to enter a political debate at this time," he said.
