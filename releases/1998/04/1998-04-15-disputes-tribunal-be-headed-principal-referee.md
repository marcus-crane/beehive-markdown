The Government has agreed to establish the new position of Principal Disputes Tribunal Referee to improve the Disputes Tribunal service.

"The Principal Referee, who will be legally trained, will be responsible for the administration of Tribunal Referees and working with Referees to ensure decisions are consistent and of high quality," Minister for Courts Wyatt Creech announced today.

"The need for a Principal Disputes Tribunal Referee is particularly important in the wake of the decision to lift the monetary limit on the sorts of claims that can be dealt with by disputes tribunals."

The monetary limit for disputes going to tribunals is being increased from $3,000 to $7,500 or from $5,000 to $12,000 when both parties agree. Legislation making this change is before Parliament now.

Currently there are 56 referees in 55 locations across the country, hearing about 30,000 cases a year.

"Ministers have agreed that the establishment of the new position should be incorporated into the Statutes Amendment Bill currently before the Government Administration select committee," Mr Creech said.
