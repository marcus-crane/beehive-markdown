"Talking is the only way to get progress with the secondary teachers' employment contract. If the PPTA is serious about getting a settlement the union needs to come back to the table willing to make progress," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Industrial action does no good, it only does harm. It harms young people who lose out on education, it harms parents because of the inconvenience and it harms the pay talk process."

Mr Creech said he had talked to a number of parents and teachers who were disappointed that the PPTA went ahead with yesterday's strike.

"The Ministry of Education's survey of schools shows about two-thirds of teachers went on strike. That is a lot less than the 90% of teachers the PPTA claimed would strike.

"I have been disappointed to hear some teachers commenting that they believe the only way to get the Government to act on their concerns is to strike, and they claim that strikes have worked in the past and will work again.

"Nothing could be further from the truth. The only thing that influences the Government is constructive discussion. Persistent and unnecessary industrial action can only harm good will and progress.

"The Ministry of Education is ready to talk. It has its door open. Time would be better spent talking than walking away," Mr Creech said.
