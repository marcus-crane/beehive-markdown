The Coalition Government will increase funding to the Otago Museum's redevelopment project by $2.87 million (including GST) over the next two years, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced in Dunedin today

"This will bring the Government's total contribution to $4 million," Mrs Shipley said in a pre-Budget announcement. The Government has already contributed $1.126 million towards the project.

"The people of Dunedin have contributed generously towards the Museum?s redevelopment project and clearly demonstrated that they value the Museum," she said.

"The Government contribution is in recognition of the immense value the Museum's collections are to all New Zealanders.

"Otago Museum is one of the oldest museums in the country; its collections are vast and varied and demonstrate a serious commitment to the collection of cultural artefacts and scientific specimens over 125 years.

"This redevelopment project will raise the standards of care that the Museum is able to give to its nationally significant collections as well as improving access for the thousands of people who come to enjoy its contents each year."

The total cost of the redevelopment project is $11.1 million (GST exclusive).
