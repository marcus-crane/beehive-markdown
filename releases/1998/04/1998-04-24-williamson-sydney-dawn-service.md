The New Zealand Government will be represented at the ANZAC Dawn Service in Sydney by the Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson.

Mr Williamson has been in Australia attending the Australian Transport Council Ministers meeting during which he met his Australian counterpart, Hon Mark Vaile the Australian Minister of Transport

"The heritage of the ANZAC partnership continues to bind Australia and New Zealand in a truly unique and indivisible way," said Mr Williamson.

"Naturally our first thoughts on ANZAC Day are of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our future and the generations to come.

"I also believe the contribution made by our service personnel who have returned from armed conflicts, then in peace time made further contributions to our society, is outstanding and they are inspirational individuals.

"It is a great honour to be able to represent New Zealand at the Sydney ANZAC Dawn Service," Mr Williamson said.

Mr Williamson will be attending the Sydney Dawn Service, during which he will lay a wreath for New Zealand, with the President of the New South Wales R.S.L Rusty Priest and New South Wales Premier Mr Bob Carr

The Service commences at 4.30am at the Cenotaph, Martin Place, Sydney.
