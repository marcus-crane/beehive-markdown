The Minister of Justice, Hon D.A.M. Graham, in response to a suggestion from the Treasurer, Hon Winston Peters, that there might need to be a complaints authority independent of the police, said today that the Police Complaints Authority is independent of the police.

'There is a public perception that the PCA is part of the police,' he said.

'It is not and never has been.

'The criticisms of police action in the recently issued PCA report on a murder investigation at Wicked Willies strip club in Christchurch is clear evidence of that,' Mr Graham said.

The Police Complaints Authority was established by Parliament and is headed by a District Court Judge.
