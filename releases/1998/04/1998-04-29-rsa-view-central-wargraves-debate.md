Last week's Fair Go programme gave a misleading impression on the role the Department of Internal Affairs plays in setting the rules regarding military cemeteries. Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

The programme concerned an Irish former member of the British Parachute Regiment, Mr Richard O'Dwyer, who did not want the Imperial Forces emblem on his headstone in a military cemetery, wishing instead to have the crest of that regiment. However, under the rules for the management of military cemeteries, no individual regimental emblems are permitted.

Mr Elder said it was important to understand the Department of Internal Affairs did not make the rules regarding war graves by itself.

"The prime concern of the Department of Internal Affairs is to respect the wishes of the soldiers who served their country, and the Department works in very close consultation with the Returned Serviceman's Association and the armed forces.

"The present rules on insignia on headstones reflect those organisations' wishes, and the Department of Internal Affairs has an obligation to respect the wishes of New Zealand's returned servicepeople.

"Last year the RSA Dominion Council decided not to change its stance on the range of crests permissible on headstones."

The RSA resolved:

"That the Dominion Executive Committee does not support, at this time, any addition or amendment to the standard and accepted service emblems as depicted on page 10 of the publication 'War Graves and Services' Cemeteries'."

Mr Elder said he understood the Department of Internal Affairs had contacted the RSA's chief executive after receiving Mr O'Dwyer's request, and the present policy on no regimental emblems was reaffirmed.

"However, because of the high level of public interest in this matter, DIA officials have sought a meeting with representatives of the RSA and the Defence Force to discuss the existing rules as they relate to Mr O'Dwyer.

A change of opinion by the RSA and the military could open the way for a change to the rules, and possibly allow Mr O'Dwyer's wishes to be accommodated, Mr Elder said.
