Health Minister Bill English said today older people needed to know they did not have to put up with the winter flu and all the discomfort it brought.

He encouraged older people to take advantage of free influenza vaccinations as winter approaches. People aged 65 and over are entitled to free influenza vaccinations from their GP. The vaccination protects people against three strains of flu (two A strains and one B strain) which are most likely to circulate this winter. The vaccine includes protection for the flu known as the Sydney strain.

"Official surveillance of flu doesn't start until May, but there is anecdotal evidence that some Aucklanders have been struck by the bug already.

"Some older people think an annual bout of flu is inevitable, but it isn't. Preventing illness is always better than trying to cure it. Overseas studies indicate influenza immunisation reduces hospitalisations and deaths by half," said Mr English.

Around 30 people die from influenza each year in New Zealand. The number of people hospitalised has increased in recent years and in the 1995/96 year nearly four hundred people ended up in hospital as a result of an influenza virus.

"The Ministry of Health aims to have 70 per cent of people over the age of 65 getting yearly flu shots. Last year that figure was around 46 per cent. By comparison, only between 20 and 25 percent were getting flu shots before the new policy on free shots for the over-65s was introduced.

"In Australia the rates of immunisation have improved dramatically over the last six years, from 53 per cent in 1992 to 77 percent in 1996, and authorities there believe coverage will be even better this year.

"We're obviously starting to have similar success here as people become aware of the vaccination.

"Influenza vaccines have a very good record of protecting people against influenza. A 1995 review of all published studies estimates the vaccine's effectiveness as 56 per cent for preventing respiratory illness, 53 percent for preventing pneumonia, 50 per cent for preventing hospitalisation and 68 per cent effective in preventing death.

"The free vaccination programme will be extended next year to include those under 65 who are at risk because of chronic debilitating conditions such as chronic chest, heart, kidney and metabolic disorders.

"Healthy people should also think about vaccination and I would encourage employers to consider providing influenza vaccine to avoid illness in their employees, especially those engaged in essential services. Studies have shown this practice saves money for employers," said Mr English.
