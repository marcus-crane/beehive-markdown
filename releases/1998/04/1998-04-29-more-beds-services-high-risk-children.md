The Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry today announced the Government's commitment to providing more beds and services to help children in need of care and protection, young offenders and treat sexual abusers.

"I am confident that this strategy will go a long way to addressing the concerns raised by the community in recent weeks, because it will provide the appropriate places for children and young people with problems to get the help they need from the right professionals."

The $27 million (GST inclusive) has been set aside in this year's Budget over three years to help the Children, Young Persons and their Families Service and the NZ Community Funding Agency provide services for high risk children and young people.

"$13.2 million of this money will enable CYPFS to provide the services and social workers for the increased number of residential places which are going up from the current 100 to 166 by the end of 2000/01.

"These places will cater for children and young people needing care and protection, and for youth who present a risk because of their offending, sexual abusing or other behavioural problems.

"Up to $13.8 million will also be available over the next three years for programme development and new services which will greatly improve the range of and access to interventions for youth who are at risk.

"A wider range of programmes is important for New Zealanders as we will all reap the future rewards by investing in these troubled young people now.

"$2.8 million of the $13.8 million will be immediately available in 1998/99 for community-based treatment and care programmes for children and young people with multiple behavioural problems, including those who sexually abuse.

"These treatment programmes are vital for children and young people with multiple problems so they and their families can address their disorders and get on with their lives.

"This will enable us to continue to work in partnership with providers like STOP and SAFE who already provide intensive treatment programmes for adolescent sex abusers.

"It is important that treatment and specialist care programmes are provided in tandem if we are to successfully change the behaviour of these young people and make our communities safer," Mr Sowry said.
