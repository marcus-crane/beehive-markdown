The Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, has announced that this year?s Bluff oyster season will start on 1 May this year, a month earlier than last year.

Since the fishery reopened in 1996 the start of the season has been delayed until 1 June to avoid dredging oysters during autumn, when oyster's are susceptible to the oyster disease Bonamia. Recent surveys have shown that Bonamia is now at very low levels and does not currently need to be taken into account in managing the fishery. Most stakeholders have therefore asked that the season be brought forward a month to extend the harvesting period.

Stakeholders have also agreed that the commercial catch limit should remain unchanged at 14.95 million oysters. This follows a re-survey of the oyster beds in October last year which indicated little change in the number of legal - size oysters, but a significant increase in the number of smaller oysters.

"I know that this weekend people will be looking foward to their Easter eggs. They can then look forward to having the oyster delicacy from the deep south on the menu 1 May," Mr Luxton concluded.
