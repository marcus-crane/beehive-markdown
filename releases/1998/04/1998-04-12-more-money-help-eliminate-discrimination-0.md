The Coalition Government is committed to eliminating discrimination in the workplace, Labour Minister Max Bradford and Associate Women's Affairs Minister Deborah Morris said today when announcing an increase in the Government contribution to the Joint Equal Employment Opportunities Trust.

The Joint EEO Trust is currently funded on the basis of $1:$1 between Government and the private sector. Today's announcement sees Government doubling that contribution as proposed in the Coalition Agreement. Government will now provide $2 for every $1 that is funded by the private sector.

"This increase in funding ratio is a clear indication of the Government's long-term commitment to eliminating discrimination in the workplace. It is also another example of the Coalition Government fulfilling its promises to New Zealanders."

"A recent review of the EEO Trust found that the Trust is effective in its job of promoting equal employment opportunities and is a service demanded by New Zealand businesses," the Ministers said.

"The Trust is helping businesses recognise and take advantage of the real business benefits of EEO."

The Ministers said it is important for employers to recognise that EEO practices provide benefits not only to their staff but also to their customers and their bottom line.

"The EEO Trust is helping break down barriers to employment faced by many groups in the labour market, and works to provide both socially and economically positive outcomes," they said. - ENDS -
