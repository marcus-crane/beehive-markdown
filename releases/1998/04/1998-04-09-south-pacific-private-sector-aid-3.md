Seventeen training and business development grants to support private sector development in the Pacific Islands were announced today by Foreign Affairs Associate Minister Simon Upton.

The grants, totalling NZ$552,766, come under the Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS), part of New Zealand's Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme. They cover private sector activities in eight countries.

"The development of a vigorous private sector is necessary to obtain a sustainable increase in living standards in the Pacific," Mr Upton said.

"With public sector budgets facing real constraints, the private sector has the capacity to generate sustainable economic growth in the Pacific region."

Mr Upton said PIIDS promoted more effective business and training links between the private sector in New Zealand and their counterparts in neighbouring South Pacific nations.

"The scheme is an innovative, forward-looking use of our ODA funding, and provides an opportunity for the New Zealand private sector be involved in assisting our neighbours to meet their own developmental needs," he said.

In the February bidding round, 32 proposals were submitted. Grants were allocated according to each proposal's development merit, commercial viability and the likely long-term economic and employment benefits for the recipient country.

Proposals for the next round of PIIDS grants should be sent to the Development Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade by 3 July, 1998.

The seventeen proposals cover activities in eight South Pacific countries:

Background Note: The Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS)

The Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme is funded as part of the New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme, and is the main vehicle for delivering private sector assistance to the Pacific region.

Basic Objectives Of PIIDS

To facilitate the transfer of knowledge from New Zealand to the South Pacific through the provision of training, marketing, technical, and managerial support;  
To encourage private sector development in Pacific Island Countries in partnership with the New Zealand private sector;  
To create employment and economic growth in the South Pacific based on Pacific Island economies' comparative advantages;  
To encourage New Zealand private sector investment in the Pacific Islands.

How the Scheme Works

The scheme aims to directly meet the needs of the private sector in the Pacific. PIIDS has been designed to be flexible with a range of funding options available including training, feasibility, and equity assistance.

There are six separate grants available under the scheme. PIIDS Development can provide grants of up to $25,000 to facilitate Training Needs Analyses, Training Programmes, Advisory Missions, and Personnel Attachments to New Zealand. PIIDS Investment allows for the funding of up to 50% of the cost of a feasibility study to a maximum of $10,000 and, provided that a proposal fits strict criteria, may contribute up to $75,000 as an Equity Grant to the new venture on a dollar for dollar basis.

PIIDS proposals are assessed by a panel made up of Development Cooperation Division staff and an independent private sector consultant during three competitive assessment rounds each year. Proposals are assessed on the basis of their developmental merit, and in the case of PIIDS Investment - their commercial viability.

The total 1997/98 PIIDS allocation is $2 million.
