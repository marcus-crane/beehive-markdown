"Critics of the new special education policy are ignoring the positive impact that Special Education 2000 is having for thousands of students," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech told a conference of speech and language therapists in Dunedin that the new special education policy was being warmly welcomed in most quarters.

"There have been attempts to discredit Special Education 2000 with claims that the Government is not funding it properly, that those children who really need help are missing out and that people are going to lose their jobs.

"These suggestions are not borne out in reality.

"The Government is committed to the $150-$200 million need to fund Special Education 2000 properly. We are not backing away from it.

"Special Education 2000 is not a quick fix, one hit wonder type of policy. It is complex and has many strands. To take any of the five components of Special Education 2000 in isolation, or focus on isolated cases ignores the fact that the policy is bringing substantial benefits to students.

"Like any new policy there will be teething problems. Big changes are involved. This is one of the reasons it is being phased in.

"There is further policy work going on to develop other aspects of Special Education 2000. I realise this is causing some uncertainty but we want to get the policy right. Decisions are being made as quickly as possible."

Mr Creech told the Conference that the simple reality was that in any huge policy implementation task, there were bound to be some difficult cases at the margin and some mistakes too for that matter.

The Minister also released figures showing the support for students with high and very high special needs in the new Ongoing Resourcing Scheme funded through the Special Education Services.

The Ongoing Resourcing Scheme guarantees funding for the students regardless of where they get their education.

"51% of students will have more support than they are currently getting, 36% will have the same and the 13% with less is a smaller proportion than was expected because their circumstances have improved. This shows that the policy is working."

Mr Creech also explained to the Conference how the Special Education Grant worked. The new grant is paid to schools to provide for the learning and behavioural special needs of students who do not fit the "high" and "very high" needs criteria. The $29 million for the grants covers this group of students.

"We face a choice. Either an official in the Ministry makes that priority decision or the local educationalists make it. We think it is better to rely on individual teaching professionals to make the decisions about the students for whom they are responsible.

"Special Education 2000 turns on its head the old way of funding students with special education needs. Too many young people who needed assistance previously just weren't getting it. The way the funding was delivered through Special Education Discretionary Assistance was ad hoc, children with the same need received different amounts depending on the region they lived in - it was not consistent nationwide - and too often those who shouted and complained the loudest got the most."

Mr Creech said that it would take time for parents, teachers and Boards of Trustees to come to grips with each component of Special Education 2000.

"But the bottom line is that this big change is in the best interests of all students. The extra investment of up to $200 million will benefit the students concerned. It does require a big change to the way schools work - but if we don't change a whole generation of young people will be left behind," Mr Creech told the Conference.
