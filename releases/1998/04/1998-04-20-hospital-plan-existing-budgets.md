Health Minister Bill English said today development costs for the Government's Hospital Plan would be met from within existing budgets.

"The plan is being produced by the Health Funding Authority, working closely with the Ministry of Health and the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit.

"The HFA's contribution is being completed as part of its ongoing business and, as such, is being funded out of the HFA's normal operational budget. I expect the Ministry and CCMAU involvement to be met from within current operating budgets.

"Clinicians and other key stakeholders will be consulted as the plan is developed," he said.

Mr English provided this information in response to a written question from Labour MP Annette King. The plan would be completed later this year, he said.
