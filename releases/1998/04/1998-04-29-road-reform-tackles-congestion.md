"We need to have a national and local roading network that works for New Zealand - that keeps traffic, the economy and our society moving forward," said Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson today.

Mr Williamson was speaking at today's opening of the Mungavin Interchange Bridge Duplication in Porirua

"When this bridge was first constructed it was imagined that with expansion of the city the bridge also would expand. No one can doubt Porirua City has grown," said Mr Williamson

"Porirua has become a strong, dynamic and innovative city. It has much to show Wellington and to offer the rest of New Zealand. It is unique. A city that has its eyes firmly on the future.

"Unfortunately as Porirua continues to grow the same problems of congestion will more than likely occur again. That is unless we seize this moment to tackle one of our most pressing roading issues.

"I believe we need to begin thinking of congestion pricing. Time has proven that more roads and more bridges can only do so much to help congestion. We have to look at other methods.

"Thus the nationwide debate on road reform which is taking place up and down the country," Mr Williamson said.
