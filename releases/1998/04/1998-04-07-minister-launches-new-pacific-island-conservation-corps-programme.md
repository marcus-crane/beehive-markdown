A new Conservation Corps programme specifically targeted at young Pacific Islanders was officially launched today by the Minister of Youth Affairs, Deborah Morris.

The new Conservation Corps programme is run by the Open Pacific Learning Centre in Porirua, and is one of only two Pacific Island targeted programmes in the country.

Deborah Morris said, "The Ministry of Youth Affairs has been aware that Pacific Island young people are under-represented on the Corps programmes. In order to attract young Pacific Island people the programmes need to be run by a Pacific Island sponsor which is well networked into its community.

"One of the reasons for the great success of Conservation Corps is that they are run by local community organisations. The local knowledge and skills compliment the youth development focus of the programmes. They are evidence of how successful a partnership between Government and communities can be.

"Up to 80% of participants of Conservation Corps participants enter employment, education or training within six months of completing their programme. That makes Conservation Corps one of the Government's most successful employment programmes. Conservation Corps have been operating for almost ten years.

"Participants on this new Conservation Corps will work in teams on conservation projects such as cleaning and maintaining local parks, recycling metal and glass, pruning forestry bush, cleaning up local beaches and conservation education in schools.

"The participants will learn new skills including, budgeting, O le Pacifika, first aid, time management and communication skills. They will also have an opportunity to try out challenging recreation which broadens the life experience and cements the need to work in teams.

"One of the most valuable tools for helping young people into employment is youth development. That means considering every young person as a whole young person and acknowledging that physical health, spirituality, relationship skills and self-esteem all contribute to success in the labour force. Conservation Corps is the perfect example of such an approach," said Deborah Morris.
