Health Minister Bill English said today's announcement of an extra $252 million for elective surgery was a big step in moving to a much better and fairer system for New Zealanders needing elective surgery.

Mr English said the announcement followed months of hard negotiations to get more money for elective surgery. The $250 million is in addition to the $1.5 million that he announced on 20 February to specificly address heart surgery waiting lists in Southland and Otago.

"The current system is all about guesswork and hope. People all around the country are on waiting lists for surgery without knowing where they stand compared to others waiting, and without knowing how long they will have to wait.

"Doctors, nurses and managers have been working very hard to put in place the booking system to give people certainty about what they can expect from the public health service.

"But it has always been recognised that if the booking system is going to work, we must make sure we are doing a reasonable level of elective surgery. The message from doctors has been that there was not enough money in the system to make it work properly.

"I have made it clear that elective surgery was my top priority for extra health dollars. Today's announcement shows that the Government has listened to doctors' concerns and is prepared to find the money needed to fund a reasonable level of elective surgery.

"People must have certainty about what they can expect from the public health service. Just last weekend a constituent of mine, Mr Colin Morrison, died suddenly. Mr Morrison needed heart surgery and he died not even knowing whether the public health service would come through for him, let alone when.

"My commitment to Mr Morrison's family, and to all the other New Zealanders waiting for surgery, is that in future people will know what they can expect from the public health service. That is why we need the booking system, because the guess and hope system that has operated to date has not given people that certainty.

"There are no absolute answers to the question of whether this will be exactly the right amount of money. Experience with the Waiting Times Fund initiative shows it takes time to increase surgery levels. We have the physical capacity to do it in terms of theatre space, but not necessarily the highly-skilled teams of nurses and doctors required ready to go.

"We have to give our hospitals certainty so they can plan their workloads. The money announced today will be allocated over three years for that reason. The Health Funding Authority is in the process of negotiating contracts with all the Crown health enterprises, and today's announcement will allow them to finalise negotiations over surgery levels with certainty about on-going funding.

"The booking system will start on 1 July this year. It will take time to get it right. But I am confident that with the hard work of doctors and nurses who are working to implement it, and with the Government showing it is totally committed to funding a reasonable level of elective surgery, we can do it," said Mr English.
