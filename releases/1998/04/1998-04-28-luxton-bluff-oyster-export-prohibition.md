The Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, is to recommend to Cabinet that the prohibition on the export of Bluff oysters under the Customs and Excise Act be lifted from October.

This follows a request to lift the export ban by the Bluff oyster industry.

"The prohibition on the export of Bluff oysters is a relic of an era of restrictive trade and Government intervention. None of New Zealand's other commercial fish species are still banned from export in this manner" Mr Luxton said.

"The sustainability of this fishery and the economic benefit to New Zealand of the oyster resource is ensured by the quota management system within which this fishery is now managed.

"After discussing the issue with the wider fishing industry, other stakeholders and government departments there appears little reason for the export ban to remain. New Zealand's fish export reputation is safeguarded by regulations governing the processing and export of fish. These will ensure that any oysters exported meet the requirements of the importing country, " Mr Luxton said.

Industry sources report that the export of Bluff oysters is unlikely to be attractive in the short to medium term, given the strict requirements of importing countries and the prices for comparable oysters being offered in accessible overseas markets. The move to export is being seen by the industry as a longer term proposition which may eventually add diversity and stability to the marketing of oysters.
