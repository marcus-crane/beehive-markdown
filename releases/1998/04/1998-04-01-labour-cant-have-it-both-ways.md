Health Minister Bill English said a statement today by Labour's Annette King that she was 'disturbed' at conflict between the Ministry of Health and the Health Funding Authority was pious nonsense.

"Annette King can't have it both ways. She makes a song and dance about the lack of accountability in the system. Then when she sees a report that shows there is accountability in the system, she claims it is disturbing and unusual.

"The Ministry's report on the performance of the Transitional Health Authority is hard-hitting in its assessment of areas where the new agency was at risk of not meeting the Government's requirements, because that was the information that the Government needed.

"The Health Funding Authority, formerly the Transitional Health Authority, is spending $5.8 billion of taxpayers' money. The Ministry would be failing to do its job if it did not monitor the HFA on behalf of the Government," said Mr English.
