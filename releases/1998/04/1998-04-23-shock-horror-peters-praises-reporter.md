Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader, Winston Peters, said today he was pleased that the message of the real meaning of MMP appeared to be finally getting through.

Pointing to a newspaper column written at the weekend by New Zealand Press Association political editor, Peter Wilson, Mr Peters said "It's no secret that Press Gallery journalists have been extremely swift to condemn and criticise New Zealand First at the slightest pretext, but much slower to analyse in a thoughtful manner the true role of the Party in the Coalition Government."

In the column, Mr Wilson notes that New Zealand First MPs are growing in confidence and are starting to make their presence felt in Parliament.

He lists issues where NZF backbench MP's are speaking out contrary to National policy such as tariff reductions; voluntary membership of student associations; the minimum wage; Government's plans to buy a third frigate; and proposed significant changes to holidays legislation.

"What is particularly heartening is the columnist's recognition that healthy debate within a coalition is not a sign of a collapsing or dithering Government. As the column said:

"Labour cries \`\`split'' whenever they get a whiff of dissent within NZ First. It is part of the game. National MPs did it when Labour was in office and would doubtless do it again if they found themselves on the opposition benches.

If there was a group of NZ First MPs who felt so strongly about coalition policy that they were prepared to cross the floor and vote

against it, or leave the party, that would be a split. There is no evidence of that.

There is nothing wrong with a robust campaign between National and NZ First. It is something voters are going to have to get used to, and the by-election will be their first taste of it. When it is all over, the Government will still have 61 votes in Parliament."

"This is good common political sense," said Mr Peters, "which will be welcomed by the sensible voters of Taranaki-King Country. They know that now is not the time to throw their vote away on parties like:

Act, which preaches fiscal rectitude, yet is desperately seeking to circumvent the rules on electoral spending and whose Leader has been shown to be profligate with Parliamentary travel funds, like

Labour, which every week proves it has no policies, apart from off-the-cuff ones, such as Helen Clark's plan to give taxpayer subsidies to banks, like

the Alliance, one of whose deputy co-leaders, Jeanette Fitzsimmons, has the well-being of farmers so much at heart that she thinks all trade should be banned."

As the NZPA column points out, there is a role for smaller parties to play in MMP Government and New Zealand First is playing that role successfully," said Mr Peters.
