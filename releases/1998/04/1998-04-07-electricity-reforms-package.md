The Government's electricity reforms package will deliver a better deal for consumers, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today when announcing the package.

Choice of electricity suppliers for smaller consumers;  
Reduced operating costs;  
Better timed investment in new generation; and  
Less harm to the environment.

The reform package includes:
