Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says Labour is not credible or believable in its health promises.

"The desperate leader of the Opposition has promised voters that there would be no cuts to general hospital surgical services under a government led by her. At the same time she is making her billion dollar promises, she is saying she won't put taxes up.

"Voters in this electorate can see this credibility gap as can the rest of the country.

"Her track record is no better. While Helen Clark was Minister of Health, she cut total health spending by almost three percent - from $4,630 million in the 1988/89 budget to $4502 million in the 1990/91 budget (figures in 1997 dollars).

"She claims National has cut health expenditure, yet when I was Health Minister total health spending rose by over nine percent - up from $4,573 million on 1993/94 to $5,014 million in 1996/97.

"Miss Clark has a record of non delivery.

"Delivering the best of modern health services is one of the most complex issues that modern governments have to face today and National is committed to finding the best way to provide services, rather than making spurious promises which cannot be kept.

"I urge the people of Taranaki/ King Country not to be fooled by Labour's use of people's very personal and private health circumstances.

"It is a sign of a desperate political party, rather than a responsible commentary on the New Zealand health system.

"A vote for National will deliver strong leadership, political stability, lower interest rates, lower tax rates and modern social services. National's people and policies are delivering real benefits to all New Zealanders.

"National is counting on the people of Taranaki/ King Country to vote this Saturday. Don't put your future at risk by gambling with your vote," concluded the Prime Minister.
