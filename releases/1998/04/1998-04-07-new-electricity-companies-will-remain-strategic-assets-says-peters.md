The three new Crown owned electricity generators resulting from the split of ECNZ, will continue to be strategic assets protected under the Coalition Agreement, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"The child and the parent are identical as far as Government is concerned.

Mr Peters rejected the comments by ECNZ chief executive Dave Frow that there was no logical argument for classifying the new companies as strategic assets.

"Servants of the Government do not decide what is strategic and what is not. That is matter for Government and electors.

"This Government is here to serve the New Zealand taxpayers, consumers, housewives and businesses. We are not here to serve the wishes of a few interest groups."
