Pupils from St Patricks College visit Parliament today as part of Lampen Workchoice Day. Lampen Workchoice Day is an excellent opportunity for young people to check out possible career opportunities, and for employers to get a fresh perspective on the hopes, interests and ambitions of today's young people, said the Minister of Youth Affairs, Deborah Morris.

Deborah Morris said, "The Parliamentary visit is one of many work place visits that will take place across the country today. The programme allows students to gain first hand experience of work environments and to build career related confidence. It is great that employers encourage young people to check the options available to them. I think that many students will be inspired and fired up to make decisions about what they want to do.

"Over the last three years more than 4,500 senior secondary school students have benefited from spending a day with a huge range of employers; while in turn, those employers have made a real contribution to our future workforce by making their resources available for career education.

"The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that youth have the best preparation available for the world of work. Support of the Lampen Workchoice Day is one small but important example," said Deborah Morris.
