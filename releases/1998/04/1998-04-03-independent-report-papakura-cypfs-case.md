The independent report into the notification of a five year-old South Auckland girl who had been sexually abused by members of her family was released today by the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

The report was written by barrister John Morrison and was received in the Minister's office on Friday afternoon. It was then referred to the general manager and chief social worker of CYPFS, and for consultation with the staff involved.

"The allegations made about a delay in CYPFS responding to the notification were serious, and we need to make sure systems are in place to ensure this doesn't happen again," Mr Sowry said.

"The report has identified several issues which contributed to the delay

"Firstly communication difficulties with the call centre which had already been resolved prior to this investigation .

"Of greater concern to me is the issues surrounding a communication breakdown in the office concerned."

The investigator made several recommendations to address this issue. One idea suggested is that CYPFS establish an additional critical case warning system - a red light alert. This system would be similar to the one that the police emergency communications centre uses to alert staff to incoming 111 calls.

"I have asked the agency to investigate the feasibility of implementing this nation-wide," Mr Sowry said.

"I would like to make it very clear that this delay did not relate to caseloads or funding, but to the breakdown of systems and communications."

The report also raised a number of staff issues which it is appropriate for the general manager and chief social worker to address.
