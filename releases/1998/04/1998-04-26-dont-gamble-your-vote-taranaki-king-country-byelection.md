Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will be in Taranaki/ King Country from Monday evening to Thursday this week, urging people to vote for their future on Saturday by voting National.

Mrs Shipley said National wants to earn each vote in Taranaki/ King Country.

"A vote for National will deliver strong leadership, political stability, lower interest rates and lower tax rates.

"The people of Taranaki/ King Country have been subjected to a deluge of opposition politicians making promises. None have said who will pay.

"Labour must explain how it will pay for its billion dollar promises without putting taxes up.

"Act must also 'get real' and explain how it can meet New Zealanders expectations while slashing Government expenditure.

"I urge voters to think about your future and the future of your families as you go to the polls on 2 May. If you want an environment in which your farms and businesses can thrive, then vote National. If you want a prosperous future that all New Zealanders can share in, then vote National."

Jenny Shipley warned voters against being duped into believing tactical voting would work in a by-election.

"Tactical voting may have a place in a general election, when each voter has two votes, but in a by-election, where there is only one vote, trying to vote tactically may backfire by causing political instablility. The cost of that would be borne by people with mortgages and those in business.

"National is counting on the people of Taranaki/ King Country to vote this Saturday. Don't put your future at risk by gambling with your vote," concluded the Prime Minister.
