ACT Leader Richard Prebble has defined the style of moderation that his party wishes to bring to Parliament, which is to rob our children, our elderly and our poor, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"Mr Prebble is begging Taranaki-King Country voters to give his party an extra seat in Parliament so they can stop the extra $5 billion of social spending that covers free doctors' visits for under sixes, and the removal of the superannuation surtax.

"ACT also wants to scrap the extra $355 million for education, the extra $900 million for health and the extra 500 police," Mr Peters said.

"A vote for ACT's style of moderation is a vote to collapse our health, education, police, and social support systems."

Mr Peters said ACT's policies were anathema to New Zealanders which is why New Zealand First held the balance of political responsibility and not ACT."
