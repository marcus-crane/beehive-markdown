Associate Minister of Women's Affairs, Deborah Morris, says the New Zealand Women's Rugby team deserves the congratulations of all New Zealanders.

"Bringing home the Rugby World Cup with such convincing wins is no easy feat. The team should be an inspiration to all New Zealand women.

"While television coverage of the final game was patchy I'm sure all New Zealand viewers were incredibly proud to see the team perform so well.

"The New Zealand Women's Rugby team is a force to be reckoned with. It is exciting to see their success at the international level and I hope this leads to more and better coverage of their sport," said Deborah Morris.
