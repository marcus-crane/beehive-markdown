Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed the release of a booklet designed to dispel some myths about the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service.

"One of the hallmarks of a democracy is its capacity to embrace heated debate and legitimate dissent. However, a democracy must also protect itself against activities designed to undermine the very principles upon which it is founded.

"A key part of that protection is a well run, fully accountable and ethical organisation responsible for security. In New Zealand, that organisation is the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service," Mrs Shipley said.

"I'm very keen New Zealanders have every confidence in the Service." She congratulated the Service for taking a positive step in helping New Zealanders better understand its role and the part it played in preserving the country's own unique brand of democracy.

Mrs Shipley said that, as Minister in Charge of the Security Intelligence Service, she understood and supported the Service's long-standing policy of not disclosing the detail of security intelligence operations.

"Unfortunately, this factor has helped to promote a 'cloak and dagger' mythology about the Service.

"However, there is a distinction between operational detail and wider issues about the Service - why we have it, to whom it reports and what checks and balances are in place to make sure it operates within the limits imposed by Parliament.

"As taxpayers who fund the Service and as citizens of a democracy, all New Zealanders should be properly informed about these wider issues.

"There are no sensational revelations contained in the publication. The Service will be seen for what it is - a part of the public service doing a necessary and valuable job for all New Zealanders and fully accountable to me, as the Minister in Charge of the Service, and to our Parliament," Mrs Shipley said.
