Health Minister Bill English today warned Labour's health spokeswoman Annette King that she might be about to lose her job.

"Helen Clark has stepped in and is fronting health stories for the Labour Party.

"Annette King should be taking this as a warning sign that she might soon be shifted off the health spot. It's a clear sign that Helen Clark is unhappy with the way things are going on the health front for Labour and that means she's unhappy with Annette King's performance.

"It happened to Lianne Dalziel and it could well happen to her as Ms Clark starts to panic about how Labour is doing in the by-election.

"Labour's real problem is that it has no health policy and that's become clear during the by-election. Helen Clark has made a few vague statements on health, but she won't tell the Taranaki-King Country voters what Labour would actually do differently there.

"Ms Clark's latest effort in trying to palm off a document as a leak that has been widely distributed for discussion within the health sector shows just how desperate she is.

"It may be news to Labour that we have a tiered health service, but it's nothing new to anyone who works in health. Helen Clark has been caught in a fit of by-election fever and any credibility she had with the health sector is rapidly going down the tubes," said Mr English.
