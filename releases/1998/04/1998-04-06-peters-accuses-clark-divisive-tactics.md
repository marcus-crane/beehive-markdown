New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters today condemned Labour Leader Helen Clark of attempting to separate New Zealanders on the basis of race, instead of financial and social circumstance.

"Maori should not be singled out for help in the way Ms Clark has done. Instead, we should be looking across the board at all New Zealanders and, in particular, those who are struggling - both financially and socially," Mr Peters said.

"Where Maori are concerned, Labour should look at its own record and standard of representation of Maori, and the reasons why New Zealand First captured all five Maori seats at the last election."

Mr Peters said it constantly escapes the Labour party that Maori are New Zealanders and that the Government is committed to improving the financial and social circumstances of all New Zealanders.

"Although Maori suffer from high rates of unemployment, and poor standards of educational achievement, New Zealand First rejects the blatant generalising, labelling and pigeon-holing of Maori as underprivileged and non-Maori as privileged.

"It is a harmful and divisive approach that is not good for New Zealand, or any part of New Zealand's population," Mr Peters said.
