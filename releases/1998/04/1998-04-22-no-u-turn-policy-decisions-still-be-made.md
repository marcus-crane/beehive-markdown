The Government has not abandoned the key features of its road reform package," said Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson today.

"I have been saying for some time that Government will not be adopting the Roading Advisory Group's (RAG) report in its entirety. It is one but only one, of many proposals.

"The RAG report drew over 13,000 submissions and has encouraged much of the public debate on road reform.

"While some recent media headlines have rushed to draw conclusions it is still some weeks off before we will have the final shape of our policy direction.

"You cannot have road reform for the future decided on the basis of some quick fix solutions or a short term political wish, such as changing the benefit cost ratio threshold for roading from 4:1 to 3:1 by 2005.

"That is a Labour Party nightmare/promise with a price tag well in excess of $200 million.

"The RAG report has a number of elements the Government supports and they are:

- To manage roads in a more business like fashion;
- To establish a fairer and more transparent system of user pays road funding;
- To maintain ownership of the road network in public hands;
- To ensuring the community maintains an input into the way our roads are managed.

"There will be no privatisation of roads, any suggestion we would consider population funding is way out of the ballpark and the present road network will be protected in legislation if necessary," Mr Williamson said.
