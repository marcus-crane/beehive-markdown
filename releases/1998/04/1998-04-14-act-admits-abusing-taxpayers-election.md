ACT MP Owen Jennings has shot himself and his party in the foot with a brazen statement about campaigning full-time in the Taranaki-King Country electorate, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"In an open letter to National's candidate on April 9, Mr Jennings wrote:

"I have spent the last few months full time campaigning in the Taranaki-King Country."

"Mr Jennings has conveniently forgotten his pledge to serve diligently as a List MP, preferring to take taxpayers for a ride," Mr Peters said.

"The question now is whether Mr Jennings will be censured by his perk-busting colleague Rodney Hide.

"Mr Hide has already voiced concerns of a possible blow-out in MP's travel costs because of frequent visits to the Taranaki-King Country. But, Mr Hide is rather coy about this ticklish subject, because ACT has a spare-no-expenses approach to issues like campaigning.

"Maybe they'll come up with another confidence trick to hide their travel costs, like the sham primary process they used to breach the $40,000 limit on by-election spending," Mr Peters said.
