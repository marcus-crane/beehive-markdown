"The Coalition Government is actively considering the key recommendations arising from Justice Thorp's Independent Review of Firearms Control," Police Minister Jack Elder said today

"Like all New Zealanders, I am keen to ensure that community safety is enhanced by effective firearms control and laws.

"The issues arising from the Thorp Report are complex and potentially have significant financial and social consequences.

"It is not simply whether or not to enforce gun registration, as Labour's justice spokesman Phil Goff would have the public believe. His claim that Government splits are stopping gun-law reform is also a figment of his vivid imagination."

Mr Elder said key gun law reform issues being considered by the Government include:

- completion of the current gun relicensing programme
- establishment of a transitional firearms unit within the Police
- licensing of all firearms
- buy-back of military style semi-automatic firearms
- review and revision of the 1983 Arms Act.

"A priority for the Government is to ensure that any changes will result in a real improvement in community safety, while at the same time ensuring law-abiding gun-owners are not penalised by symbolic gestures," concluded Mr Elder
