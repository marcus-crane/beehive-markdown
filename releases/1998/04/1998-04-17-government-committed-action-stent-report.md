Health Minister Bill English said today the Government was committed to ensuring action on the recommendations made by Health and Disability Commissioner Robyn Stent in her report on Canterbury Health.

"I have asked the Ministry of Health to take the lead in ensuring that all the recommendations made by the Commissioner are either fully implemented or given appropriate consideration.

"I have also emphasised the importance of a prompt response. The Ministry will report back at the end of this month on how far implementation has progressed," he said.

The Commissioner made 112 recommendations in her report, made public earlier this month. Although many of them related to Canterbury Health, others covered the Ministry, the Health Funding Authority, the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit, the Christchurch School of Medicine, and the Christchurch Hospitals' Medical Staff Association.

"Many of the recommendations had been implemented by the time the report was completed. In particular, a number of changes have been made in the Emergency Department at Christchurch Hospital.

"The Ministry will identify recommendations already implemented as well as co-ordinating responses on those still needing to be addressed," he said.
