"Lincoln University's new website - The Lincoln Connection - is an innovative example of how the technology of tomorrow can be used to solve the transport problems of today," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today at the launch of the website.

Mrs Shipley said the Lincoln Connection is an excellent example of community cooperation to help solve urban transportation problems.

"The website is a practical way for Lincoln's staff and students to solve their transportation needs and to reduce the number of single occupant cars on the roads. It's a great example of leadership, with people thinking and acting smart."

The website is a pilot transport programme with information on commuting option for between Lincoln University and the surrounding areas. Bus timetables, telephone numbers for bus and taxi services and internet connections to airline and intercity bus companies are on the website.

The site also includes New Zealand's first computer-based carpooling system, in which Lincoln students and staff can register their origin and destinations and be matched to others.

"Congestion, unsafe road conditions and pollution will increasingly become an everyday part of driving if we do not change the way we think about transportation in our cities.

"Encouraging car-pooling and the use of public transport is an excellent way to start addressing these problems," said Mrs Shipley.
