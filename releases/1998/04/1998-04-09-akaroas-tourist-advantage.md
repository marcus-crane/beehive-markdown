"Akaroa's cultural heritage and natural environment give it a huge advantage in promoting itself as an exciting tourist destination", said the Prime Minister, Hon Jenny Shipley, in opening the Bruce Apartments in Akaroa today.

"With its French and Maori history, and the natural beauty of its harbour and surrounding hills, Akaroa can capitalise on the growing demand for cultural tourism and eco-tourism. Selling itself to the international tourism market as a place that is unique in New Zealand will ensure growing numbers of tourists will enjoy the charm that is Akaroa. Internationally, cultural tourism and eco-tourism have been proved to add significant value to tourist experience and tourist business alike. Business operators working together are likely to get the greater payback and I would encourage them to do so.

"The developers of the 15 unit Bruce Apartments are well positioned to capitalise on this.

"Currently New Zealand's tourist industry is faced with the decline of some Asian markets, but the prospects for 1999 and for the early part of the next century look outstanding, provided we capitalise on the unique opportunities which lie ahead.

"Encouragingly, our most important Asian market, Japan, has shown no change over the last year and seven per cent growth for February.

"The real test for New Zealand tourism over the next year lies in our traditional markets of Australia, United Kingdom, North America and Europe and the Government, through the New Zealand Tourism Board, is giving a higher priority to these traditional markets.

"With the America's Cup, the World Cup of Golf, APEC, the Millennium and the Olympics, New Zealand has a once in a lifetime opportunity to promote ourselves to the world. We must make sure we seize this chance to sell New Zealand. Not only will the tourism sector benefit, but so will New Zealand's economy," concluded Jenny Shipley.
