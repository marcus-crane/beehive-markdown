Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed today's decision by the Australian High Court that New Zealand television programmes must be included in Australia's local contents quota.

He commended the Tradenz-sponsored Project Blue Sky for its five-nil courtroom success.

"The ruling recognises the 1988 CER Services Protocol which guarantees free trade in services between Australia and New Zealand," Dr Smith said. "It was the only acceptable judgement from New Zealand's point of view and will mean New Zealand producers will have a much better chance of getting programmes like Shortland Street onto Australian TV."

The dispute was centred on the Australian Broadcasting Authority's (ABA) rules which treated New Zealand programmes as foreign. New Zealand contended this was contrary to Australia's obligation to provide national treatment under the 1988 Services Protocol.

The New Zealand Government has been seeking to have the rules changed since 1990. Project Blue Sky's case was initiated in October 1995.
