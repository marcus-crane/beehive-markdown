One of New Zealand's best-known cooks, Alison Holst, has been appointed to one of the two New Zealand positions on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority.

Announcing this today, Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere said he was delighted that Mrs Holst, who holds a Master's degree in food technology, had agreed to make her considerable talents available to the Authority and to the people of Australasia.

"Through her culinary work throughout New Zealand over the years, as well as her highly-regarded and much-used series of cookery books, Mrs Holst has done as much as anyone to awaken New Zealand to the delights of good cooking, and to the need to have high quality standards in the preparation and consumption of food," he said.

"Her communication skills, her awareness of what international markets require from food products, as well as her expertise in food science and consumer issues make her an outstanding representative for New Zealand on the ANZ Food Authority," concluded the Minister.
