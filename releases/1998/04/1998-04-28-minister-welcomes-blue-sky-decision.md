"The Blue Sky team is to be congratulated for their ongoing efforts to increase the market for New Zealand made television programming," Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson said today

The Minister was commenting on the Australian High Court Decision which should now pave the way for New Zealand made television programmes to be included in the Australian Broadcasting Authority's local content quota.

The work of Blue Sky has built on and been complimented by the efforts of Government officials since 1990

"The New Zealand broadcasting market has been fully open to Australian made programmes for some time now and this decision fully embraces the spirit of CER," the Minister said.

"The inclusion of New Zealand programmes in the Australian content standards will bring positive benefits to both sides, including increased opportunities for trans-Tasman productions.

"New Zealand has never suggested that Australian broadcasters be obliged to purchase our programmes, only that New Zealand be given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field,' Mr Williamson said.
