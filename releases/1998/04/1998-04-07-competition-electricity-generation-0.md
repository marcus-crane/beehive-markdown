The Coalition Government has decided in principle to split ECNZ into three competing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the Treasurer and Ministers of Finance, Energy and State-Owned Enterprises said today.

"The new companies will make the wholesale electricity market in New Zealand highly competitive, and should lead to lower prices," the Ministers said.

"The Coalition Government has ruled out privatisation of any of the new SOEs or Contact Energy."

Creating the new SOEs will remove concerns about industry dominance by large companies and provide greater choice of supplier for power purchased on the spot market and/or on long term contacts.

"Electricity shortages cause substantial disruption to people's lives and to the economy as a whole. Equally, investment in stations which are not needed ties up scarce capital and undermines economic growth and employment," the Ministers said.

"Robust competition is the best way to avoid too much or too little capacity.

"If prices remain high when there is surplus capacity, consumers have to pay more than they should and wasteful new investment is encouraged, to the detriment of the environment."

The Ministers said that over the next five years or so, New Zealand is facing a significant surplus of capacity, so there is room for average wholesale prices to fall significantly.

"At present, ECNZ is dominant in the market which allows it to keep prices higher than in a fully competitive market. Break-up will produce much more vigorous competition and lower prices."

New SOEs  
The new SOEs will be as follows:

Waikato hydro stations (SOE 1);  
Huntly thermal station, Te Awamutu and the Tongariro hydro stations (SOE 2); and  
Manapouri and the Waitaki hydro stations (SOE 3)  
Based on existing projections, shares of total capacity (MW) in 2002 will be approximately:

SOE 1 13%  
SOE 2 17%  
SOE 3 30%  
Contact Energy 25%  
The private sector 15%

The structure of Contact Energy is not affected by these changes.

Protecting the rights of Treaty claimants  
The creation of new SOEs will not alter the Treaty of Waitangi related protections that currently apply to ECNZ's assets. Final decisions on the establishment of the new SOEs will not be made until after appropriate consultation with Maori on Treaty issues.

Small hydro stations  
The new SOEs will be required to continue the existing sales processes for the small hydro stations. If they are not sold before the ECNZ split, they will be allocated to the nearest of the new SOEs until the sale process is completed.

Enhancing competition  
On completion of the restructuring, the following existing restraints on ECNZ are to be removed:

the cap on ECNZ providing more than 50% of new capacity;  
the requirement for ECNZ to "ring-fence" any new capacity it provides; and  
the requirement for ECNZ to offer a high level of its capacity to customers each year on longer term contracts.  
Future decisions on new capacity and long-term contracts will be commercial matters for each company to determine in consultation with its shareholders.

All electricity generators will be able to compete for customers across New Zealand. The electricity market is expected to develop transparent, open access arrangements over regional monopoly lines businesses.

Security of supply  
This package has been designed to maintain and enhance security of supply in New Zealand's hydro-dependent system. Before making final decisions, the Government expects wholesale market participants (generators and energy retailers) to confirm that they accept responsibility for protecting against the risks of a "dry year". (The Government's policy is set out in an accompanying policy statement.)

The appropriate level of security of supply of the national grid will be established in negotiations between Transpower and its customers. The Electricity Market (EMCO) will continue to provide a fully functioning market-place to trade electricity.

Overall, security will be enhanced by the fact that the new hydro-only companies will want to extract the maximum value from their water by using it wisely and avoiding spillage.

Implementing the three-way split of ECNZ  
A Transition Team will be established to oversee the restructuring process for generation. It will be required to prepare an overall implementation plan within two months.

Its tasks include identifying how to deal with each of ECNZ's existing contracts so that the rights of ECNZ's staff, suppliers, lenders and customers are appropriately protected.

Following the initial design work of the Transition Team, SOE Development Groups will be formed to negotiate detailed contracts for the split.

Key tasks for the Development Groups include certifying the financial viability of each SOE, ensuring they will compete vigorously in the market, and managing environmental issues appropriately.

The Government will consider the work of the Transition Team and the SOE Development Groups before it makes final decisions on whether to implement the split.

The composition of the Transition Team will be: Tim Saunders (Chairman), Doug Heffernan and Brent Wheeler.

Mr Saunders is currently deputy chairman of Contact Energy (he will not be on the Contact board while on the Transition Team). He is a business analyst and company director who is based in Auckland. He has considerable previous experience advising the Government on commercial and SOE structural issues.

Mr Heffernan was until recently the Chief Exectutive of Power New Zealand, Auckland. He has indepth experience in electricity systems at a senior level.

Dr Wheeler has substantial experience in economic issues, including the New Zealand electricity system. He is an adviser to the Tainui Trust Board and the Papakura District Council.

BACKGROUND ON THE NEW SOEs  
Background information on the stations transferred to each SOE, including name, MW capacity, and fuel type.

SOE 1: Waikato stations  
There are eight hydro stations situated on the Waikato river below Lake Taupo. Total capacity of the stations is 1,058MW. The largest single station is Maraetai, with a capacity of 360MW.

SOE 2: Huntly, Te Awamutu and the Tongariro hydros  
Huntly is situated on the lower Waikato river. It has a capacity of 1000MW and was commissioned in 1981. In capacity terms it is the country's largest station. Huntly can burn either coal or gas in its four generating units.

The Te Awamutu station is a gas-burning unit with a capacity of 52 MW.

The Tongariro hydro group comprises Tokaanu (240MW) and Rangipo (120MW). These stations use water collected from the North Island central plateau which then flows into Lake Taupo.

SOE 3: Manapouri and the Waitaki stations  
Manapouri, situated in the Fiordland National Park, was commissioned in 1969. It has a capacity of 700MW from seven turbines. A second tailrace tunnel is currently under construction to enable the station to make better use of its existing water catchment.

The Waitaki system comprises eight stations that use water collected from the Southern Alps, and neighbouring mountain regions. The stations, commissioned progressively since 1935, have a combined capacity of approximately 1,760MW. The largest is Benmore at 540MW, and Oahu A, B and C with a combined capacity of 688MW.

ECNZ could become SOE 3. It is intended, nevertheless, that ECNZ would still go through the SOE development process for strategic, financial and organisational planning purposes
