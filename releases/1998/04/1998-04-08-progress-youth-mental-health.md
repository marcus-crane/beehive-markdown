The Government is making significant progress in improving the delivery of youth mental health said the Minister of Youth Affairs, Deborah Morris. The Minister was meeting members of the Wellington Mental Health Consumers Union in Wellington.

Deborah Morris said, "We are all agreed that recent reports and statistics have highlighted the need to improve mental health services for young people. Recent initiatives by the Government are beginning to improve the situation, but it will not improve over night.

"Youth mental health services are being expanded. New services include:

\- an early intervention service for youth with serious mental illness;  
\- specialist youth assessment and treatment services;  
\- supported accommodation for youth with serious mental illness;  
\- iwi-provided services for Maori youth;  
\- programmes for Maori youth with alcohol and drug dependency problems; and  
\- additional adolescent acute inpatient psychiatric beds.

"The health of most New Zealand children and young people is good, but unfortunately for a significant number it is not. We know there is more we can do. The Minister of Health and I want to see the completion of the National Child Health Strategy as a way of bringing together all the people working in the interests of children. There are positive signs around the country that people are co-operating rather than competing, and this can only be good for children and their families.

"Children and young people deserve the best possible start in life and this Government is committed to improving child health. Making children a priority on waiting lists is only one area we are working on, but it demonstrates the Government's determination to make a real difference for children," said Deborah Morris.
