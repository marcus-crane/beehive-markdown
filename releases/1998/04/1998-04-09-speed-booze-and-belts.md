"Speeds down, no drinking and driving and all passengers wearing seat belts will make this Easter Weekend one of the safest ever," said Hon Maurice Williamson Minister of Transport today.

Mr Williamson made his comments at the official start of Easter Weekend 1998. The same period last year recorded five fatal crashes resulting in six deaths.

"Holidays don't start on the road, they begin when you get to your destination. Motorists should bear in mind weekend fatalities have accounted for nearly half of all road deaths this year," the Minister said.

"Fatigue, not allowing enough time for journeys and carelessness are all major contributing factors to accidents on New Zealand roads.

"Police officers will be out in force this weekend in an operation targeted at drinking drivers; cutting open road speeding, and drivers, and passengers not wearing seat belts.

"If you can't drive within the law, my advise is stay off the roads otherwise you will be caught," Mr Williamson said.

The Easter Weekend break officially runs from 4pm Thursday April 9 to 8am Tuesday, April 14.
