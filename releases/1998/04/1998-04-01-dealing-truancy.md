Introductions

This is the first time most of you have been able to get together and all focus on the one topic - how we deal with truancy and get kids to stay in the education system. If each of you can go away with a new idea, or a new approach about how to deal with truancy the time here will have been well spent.

The consequences of falling out of the education system are well known. They will get worse as we move into the world of the 21st Century. A young person deprived of their education is a young person deprived of the foundation stone for their working and adult life.

Look at the statistics that we have to turn around. These are new figures, and a Ministry of Education researcher will be going into the research in more depth later today.

This research, based on information collected in 1996, shows:

The average rates for absence overall (including justified absences) were 6.8% for intermediate schools, 8.4 % for composite schools and 12.7% for secondary schools.

For primary schools, which were in a Ministry of Education funded Initiative for Improving School Attendance in 1996, the average rate for absence was 7.2%. We support initiatives to pick up these young people, get them back into the education system and keep them there.

While I often hear claims of sweeping simple solutions to these problems, the reality is that it will take persistent applied effort across a range of initiatives for truancy to fall. We can't just rely on one initiative - like say the NETs scheme or like say the new Special Education 2000 policy. There will be regular disappointments, but just because you don't always hit it it does not mean you don't aim at the bullseye. We must see that our public policies complement each other; that they cross over the traditional boundaries between agencies so that people do not fall through the cracks between agencies and programmes.

We have sought to involve the public in this debate by publishing the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility. Many commentators have seen this as a narrow attempt to address beneficiaries only. That's nonsense. Thinking about social issues and the role of the family, in my portfolio education, makes that point better than others. It does not matter how good our schools are, how good our teachers are or how much effort they put in; if a child turns up to school utterly tired out then they have no chance to reap the benefit they can from our education system. The safest, most up-to-date superbly taught classroom will not succeed if the children aren't turning up able and willing to learn. That's where parental responsibility comes home to roost. Parents are in a key position to ensure their children are ready to get their best from their school.

The Government can only ever be a part of the education answer. What we cannot do is make it all work for everyone without the input of families, communities and of course the students themselves. A strong family supportive of education and their child's learning makes a critical difference to a child's success.

Some people aren't taking these questions seriously. They seem more content on hyping up a political debate than really getting to the heart of the issue. If that is how they chose to deal with major questions facing our society, so be it. But as Minister of Education I can't afford to do that. I would doubt that anyone involved in education or committed to young people could afford to either.

Our basic commitment to the underlying principle of Tomorrow's Schools reflects another way of looking at the need to have parents involved in education of their children if it is to succeed. Giving responsibility for deciding the priorities for spending the education dollar to the school boards on behalf of their communities will mean they take ownership of situations, take initiatives to solve problems, and make the best use of available funds to ensure their children fulfil their potential.

This is very much the underlying principle behind the District Truancy Service model. The Ministry of Education offers funding support and guidance to local communities working in partnership with the schools in the district.

As participants at this conference, you have been invited to attend because you are in a position, through your District Truancy Services, to offer support to your schools, parents and community agencies in addressing the needs of at risk students.

Over the past decade New Zealanders have increasingly recognised the importance of education to our economic and social well being. Education is the key to progress. The policies we put in place and the practices we follow in our educational institutions and all our undertakings with young people focus on preparation for the future.

One of the specific initiatives is of course the reason you are here today. The Government has increased funding for programmes to address truancy by returning to the education system students who truant and students who have become non-enrolled.

The District Truancy Services must encourage individuals and families where problems exist to recognise the need for education and skill development for their children. They can help by identifying the underlying causes of truancy in the individual cases; they can work with schools in early intervention and prevention programmes; and they can work with other agencies to encourage proactive partnerships. Students attend school, hopefully, from around 9:00 to 3:00 but life goes on all day. Where we are dealing with at risk families we need a holistic response that works at solving the problems that undermine the young person's ability to get to school.

Increasingly schools will need to respond to the individual learning styles of their students. To do this they need to be vibrant, lively, relevant establishments - kids cannot stand being bored. I continually stress the need for schools to see how they can improve what they do so they cater for the needs of all their students. That is their job.

We are dealing here with the reality of what happens in the community. I saw a good example of this at a public meeting I attended last year. Four girls who had been booted out of school turned up with the volunteer who was taking them for their correspondence lessons. They told their story. Obviously they were of the ilk that challenge traditional authority, but underneath that they were not fools. One of these young women was obviously someone who pushed boundaries; she obviously did not fit easily into the school setting. In fact the one who spoke most was quite articulate. When I asked what she was suspended for, she said it was because she had dyed her hair green. I imagine that was not the only reason for the suspension. Of deeper significance though to me was the broader question of what was going to happen to her and those like her throughout New Zealand. We really have to find ways that schools can reach these sorts of young people. I constantly stress the importance of schools reaching each and every child on their books. In this case there must have been gaps; for example, she said she had not had a conversation with her school dean until the time she was suspended.

To me, reaching all students is the real challenge facing the teaching profession over the upcoming years. In the past it was easy to get away with just catering to the academically inclined. Those who are left school without any qualifications of substance could make their way through life in a low skilled manual occupation. But those jobs are rapidly disappearing. The best example I know of to demonstrate this occurred to me recently. This year, 1998, is the ninetieth anniversary of the completion of the North Island Main Truck Railway. That huge engineering project was essentially built by hand; pick and shovel - just 90 years ago. If you travel to Wellington you will see being constructed just north of the city a motorway interchange at Newlands in the Ngaranga Gorge. As I drove up the gorge recently I noticed that on that whole site there was not a man with a shovel to be seen anywhere. There were diggers, trucks, bulldozers, loaders etc., but no shovels. In just ninety years the whole way we undertake huge construction has changed completely, and the many manual jobs that the old system created have gone forever.

Some schools are taking the initiative. A few schools have creatively used their funding to have social workers based in schools ? some have shared this resource amongst a clusters of several schools. Some are developing ?one-stop-shop?, full service schools that integrate health and social welfare to get young people on track. There are homework centres and drop in centres at schools because some homes can't provide the space, quietness or adult supervision.

There are programmes such as Tu Tangata involving adults from the community sitting with and supporting students during class. You will be interested to know that truancy has dropped and behaviour has picked up at these schools ? and the adults sometimes gain qualifications they missed out on earlier themselves.

Other programmes within schools identify at risk children early and assist families in sorting out problems before they get to crisis level. Some address bullying - a significant contributor to truancy ? through programmes incorporating anger management and conflict resolution such as the pilot ?Eliminating Violence, Managing Anger? programme that we fund in twenty five schools nationwide at the moment.

The Budget has provided funding for education on issues related to drugs and managing anger.

And of course the truancy initiative, now nation-wide, of which you are a very valued part.

We are strongly encouraging the interagency approach to dealing with children, young people and their families who are at risk. We want this Strengthening Families Project to contribute to:

better educational attainment improved health status reduced incidence of abuse, neglect, or persistent offending. The aim is to assist families to meet their care, control and support responsibilities to their children; and to improve the families? ability to resolve difficulties and problems. When people ? schools, communities, local and central government departments ? work together, the sum is greater than the parts.

There is the School Support Project to help schools experiencing difficulties re-establish themselves. Programmes are also in place to increase the availability of early childhood education. We hope soon to bring in more initiatives to raise achievement for Maori students. We are looking too to release a strategic plan to support Pacific Islands student education.

The Special Education 2000 policy which is designed to establish a clear, consistent and predictable resourcing framework for special education will include further initiatives which will meet the needs of students with significant speech/language difficulties or severe behavioural problems. A major trial of the behaviour initiative is being led in Waikato and if it can be organised an alternative approach in the Nelson area.

Developing School Based Alternative Education options is a new initiative to provide educational opportunity for young people alienated from the educational system who may not be well served by regular school settings is ongoing.

I am aware that as members of District Truancy Service Committees from around the country, you represent and bring experiences from a broad cross section of New Zealand's society. Your efficiency and effectiveness in dealing with children and families at risk is enhanced through local governments, non-government organisations and the broader community becoming involved.

There is no one, correct approach. While it is essential that there is national consistency in safe, efficient and effective practices, we are looking to you for different local solutions suited to different local needs.

I would like to acknowledge the business partnerships that I understand have been developed by some District Truancy Services and also those forged with Minolta New Zealand who have supported this conference through generous sponsorship. Not only is this of great assistance in ensuring you all have a quality venue but I feel it also reinforces the fact that the broader business community is as concerned about social and educational issues as those directly involved in addressing them.

Good educational outcomes for all students has to be our goal. We must not have young people facing the personal, social and economic waste that flows from not achieving their full potential.

I trust this conference will provide an opportunity for discussion and an exchange of ideas, initiatives and examples of effective practice. I hope that the sharing of experiences will build your motivation and your enthusiasm for the tasks facing you.

There is a Maori proverb, which picks up the urgency of your task:

Mahia nga mahi kei tamariki ana. Make the most of your time while you are young.

My good wishes for a stimulating and enlightening conference. Thank you.

Kia ora tatou.
