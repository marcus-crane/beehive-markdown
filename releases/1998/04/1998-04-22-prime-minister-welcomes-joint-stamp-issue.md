"The signing of the official first day covers of the joint Turkey-New Zealand Memorial Statues stamp issue this ANZAC week gives the people of both nations an opportunity to reflect on our shared history as well as celebrate the strong spirit of friendship and goodwill that has been forged," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"As we approach ANZAC Day, the launching of the joint stamp issue not only commemorates the events that took place at Gallipoli, it also serves as a strong reminder of the contradictions of war: the passionate pursuit and defence of freedom, the strongly held values of the respective nations, the comradeship and compassion that can arise and victories and losses that were incurred.

"Thankfully today, modern history records a more peaceful and positive relationship between us.

"The people of both nations can be confident that we have learned from our shared history and moved forward to forge a positive and warm ongoing relationship that binds us in friendship, trade and cultural ties.

"Today's joint stamp issue is one of the symbols of that special friendship, as well as a mutual remembrance of the past.

"The joint issue also shows the depth and strength of relations between New Zealand Post and its Turkish counterpart, for which they should both be congratulated," the Prime Minister concluded.
