State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall welcomed today the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report on Timberland West Coast's sustainable beech management plans.  
In the report, the Commissioner concluded that Timberlands' beech plans "incorporate the principles of sustainability".

The Commissioner says "the plans represent considerable progress towards an integrated adaptive management system that seeks to provide timber products while maintaining ecological sustainability".

The Commissioner also made three recommendations to the Minister for State Owned Enterprises.

1\. Extension of the public comment process until mid-December

Mr Ryall agreed with the Commissioner that the beech management plans were complex and that the public needed further time to prepare.

"Late last week we announced an extension of the time for public comment by an additional two weeks ending 20th November. Feedback we have received suggests that this extra time will be sufficient to help people submit their comments," Mr Ryall said.

2\. Appoint an independent auditor to carry out annual audits of Timberlands' performance under the plans.

Mr Ryall said auditing was a critical aspect of ensuring true ecological sustainability.

"This is a valuable suggestion which I intend to pursue. The Government is working to bring these forests under the Forests Act. This will see independent annual audits by MAF. In addition, the Director Generals of MAF and DOC can request that plans are reviewed every five years.

"I consider that there is merit in the public having access to an audit report. The results of these audits could be included in the company's annual report. I will be doing more work on how we accommodate this recommendation."

3\. A campaign to improve public understanding of indigenous forest use for both production and environmental goals.

"The Commissioner's report considers the broader issues of multiple use of indigenous forests. The Commissioner is keen to foster public understanding that native forests can be managed for both production and conservation purposes. I believe the current public comment phase is contributing to this."

Mr Ryall said the report acknowledged the progress Timberlands has made since Labour's planned large-scale industrial beech chipping plant of the mid-80s.

"The Government reiterates that it will only approve Timberlands' beech management plans if it is satisfied they are sustainable, economically feasible, and protect the areas of important conservation value in our West Coast forests.

"We are undertaking the public comment process recommended in the former Commissioner's 1995 report."

Timberlands' plans are available at public libraries and on the Internet:
