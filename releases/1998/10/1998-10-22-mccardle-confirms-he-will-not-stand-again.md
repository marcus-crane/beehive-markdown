Independent MP and Associate Work and Income Minister Peter McCardle has confirmed he will not be standing at the next general election.

Mr McCardle has been in Parliament since 1990.

He said today that he has enjoyed his time in politics and was pleased to have achieved the major employment reforms, including the one-stop-shop and the Community Wage, which were his main motivation for entering politics.

"The reforms are now in place. But there remains much to be done to ensure that maximum benefits are achieved, and I look forward to contributing to that process until the next general election," Mr McCardle said.
