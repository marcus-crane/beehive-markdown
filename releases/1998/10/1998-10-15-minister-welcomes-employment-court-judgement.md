The Minister of Internal Affairs Jack Elder has welcomed the Employment Court's decision on elements of the restructuring of the Fire Service.

Mr Elder said the modernisation of the Fire Service is aimed at saving lives. Reducing the incidence and consequences of fire is part of the reorganisation strategy and will require fire officers who're highly skilled and dedicated to public education.

"It is essential to the public well being that the modernisation process proceeds and the decision has cleared the way for this to continue," Mr Elder said.

"Considerable progress has already been made with public education programmes, reduced response times by fire fighting units through strategic relocation of stations and quality research carried out at Canterbury University."

Mr Elder said the Fire Service has been long overdue for its practices to be brought into line with the best of the public and private sector.

"I hope the union and the commission are able from this judgement to get round the table as soon as possible and come to a settlement which advances the modernisation process while ensuring a just settlement for those working in the industry," Mr Elder said.
