The Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon David Carter, today extended by two weeks the period available for public comment on Timberlands West Coast's sustainable beech management plans.

The deadline for public submissions will now close on 20 November, bringing to six weeks the time made available for the public to make comments on the plans. Mr Carter said the Government was extending the public comment phase by two weeks to give the public as much opportunity as possible to see for themselves the approach Timberlands has taken to the sustainable management of the forests and to comment on those plans.

"Feedback we have received from a number of people indicates that they would appreciate another two weeks to prepare their submissions. Accordingly we have extended the period available for public comment on the plans from four to six weeks."

Mr Carter said this level of scrutiny and transparency has never before been required of any forest owner. Before making a final decision on whether to proceed with sustainable beech production, the Government must be satisfied that the plans are not only ecologically sustainable, but also economically viable, and that areas of the highest conservation value are preserved.

The full plans are available at selected public libraries and on the Internet (http://www.maf.govt.nz/Forestry). A summary of the plans is available by writing to Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) which is conducting the public comment process. (More to come)
