The Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum will give young New Zealanders representation at the highest level of Government, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Minister of Youth Affairs Tony Ryall said today.

"If we want to find solutions to young peoples' issues, we have to listen to them. The Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum will make an important contribution to Government decisions affecting young people," Mrs Shipley said.

"The ideas and energy of young people will shape our nation in the next millenium. The Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum recognises the real contribution that young people can make to the future of our country."

Youth Affairs Minister Tony Ryall said the 15 members of the Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum were chosen from 230 applications.

"The members of the Prime Minister's Youth Advisory Forum are aged between 12 and 23 years and reflect the diversity of New Zealand's young people," Mr Ryall said.

"The Prime Minister's Youth Advisory forum will be a great opportunity for these young people to represent their peers. I look forward to working with the youth advisory forum and sharing their knowledge and views of how we can tackle the issues that young people face."

The Prime Minister, Minister of Youth Affairs and Independent MP Deborah Morris will meet with the forum in Wellington on 12th and 13th October. Two more meetings are planned over the next 12 months.
