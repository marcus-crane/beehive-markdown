Schools, teachers and students will this week learn of a new approach to using and promoting information technology and computers in education.

The Education Minister and Prime Minister will officially launch "Interactive Education" - an Information and Communication Technologies Strategy for Schools on Wednesday 28 October at 3.45pm at Wellington Girls College.

The release of the Government strategy will be followed by an interactive focus day for teachers and principals on Thursday 29 October at Wellington's Overseas Terminal.

"The Information and Communication Technologies Strategy is a very practical approach to getting every school, student and teacher au-fait with information and communication technology," Mr Creech said. "It has been developed in conjunction with a wide range of educationalists, technology sector groups, community groups and industry.

"Getting value for money and making the most of information technology is not a case of trucking in thousands of computers into our schools. To get a really effective programme principals and teachers need to know how to integrate technology into their teaching and learning programmes.

"The focus day will be an opportunity for those at the chalk face to roll up their sleeves and really work on ways to return to their school and inject information and communication technologies into the every day running of, and learning at, the school," Mr Creech said.

About 200 educationalists will attend the focus day in Wellington, in addition there will be live link ups across the country via video conferencing.

Australian educationalist Howard Kelly will take part in the focus day. Mr Kelly is General Manager, Multimedia and Cross Sectoral Programmes, Office of the Secretary of Education, Victoria. He is in charge of the Schools for the Third Millennium Project.

"Victoria has done some extremely innovative things with information technology in schools. We have been able to gain from their experience and ideas and learn where they went right, and where they went wrong," Mr Creech said.
