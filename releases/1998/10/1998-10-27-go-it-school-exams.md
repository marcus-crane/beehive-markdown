Education Minister Wyatt Creech today hoped the thousands of students embarking on school exams today would really "go for it" once they were in the exam room.

More than 91,000 secondary school students start their School Certificate and University Bursaries exams today.

"I remember too well the feelings of nervousness and trepidation as I entered my end of year school exams, but once I sat down to the exam I gave it my best shot. I urge today's students to do the same.

"The final exams are the culmination of the year's work for students, testing the skills and knowledge they have picked up.

"It is important for every student to give the exams their best and apply themselves as well as they can.

"When the exams are over students will be able to go into the new year on a positive note," Mr Creech said.
