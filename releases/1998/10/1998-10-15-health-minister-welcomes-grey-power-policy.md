Health Minister Bill English said today he welcomed Grey Power's health policy, particular the call for more political agreement over health issues.

"I welcome this policy. This year I have called a number of times for multi-party support for various initiatives, including the child health strategy and the Hospital Services Plan.

"There will always be some political differences between parties, but we should be able to find areas where there is broad agreement, such as child health, and get support across the political spectrum for policy.

"There is widespread public support for a greater political consensus in health and Grey Power has recognised this better than the politicians.

"I have had a number of constructive discussions with Grey Power over their ideas for health and look forward to having more, because the policy announced today is worth considering.

"I do understand their concerns about the need for certainty about what services are available and stability within the sector. This is what I have been working towards with the Hospital Services Plan, the Rural Health Policy and the Booking System in particular," said Mr English.
