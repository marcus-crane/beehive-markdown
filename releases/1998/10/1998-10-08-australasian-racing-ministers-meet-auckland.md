Racing Minister Clem Simich is to host and chair the 1998 Australian & New Zealand Racing Ministers' Conference, which will be held tomorrow at the Auckland Centra Hotel. The meeting will be attended by the Racing Ministers from each Australian State.

"The New Zealand racing industry is increasingly competing in an Australasian market. Not only do annual events such as the Melbourne Cup and the Interdominions receive strong support on both sides of the Tasman, but there are also very close links between the breeding industries of both countries" the Minister said.

"Australian owners always feature strongly at this country's various yearling sales and many trainers have established stables in both countries.

"We are also increasingly seeing the development of a Trans-Tasman gaming market. Currently, the New Zealand TAB offers odds on Australian racing and has a number of Australian-based clients. New Zealand punters are also able to place bets with various Australian TABs and betting agencies.

"The Conference will provide an important forum for Ministers to examine and discuss a range of issues currently facing the industry.

Agenda items at the Conference include Internet wagering, the impact of pay television, racing industry reform and the introduction of a GST in Australia.

The meeting will conclude with Ministers and delegates attending the North Shore City Stakes at Alexandra Park on Friday night, followed by the Lindauer Guineas Day at Ellerslie on Saturday.
