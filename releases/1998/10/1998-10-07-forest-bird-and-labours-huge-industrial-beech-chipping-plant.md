When Forest and Bird and the Labour government's environment minister Phil Goff signed the West Coast Accord in 1986, they envisaged a huge industrial chipping plant based on 137,000 cubic metres of beech each year," State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"The huge beech scheme envisaged by Labour and Forest and Bird was almost twice the size of Timberlands West Coast's sustainable beech management plans released yesterday for public comment," Mr Ryall said.

"Timberlands' plans allow a maximum of 25,087 mature beech trees to be harvested each year, producing 66,401 cubic metres of beech. The 25,087 mature beech trees planned for harvest represent just 0.5% of the 4.7 million mature beech trees in these forests.

"Small volumes of poor quality and immature trees will also be removed through production thinning (7046 cubic metres) and improvement felling (8930 cubic metres) through a process scientifically designed to mimic nature as closely as possible.

"Labour and Forest and Bird envisaged large areas of clear felling in the West Coast beech forests when they signed the Accord. By contrast, Timberlands is proposing to sustainably harvest half that volume of beech. This proposal is about sustainable single tree or small group extraction by helicopter.

"The Maruia Society and Worldwide Fund for Nature say Timberlands' beech plans should be given 'serious and open-minded consideration'. We have released the documents to enable exactly that and I look forward to receiving the public's comments."
