Hon Marie Hasler, Associate Minister for the Environment, will present Environmental Choice licences for household tissue and recycled paper to Gracefield Paper tomorrow afternoon.

Gracefield is the first company to gain either licence. As a result the Environmental Choice label will be seen on supermarket shelves for the first time. The range of tissue includes paper towels, serviettes, toilet paper and facial tissue.

Ms Hasler will arrive at the Royal Oak Mall Pac N Sav at 3.00pm and walk through the store to view the product on the shelf. The formal launch will be at The Sorrento, One Tree Hill Domain, Manukau Road at 3.30pm.
