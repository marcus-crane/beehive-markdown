New Zealand and China have agreed to establish a bilateral security dialogue, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced from Beijing today.

The announcement followed a meeting between the Minister and his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.

"China is a major player in the Asia-Pacific region. The security dialogue provides a Forum for discussing with them the major security issues - including disarmament issues - of the day," the Minister said.

"New Zealand has an excellent relationship with China. This dialogue adds another facet to it," the Minister added.

The dialogue builds on other developments in the New Zealand-China security relationship. The Minister of Defence, Hon Max Bradford, has just visited China, following a visit to New Zealand by his Chinese counterpart, General Chi Haotian, early this year. Both countries have agreed to appoint defence attachés to their respective embassies.

Mr McKinnon remains in China until Sunday, when he leaves for one-day bilateral visits to Japan and Korea.
