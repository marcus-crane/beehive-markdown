New research shows the Schools Support Project is making a big difference helping struggling schools get back on track, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

The Schools Support Project helps schools having difficulties with delivering curriculum, health and safety, governance and management, or school and community relationships.

"Most schools in New Zealand are working very well," said Mr Creech. "However, there are times when some need extra support to help resolve an at risk situation."

The Government has committed up to $45 million over three years for the Schools Support Project to improve the performance of schools which run into problems.

"The external evaluation not only found that there was overall satisfaction with the interventions available, but also that the outcomes of the interventions were being sustained."

Between 86% and 90% of schools surveyed agreed that the Schools Support process works, that it makes a positive contribution, and that it is needed. The great majority of those schools also judged the outcomes as either positive or mostly positive.

The research shows that governance and management has improved and staff stress reduced.

"I am also fully aware of examples of successful interventions such as the business cases implemented in South Auckland at Tangaroa College and the Southern Cross Campus. While those interventions were not yet completed, in each case the Education Review Office reported significant improvement had already been achieved."

The schools which participated in the evaluation were unanimous that the management of the Schools Support Project was best sited within the Ministry of Education.

"There are, however, areas identified by the external evaluation where the Schools Support Project can be strengthened," Mr Creech said. "Schools sampled said problems are often not identified early enough, and that interventions were not always implemented as soon as they could have been."

The Ministry of Education is commissioning work on ways of improving the collection and analysis of at risk indicators. In addition, more resource has been allocated to help Ministry Management Centres strengthen their sector networks at a local level.

"Local education sector networks are critical in the early identification of at risk situations," Mr Creech concluded. "The earlier problems are identified the easier it is to resolve them, and the more cost effective the intervention."
