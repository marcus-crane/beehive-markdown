The Minister of Education has decided Te Kao Area School in Northland will become a full primary school.

Te Kao Area School is currently a J1 to Form 7 school. Its roll at the beginning of March was 62, including 14 secondary school aged students.

"There has been a lot of consultation and discussion in the community about the best way forward for Te Kao Area School. The low number of secondary school students enrolled in Te Kao has raised real questions about the quality of education they are receiving," Mr Creech  
said.

"There have not been enough students to sustain the secondary school component of Te Kao Area School. From next year Te Kao will only teach children aged from New Entrants to Form 2.

"Other arrangements will be made for secondary school aged students, including providing assistance to attend Kaitaia College.

"The changed status of the school, plus transport assistance and boarding bursaries should clear the way for the secondary school aged students to experience the advantages of receiving their education at a larger school."

Mr Creech said the decision followed an Education Review Office report and consideration of how best to provide secondary education for the students at Te Kao.

The School's Commissioner will work with the school, teachers and community to manage the change for next year.
