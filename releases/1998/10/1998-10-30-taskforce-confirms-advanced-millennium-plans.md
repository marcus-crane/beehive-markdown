The Chair of the NZ2000 Ministers, Murray McCully, has welcomed today's announcement that plans for internationally televised Millennium events are taking shape.

"Today's announcement by the Towards 2000 Taskforce that these plans centre on the Chatham Islands, Mt Hikurangi and Gisborne City, indicate that good strategic use is being made of the available budget."

"I am aware of the work which is being done to conclude negotiations with the various groups including the complex commercial discussions. I am very pleased with the progress which is being made by the Taskforce, led by David Beatson and the Millennium Office led by Jude Urlich."
