Foreign Minister Don McKinnon confirmed today that his Japanese counter part Foreign Affairs Minister, Masahiko Koumura, will make an official visit to New Zealand on November 6 and 7.

Mr McKinnon said the relationship with Japan was of immense importance to New Zealand and Mr Koumura's visit provided a timely opportunity to share perspectives on a number of issues.

The focus of the Minister's visit will be formal discussions with Mr McKinnon on current and future direction of the bilateral relationship, the upcoming APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur and regional economic and security issues.

Mr Koumura is a member of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Obuchi's cabinet formed in July.

This will be first high level visit from Japan since former Prime Minister Hashimoto's visit last year.
