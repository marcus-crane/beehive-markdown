The acting Minister of Health, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today there was no cause for alarm in the Waikato about the status of Waikato Hospital.

"As the Minister, Mr English, has indicated previously, the Government fully recognises the quality and value of the services provided there and has no intention of downgrading or devaluing them.

"There has been concern expressed that it may be difficult to attract qualified staff to Waikato, simply because it is classified as level two and not level one in the Hospital Plan.

"The Hospital Plan makes it quite clear that there are no plans to downgrade hospitals. "The high-quality services that are being provided at Waikato Hospital will continue to be offered. Any attempt to suggest otherwise would be misleading the public," said the acting Minister.
