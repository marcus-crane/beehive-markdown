The timeline for the development and trialing of a Work Capacity Assessment process for beneficiaries or benefit applicants who are sick or have a disability has been updated, announced Minister of Social Services, Work and Income the Hon Roger Sowry.  
The process, which is designed to identify what a person can do, rather than what they can't, is to be rigorously trialed and evaluated.

"Phase 1 of the trial will now run from 1 February to 31 July 1999 and Phase 2 from 1 November 1999 to 30 June 2001. This extends the timeline for the whole process by two months."

"The Government is fully committed to the development of this process and as a consequence we are going a little slower to make sure we have it right."

The Work Capacity Assessment trial will involve the use of independent assessors with qualifications and experience in working with people with different disabling conditions. The first phase of the trial will take place in six sites around the country - the location of these sites will be announced shortly. WINZ will also begin advertising for independent assessors to take part in the trials.

Work Capacity Assessment forms a part of the Government's welfare and employment reform strategy which is designed to encourage and assist more people into paid employment. As part of this strategy, clearer eligibility criteria for the Invalids' Benefit were introduced on 1 September 1998.

"The aim of the Government's welfare and employment strategies is to assist individuals towards and into paid work to the extent that they are able. Welfare policies in the past have tended to focus on what people can't do, rather than what they are capable of."

"I am regularly coming across people on the Invalids' Benefit who are looking for a chance to be included. Until now, no policies have focused on what they can contribute. These policies, including the Work Capacity Assessment trial, are designed to change this."
