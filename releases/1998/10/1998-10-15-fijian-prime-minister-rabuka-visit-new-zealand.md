Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will visit New Zealand from October 25-30, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

Mrs Shipley said New Zealand enjoyed a warm relations with Fiji. Mr Rabuka's visit would provide a timely opportunity to discuss ways of strengthening the already close ties that exist through trade, tourism, defence, sport and immigration.

"I am delighted that Prime Minister Rabuka will be visiting us so soon after Fiji has adopted its new Constitution, which sets a basis for new era of cooperation among the people of Fiji," Mrs Shipley said.

Fiji's new Constitution, which came into effect on July 27, establishes Fiji as the Republic of the Fiji Islands, and names its people as Fiji Islanders.

Fiji is New Zealand's largest South Pacific trading partner, and one of New Zealand's top 20 markets, taking NZ$190 million worth of exports in the year to June 1998.

During his New Zealand visit, Mr Rabuka will receive an official welcome at Parliament Buildings and will be guest of honour at a state luncheon hosted by Mrs Shipley. In addition to official calls, he will discuss prospects for furthering two-way trade, tour several small-business ventures, including whale watching in Kaikoura, and visit Fijian community groups.

Prime Minister Rabuka will be accompanied by his wife and a party of officials.
