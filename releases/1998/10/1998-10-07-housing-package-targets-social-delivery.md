"The National minority Government will be making significant housing announcements this week, all designed to improve access to accommodation for lower income New Zealanders", the Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The package has been prepared after listening to community concerns and detailed discussions at Cabinet and with the Independent MP's who support the Government.

"The Government is today giving clearer instructions to its housing agencies that they must meet our social objectives.

"It is unacceptable to me and to my Government that there is overcrowding when there are state houses lying vacant in some parts of New Zealand.

"Equally, we must acknowledge that the housing circumstances of some New Zealanders, especially Maori in the more remote parts of the country, fall below the standard which most of us would regard as acceptable.

"The Government alone cannot fix all of these problems but it is determined to work with individuals and interest groups who are delivering results.

"The Government's announcements will demonstrate a substantial commitment to helping those who want to help themselves." the Prime Minister said.
