Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says recent prosecutions by the Occupational Safety and Health Service (OSH) show that where legal action is warranted OSH doesn't shy away.

Mr Bradford said that since 1 July this year, OSH has competed 37 prosecution cases involving 57 charges. Of the 57 charges, there were 43 convictions, six cases were withdrawn by leave of the court (several of these due to liquidation of the companies), and the other eight cases were either dismissed or not proceeded with because of plea-bargaining reasons.

The total in fines since 1 July has amounted to $173,300. The highest equal fine for a single charge has been $30,000 - including yesterday's Downer Construction Ltd case.

Other high prosecution fines since 1 July include: $20,000 in a fatal case in Auckland, $15,000 in a serious harm case in Auckland, $12,000 in a fatality case in Whakatane, $8,000 in a serious harm case in Auckland, $5,000 in a serious harm case in Hastings.
