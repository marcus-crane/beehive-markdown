The Prime Minister the Rt Hon Jenny Shipley today welcomed the re-election of the Liberal-National Coalition Government in Australia.

"New Zealand has a very good relationship with Australian Prime Minister John Howard and his Government. I have conveyed the New Zealand Government's congratulations and best wishes to him and reinforced our desire to continue to work together and make progress on important matters of mutual interest.

"The Australian election result shows voters faced with difficult economic times prefer parties that offer bold policies and good economic management, ahead of negative campaigning and unclear policy alternatives.

"I look forward to working with Prime Minister Howard to enhance the trans-Tasman relationship and to make progress on regional and international issues where we have common interests," the Prime Minister concluded.
