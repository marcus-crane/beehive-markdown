The Minister for Senior Citizens, Hon David Carter, will meet with Age Concern and Greypower organisations around the country this week to discuss recent superannuation changes.

Tomorrow, Tuesday, Mr Carter will meet with Age Concern and Greypower representatives in Tauranga and Rotorua.

On Wednesday Mr Carter will meet with Age Concern and Greypower representatives in Christchurch, as well as visiting a local resthome to explain further the superannuation change the Government announced last month.

On Thursday Mr Carter will head for Invercargill to meet local representatives of both senior citizens groups in the city to discuss the same issue.

The meetings follow Mr Carter's visits to resthome residents in the Hutt Valley last week.

"I found there was a lot of misinformation out there. Our older people haven't been well served by the media on this issue. There's a lack of understanding about what the Government has done to superannuation and why."

"When I sit down with older people and explain that their superannuation will continue to keep pace with any increases in the cost of living, and that they won't actually lose any dollars from their current pension, many visibly relax."

"I'm looking forward to a constructive week of meetings on the issue, and I'm delighted that these organisations have accepted my offer to come and talk to them on superannuation."
