The Government is writing to every superannuitant in New Zealand this week to explain how the changes to policies affecting the elderly may affect them, says Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, and Minister of Social Services, Roger Sowry.

"There is currently a lot of uncertainty and incorrect information about what is happening to superannuation and every elderly New Zealander needs to know just what the changes are and how they may be affected.

"These letters make it clear that pensions are not decreasing and will continue to keep pace with the cost of living every year as they have done for years.

"We also clearly explain how the new Superannuation 2000 Taskforce will work to fulfil its single task of seeking a long-term solution to superannuation for not just this generation but for our children and grandchildren.

"Older New Zealanders who need rest home or geriatric hospital care will see clearly just how much more of their income and cash assets they can now keep and still get subsidised care. No New Zealander in New Zealand will be left without care in their old age if they require it.

"It is vital that every one of New Zealand's 474,000 superannuitants know with certainty what assistance from Government they are entitled to both now and in the future," Mrs Shipley and Mr Sowry said.

The letter was produced and posted to individuals at a cost of under $200,000, funded by the Government Departments involved.

Dear

You may be wondering about announcements that have been made last week that may affect you. I want you to know the facts.

Your superannuation

Currently the rates paid to superannuitants are:

Married couple $324.38 per week  
Single person alone $212.69 per week  
Single person sharing $195.84 per week

No one will have these payments reduced.

Each year on April 1 superannuation is increased to cover rises in prices generally. This will continue! As is currently the case the married couple rate will be increased by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Single people living alone will continue to get 65 per cent and single people sharing will get 60 percent of the married rate.

This will protect your purchasing power and means your superannuation will keep in step with price increases. We had hoped to increase pensions by a greater amount but that is not possible.

That is the main decision we took this week.

The Superannuation 2000 Taskforce

The Government is going to set up an independent group to work with politicians to seek a long-term solution to superannuation for New Zealanders. It will begin work in November 1998 and report to the Government in November 2000.

The Retirement Commissioner has told us that 85 per cent of all New Zealanders want political parties to work together. We will aim to do that.

An independent person will chair this group to try and guide this vexed issue to a conclusion. It is our hope that with outside people involved this group may be able to achieve what the Accord could not.

Support for those needing long-term care

Currently in New Zealand, 28,600 older New Zealanders are in rest home or geriatric hospital care. We have tried to be fair to all New Zealanders wherever they live or whatever type of care they are in.

The Government has agreed to allow people to retain more of their income and cash assets than was the case before, and still get care subsidised by Government on behalf of taxpayers.

A single person alone in care currently can keep $6,500 and receive free care. This amount will be raised to $15,000.

A married couple where both are in care currently can keep $13,000 and receive free care. This amount will be raised to $30,000.

A married couple where one partner is in care can currently keep $40,000 plus their house and car. This will be raised to $45,000 plus their house and car.

We will also ensure older victims of serious crimes who then require care as a result of the crime, don't have to pay.

In New Zealand no older New Zealander is left without care in their old age if they require it.

All these measures will ensure older New Zealanders are valued and well cared for.

I hope this makes the issues clear for you. If you have any question about any of these issues, please contact your local Work and Income New Zealand office.

Yours sincerely

Rt Hon Jenny Shipley Hon Roger Sowry  
Prime Minister Minister of Social Services
