"Wingnut Productions' Lord of the Rings will be a show piece for New Zealand and the creativity of our film makers," Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, and Minister of Revenue, Max Bradford said today.

Mr Bradford and Immigration Minister Tuariki Delamere are visiting filmaker Peter Jackson's Wingnut Productions in Wellington this afternoon.

The film will be one of the biggest ever made in New Zealand. There will be more than 60 speaking roles, thousands of extras, and it is estimated than that more than $200 million will enter the New Zealand economy over the course of the filming.

"Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, after a very successful visit to Wingnut Productions yesterday, wants to ensure the Government provides every assistance possible to this exciting project," Mr Bradford said.

"It's a great credit to Mr Jackson and partner Fran Walsh that they have signed a contract to film the Lord of the Rings in New Zealand for United States company New Line Cinema."
