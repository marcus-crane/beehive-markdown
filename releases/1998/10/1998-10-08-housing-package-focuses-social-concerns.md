"The raft of housing initiatives announced by the National minority Government this week will help to ensure that low income New Zealand families have affordable and suitable housing," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The initiatives announced today acknowledge that the housing circumstances of some New Zealanders, particularly Maori in remote parts of the country, fall below the standard which most of us would regard as acceptable.

"This week's announcements demonstrate this Government's substantial commitment and determination to deal with the issues at the heart of New Zealanders' concerns in a modern and responsible way.

"This package has been prepared after listening to community concerns and after detailed discussions at Cabinet and with the Independent MPs who support the Government.

"The Government alone cannot fix all of New Zealand's social problems but is willing to work with individuals and interest groups who are delivering results that are improving the lives of low-income families," the Prime Minister said.
