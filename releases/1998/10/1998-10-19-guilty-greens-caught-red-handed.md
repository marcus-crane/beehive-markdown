Jeanette Fitzsimons has been caught red-handed in the act of misleading the public, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today. "In a statement released yesterday, Jeanette Fitzsimons alleged that Timberlands is blackmailing the Cabinet to gain approval for itssustainable beech plans.

"Yet the paper released under the Official Information Act, upon which Ms Fitzsimons bases her blackmail allegation, makes absolutely no reference to Timberlands' beech plans. The allegations of blackmail are groundless.

"The paper has nothing to do with Timberlands' environmentally sustainable beech plans. It relates to the Government's intention to end the Buller rimu overcut and bring all indigenous forestry on the West Coast on to a sustainable basis for the new millennium.

"As the West Coast Accord and Timberlands' Deed allow for the Buller overcut to continue until 2006, Timberlands' directors would be compelled to consider seeking compensation from the Crown for bringing forward the cessation of the Buller overcut.

This is common practice when changes are made to such a contract. "Instead of misleading the public, the Greens would be wiser to take the position of Labour MP, Damien O'Connor, who believes the plans are truly sustainable and has given them his full support. (Greymouth Evening Star 7/10/98) "Respected environmental groups such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Maruia Society believe Timberlands' beech plans should be given 'serious and open-minded consideration'. Maruia Society chief executive Guy Salmon says that if the plans are approved, New Zealanders will at long last be able to use native timber with a clear conscience."
