The Minister of Health, Hon Bill English moved today to reassure people suffering from cancer that the problems MidCentral Health were experiencing at the present time would be resolved as soon as possible.

"People with cancer need to know when and where they are to receive their treatment" Mr English said.

"The problems at MidCentral Health are more about industrial relations issues and the ability to recruit extra staff than they are about resources. I have been assured that the money and the equipment are there to provide these services.

MidCentral has suffered the disruption of a strike in recent times, and radiotherapy staff are still to negotiate a settlement on extending their hours which will bring them into line with most other hospitals providing similar services. MidCentral is one of only two services where staff work less than 40 hours per week to provide radiotherapy services for cancer patients.

These negotiations must be completed with urgency so that patients lives are not placed at risk.

MidCentral is also actively trying to recruit additional staff which, in addition to a resolution of the industrial relations situation, will ease the current situation.

"I will be monitoring the situation closely" Mr English concluded.
