The National-led minority Government will continue to build on the many achievements of the past year as it prepares for the next general election just over a year away, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today, outside an all-day Cabinet meeting at Premier House.

The meeting is part of the Government's annual planning process which includes setting political, legislative and Budget priorities for the coming year.

Mrs Shipley said: "The Government has delivered a strong performance in demanding economic and political times and we are very proud of that achievement.

"New Zealand businesses and families are benefiting from the good policies and management of this Government. Lower interest rates and low inflation are helping families and businesses alike and will return us to growth, more jobs and future success.

"It is my intention to build on our policy achievements of the past year and to lead the Government through to the next general election in November 1999.

"We will continue to manage our Budget so we can invest in our future while still acting responsibly in relation to international economic realities.

Mrs Shipley says the Government's decision-making will continue to build on the goals outlined in the Prime Minister's statement in February. Those goals are to:

Make a difference with social assistance which genuinely breaks cycles of disadvantage. Ensure low income people are not taxed to pay benefits to the better off.  
Improve business competitiveness and increase the living standards of New Zealanders. Strengthen our economic and fiscal management.

"This Government has sought to define its term in office by making decisions that will benefit this generation of New Zealanders using only this generation's resources.

"That has required some tough decisions to be taken, but we have not shied away from that as some are inclined to do. We have refused to pass our bill onto future generations because that is irresponsible and unfair.

"The National-led minority Government will continue to make steady progress on a range of policy issues while providing stable and responsible leadership for New Zealand. We intend to make 1999 our year," Mrs Shipley concluded.
