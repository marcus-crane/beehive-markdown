New Zealand children must be literate in the use of computers and information technology if they are to succeed in the 21st Century, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley told a group of teachers and students at Wellington Girls' College at the launch of the Government's new "Interactive Education" strategy.

The aim of the strategy is to make sure all teachers and students are familiar with information technology.

"It is a simple fact of life that we live in the information age and the computer is the fastest and most common way to transfer information," Mrs Shipley said.

"Therefore, it is essential that older generations (such as teachers) are able to teach younger generations about computers and information technology so they are prepared for life in the 21st Century.

"Although information and communications technologies are not an end in themselves they can add huge value to education in a variety of ways."

Mrs Shipley urged businesses to support technology in schools.

"Already large corporates are involved in a range of initiatives providing free phone lines, computer hardware and professional development for teachers and participating in 'NetDay'. Computer recycling from businesses to schools is an area that will be promoted further by the new strategy.

"I would like to congratulate all those involved in the development of the "Interactive Education" strategy including Education Minister Wyatt Creech, officials and others in the education sector and the various industry representatives who have worked closely with the Government and schools.

"Like the Policies for Progress measures announced last week, I encourage all families, communities, and the business sector to support our children at school as they learn the skills needed to succeed in the IT age," Mrs Shipley concluded.
