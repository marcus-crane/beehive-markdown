Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced New Zealand's nomination of Don McKinnon for the position of Commonwealth Secretary-General.

"Don McKinnon is widely respected in New Zealand and internationally as our Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. His nomination for the position of next Commonwealth Secretary-General has the wholehearted backing of the Government and the warm support of the wider New Zealand community.

"It is an honour for New Zealand that so many in the Commonwealth have encouraged Don McKinnon to stand. Over the past eight years, he has become a respected and influential Commonwealth leader. The job requires political seniority and Commonwealth experience and Don clearly has those qualifications.

"New Zealand benefits from its membership of the Commonwealth and it is only right that we should also contribute to its future. This is an opportunity for New Zealand to take a leading role in a major international organisation."

"Don McKinnon's candidature is also an opportunity for New Zealand to continue to encourage cooperation between countries of all levels of development to ensure that the interests of small states especially are enhanced and to promote good governance.

"We already have very good levels of support extended to New Zealand's candidature. We will concentrate in the next twelve months on justifying the confidence already expressed in Don and on securing further support," the Prime Minister concluded.
