The fact Helen Clark hasn't been able to satisfy Jim Anderton by raising taxes for 144,000 hard-working New Zealanders is ominous for everyone trying to earn a living, Treasurer Bill Birch said today.

"What's more, the tax rises Labour have owned up to are nowhere near enough to pay for its $3.8 billion of promises. Have they added them up?

"Ms Clark might be trying to position Labour as economically and fiscally responsible.

"But she refuses to stop making promises about extra government spending to every group she talks to.

"And she won't say how New Zealanders are going to be made to pay for all of the promises."

Labour's current spending tally consists of:

- a promise to small businesses of a $1 for $1 subsidy to buy computers. There are 225,000 small businesses (with under 20 staff) in New Zealand. With a computer and printer costing around $5000, even subsidising half of these companies would cost $282 million.
- making the emergency unemployment benefit available to all students - $14 million in 99/2000.
- ring fencing 8 cents of tax for a superannuation fund - this takes away $2.675 billion used to fund current national superannuation.
- increasing family assistance (assuming $5 per week per child) $150 million
- increasing mental health service funding (assuming 10%) - $55 million.
- reinstating a 65% wage floor for superannuation - $101 million.
- increasing elective surgery funding (assuming 10%) - $43 million.
- raising benefit levels ($10 a week) - $212 million.
- increasing tertiary subsidies (5% real increase) - $34 million
- industry policy - Labour's costing $100 million .
- changing Housing NZ rentals - Labour's costing $120 million.

"Labour's spending promises add up to $3.786 billion in the first year.

"That, of course, is without the Alliance's bizarre promises. He's going around the country telling his supporters don't worry, the money's there - because he thinks he has the right to take as much as he wants out of New Zealanders' pockets."

Mr Birch said Helen Clark should remember that someone always had to pay for the "free" services or "government money" Labour loves to promise to every group it talks to.

"Last election Labour's plan was simply to spend the surpluses - the taxpayer money that was being used to pay back debt.

"With the Asian Crisis having removed the surpluses any extra spending means New Zealanders pay more now, through higher taxes, or in the future, through increased debt.

"The National Government has shown the only way of increasing spending on quality social programmes is through prudent budgeting and economic growth.

"Growth allows more spending, less debt, and higher incomes through jobs and lower taxes all at the same time."
