Business must play a key role in helping to solve some of New Zealand's major social problems like drug abuse, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said at the launch of the national Hugs Not Drugs annual appeal today. Hugs Not Drugs is organised by PRYDE - Parents Resource Institute for Youth Drug Education - to raise funds for resources for dealing with drug problems and the promotion of a drug free lifestyle.

The appeal will culminate in a Warm Fuzzies Day on Friday in which all New Zealanders are challenged to give "Warm Fuzzies" such as a hug, instead of "Cold Pricklies" such as a put-down.

"The work of organisations like PRYDE is critical to saving our young people from the devastating effects of drug abuse," Mrs Shipley said. "But equally important is the role that business must play in promoting a good work ethic, a healthy lifestyle and contributing to the communities in which they do business. "I congratulate Postie Plus, the major sponsor of Hugs Not Drugs, for showing a genuine commitment to helping solve some of our social problems. "The actions of Postie Plus shows that business can and does have a heart and that business is not just about money and bricks and mortar - it's about people."

Mrs Shipley said she was encouraged by the large contribution that business people made to our communities through sponsorship, voluntary work, partnerships with schools, and employee involvement in community projects. "Businesses are doing all these things while also creating wealth and jobs, which means more taxes and a better standard of living for everyone.

"This Government is grateful for the significant contribution of wealth creators in this country and we will do everything possible to make the environment right to help them succeed. "We also encourage more business people to take up the challenge of addressing the social problems like drug abuse that affect our communities and particularly our young people.

"Please remember to give a "Warm Fuzzie" on Friday and to make whatever contribution you can to the work of PRYDE."
