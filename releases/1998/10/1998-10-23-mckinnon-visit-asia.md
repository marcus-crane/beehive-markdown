Foreign Minister Don McKinnon departs this weekend for bilateral visits to Malaysia, China, Japan and Korea.

"Our Asian partners remain of crucial importance to New Zealand, despite the turmoil of recent months," Mr McKinnon said.

"It is important to sustain and develop these relationships at the highest level."

On the agenda in each capital will be both bilateral and regional issues, in particular the economic environment, prospects for the forthcoming APEC Leaders Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, and regional security issues such as North Korea.

The Minister will call on senior Ministers in each country. In addition, in Shanghai he will visit the China International Travel Mart, a major annual tourism promotion at which several New Zealand tourism industry groups are represented. In Kuala Lumpur he will give a keynote address to the Commonwealth Press Union's biennial Conference.

The Minister departs New Zealand for Malaysia on Sunday 25 October. He will be in Malaysia until 27 October. He will be in China from 28 October until 1 November; Japan on 2 November; and Seoul on 3 November. Mr McKinnon returns to New Zealand on Thursday 5 November.
