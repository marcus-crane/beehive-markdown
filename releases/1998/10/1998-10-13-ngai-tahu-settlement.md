### 8 ACCEPTANCE OF DISPOSAL OFFER

8.1 If the Grantee accepts the Disposal Offer or otherwise  
agrees to purchase the Highbank Assets on terms and conditions (including price)  
agreed with the Owner before or at 5.00 pm on the Acceptance Date, then the sale  
of the Highbank Assets shall be completed on the Settlement Date.

8.2 Any acceptance of the Disposal Offer shall be effected by  
giving notice to the Owner. Such notice shall include a statement that the  
acceptance of the Disposal Offer is unconditional or subject only to any  
conditions referred to in the Disposal Offer.

### 9 NON-ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER

If:

9.1 the Grantee does not accept the Disposal Offer or otherwise  
agree to purchase the Highbank Assets on terms and conditions (including price)  
agreed with the Owner before or at 5.00 pm on the Acceptance Date; or

9.2 the Grantee gives notice to the Owner that it declines the  
Disposal Offer at or before that time,

the Disposal Offer will lapse at the earlier of:

(a) the time at which the Grantee gave notice declining the  
Disposal Offer; and

(b) 5.00 pm on the Acceptance Date.

### 10 CONSEQUENCES OF LAPSE OF OFFER

If the Disposal Offer lapses in accordance with *clause 5.2.1*  
*or clause 9*, then:

10.1 the Owner will be free to Dispose of the Highbank Assets  
to any person so long as the Disposal is not on More Favourable Terms than the  
Benchmark Offer and so long as the contract for the Disposal of the Highbank  
Assets is executed within 12 months after the date on which the Disposal Offer  
has lapsed; but

10.2 the Owner may not Dispose of the Highbank  
Assets:

10.2.1 during the 12 month period referred to in *clause 10.1*  
on More Favourable Terms than the Benchmark Offer; or

10.2.2 after the expiry of that 12 month period,

without again complying with this Deed in full.

### 11 NOTICE OF TERMS

### 11.1 Notice of Disposal to third party

If the Owner wishes to Dispose of all or any of the Highbank  
Assets pursuant to *clause 10.1*, it shall give notice to the Grantee of  
its intention to do so. Such notice shall:

11.1.1 specify the date or proposed date of execution of the  
contract relating to the proposed Disposal and, in the case of a contract which  
has been executed or will be executed within 20 Business Days of the date of the  
notice, specify the date on which the contract will cease to be conditional upon  
the Owner's compliance with this Deed;

11.1.2 subject to *clause 11.2* and *clause 11.3*,  
set out the terms and conditions (including price);

11.1.3 contain a statement that the proposed Disposal would not  
be on More Favourable Terms than the Benchmark Offer; and

11.1.4 be given to the Grantee not less than 20 Business Days  
before the later of:

(a) the proposed date of execution of the contract relating to  
the proposed Disposal; and

(b) the date on which the contract relating to the proposed  
Disposal will cease to be conditional upon the Owner's compliance with this  
Deed.

### 11.2 Non-disclosure of terms

11.2.1 The Owner may omit any of the terms and conditions of a  
contract or proposed contract so long as they are not material to the Grantee's  
evaluation of those terms and conditions and comparison of them with the terms  
and conditions of the Benchmark Offer.

11.2.2 If the Owner exercises its rights under *clause*  
*11.2.1* it shall give notice to that effect to the Grantee at the same time  
as it gives notice under *clause 11.1*. Such notice shall specify the  
nature of the terms and conditions omitted from the notice given under *clause*  
*11.1*.

11.2.3 The Grantee may by notice in writing to the Owner, which  
shall be given not more than 3 Business Days after the Owner has given the  
notice referred to in *clause 11.2.2*, require that the Owner refers to an  
Assessor the issue as to whether the terms and conditions omitted by the Owner  
are material.

11.2.4 If the Grantee gives a notice under *clause*  
*11.2.3*, its notice shall include the name of the person whom it proposes  
should be the Assessor and the Assessor shall be appointed in the manner  
described in *clauses 12.1.3* and *12.1.4,* and *clause 12.2*  
will apply with any necessary modifications.

11.2.5 If the Assessor determines that any of the terms and  
conditions omitted by the Owner are material, the Owner shall disclose those  
terms and conditions to the Grantee forthwith, and the fees and costs of the  
Assessor shall be borne by the Owner. Otherwise, the fees and costs of the  
Assessor shall be borne by the Grantee.

### 11.3 Non-Disclosure to EAL

If the Grantee is the Joint Venture Entity or any entity  
including EAL, and terms and conditions of a contract or proposed contract  
include terms which, in the reasonable opinion of the Owner, make disclosure of  
them to EAL commercially sensitive, the Owner may disclose them only to Te  
Runanga, subject to an obligation that Te Runanga does not disclose them to EAL.  
However, if a reference to the Assessor is made under *clause 12.1.1* and  
the Assessor makes a determination under *clause 12.3.2,* then such terms  
and conditions may be disclosed by Te Runanga to EAL. Nothing in this *clause*  
*11.3* prevents Te Runanga disclosing such terms and conditions to the  
Grantee's advisers, so long as such advisers enter into an undertaking in favour  
of the Owner that they will not disclose such terms and conditions to  
EAL.

### 12 REFERENCE TO ASSESSOR

### 12.1 Appointment of Assessor

12.1.1 If requested by the Grantee within 5 Business Days after  
the notice referred to in *clause 11.1* has been given to the Grantee, the  
Owner shall refer to an Assessor the issue as to whether the Disposal would be  
on More Favourable Terms than the Benchmark Offer. If there is any dispute as to  
which offer is the Benchmark Offer, that issue may also be determined by the  
Assessor.

12.1.2 Subject to *clause 12.6*, the Grantee's request  
under *clause 12.1.1* shall be made by giving notice to the Owner of the  
request, and such notice shall include the name of the person whom the Grantee  
proposes should be the Assessor.

12.1.3 If the Owner accepts that the person whom the Grantee  
proposes should be the Assessor or the Owner and the Grantee agree on an  
alternative, the Owner shall forthwith appoint the person nominated by the  
Grantee or the agreed alternative, as the case may be, as Assessor.

12.1.4 If the Owner does not wish that the person nominated by  
the Grantee be appointed as Assessor, and the Grantee and the Owner cannot agree  
on an alternative within 3 Business Days after the Grantee's notice has been  
given to the Owner, then:

(a) if the Owner and the Grantee agree on a third party who  
should be asked to appoint the Assessor, the Owner shall arrange for the  
appointment of the Assessor by that third party; or

(b) if the Owner and the Grantee have not agreed on a third  
party who should be asked to appoint the Assessor, the Owner shall arrange for  
the appointment of the Assessor by the President for the time being of the  
Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand or his or her  
nominee.

### 12.2 Appointment and Conduct of Assessor

12.2.1 The terms of appointment of the Assessor shall include  
requirements that:

(a) the Assessor determines the matter within 5 Business Days  
after the date of his or her appointment;

(b) the Assessor shall immediately notify the parties of his or  
her determination; and

(c) the Assessor shall keep all confidential information  
provided to him or her by the Owner or Te Runanga confidential.

12.2.2 The Owner shall provide to the Assessor a copy of the  
Benchmark Offer and the terms and conditions (including price) of the proposed  
Disposal and such other evidence as is necessary to determine the  
issue.

12.2.3 The Assessor shall provide an opportunity to each party  
to make submissions on the issue or issues being considered by the Assessor, so  
long as this does not, in the Assessor's opinion, have the effect of extending  
the 5 Business Day period referred to above.

### 12.3 Assessor's Determination

If:

12.3.1 the Assessor determines that the Disposal would not be  
on More Favourable Terms than the Benchmark Offer, then *clause 10.1* shall  
apply, and the 12 month period referred to in *clause 10* shall be deemed  
to end on the later of:

(a) the end of the 12 month period after the date on which the  
last Disposal Offer made by the Owner lapsed; and

(b) the date which is 20 Business Days after the date of the  
Assessor's determination;

12.3.2 the Assessor determines that the Disposal would be on  
More Favourable Terms than the Benchmark Offer, then *clause 13.2* shall  
apply.

### 12.4 Costs of Assessor

The fees and costs of the Assessor shall be borne by the  
Grantee if the Assessor makes a determination under *clause 12.3.1* and  
shall be borne by the Owner if the Assessor makes a determination under  
*clause 12.3.2*.

### 12.5 Binding Decision

Both the Owner and the Grantee agree that the determination of  
the Assessor will be final and binding on both of them and that paragraphs 4 and  
5 of the Second Schedule to the Arbitration Act 1996 do not apply to the  
Assessor's determination.

### 12.6 Appointment of Assessor

The Owner or the Grantee may, at any time after the Indication  
Date, require, by notice to the other of them, the appointment of an Assessor in  
anticipation of a possible future reference to an Assessor under *clause*  
*12.1*. In that event, the provisions of *clause 12.1* relating to the  
appointment of an Assessor will apply with all necessary modifications, and any  
reference under *clause 12.1* which occurs within 6 months after the  
appointment of an Assessor under this *clause 12.6* will be a reference to  
the Assessor appointed under this *clause 12.6* unless, before the date of  
the reference, either party has given notice to the other withdrawing its  
approval of that person as an Assessor. Each party agrees it will not give such  
a notice unless the party believes, on reasonable grounds, that  
either:

12.6.1 circumstances have changed to such an extent since the  
time of the appointment of the person appointed under this *clause 12.6*  
that; or

12.6.2 new information has become available since that time  
which indicates that,

such person is no longer the appropriate person to be the  
Assessor.
