Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today welcomed ECNZ's announcement that it is cutting the price of electricity to domestic and small business customers.

"The benefits of the Government's electricity reforms are flowing through rapidly," Mr Bradford said.

"The Electricity Industry Reform Act was passed in July, and already hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders now have real choice about who they buy their electricity from and as a result of the competition, lower prices."

Mr Bradford's comments follow the announcement today by ECNZ that it has formed a new national energy retail company "First Electric" to sell cheaper electricity. First Electric is offering customers up to 15 per cent off their power bills, with greater savings in some cases, and a high level of customer service.
