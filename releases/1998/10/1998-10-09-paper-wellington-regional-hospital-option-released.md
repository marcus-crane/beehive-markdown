Health Minister Bill English today released a discussion document on the possibility of building a new hospital for the Wellington region at the Kenepuru Hospital site in Porirua.

"The recommendation from officials is that a firm proposal be developed for a new regional hospital at Kenepuru.

"I have accepted that recommendation, but must emphasise that no decision has been made about whether or not to proceed with the regional hospital option.

"There is strong public interest in the idea, both for and against, and I am releasing this discussion document in order to prompt an open debate about the relative merits of the proposal.

"Regardless of whether the Kenepuru option gets the go-ahead, the Government is committed to spending $20 million on upgrading facilities at the Newtown site and this money is not at risk.

"I have decided to proceed with getting a firm proposal because a window of opportunity has been identified, which is possibly a once-in-a-lifetime chance, to rethink hospital services for Wellington. We must not close off that opportunity without considering it fully.

"In addition, there are issues which need to be gone into in much more detail before a decision is made. For example, the wider community impact of any reorganisation of Wellington's hospital services must be taken into account.

"Although I have been quite open about my view that there is real merit in the Kenepuru option, I would emphasise again that no final decision has been made, said Mr English.
