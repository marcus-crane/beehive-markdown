Labour's industry policy is the sickly son of the DFC, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"The last time Labour pursued this policy it cost the community a fortune through the failed Development Finance Corporation (DFC). After eight years in Opposition, you would have thought the Labour Party might have learned something," Mr Ryall said.

"What small to medium sized businesses tell us is that they really want good business advice. That's where our help can make a difference. Not some DFC-type grant system managed by the bureaucracy.

"After the Labour Listens campaign and all the lunches with the Business Roundtable this is all they can come up with. Tony Blair would be disappointed.

"Last week Labour promised to increase superannuation payments. This week another $200-million promise. And still no explanation on who is going to pay for this."
