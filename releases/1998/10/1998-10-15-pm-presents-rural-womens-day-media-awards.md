Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today acknowledged the huge contribution rural women make to New Zealand's economy and our society while presenting the first Rural Women's Day Media Awards.

"Coming from a rural background myself, I know that rural women are equal partners in the business of farming and other rural enterprises.

"More than half the farms in New Zealand have at least one female owner. A survey carried out late last year by Wrightsons showed that 70 per cent of rural women are tertiary educated, and they make or strongly influence a very high percentage of financial and other major on-farm business decisions.

"They are also increasingly proving to be the movers and shakers in researching and developing alternative land uses.

"There are great stories to be told about rural women. I hope this award will encourage the media to continue to look at all aspects of the lives of our rural women," Mrs Shipley said.

The winners of the Rural Women's Day Media Awards are:

Photo award: Don McCully for his photo of Kerry Harmer (published in The Courier of Timaru) Journalism Award: Diana Leslie for her story on Ann Scanlan (published in the New Zealand Farmer)

The Rural Women's Day Media Awards have been organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Women's Affairs, with sponsorship from Air New Zealand.
