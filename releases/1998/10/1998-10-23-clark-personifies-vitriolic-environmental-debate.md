Labour leader Helen Clark's response to the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment personifies the entrenchment of viewpoints that the Commissioner has counselled against, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

Earlier today, Mr Ryall welcomed the Commissioner's recommendation for a programme to improve public understanding of the use of indigenous forests for both production and environmental goals.

"The debate so far on Timberland's plans has been characterised by a polarisation of viewpoints between those who vigorously support and oppose the sustainable management of native forests," Mr Ryall said.

"Helen Clark's response typifies this close-minded approach. The debate must move beyond this type of entrenched viewpoint.

"In the spirit of MMP, Helen Clark should consider adopting a more constructive approach and taking up the Commissioner's recommendation to foster greater understanding that native forests can be managed for both production and conservation purposes."

Mr Ryall said the Commissioner concluded in his report that Timberlands' beech plans "incorporate the principles of sustainability". (section 4, para 1)

The Commissioner says "the plans represent considerable progress towards an integrated adaptive management system that seeks to provide timber products while maintaining ecological sustainability". (section 4, para 1)

Timberlands' plans are available at public libraries and on the Internet: [http://www.maf.govt.nz/Forestry/](http://www.maf.govt.nz/Forestry/%20)
