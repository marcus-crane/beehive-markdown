New Zealanders firmly believe individuals and families should take their social and family responsibilities seriously, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"This was made clear by the 94,000 responses to the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility, the majority of which indicated support for all 11 of the social expectations in the questionnaire."

These expectations included: training and learning for employment; looking after our children; shared parenting; getting children to school ready to learn; managing money, and young offenders.

"The majority of New Zealanders want each of us to make the effort to take social responsibility for ourselves and our families.

"We have achieved our goal of getting people talking about social issues and the types of expectations, obligations and responsibilities that exist between the Government and the community.

"While the majority of respondents did not support a formal Code, as was originally proposed by NZ First, they did clearly identify social concerns that they want Government to act on. These have been distilled into 10 key initiatives for the Government and the community to act on. The social policy Ministers team will now pick up and drive these initiatives.

"Any policy changes must be supported by families, communities and social agencies and they must deliver solutions that work.

"While there are never any simple answers to these issues, we should not stop trying to find solutions and that's what the discussion on the Code has been about. We must now move forward with the 10 proposals that the discussion has brought us.

"But I want to reiterate again that the Government cannot provide all the answers on its own. We can only move forward when we have a true partnership between Government and the community.

"There will continue to be many things that families can and must do for themselves to solve social problems. We are talking about working together for the betterment of our society.

"We look forward to the continued support of the churches, community groups and political leaders," Mrs Shipley said.
