"New Zealand's film industry is quickly becoming an international success story thanks to the innovation and creativity of our film makers, such as Peter Jackson," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said on visiting Mr Jackson's Wingnut Productions in Wellington today.

Peter Jackson and partner Fran Walsh earlier this year signed a contract to film the Lord of the Rings for United States company New Line Cinema.

It will be one of the biggest films ever made in New Zealand. There will be more than 60 speaking roles and thousands of extras and it is estimated that more than $200 million will enter the New Zealand economy over the course of the filming.

"New Zealand's film industry is a growing area in the New Zealand economy despite the significant changes it has weathered because of the development and expansion of television over past decades," the Prime Minister said.

"According to the Employment in the Cultural Sector survey released last week, employment in motion picture production grew by 16 percent in this country between 1991 and 1996.

"This growth is largely due to the tenacity and innovation of people like Peter Jackson and his production team and the hard work of the New Zealand Film Commission in promoting and supporting budding local talent.

"I also acknowledge the commitment that Peter Jackson and Wingnut Productions are making to New Zealand by staunchly staying here. It is good to see that even in the film industry, New Zealand has competitive advantages, not just economically but because of our innovation and creativity.

"I am sure it will not be long before Wellington is officially recognised as "Welliwood" - the Hollywood of the South Pacific," the Prime Minister said.
