Hon Murray McCully, Minister Responsible for Housing New Zealand & the Housing Corporation of New Zealand, expressed his surprise that the Regional Housing Issues Report put out by Te Puni Kokiri failed to take note of the recent housing initiatives.

"This is particularly disappointing as the Minister of Maori Affairs was a key mover in promoting these initiatives," said Mr McCully.

"These initiatives included reduction in rents for over 15,000 Housing New Zealand tenants, a large number of whom are in urban areas, with more rent reductions to follow in the near future. These are across the board cuts for all low income renters from Housing New Zealand."

"Government is making it easier for urban and rural New Zealanders with housing problems to find out what services are available to help them through a new 0800 number," said Mr McCully.

The initiatives also covered enhancements to the Low Deposit Rural Lending scheme including a reduced deposit and a 7 year fixed interest rate. Both of these concerns were identified in the Report as barriers to rural home ownership.

"Housing New Zealand, the Housing Corporation of New Zealand, and Te Puni Kokiri are working together to implement the housing initiatives ," said Mr McCully.
