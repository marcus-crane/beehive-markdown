Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon, leaves New Zealand today to attend the 10th meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, CMAG, in London 8-9 October.

The key issue on the agenda is Nigeria, and the positive moves made towards democracy since CMAG last met in March this year.

"Since the death of General Abacha, a new Nigerian leadership has emerged under General Abubakar which has so far demonstrated that it is intent on restoring democracy, the rule of law and human rights," Mr McKinnon said.

"The very positive developments we have seen this year will obviously be a key factor in determining Nigeria's future status in the Commonwealth."

Earlier this year, new Nigerian Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, announced a plan to return Nigeria to civilian rule by 29 May 1999.

Mr McKinnon said that despite the very encouraging progress to date there is still some distance to go before Nigeria fully meet the standards expected in the Harare Declaration.

"Nigeria will be attending this CMAG. This will provide Foreign Minister, Ignatius Olisemeka, the opportunity to clarify his Government's plans for a return to free and fair elections. We welcome this opportunity for dialogue."

Mr McKinnon is the Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, established at the 1995 Auckland CHOGM to monitor Commonwealth countries' compliance with the principles of democracy and human rights enshrined in the 1991 Harare Declaration.

Mr McKinnon returns to New Zealand on Sunday 11 October.
