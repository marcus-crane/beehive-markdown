Education Minister Wyatt Creech has considered a response from the Board of Trustees at Petone College and concluded the school should close.

The Board of Trustees has informed the Minister that it accepts and agrees with his initial decision to close the school in its current form. The Board did not put forward further arguments as to why the college should stay open.

"Putting together all the submissions and advice from the community, parents, school and officials has lead me to conclude that closure is clearly in the best interests of the school, its students and the community.

"I must now be assured that suitable alternative arrangements are made to meet the needs of all students, especially those with special education needs. The Ministry of Education will report back to me by the middle of November on the provision of education for students at the College."

Mr Creech said for almost 150 Petone College students, Hutt Valley High School will now be their nearest secondary school.

"Given the pressure of student numbers at Hutt Valley High, consideration will be given in the short term at least to explore ways in which the Petone College site and buildings can continue to be used.

"The whole process have been a very difficult one for all concerned. I am well aware of the strength of emotion and community feeling connected with the school.

"I have had to make the decision that gets the best educational results for the students. I am very confident that the closure of this college, while painful in the short term, will result in improved outcomes in the longer term.

While the college will technically close from 1 February 1999, it will close so far as students are concerned at the end of this year.
