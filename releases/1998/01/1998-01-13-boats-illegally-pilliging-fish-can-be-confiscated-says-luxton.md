Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, said this afternoon that any fishing boat which was fishing illegally could be confiscated, along with its fish catch and even other assets of registered owners.

"The management of our fisheries is important to New Zealand. That is why we have very strong powers to confiscate boats and assets of people who fish illegally. Our fishery is a valuable resource which the Government has to manage for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

"If people deliberately flout the intention of the law their boats can be confiscated. My officials are able to use all the powers available to them to protect the legitimate rights of commercial, recreational and Maori, to take fish from our seas. Fines and other penalties imposed by the Courts can be very severe.

The Ministers comments follow reports that six boats are reported to be fishing by a group calling themselves the Confederation of Chiefs of the United Tribes without recognised permits to fish.

"Maori do have a legitimate customary fishing right. Most Maori respect that right and use it appropriately. Unfortunately there are a very small number who appear to have a different view. While customary fishing rights are a complex issue, reports of six boats being sent out to take fish under the guise of customary rights, would appear to be simply pillage.

"This is a compliance issue and the Ministry of Fisheries will take appropriate action."

The Minister said he was still awaiting advice on whether prosecutions would be taken for between 4 and 7 tonnes of snapper landed prior to Christmas. He also noted that he will be taking a paper to Cabinet next Tuesday considering officials advice on what could be done to make progress with Maori customary fishing rights in both the short and medium term.

"It is important that we get not only a short term solution to the immediate problem, but also a lasting solution for the benefit of all New Zealanders," Mr Luxton concluded.
