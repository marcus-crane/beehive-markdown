Associate Health Minister Hon Tuariki Delamere said today that, contrary to a grossly misleading New Zealand Herald headline, the Government's policy of free doctors' visits for children under six will stay.

"That policy is set in concrete and will remain so for the term of this Coalition Government.

"It is stupid to assume that, merely because policies of all kinds are under continuing review, any policy is automatically in doubt. Constant review of the effectiveness of the spending of public money is part of good government.

"One can only wonder what private agenda is being run by the Herald to promote such inaccurate and misleading information," said the Minister.
