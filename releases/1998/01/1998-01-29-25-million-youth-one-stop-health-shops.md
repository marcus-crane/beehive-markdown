The Government's approach to funding health services suitable for young people has lead to $2.5 million being pumped into the innovative One Stop Shops this year, says Hon Deborah Morris.

"It is time for youth health to become a priority in this country. Youth issues may not be the most attractive focus for politicians, yet the health and well-being of young people impacts on all of us.

"Young people want health services especially for them, which are youth friendly, free, easy to access and which provide as many services as possible under one roof. The One Stop Shop approach delivers just that. "One Stop Shops offer the services of nurses and GPs, specialist services (such as sexual health, contraception, drug and alcohol, mental health) counselling, referral to external specialist services and they also provide a wide range of information on issues such as education, health, justice, income support and recreation.

"If we expect to improve the status of youth health we have to let young people design their own services. We have to listen! That is a challenge for a lot of decision makers," concluded Deborah Morris.
