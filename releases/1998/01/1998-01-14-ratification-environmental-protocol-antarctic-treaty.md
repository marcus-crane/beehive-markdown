"The Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, which comes into effect on 14 January 1998, will usher in a strict new regime of environmental management for Antarctica", the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Simon Upton, said today.

"All New Zealanders working in and visiting the Ross Dependency will need to abide by the provisions of the Protocol.

"New Zealand has been at the forefront of work within the Treaty to prepare for the implementation of the Protocol. We took a strong lead at the Christchurch Consultative Meeting last May in proposing new management plans for areas in the Ross Dependency that require special environmental protection. We have set in place a robust framework and guidelines for the management of activities by all New Zealand visitors to the Ross Dependency. We will continue to show strong leadership and demonstrate the highest standards of environmental stewardship in this most important region of Antarctica," Mr Upton said.

"Ratification of the Protocol means that the Committee for Environmental Protection will be able to meet at the next Consultative Meeting in Tromso, Norway, in May this year. This will give the Meeting a strong focus and new sense of purpose. New Zealand looks forward to working closely with its Treaty partners to ensure that the CEP is established from the outset as the Treaty's scientific, environmental and technical advisory committee. In this connection we are working with other Parties to develop the framework for an Antarctic-wide State of the Environment Report which will establish essential baselines against which to manage future human impacts on the continent and which we believe is an urgent and early task for the Committee," the Minister concluded.

Background Information

The Environmental (Madrid) Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty was concluded at Madrid in 1991. New Zealand ratified the Protocol in 1994. The Protocol required ratifications from all twenty-six Consultative Parties (i.e. voting members) to the Treaty before coming into force.
