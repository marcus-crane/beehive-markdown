Cabinet today authorised the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for overseeing Waitangi Day activities, Hon Winston Peters, to approve spending of up to $100,000 for the celebration of Waitangi Day 1998 at Waitangi.

Mr Peters will hold further discussions with the Waitangi organising committee to finalise details of the budget.

"This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that New Zealand's national day is celebrated appropriately by all New Zealanders of all races throughout the country," said Mr Peters.

"I am pleased to see that the programme at Waitangi includes opportunities for all ethnic groups to celebrate this very significant day in our history."

As well as the day of festivities at Waitangi, celebrations are being arranged by various community groups at more than 40 locations throughout New Zealand.

There will be an official garden party at Government House in Wellington, which will be addressed by the Governor-General, Sir Michael Hardie-Boys, the Prime Minister, Rt Hon Jenny Shipley, and the paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa, Tumu Te Heu Heu.

At least three Government Ministers and several MP's have indicated they will attend the celebration at Waitangi.
