"Penalties and remedies under the Commerce Act must deter anticompetitive conduct," Minister responsible for competition policy, the Minister of Commerce, Hon John Luxton said today.

"I want to make sure that our competition law is effective. To be effective the Commerce Act must be effectively enforced and the penalties and remedies for breaches of the Act sufficient.

"Court processes must also support the goals of the Act and should balance justice and efficiency of process."

Mr Luxton's commments follow the release of a discussion document on Commerce Act penalties, remedies and court processes.

Prepared by the Ministry of Commerce, the discussion document explores the proposition that firms can currently profit by breaching the Commerce Act.

It reaches preliminary conclusions that there is a problem because pecuniary penalties are not high enough to deter anticompetitive behaviour, other remedy provisions (such as damages and injunctions) are rarely applied and court processes are slow and costly. The problem is particularly evident in relation to cartels and firms that deny or delay access to essential facilities such as electricity lines and telecommunications networks.

The Minister said the Commerce Act is a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating business conduct. It is underpinned by the principle that economic efficiency is generally best achieved by protecting and promoting competition where possible.

"It is important for New Zealand families and businesses, our economy, and our international reputation in such forums as the World Trade Organisation and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, that the Commerce Act effectively guards against anticompetitive conduct. This discussion document will assist in achieving this outcome.

The closing date for submissions on the discussion document is 13 March 1998.
