The $59 million higher than forecast operating surplus recorded in the Government's Financial Statements for the five months to November 1997 are further evidence the Government is in a healthy financial position, Treasurer Winston Peters said today.

The statements show an operating balance of $1.726 billion, with the increase above forecast mainly due to surpluses from State-owned enterprises and Crown entities which were $104 million higher than forecast.
