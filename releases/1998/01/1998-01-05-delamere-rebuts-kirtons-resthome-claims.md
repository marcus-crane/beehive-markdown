Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today rejected claims by NZ First MP, Neil Kirton, that the Government was planning to put the safety of the elderly in resthomes at risk.

"The policies championed by New Zealand First during 1997 mean the elderly will benefit from the Coalition Government's removal of the surtax on superannuation and the easing of the regime on income and asset testing.

"Mr Kirton is claiming the Government will announce plans 'to remove vital safety and licensing legislation that protects extremely vulnerable people living in resthomes and other long-term care'.

"As Mr Kirton is wont to do these days, he has used his privileged position as an MP to gain access to information and advice proffered by officials, and then attempted to twist that information to suit his own position - whatever that position is these days.

"I, like all my ministerial colleagues, welcome the unfettered advice given by officials. We often do not agree with them but the worst thing that could happen for any New Zealand Government would be for officials to become Ministerial sycophants that Mr Kirton so obviously wanted when he was a member of the Executive.

"In the matter of the resthomes, I assume Mr Kirton is referring to the suggestion by some officials that private resthomes should audit themselves in respect of the quality of the services they provide.

"Mr Kirton can relax as I have rejected that advice out of hand and told the officials that I will vigorously oppose any attempts to bring in such a regime.

"Mr Kirton is merely playing the old political game of frightening people, especially the vulnerable elderly and their families, in order to gain a cheap headline for himself," concluded the Minister.
