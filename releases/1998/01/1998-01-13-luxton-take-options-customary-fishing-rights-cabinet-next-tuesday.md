Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, said today that he will be taking a paper to Cabinet next Tuesday considering officials advice on what could be done to make progress with Maori Customary fishing rights.

Recent activities by a group calling themselves the confederation of Chiefs of the United Tribes has raised the issue in the media.

Mr Luxton said today, "The management of our fisheries is important to New Zealand. Customary fishing rights are a complex issue. It is important that we get not only a short term solution to the immediate problem, but also a lasting solution for the benefit of all New Zealanders."
