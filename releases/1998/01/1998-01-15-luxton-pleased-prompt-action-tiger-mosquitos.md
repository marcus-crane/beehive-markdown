The new Minister for Biosecurity, Hon John Luxton today commended the Ministry of Health's initiation of prompt follow-up action to a MAF inspector's detection of Asian tiger mosquito larvae on an Auckland wharf in a water-filled bucket associated with an imported truck..

Mr Luxton said today, "It is important that New Zealand remains as free from unwanted pests as possible.

"A national pest management strategy, currently being developed under the Biosecurity Act by the Ministry of Health is timely. The completed strategy will ensure a co-ordinated approach to the management of exotic mosquitoes of public health significance, reducing the risk of disease-transmitting mosquitoes becoming permanently established in New Zealand.

"To date there is no evidence that this find has lead to an established population in New Zealand.

"While not an unusual event - such interceptions have been made in the past, this find highlights the need to remain vigilant for such incursions," the Minister concluded.
