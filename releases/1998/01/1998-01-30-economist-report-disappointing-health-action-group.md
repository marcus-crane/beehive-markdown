Health Minister Bill English said today the findings of a report into the current population based funding formula for health would be a major disappointment to the Dunedin Health Action Group.

"Even if you accepted the findings of the report, it would amount to a budget adjustment for the Southern Region of 0.4 percent.

"Listening to the Dunedin City Council and the local Labour MP, you would have expected to fund Dunedin was underfunded by tens of millions of dollars. This report confirms that is not the case.

"One of the major finding of the report seems to be that there should be an additional rural adjustment for very remote populations. Even if this argument was successful, it would not yield a single extra dollar for Dunedin.

"The current formula is a simple and fair way to make sure people get their share of public health services.

"I invite the Dunedin Health Action Group and Mayor Sukhi Turner to apply the same energy to how we can best use the other 99.6 percent of the Southern budget for the benefit of local people as they have applied to this 0.4 percent.

"If they really cared about the health of our region they would do that," said Mr English.
