The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Tau Henare, said today he had some sympathy for Waitangi Tribunal claimants frustrated by the speed in which claims are processed.

Mr Henare's comments come following the setting up of camp by a group of Maori on the edge of Lake Waikaremoana nearly a week ago.

"It's been 12 years since those people lodged their claim with the tribunal, and they're frustrated, and I share some sympathy with them," said Mr Henare.

"It's not good enough.

"But there's a number of issues behind the action they've taken which are wide ranging and that will need to be sorted out to resolve this one."

Meanwhile Mr Henare said information he had been supplied about the location of the camp was contrary to media reports.

"I've been told by both my ministry's staff and DOC the area we're talking about is not the local camping ground as reported, but an area on the lake's edge managed by DOC as a National Park leased from the Tuhoe-Waikaremoana and Wairoa-Waikaremoana Maori Trust Boards."

Mr Henare said the media hype had generated unnecessary aggravation for the general public.
