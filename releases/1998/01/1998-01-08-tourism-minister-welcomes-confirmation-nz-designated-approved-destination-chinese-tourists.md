The Government has been formally notified that the Chinese State Council has designated New Zealand as an approved destination for Chinese tourists, Tourism Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The Government and the tourism industry will treat this as a signal to rapidly respond with marketing initiatives and facilitation processes, " Mr McCully said.

"This decision is timely given the dramatic downturn in tourism visitors from other parts of Asia," he said.

"I am enormously impressed with the long term potential of the China market, after visiting the country last year to promote the designation of New Zealand as the first non-Asia country to be designated an approved tourism destination," said Mr McCully.
