Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced a new range of Royal awards to be established to recognise acts of gallantry and bravery by New Zealanders - both civilians and military.

"Every society has its heroes and through their courage and self-sacrifice they have earned our respect," said Mrs Shipley.

"Brave and gallant New Zealanders should be honoured not only for their own achievements but for their contribution to our nation. They make us proud to be New Zealanders and should be honoured by us all."

The Prime Minister said the creation of the new awards is the second major element following from the 1995 review of the Royal Honours System in New Zealand. The launch of the New Zealand Order of Merit in May 1997, and the first investitures later that month, marked the first stage of implementing a totally New Zealand-based system.

Mrs Shipley said the new gallantry and bravery awards will replace the various British awards which until May 1996 had been available to New Zealanders.

"The British Government's review of their awards and our own review during 1995 has provided an opportunity to move to a completely New Zealand based system of Royal honours."

Mrs Shipley said there will be two categories of awards, each with four levels. The premier award to recognise acts of gallantry by New Zealand Defence Force personnel and certain other groups for war and war-like operations, including peacekeeping operations, will be the "Victoria Cross for New Zealand".

The premier award to recognise acts of bravery by civilians and military personnel, for which purely military awards are not appropriate, will be the "New Zealand Cross".

The four Gallantry or combatant awards will be for acts which do not necessarily involve the saving of life.

The four Bravery or non-combatant awards, on the other hand, will be for acts of bravery by civilians in saving or attempting to save life.

The Government has also decided that the existing fourth level of awards, known as the Mention in Despatches and Queen's Commendations for Brave Conduct and Valuable Service in the Air, should be replaced by a medal. These awards have formerly been marked by a small, inexpensive emblem.

"Full details of the awards, criteria and the designs are in the process of being finalised and will be published once Her Majesty The Queen has formally signed the Royal Warrants instituting the awards. Shortly after that, the first awards for acts of bravery and gallantry under the new system will be announced," Mrs Shipley said.
