Health Minister Bill English said today a hi-tech pilot project on long-distance skin clinics demonstrated how new technology could help provide better patient care outside the main centres.

"One of best ways of finding out whether these things are a good idea or not is by finding out what the patients think. With this project, there has been such a strong demand from patients for the new service that those who've missed out on being in the trial have been very disappointed. These are the patients who have to travel for conventional specialist treatment to provide a reference group for the new process.

"There are obvious advantages to patients from saving travel time and having their GP on hand when they are seen by a specialist.

"Another advantage is that it gives GPs first hand knowledge of the diagnostic process. The doctors involved in the study believe it will provide an excellent opportunity for them to learn how to better manage their patients with skin diseases and improve the level of patient care," he said.

Mr English visited the Taupo Health Centre today to see the teledermatology link in practice.

The Waikato teledermatology trial has already involved more than 60 patients using a live video link allowing local GPs in Rotorua and Taupo to seek advice for their patients from a dermatologist at Waikato Hospital. The trial has been running for four months and will be completed in January next year.

The clinical trial compares the treatment of conventional visits to the Waikato Hospital Skin Clinic with those participating in the telemedicine appointments. The results of more than 200 patients are expected to be compared in the trial.

The latest trial is the third in a series which have previously studied the diagnostic accuracy of using videoconferencing technology.

In the past these consultations were conducted between Taumaranui Hospital and the Waikato hospital Skin Clinic. The trial has now been extended to GPs.
