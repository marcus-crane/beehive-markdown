Health Minister Bill English said today Labour continued to be dishonest over its rural health policy.

"During the Taranaki-King Country by-election I challenged Labour to name which rural hospitals it would reopen. The silence was deafening.

"Yet today Labour MP Annette King has used figures on the decreasing number of discharges from smaller hospitals to claim that there is a deterioration in services for rural people.

"Behind the scenes Annette King is supportive of the work that rural communities are doing to reorganise their health services to make sure they are sustainable in the future. Yet publicly she is decrying these same changes.

"Labour continues to pick the scabs without having the courage to say what it would do differently.

"It is true that the discharges from smaller hospitals have fallen since 1990. I released the figures Annette King is using nearly a month ago. It reflects the trends towards the greater specialisation of services, less low-priority elective surgery being done in small hospitals, and changes with long-term care of the elderly moving out of public hospitals.

"However, the other side of that coin is that total discharges from public hospitals have increased 35 percent since 1990. Rural people will most certainly have gotten a share of that increase. Our public hospitals are doing more and more. If Labour wants to change what is happening in health care then, again, I challence Annette King to tell us exactly what changes she proposes," said Mr English.
