Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today he had been delighted by the public response to his call earlier this week for the wider application of the smokefree laws to workplaces, schools and Parliament.

"Callers to my office and to talkback radio all over the country have been strongly supportive of these suggestions, which I am making in the interests of cutting the nation's health bill from smoking-related diseases and deaths.

"I am also pleased that many teachers have supported my call for schools to become truly smokefree environments, because of their important role in the development of our young people.

"That said, it has been disappointing that some teachers have rung my office and not too politely told my staff that I should not poke my nose into their affairs as 'we are only teachers, not role models'.

"If there are teachers in this country who believe they are not role models to students, then perhaps they should consider whether or not they are in the right job and whether teaching is the appropriate career for them.

"It is my belief that, after parents, teachers are the next strongest role models young people have. Indeed, where children come from dysfunctional homes, it is likely that teachers are the primary role models for children.

"Showing young people that it is possible to lead an active and healthy lifestyle without smoking is a responsibility and challenge I urge all teachers to accept," said Mr Delamere.
