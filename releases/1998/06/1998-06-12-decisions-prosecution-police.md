The Attorney-General, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today that the decision as to who will be prosecuted for what offence, and who will not be prosecuted, will always remain a decision for the police and ultimately the Solicitor General.

Mr Graham said there is no suggestion that politicians would get involved in such decisions.

His statement follows comment that changes included in the draft police review could make police vulnerable to political interference.

'The decision to prosecute or not prosecute rests with the police,' he said.

'It is a fundamental and important principle which this Government respects and fully supports.

'It is essential that the decision on prosecution should never be given to politicians.'
