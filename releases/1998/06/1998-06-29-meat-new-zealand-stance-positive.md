Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has described as "positive" Meat New Zealand's announcement that it is working constructively to meet the Government's 15 November deadline to present plans for a future without special statutory powers.

"I am particularly pleased that Meat New Zealand has undertaken to consult with farmers," he said. "This will enable Meat New Zealand to explain to farmers that reform will not mean the end of the organisation but will allow farmers - not parliament - to make decisions about its future."

Dr Smith also agreed with Meat New Zealand on the importance of ensuring quota markets continue to be administered in New Zealand.

"Meat New Zealand's constructive approach will ensure that when change occurs it does not jeopardise the benefits we gain from administering those quota markets here in New Zealand," he concluded.
