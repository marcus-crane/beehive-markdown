Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters, who is in Malaysia on a trade mission, today signed an ?open skies? Air Services Agreement with Malaysia.

?This Agreement is a very positive development in the overall New Zealand/Malaysia relationship, and reflects our shared interest in enhancing trade and travel between the two countries,? said Mr Peters and Minister of Transport Maurice Williamson in a joint statement following the signature.

?Efficient international air transport links are vital to the well-being of the New Zealand economy,? said Mr Peters and Mr Williamson.

?This Agreement creates an environment where airlines are able to make commercial decisions based on their assessment of market requirements.?

New Zealand and Malaysian airlines are now permitted to operate between and beyond the two countries without restriction as to routes, or the capacity which may be provided. Airlines will not be required to file fares for approval, although the authorities in either country may require the airlines to notify them of the fares they are charging. This means that airlines will have the maximum flexibility to develop and implement innovative and competitive prices, in line with market conditions. The new Agreement with Malaysia also includes liberal airline investment provisions.

Malaysia and New Zealand in 1997 concluded an Agreement on Trade and Economic Co-operation covering investment and trade in services, as well as goods.

?The new Air Services Agreement is consistent with this objective and a signal of our commitment to liberalising trade and investment.?

?The Air Services Agreement is fully consistent with the objectives of APEC economies in progressively moving to free and open trade in goods and services. This is a concrete example of two APEC economies moving to progress liberalisation in the very important area of air transport - a sector which is vital to the efficient movement of people and goods around the region.?

This Agreement is an important complement to those signed with APEC partners the United States and Singapore in 1997, and the agreement negotiated earlier this year with Brunei.

?These agreements create significant opportunities for airlines to provide efficient and competitive air services to the benefit of the New Zealand business community and the wider travelling public,? the Ministers concluded.
