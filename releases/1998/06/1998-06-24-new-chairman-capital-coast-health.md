Health Minister Bill English announced today that Alan Harwood had been appointed chairman of the board of Capital Coast Health.

"Mr Harwood has been a director of Capital Coast Health since July last year. Over that time he has made a valuable contribution to the board and I am pleased he has accepted the position of chairman from 1 July.

"He replaces Jack Jenkins, who was appointed executive chairman in November 1996 to oversee a recovery plan for the hospital. I am confident that Capital Coast Health is now back on track to a sustainable long-term position and believe the time is right to appoint a permanent chair.

"There is still a lot of work to be done at Wellington Hospital, but the board, management and staff are committed to giving Wellington people a quality health service and are working hard to achieve that," said Mr English.

Mr Harwood is the former General Manager of the AMP Society. He is currently a director of Health Waikato.
