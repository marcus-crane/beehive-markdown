Housing Minister Murray McCully has paid tribute to the former Anglican Archbishop of New Zealand, the Most Reverend Brian Davis, who died in Napier last night, for his involvement with community housing.

Archbishop Davis, who joined the Community Housing Limited board as a foundation member in late 1994, resigned last month on the grounds of ill health.

"He valued his involvement in Community Housing Limited, bringing a strong sense of fairness and a deep appreciation of the concerns of disabled people to the CHL Board," said Mr McCully.
