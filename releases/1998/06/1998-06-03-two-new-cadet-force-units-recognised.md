Defence Minister Max Bradford today announced the formal recognition of two new Cadet Force Units.

They are the No. 5 (Rodney District) Squadron Air Training Corps at Albany and the Rangitikei/Ruapehu Community Cadet Unit, New Zealand Cadet Corps.

No. 5 (Rodney District) Squadron is the first new Air Training Corps unit to be recognised since 1987. The recognition of Rangitikei/Ruapehu Community Cadet unit follows the recognition of Kaipara Community Cadet unit last year. There are now 100 community cadet units nationally.

"I am delighted that the young people in these Cadet Force units have done so well," Mr Bradford said. "It is also important to recognise the support of adults who give their time to supervise the teenagers and to form the units," he said.

The New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF) were created in 1971 when the school cadet system was discontinued. Since then the emphasis has changed from an essentially military training theme to one of youth development, with the community and the New Zealand Defence Force working in partnership.

Unit training programmes concentrate on activities which build self confidence, initiative, teamwork and leadership skills in young people.

The NZCF comprises the Sea Cadet Corps, the New Zealand Cadet Corps and the Air Training Corps, totalling some 4000 cadets and officers in 100 units from Kaitaia to Invercargill.

Mr Bradford said that over the past 12 months there has been an increasing interest in the Cadet Forces from the wider community and existing units are starting to grow in numbers.
