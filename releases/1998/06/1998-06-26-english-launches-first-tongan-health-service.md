The first community health service designed for a specific Pacific Island group was launched today by Health Minister Bill English.

The Langimalie Clinic has been set up by the Tongan Health Society Board and will provide GP and other community health services for Tongans living in the northern region.

"This is a clinic set up by Tongans, run by Tongans, for Tongans. I have no doubt at all that it is going to be successful and will meet a real need," said Mr English.

"In spite of not being offically open, the clinic has already seen more than 1,000 people during the establishment phase since December and registered 1,200 people. Many of these patients have never been to a GP, or not been in the last six to 10 years.

"People do not want to talk about health problems with someone they do not think understands them. Differences in culture, language, ethnic background and makeup create a communication barrier which has been a real factor in the low numbers of Tongans and other Pacific Island people using GPs and community-based health services.

"As a result we have seen a disproportionately high number of Pacific Island people needing hospital services, where treatment is more difficult and more expensive.

"This clinic is part of a Government policy to make funding for GP and community health services more flexible and so encourage different sorts of organisations into the public health service. This policy also makes basic health services more accessible by encouraging local focussed and locally controlled services.

"I congratulate the members of the Tongan Health Society Board who had the foresight to start planning for this clinic nearly two years ago and have made this project a success," said Mr English.

The clinic is at 704 Great South Road, Penrose. The site at Penrose has been chosen because it is close to both Central and South Auckland where most Tongans live. It is being funded by the Health Funding Authority and is open to non Tongans as well as Tongans.
