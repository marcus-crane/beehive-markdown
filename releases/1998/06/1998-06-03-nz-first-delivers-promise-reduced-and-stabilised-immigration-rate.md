The Government's new immigration policy to achieve a net gain of 10,000 migrants a year, and a new pilot programme for attracting higher skills is another New Zealand First initiative that will benefit all New Zealanders, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"We promised a reduction to 10,000 net. The new target to take effect from 1 July will achieve this goal over the next five to ten years," Mr Peters said.

"The focus is on quality not quantity - an issue strongly promoted by New Zealand First.

"This focus, reflected in the Government's new pilot programme, will attract highly skilled migrants.

"We are targeting migrants with computer and information technology skills in particular, as well as other English speaking migrants with the skills and experience that will assist them to make a positive contribution to New Zealand," Mr Peters said.

The pilot programme is focusing on countries where New Zealand has already attracted skilled migrants.

It will be launched by Immigration Minister Max Bradford while he is in the United Kingdom next week.
