Hon Deborah Morris and other South Pacific Region Youth Ministers have united to present a statement condemning recent nuclear weapon tests. Their statement, developed at New Zealand's initiative, was presented at the recent Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting held in Kuala Lumpur.

"All of us have a responsibility to foster a stable environment for our youth. The continued testing of nuclear weapons does not assist that goal," said Deborah Morris.

The South Pacific Ministers agreed that for youth empowerment to take place countries must ensure a stable environment of equality, peace and democracy.

The statement read:

"Noting that this Conference has agreed that enabling conditions for youth empowerment include a stable environment of equality, peace and democracy we the Ministers responsible for Youth Affairs of the South Pacific Region wish to express concern that the recently reported nuclear weapons tests raise significant issues with regard to the achievement of these objectives."
