Forty one fewer people have died on New Zealand roads this year compared with the same time last year, Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson announced today.

"It is clearly evident the community as a whole, not just drivers, are taking responsibility for road safety," Mr Williamson said.

"The road toll extends way beyond the actual road fatality itself, there is the trauma to the victim's family and, in the case of injury, ongoing care impacts on New Zealand as a whole.

"This reduction in the road toll represents in monetary terms alone, a saving of nearly $100 million in social costs.

"I understand one of the reasons for this reduction could be that the Waikato road toll is half of what it was this time last year - 36 compared to 63.

"We are still waiting on an evaluation of The Hidden Speed Camera Trial in the Waikato, but it is already known that fatal road crashes in the region have been reduced by 13% since the trail began.

"This compares to a reduction in fatalities of 7% for the rest of the country.

"At the end of this month the Hidden Speed Camera Trial will be evaluated by the National Road Safety Committee before going on to Government for policy consideration. In the meantime the cameras will remain in place," Mr Williamson said.
