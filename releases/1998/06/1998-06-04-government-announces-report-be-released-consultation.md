The Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the Minister of Police Jack Elder today assured the public and police that any resources freed up from the Police Review will be spent on policing in New Zealand.

They also assured all stakeholders that they would be involved in the consultation process.

The draft report from a review of the New Zealand Police, aimed at freeing up these resources for front-line policing, will be released on Thursday 11 June.

"As Ministers receive the draft report next Thursday, it will be simultaneously released to the Police Association, the Safer Community Councils, the Police Managers Guild, the Public Service Association, all staff and other interested parties.

"The reviewer, Mr Doug Martin, has informed us that his draft report will be available next week. Government has decided that full consultation should take place with all stakeholders prior to it coming to Government for final decisions," the Prime Minister and Minister said.

They said the Police have a unique role within New Zealand society and impact on every community.

"New Zealanders want assurances that we are getting the best possible police service for the resources that are available.

"Because of that, we believe the Government will be in a better position to make decisions on the report's proposals once it has received feedback from the Police, including Police staff, and from other stakeholder groups including unions and community organisations," they said.

The release of the draft report next week will mean the end of speculation which has created uncertainty for police staff and the community.

"This report has been the subject of enormous speculation which has seldom been based on facts and I am very conscious of how unsettling this has been for police staff and their families and the community as a whole."

The consultation period will last for about six weeks. A final report is then expected to be presented to Government by the end of July.

Any changes to the current police arrangements would be expected later in 1998.
