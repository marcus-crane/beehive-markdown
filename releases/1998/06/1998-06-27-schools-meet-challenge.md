New Zealand is on the cusp of a revolution that will challenge and change every aspect of our lives, Minister for Information Technology Hon Maurice Williamson announced today.

"In virtually every community today, Netday '98, there will be a school emanating a buzz of activity as teachers, parents and local business people crawl through roof spaces installing computer cables," the Minister said.

"Our children are facing a very different world to the one we entered at the same age. This is the world of computers, electronic commerce, and the Internet; a world of people interconnected unlike any previous generation; a world of global citizens; a networked world.

"Schools are being challenged by this new environment to change the way they operate and update the tools they use to ensure all students are both information and Information Technology (IT) literate.

"The Internet has received a lot of attention during the last two years and more than two thirds of all New Zealand schools are now connected. But just as important is networking within schools.

"Networking of IT equipment ensures better access by students and teachers to resources such as the Internet and also enables better use of shared equipment such as printers and CD ROMS. For networking within a school, the school needs basic network infrastructure such as cabling and hubs.

"NetDay is an initiative to provide schools with just such an infrastructure," Mr Williamson said.

Mr Williamson will be taking part in Netday activities in five schools during Saturday morning 27 June 1998.
