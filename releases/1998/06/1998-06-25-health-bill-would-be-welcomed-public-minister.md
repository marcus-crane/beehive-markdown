Health Minister Bill English said the passing last night of the Public Health Agencies (Redesignation and Taxation) Bill would be welcomed by the public, as it set in law the name change from Crown health enterprises to hospital and health services.

"We can now officially call our public hospitals hospitals again. This change has been universally welcomed by the public since it was announced in the Budget. The public will also welcome the move from four regional health authorities to one health funding authority and the associated cut in bureaucracy costs.

"This Bill reinforces many of the changes that have been happening in the public health service since the Coalition Agreement was signed, in particular the move away from a commercial focus for public hospitals to a more co-operative approach.

"The concept of purchasing has been replaced with funding, which makes the terminology in legislation consistent with the intent of the Coalition Agreement.

"The objective of hospitals will clearly be to improve health outcomes and enhance the health status of the people they serve.

"It is also made clear that hospitals are not required to make profits, although they must cover their costs, including the cost of capital. Additional funding for a capital charge on hospitals was announced in the Budget," said Mr English.
