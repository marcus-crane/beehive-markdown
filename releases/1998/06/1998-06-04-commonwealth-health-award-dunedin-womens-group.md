Health Minister Bill English today praised a group of Dunedin women with disabilities who have written a book, Speaking Out for Ourselves.

"I really admire these women for what they have done. Writing a book is no mean feat, but what makes this one particularly special is that it has been written by people with disabilities. This is a group that is often not able to speak for themselves.

"Most people take for granted that they can choose where they live, who they live with, what kind of job they have, and who they socialise with. These are simple things, but for people with disabilities these decisions can be taken out of their hands," said Mr English.

He presented the group with a Commonwealth Award for Excellence in Women's Health, which are for projects in Commonwealth countries which are models of women's health.

The group wrote the book with the help of researchers and a facilitator from the Donald Beasley Institute.

"This Award is recognition of the hard work that goes into a project like this. The success of the book also shows that there is a need out there for people with disabilities to talk about their own experiences. I hope it helps other people speak out for themselves," said Mr English.
