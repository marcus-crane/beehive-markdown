Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed the Investment Savings and Insurance Association Report on Retirement Savings.

"The ISI Report concludes that the current scheme is likely to impose unacceptable costs on future generations if it continues unchanged, and that we need to use the time available to come up with a more sustainable option for the baby-boomer generation.

"It says we must not look at retirement income policy in isolation, because it is the broad economic direction that will put us in a position where we can afford all our social policy programmes. The report argues, and I agree, that economic sustainability must be New Zealand's goal, through a broad range of balanced policy programmes.

"The report identifies a number of policy areas it says must be addressed including increasing economic growth, higher private savings, enhancing the efficiency of private sector investment, limiting government spending and a consistent approach to immigration.

Many of these are already on the Government's agenda. I listed in my speech yesterday some of the areas we are working on including:

The already-announced micro-economic reforms  
Ways to encourage personal savings and develop a national savings strategy  
Reviewing Government spending intentions that have not yet been enacted.  
Considering medium-term policy options.  
"I want to make it clear that each of these areas is equally important in positioning for a strong and successful future for our country and its people.

"The ISI report is a reminder to us all that we cannot afford to let these issues drift. The issue of retirement income is a challenge for the Accord parties. If the Accord cannot make progress, then we will have to find an alternative route to advance this matter.

"I would urge all those interested in developing a sustainable economy and increasing savings to read the report and debate the options, so that we can move forward" Mrs Shipley concluded.
