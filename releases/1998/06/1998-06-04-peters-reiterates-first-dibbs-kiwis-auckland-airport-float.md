New Zealanders would get the first chance to buy shares in Auckland Airport as originally promised, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said in response to a New Zealand Herald article today.

"The suggestion that overseas investors would have preference over New Zealanders is totally incorrect.

"We have made it very clear from the start that this share float is aimed at New Zealanders who I am sure will see this opportunity for the good investment that it is," Mr Peters said.
