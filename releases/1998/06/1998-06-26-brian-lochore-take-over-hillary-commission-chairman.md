The Government has announced that former All Black captain Brian Lochore has been appointed the new Chairman of the Hillary Commission.

The 57-year old farmer will take over from the retiring incumbent, Sir Wilson Whineray, on Wednesday (1 July 1998).

Mr Lochore has been a member of the Hillary Commission since 1995, and currently holds the key post of Chairman of the NZ Sports Foundation Grants Committee.

It is the second time he has inherited a top sporting leadership role after taking over as Captain of the All Blacks from Wilson Whineray in 1966.
