The Government has released details of how schools across the country are expected to benefit from almost $400 million for new work on school buildings and extra classrooms.

"Responding to the growth in the number of students enrolling in schools, modernisation of existing buildings and mopping up the deferred maintenance backlog are the targets of the property spending for 1998/99," Mr Creech said.

"The programme again shows we are putting in the investment where it is needed to deliver a better learning environment for students. We are also empowering schools to determine their own property needs."

Key aspects of the property projects in this financial year:

$382 million will be spent on school property in 1998/998  
$180 million increase on regular baseline funding Delivers 460 additional classrooms  
$63 million set aside to clear up half of the remaining deferred maintenance work.  
$25 million for the Financial Assistance Scheme  
$40 million for new works such as health and safety projects and access to buildings for students with disabilities.

A new primary school is expected to be established at Papamoa, near Tauranga, and site purchases will continue for other new schools.

"Almost half, or $162 million, of the investment will pay for property projects to support expected peak 1999 rolls for primary schools, and peak year 2000 rolls for secondary schools.

"We also want to complete the whole programme of deferred maintenance by the start of the new millennium. The deferred maintenance has been around too long," Mr Creech said. "It is a pressing priority, and the Coalition Government is determined to start the next century with the issue out of the way.

"I want the Ministry of Education to make property spending more responsive to the needs of individual schools.

"For the first time, schools will have the option of using their deferred maintenance funding to pay for modernisation projects.

"This empowers schools to decide for themselves how their funding entitlement should be spent," said Mr Creech.

$25 million has been set aside for the Financial Assistance Scheme, where schools and the Government split the bill for modernisation or community based projects.

"The Government will continue to support schools that are prepared to put their own money up front to help themselves," Mr Creech said.

Another feature is a $40 million new works programme, to upgrade the health and safety of schools and to continue to improve access for the disabled. In total 1,100 projects at 760 schools will be paid for from this funding.
