Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, officially opens New Zealand's new Embassy in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, on Friday 5 June (Saturday NZT).

The opening will begin with an early morning hiki tapu ceremony to bless the new Embassy offices.

Mr McKinnon said the main entrance to the Embassy offices is flanked by Pou Pou, or carved panels symbolising agriculture, transport and leadership. This highlights the agricultural bases of both economies and the international cooperation between our two countries.

"Opening an Embassy in Argentina sends a strong signal that New Zealand has South American markets in our sights," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealand wants a strong and vibrant relationship with Argentina. It is an exciting country at the heart of MERCOSUR which boasts a total population of 200 million and a domestic market larger than other emerging markets."

"It's the job of our representatives in Argentina to develop and strengthen the ties between our two countries, ultimately enhancing opportunities for trade, investment and dialogue on other issues."

The Embassy, headed by Ambassador Caroline Forsyth, is New Zealand's 48th diplomatic mission and the second to be opened in South America - the other is in Santiago. Ambassador Forsyth is also accredited to Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

New Zealand's two-way trade with the four countries covered by the Embassy (the countries which make up MERCOSUR), totalled $NZ232.28 million for the year ended December 1997.

Trade with Brazil leads the way at $NZ161.85 million, consisting of $NZ94.09 million in exports and $NZ67.77 million in imports. Argentina accounted for $64.92 million of which $51.44 million was in exports. Uruguay accounted for $NZ5.5 million in exports. Trade with Paraguay is still at a lower level.
