Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnov'ek will meet Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and several key ministers during a two-day visit to Wellington on June 8 and 9.

Dr Drnov'ek will be the first Slovenian leader to visit New Zealand and his talks here are expected to focus on developing the bilateral relationship, which is in its infancy, as well as regional issues.

"I welcome the interest in New Zealand and our region that Dr Drnov'ek's visit demonstrates," Mrs Shipley said.

"It will provide an opportunity to discuss recent developments in both the Asia-Pacific region and in south eastern Europe, as well as to strengthen relations between our two countries."

Slovenia is one of five successor states to emerge from the former Yugoslavia. It became independent in 1992 and is expected to join the European Union early next century.

Slovenia, with a population of two million, is making solid progress in its transition to a full market economy, focussing on the production of manufactured goods and tourism.

As well as meeting with Mrs Shipley, Dr Drnov'ek is scheduled to meet International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith, Treasurer Winston Peters, Finance Minister Bill Birch, and Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton.
