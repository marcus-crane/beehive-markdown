A union says Labour MP Trevor Mallard and Alliance MP Grant Gillon are asking parliamentary questions on its behalf, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder reported today.

The Professional Firefighters Union has issued a notice to members thanking the two MPs for asking the parliamentary questions for it. Posted on the Union's internet site, it states:

'The Union appreciates very much the assistance given by both Trevor Mallard (Labour) and Grant Gillon (Alliance) in following up various issues for the Union with the Minister of Internal Affairs - particularly through the use of written questions to the Minister.'

"This is a gross abuse of the parliamentary process, if the union is to be believed, with MPs using their privileged position to work on behalf of a pressure group," Mr Elder said.

"Mr Mallard and Mr Gillon must now come clean and explain the nature of their relationship with the union to the public."
