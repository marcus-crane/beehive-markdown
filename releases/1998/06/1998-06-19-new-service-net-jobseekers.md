A new Internet service to help people looking for work has been launched today by Employment Minister Peter McCardle.

Job-Bank is the latest addition to NZ Employment Service's Internet site. It will provide fast access to information about all paid positions listed with NZES nationwide, and can be accessed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

It means jobseekers no longer have to go into an NZES centre to find out what vacancies are available. All they need is access to the Internet at home or at locations such as offices, libraries and schools.

The site address is http://job-bank.nzes.govt.nz

Launching the new site at Parliament, Mr McCardle said: "This is a exciting addition to the range of services provided for jobseekers, and more high-tech innovations are planned. It is part of the future direction for the Employment Service - helping jobseekers to help themselves, and to become more self-reliant."

Job-Bank is designed with state-of-the-art graphics, and is very easy to use. The first step is to click on the region the user is interested in, then the job category. All the positions in that category and in that region are listed on screen, together with relevant details such as skills needed, work hours, and salary. Job-Bank is interactive, so a user can e-mail the NZES centre dealing with a particular vacancy to obtain more information, or to apply for the job.

Mr McCardle said: "Job-Bank is another welcome addition to the range of services around the country for jobseekers, including providing computers for purposes such as writing CVs."

At the moment NZES has 1500 vacancies for paid work. That figure alters as jobs are filled, and new positions are listed.
