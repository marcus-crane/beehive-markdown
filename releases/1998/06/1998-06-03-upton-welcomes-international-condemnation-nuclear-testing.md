Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today he was delighted that the initiative by New Zealand and Australia in calling for an emergency meeting of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has so clearly demonstrated the international community's condemnation of nuclear testing.

"A statement introduced by New Zealand was supported by 49 countries. I am very encouraged that the New Zealand/Australian statement had such broad support, including all the permanent members of the Security Council and a wide range of countries from Western and Eastern Europe, as well as Japan, Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Ecuador.

"The statement condemned all nuclear testing, and said that tests by India blatantly undermine the international regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It said that constructive dialogue and negotiation is the only way to resolve tensions in the region. The 49 states called on India and Pakistan to renounce their nuclear weapons programmes, to accede unconditionally and without delay to the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and to engage in negotiations to conclude a ban on the production of fissile material.

"In addition to the CD special session, New Zealand also participated in a special plenary meeting of states parties to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in Vienna. A statement is being issued today on behalf of Treaty members, criticising Pakistan's nuclear tests and expressing concern about a potential arms race in South Asia. It calls on all countries to adhere to the CTBT unconditionally."
