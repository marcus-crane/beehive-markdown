Te Taru White has been appointed as a member of the Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA) Board for three years commencing 1 July 1998, announced Minister of Transport Hon Maurice Williamson today.

The LTSA has responsibility for the promotion of land transport safety at a reasonable cost. The Authority comprises a five member board whose members represent the public interest in road safety matters.

Mr White is replacing Noeline Munroe who has been a member of the LTSA since its inception in 1993.

"Mrs Munroe has made a significant contribution to the work of the LTSA and our recent positive gains in getting the road toll down reflects on her work," the Minister said.

"Mr White who has affiliations to Te Arawa, Ngati Porou and Tainui, has been actively involved in economic development of tribal resources. His experience extends across a range of public sector organisations.

"Mr White's science background and experience in asset, human resource and change management and in strategic planning will ensure the Authority has a strong skill base to draw from," Mr Williamson said.
