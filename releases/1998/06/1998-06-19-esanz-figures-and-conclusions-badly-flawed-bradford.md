The Electricity Supply Association (ESANZ) has fallen to a new low in attempting to put a positive spin on figures that even they admit show electricity prices for domestic consumers have risen by 16.6 per cent (in real terms) in the past five years, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

"ESANZ (representing the majority of power companies) is claiming that electricity bills to all their consumers - domestic, commercial and industrial - have fallen by eight per cent since 1987.

"At the same time, they provide graphs showing prices for domestic consumers - that's you and me at home - have had a 16.6 per cent increase in the past five years and a 21 per cent increase in the past 10 years."

Mr Bradford said an analysis of ESANZ's figures by the Ministry of Commerce also showed they were flawed from the start.

"In their press statement, ESANZ claims the Ministry of Commerce has agreed with its analysis showing average retail prices to all consumers had fallen by more than eight per cent. However, the Ministry has categorically rejected the conclusion of ESANZ, as is clearly shown in a report released this afternoon."

The report by the Ministry of Commerce (attached) clearly shows the relative movements in wholesale and retail prices.

"Power companies' prices fell by only 10 per cent while delivered wholesale prices (generation and transmission) fell by 21 per cent - which is absolutely consistent with what the Government has been saying all along."

Mr Bradford said the figures used by ESANZ are flawed because of data problems with wholesale prices which estimate a relatively low wholesale price for 1987 and a relatively high price for 1997.

"The effect is to underestimate the fall in wholesale prices over the period. The figures are also flawed because of the way ESANZ has calculated real prices.

"Even if ESANZ's results were correct as they stand, they still show that in percentage terms, real wholesale prices have fallen more than retail prices."
