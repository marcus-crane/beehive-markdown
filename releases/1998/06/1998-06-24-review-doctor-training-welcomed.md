Health Minister Bill English said today he welcomed moves by hospitals to review doctors' training.

"All young doctors spend time in hospitals during their training and we have to make sure they get high quality training that meets the needs of the health services they are being trained to work in.

"However, training for doctors has been a long-running irritant in our hospitals and a concern for both employers and doctors.

"The decision by hospitals to commission a nationwide review of doctor training is a constructive approach to trying to resolve this issue.

"I know that the deans of both Medical Schools are also thinking about ways that training can be better organised. I hope that these two groups can combine their thinking to try and get a solution to these problems," said Mr English.
