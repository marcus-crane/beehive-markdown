Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters has repeated his call for MPs to disclose their business interests and connections following TVNZ's Assignment programme about the ACT party, on Thursday night.

"Mr Prebble told the Assignment programme that he encouraged his MPs to maintain their private interests.

"He says as long as ACT MPs make a "reasonable" contribution in Parliament then their private business interests don't matter.

"But some private activities might raise a conflict of interest at the expense of taxpayers.

"It is not right for an MP to pursue their own business interests at the expense of their Parliamentary duties which they are being paid a full-time salary for.

"All MPs must declare their hand so the public can judge whether there are any possible conflicts of interests.

"This issue is in the public interest and is particularly significant given the Owen Jennings debacle and use of Parliamentary property for private business deals," Mr Peters said.
