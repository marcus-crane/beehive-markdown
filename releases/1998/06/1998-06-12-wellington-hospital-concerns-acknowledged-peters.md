Wellingtonians are right to be concerned about the quality and quantity of services offered at their hospital, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters said today, responding to suggestions that Wellington could lose heart and neuro-surgery services.

"Bill English's assurance that Wellington will not lose heart and neuro-surgery services are welcome, however both Bill English and myself believe it is essential that Wellingtonians know exactly what services their hospital will deliver.

"I will be seeking a briefing from management of Wellington Hospital on issues of management facing the hospital and I will be discussing with the Minister of Health on looking at what further investment can be made in the hospital.

"The Minister and I, along with the people of Wellington, want to see a world class hospital serving Wellington," Mr Peters said.
