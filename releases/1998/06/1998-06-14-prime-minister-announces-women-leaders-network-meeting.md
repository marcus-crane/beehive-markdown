Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced that an APEC Women Leaders Network (WLN) meeting will be held in June next year as part of New Zealand's APEC responsibility.

Speaking at the Wise Women Network Conference in Wellington, Mrs Shipley said the WLN will highlight women's role in business and their contribution to economic development in the APEC economies.

"It will provide opportunities for women of the APEC region to develop business partnerships and alliances.

"The WLN will also provide the region?s business women with a direct input to the APEC Leaders meeting. This will give greater recognition to women?s contribution to the APEC economies, their view of the financial situation in the region, and the effect of globalisation and trade liberalisation on women?s lives and business enterprises.

"In addition to looking at APEC regional issues, the WLN will be a significant opportunity to showcase New Zealand women?s role in businesses development. New Zealand women are among the most enterprising and innovative business creators in the APEC region.

"New Zealand women in business have many success stories to tell including Maori women's business innovation, the Maori Women's Development Fund's financial and mentoring services, the success of women's networks such as Women In Self Employment (WISE) and the role of women-owned businesses in niche markets such as "organic" food production, the apparel and fashion industry, publishing and tourism.

Mrs Shipley says the conference will also follow-up on the themes of the 1998 APEC meetings on small and medium-sized enterprises, human resource development and science and technology.

The WLN is an APEC-related informal network of women in business, government, universities, research institutions and non-governmental organisations in the APEC economies. Meetings of the WLN have rotated with the APEC chair, with the Philippines hosting the initial meeting and Canada hosting the 1997 meeting. To date meetings have been held in close association with the APEC Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) Ministerial meeting.
