Canberra's decision to implement its CER obligations with respect to local television content quotas should lead to the New Zealand television industry having a much better chance of exporting its programmes to Australia, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Dr Smith was welcoming the Australian Government's decision to have the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) revise Australia's local content quota standard for free-to-air commercial television.

Currently, the quota standard excludes New Zealand television programmes. New Zealand has argued that that makes the standard unlawful because of the CER Protocol on Trade in Services. Last month, the Australian High Court agreed with New Zealand's position when it ruled on an appeal by the TradeNZ-backed Project Blue Sky.

"The High Court ruling was an important reaffirmation of what CER stands for," Dr Smith said. "The court was clear that, under CER, the ABA must accord national treatment to New Zealand programmes. That is what New Zealand has been seeking - no more, no less."

Dr Smith said the New Zealand Government was ready to work constructively with the Australian Government and the ABA in delivering a satisfactory outcome for all concerned. "New Zealand attaches considerable importance to finding a solution which is in accordance with the court ruling and CER. I encourage the television industries on both sides of the Tasman to work together with the ABA to develop a new standard."
