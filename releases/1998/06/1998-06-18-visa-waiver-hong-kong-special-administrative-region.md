"New Zealand is to introduce a 'visa free' regime for visitors from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)," Prime Minister Shipley announced on the visit of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR Tung Chee Hwa today.

Mrs Shipley said the announcement reflected New Zealand's confidence in the continuing integrity and autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR.

It is nearly one year since the transition of sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to China and the implementation of the "one country two systems" regime.

"In the year since the handover of sovereignty, China has been scrupulous in abiding by its commitments to Hong Kong; allowing it to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and protecting those rights and freedoms promised it under the 'Basic Law', a document which, in effect, serves as the Hong Kong SAR's de facto constitution.

"The Hong Kong SAR is one of New Zealand's leading economic and trade partners. It is New Zealand's seventh largest export market with exports exceeding half-a-billion dollars last year. Hong Kong is also a valuable source of foreign investment; a significant source of overseas visitors as well as an important source of migrants."

"From many perspectives, the Hong Kong SAR partnership is of immense importance and value to New Zealand. This visa waiver will help promote those links further and encourage more tourists and business people to visit New Zealand in the future," the Prime Minister said.

The visa waiver will enable holders of Hong Kong SAR and British National (Overseas) passports to visit New Zealand for up to three months without requiring a visa. As with other visa waiver arrangements, all visitors from Hong Kong SAR will be subject to standard border control requirements. The policy announced today will come into effect on 1 October 1998.
