Users of legislation are being surveyed on proposed changes to the format of legislation as part of a process directed at making the law easier to understand.

The Attorney-General, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today the survey was being carried out following recommendations from the Law Commission.

'The Law Commission recommended changes to the design and typography of legislation in recognition of the fact that the physical appearance of legislation is an important factor affecting its accessibility to those who use it,' he said.

'Since their report was published, representatives of the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Law Commission, the Office of the Clerk, the Inland Revenue Department's drafting unit and GP Print have been reviewing the recommended changes.

'Before a final recommendation is made to the Government, the working group is keen to get feedback from a wide range of users of legislation.'

A survey pack containing samples of the current typeface and type size and six alternatives has been put together. It uses the Defamation Act, the original sample used in the Law Commission's report.

Mr Graham said the main point to be considered is which typeface and type size contributes most to legibility and comprehension of legislation.

Copies of the survey pack are available from Julia Kennedy, Manager Support Services, Parliamentary Counsel office, or Susan Clarke, Legal Executive, Parliamentary Counsel Office: Ph (04) 472 9639; Fax (04) 499 1724; e-mail susan.clarke@parliament.govt.nz
