The Minister for Courts, Hon Wyatt Creech, said today some courts fees payable by those who use the court system will rise from 1 July 1998.

The changes will be gazetted today.

"The Government has decided to increase court fees by a small margin on some high volume services so that court users make a more appropriate contribution to the cost of providing services," Mr Creech said.

"This rise is consistent with a general on-going assessment by the Department for Courts of the level of user contribution to the cost of court services."

The fees affected are mainly those charged in the civil jurisdiction.

Despite these increases, the vast bulk of the cost of court services will still be met by the taxpayer.

Full details of the new fees are attached to this Media Release.
