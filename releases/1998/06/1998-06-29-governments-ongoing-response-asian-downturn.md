"The Coalition Government is acting to ensure the hard-won gains of the last 15 years are retained for New Zealanders," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Speaking after a cabinet briefing on the impact of external shocks from Asia on the New Zealand economy, Mrs Shipley said New Zealand along with other countries in the region is finding the Asian downturn deeper and longer-lasting than initial information indicated.

"New Zealand sells more than a third of all its exports to Asia. Their downturn is now affecting our exports, our income and our growth. The latest information indicates that while growth levels are expected to recover, the current situation is serious and we will have to revise downwards our expectations of economic growth and tax revenue. It is responsible and prudent to look at both short and medium term responses to that and we have decided to:

Set aside some Government spending  
Accelerate our programme of reducing costs to business  
Look at further measures to enhance the environment for growth  
"New Zealand has made many of the right moves to build a sound flexible economy that is well placed to weather the current storm. The Government is living within its means with surpluses enabling us to maintain confidence and pay off debt.

"We have already in this year's Budget set aside $300 million over two years as a buffer against the Asian economic downturn. Today Cabinet has agreed in principle to at least double that reserve. This will require us to take moderate and sensible steps to constrain the Coalition Government's spending programme.

"A team of Ministers will be working through the detail and announcements will be made once that is completed.

"Secondly, the Government has re-stated its commitment and determination to implement the programme of measures announced in the Budget aimed at improving competitiveness and reducing costs to business. These measures, such as lower power prices and competition in ACC, will help New Zealand businesses compete overseas.

"Thirdly, the Government is giving further consideration to a package of medium-term measures that will improve the competitiveness of exporters and strengthen prospects for economic growth.

"The only way we will create jobs and achieve our social goals for the next generation of New Zealanders is through sustainable, ongoing export-led economic growth. The Government will continue to consider all options for assisting and enhancing that recovery.

"This is a demanding time because as a nation of traders we cannot avoid being swept along by the tides of the global economy. The longer term outlook remains more positive, because New Zealanders are smart, efficient and flexible, and as the global economy grows, with the aid of sound economic fundamentals we will recover and prosper," the Prime Minister concluded.
