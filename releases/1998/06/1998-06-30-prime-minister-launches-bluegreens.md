The Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley, today launched a new centre right political grouping of environmentalists to work with the National Party, to be known as "Bluegreens."

"Some of the biggest challenges New Zealand faces in the new millennium will be how to ensure that the environment and our natural heritage are not polluted and destroyed.

"National will draw on the strengths of the Bluegreens to develop innovative green policies that will complement a successful economy," Mrs Shipley said.

Central to the philosophy of the Bluegreens is a charter setting out ten objectives which they want to see translated into future National Party policies. The Bluegreens seek to attract a wide membership from both inside and outside the National Party to develop credible policies which will put the Party at the forefront in securing improved government performance.

"We must recognise that the quality and diversity of New Zealand environment is the core asset of New Zealand, and learn to treat it as such. Future government policy must clearly recognise that there is a direct relationship between a healthy environment and a growing economy."

Mrs Shipley also announced that the Government had approved new regulations under the Resource Management Act to combat marine pollution.

"These regulations are intended to protect our coastal waters from invasion from unwanted organisms," Mrs Shipley said "but they also tell boaties that discharging sewage and rubbish from their boats in our harbours and close to our shoreline is not acceptable. Ending this practice will mean a better quality environment and a more enjoyable experience for boaties and for all New Zealanders who like to spend time.on our beautiful beaches and coastline.

"These are the sorts of policies that I anticipate the Bluegreens will be working on developing and pushing within the Party to be adopted. We need to develop policy that is seriously debated and which can be implemented credibly. It is a challenge, but one I know that they, and the Party, will accept, knowing that our future, quite literally, depends on it.

"The politics of the left has failed both internationally and domestically to marry economic and social progress with sound environmental policies. National relishes the challenge of showing that clean and green is good business." Mrs Shipley said.
