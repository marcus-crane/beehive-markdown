Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today that, in light of the improved security situation, there is no reason to discourage New Zealanders from visiting Indonesia.

"This supersedes earlier advice from our Embassy I Jakarta suggesting New Zealanders defer non-essential travel to Indonesia," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealanders visiting Indonesia should be aware that the political and economic situation remains uncertain and that the possibility of localised unrest cannot be ruled out. They should keep themselves fully informed of developments and take sensible precautions for personal safety," Mr McKinnon continued.

"The disturbing events of last month are a reminder of how important it is for New Zealanders to keep the Jakarta Embassy informed of their whereabouts. New Zealanders residing in Indonesia should register with the Embassy if they have not already done so. Those who left during last month's unrest should let the Embassy know when they have returned," Mr McKinnon concluded.
