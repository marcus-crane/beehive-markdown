Health Minister Bill English said today people with disabilities might in future be able to get more control over funding so they could organise their own support services.

"We need to explore more flexible funding options for people and this could include individual entitlements.

"This won't be an option for everyone with a disability, but there is no doubt that the notion of individual entitlement is attractive to many people with disabilities because it is all about support for independence," said Mr English.

Mr English was speaking at the launch of Building on the New Deal, which sets out the Government's work programme for Disability Support Services for the next three to five years.

"This work programme is not about a whole lot of structural change. I want to see solutions that mean a better service for people because too much structural change only disorientates people.

"It is counter-productive to generalise about people with disabilities. In the end the best solutions will be about the different bits of the Government service working together at the local level with families and individuals," he said.

Disability spending became part of the health budget in 1993. Last year the funding authority spent $1.25 billion on disability support services, or a quarter of its total budget.

"The benefit of this document is that it states our priorities in black and white and thus provides clearly accountable direction for the Ministry of Health and the Health Funding Authority's work over the next three to five years.

"A disability database will be developed to provide comprehensive data on people with disabilities, their needs and the services provided to meet their needs. The Disability Framework that has been implemented over the last five years will be reviewed," said Mr English.
