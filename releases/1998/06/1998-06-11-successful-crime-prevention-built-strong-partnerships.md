The partnership of Government and local communities working through Safer Community Councils can make a real difference in reducing crime and making communities safer, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Speaking at a meeting of the Prime Ministerial Safer Communities Council in Wellington, Mrs Shipley said local Safer Community Councils played a key role in supporting and coordinating community crime prevention initiatives.

"Providing successful local solutions to local problems requires strong partnerships between Safer Community Councils, local communities and Government agencies.

"There are some excellent examples of what Safer Communities Councils can achieve through bringing together experienced, skilled individuals and organisations with the commitment and energy to make a difference to the levels of crime and anti-social behaviour we find within our neighbourhoods and communities.

"The various youth programmes around the country, including schemes to reduce truancy, and night patrol-town watch initiatives, have had a significant impact on reducing crime and helping individuals use their energies in productive ways.

"For example, the Otangarei Safer Streets project in the Whangarei area is one of the 16 Youth at Risk demonstration projects being supported by the Crime Prevention Unit. This project combines after-school activities, neighbourhood support groups and safety and security initiatives and Police have reported a 50 percent drop in shoplifting and vandalism in the area since it started.

"In Kerekere, the Safer Community Council set up a school holiday programme for young people living in Shannon. During the programme period, police reported an 80 percent drop in youth crime compared to other holiday periods.

"The 'early start' programme in Christchurch helps at-risk families through intensive home-based support. The Christchurch Safer Community Council has long been a supporter and advocate of this programme, which now, along with a similar programme 'family start', is being piloted in Whangarei, Rotorua and West Auckland.

"The Coalition Government strongly shares the commitment to working with communities in a coordinated approach to combatting crime.

"But the community crime prevention approach is only one part of Government ?s law and order strategy.

"We have also increased funding for the Police by $53 million, increased Police numbers by 286 at the frontline and improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the Courts and Corrections systems. We must work in an integrated way, right across the Justice sector."

Mrs Shipley thanked all representatives from the 60 Safer Community Councils around the country for their continuing support and work.

"As a result of the Crime Prevention Strategy and in particular the work of Safer Community Councils, there is now a changed perception of crime prevention as an issue which both government and the community can jointly own and address," the Prime Minister concluded.

The Safer Community Councils are administered and supported by the Crime Prevention Unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
