The sale of Wellington Airport has nothing to do with Wellington Hospital in the context that the Wellington Mayor and some of the councilors have implied tonight, Treasurer Winston Peters said.

"The Budget document made it very clear that the Government would look at assets management on a case by case basis, to free up money to invest in vital education and health initiatives.

"For the Wellington Mayor and other councilors to imply that this is in some way a bribe is a straight cop-out of their responsibility to stick to their word with respect to the Wellington Airport sale process.

"The Government agreed to the sale of Wellington Airport at their request. What use will be made of the funds from any sale is quite a separate issue which need not concern the Council.

"I have visited Wellington Hospital, among others. With the Asian crisis having an affect on the Government's coffers we must look at using the proceeds from the sale of assets to pay off debt and use the interest bill savings to invest in vital capital and infrastructure projects such as those required by Wellington Hospital.

"Simply put - the Council need to keep their word on the sale of the Airport, and let us worry about running Wellington's health services," Mr Peters said.
