Brazil is forming the new frontier for New Zealand Investment in Latin America, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon said today after a busy three-day visit in powerful Latin American country.

Mr McKinnon, on a five-nation visit to South America, said Brazil and Argentina had taken over from Chile as the new horizon for New Zealand trade and investment in South America, and the opportunity for rapid growth was exciting.

"New Zealand's links with Brazil have great potential, not just in terms of trade and investment possibilities, but also in cooperating in international trade fora such as the WTO where we share many similar objectives," Mr McKinnon said.

"As fellow members of the Cairns Group, New Zealand and Brazil have an intense interest in opening up world markets for agricultural products. Hopefully as we work together towards this common goal we can develop an understanding that will prove fruitful in other areas of international trade.

"Brazil also offers huge opportunities for New Zealand businesses looking to expand their horizons. It is the most industrialised American country south of the United States. It is enjoying rapid economic expansion, boasts huge resources and is an important member of the Mercosur customs union that also includes Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay."

During his three-day visit to Brazil Mr McKinnon met a variety of business leaders in the major commercial centre of Sao Paulo before travelling to the capital Brasilia where he held formal talks with Foreign Minister Luiz Lampreia after meeting key Ministers.

Mr McKinnon, the first New Zealand Foreign Minister to make an official visit to South America, said he hoped his visit would lay the foundation for a broader relationship with Brazil. He noted that the two countries also shared common interests in areas such as United Nations reforms, the environment, indigenous issues and Antarctica.

Mr McKinnon now moves on to Argentina before finishing his visit in Chile.
