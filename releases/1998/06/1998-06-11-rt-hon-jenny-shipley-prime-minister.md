Mrs Shipley warmly welcomed His Excellency Mr Alberto Fujimori, President of the Republic of Peru, his Ministers and his delegation to New Zealand. This was the first visit to New Zealand by any Head of State of the Republic of Peru.

The Leaders agreed that both countries were seeking to develop linkages with their respective regions. For Peru, the accession to APEC was the clearest possible sign of Peru ?s wish to develop its relationships with the Asia Pacific region. Similarly, for NZ, a number of recent initiatives and visits had underscored the Government?s determination to deepen its political, economic and other contacts with the countries of Latin America. Within this broader strategic context, the visit to NZ of the President of Peru, following so soon after the visit to Peru by New Zealand?s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Rt Hon Don McKinnon, underscored both countries? commitment to exploit more fully the potential of this particular bilateral relationship.

International and Regional Cooperation  
APEC  
The Prime Minister said she was delighted to welcome Peru into APEC as a full member, with effect from the Kuala Lumpur Leaders? meeting to be held in November. She noted that Peru was already a member of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC), and had been a member of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) since 1990. Peru had strong APEC credentials. Mrs Shipley observed that Peru?s first full year of formal membership of APEC would be during New Zealand?s term as APEC Chair. She very much looked forward to welcoming the President and other APEC Leaders to Auckland in September next year.

The Multilateral Trading System (WTO): Its Importance to the Two Economies  
The Prime Minister and President Fujimori noted that both their countries supported the multilateral trading system. The President explained the successful steps his Government had taken to stabilise Peru?s economy since 1990 after many years of hyper-inflation and economic dislocation that took place during the previous administration. New Zealand and Peru's efforts to integrate their economies more fully with the international economy meant that the health of the multilateral trading system was increasingly important to Peru.

Both Leaders agreed that a liberal international trading system strongly reinforced such policies and agreed to work together to build support for further liberalisation of world trade on a comprehensive basis. Both Leaders agreed to maintain close contact as they sought to build up political momentum at Head of Government level, towards a new round of Trade Negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.

The United Nations System  
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and President Fujimori noted their commonality of view on United Nations issues, and agreed that reform of the United Nations system was an important issue to all countries. They welcomed the good progress made on the Secretary-General?s reform package last year and expressed the hope that progress would continue to be made at a good pace. Mrs Shipley noted Peru?s candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2001 and 2002.

International Security  
Mrs Shipley and Mr Fujimori expressed their shared deep concern at the recent nuclear testing undertaken by first India, and then Pakistan. The Leaders deplored those actions which could threaten the peace and stability of the region. They called on India and Pakistan to adhere unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

The Environment  
Mrs Shipley and Mr Fujimori agreed that global environmental issues such as climate change were of vital importance to all countries in today?s world and noted that the two countries cooperated in many international environmental fora. On climate change, the Leaders welcomed the positive outcomes of the Third Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, contained in the Kyoto Protocol, and hoped that further progress would be made, particularly on emissions trading, at the Fourth Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in November. Both the Prime Minister and the President also stressed the importance of preserving the environment of our Oceans and managing marine resources, especially fisheries in a sustainable way. They expressed the hope that the 7th session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, to be chaired by New Zealand, would lead to improved coherence of the international approach to Oceans.

Antarctica  
The Prime Minister noted that New Zealand had been an original supporter of Peru?s bid for Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party status. Since then, the Prime Minister noted that Peru had shown a strong commitment to Antarctic scientific research. Mrs Shipley and Mr Fujimori noted that New Zealand and Peru had common views on the protection of the Antarctic environment and its dependent and associated ecosystems. They expressed their concern about illegal and unregulated fishing for toothfish in the Southern Oceans.

Mrs Shipley expressed her gratitude for Peru?s initiative to host the twenty-third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXIII) in 1999.

El Nino  
Prime Minister Shipley expressed her deep regret and sympathy at the devastation suffered in Peru this year due to the effects of the El Nino weather pattern. She noted that New Zealand was pleased to help the Peruvian people through this difficult time with a contribution to relief funds of over $100,000.

In turn, President Fujimori expressed on behalf of the Government and people of Peru and himself, their gratitude to the New Zealand Government for this gesture of friendship and solidarity which added to the initial assistance given to Peru by the New Zealand Government last April.

Bilateral Cooperation  
Both Leaders expressed their determination to deepen ties between Peru and New Zealand. There were a number of areas where practical steps could be taken. With the greater political focus now realised through the President?s visit, they expressed confidence that the potential of the relationship would be more fully exploited in the future to the benefit of both countries.

Political  
The visit of the President and his Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and the Presidency, together with Mr McKinnon?s own visit to Peru this month, had demonstrated the value of high level political contacts. Such contact would now be renewed at Head of Government level each year, thanks to Peru?s full participation in APEC and the APEC Leaders? Meeting in particular. Both Leaders agreed that further visits, focussed on practical aspects of the relationship, would be valuable. In that regard, the Prime Minister welcomed the interest shown by the Peruvian Government in exchanging high-level visits in the fisheries sector.

At official level, they noted that the two Foreign Ministers had just signed a memorandum of understanding designed to establish a political consultative mechanism between their respective Foreign Ministries. This would be supplemented by contact amongst officials in many other fields through their joint participation in various APEC working groups. This augured well for the future.

Trade  
Bilateral trade was at a relatively low level, except in dairy products, where New Zealand was Peru?s largest source of imports. The President noted with satisfaction that there were signs of interest on the part of New Zealand companies to increase trade and invest in Peru, particularly in the agro-business area. The New Zealand Prime Minister, for her part, pointed to the very open nature of the New Zealand import regime. She hoped Peruvian companies and business people, now that they were beginning to focus on the APEC region, would explore the opportunities in the New Zealand market for Peruvian products.

In this context, the Leaders welcomed the progress made on an Interagency Quarantine Arrangement between the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry?s Regulatory Authority (MAFRA) and the Peruvian National Sanitary Service (Senasa), which would, among other things, allow the importation of Peruvian mangoes into New Zealand. The Prime Minister and President noted with satisfaction that this agreement was expected to be completed in time to allow the importation of Peruvian mangoes in December 1998, when the mango season began.

There were also shared interests in certain areas of fishing and agriculture, the Leaders said. Earlier New Zealand development assistance efforts in Peru (the Province of Puno) had shown how applicable New Zealand agriculture technology was in certain areas of Peru. These development assistance efforts had contributed significant technical expertise to the Puno project in the 1970s and early 1980s and it was now self-sustaining. Private sector links had since continued and President Fujimori said he was delighted that New Zealand agricultural scientists and consultants were keen to contribute their technical expertise. Both Leaders believed this was an encouraging development and one which reflected the positive and growing opportunities between the two countries.

The Leaders agreed that, in the longer term, trade in services would develop because of these natural shared interests. The Prime Minister emphasised the considerable strength of New Zealand consultancy companies. In the South Pacific and in Asia, New Zealand consultancy companies had proven time and time again how New Zealand experts could bring practical and highly cost-effective solutions to a range of economic development problems. Given the much improved economic outlook in Peru, there was every reason to believe these strengths could be of interest to Peru.

The Leaders noted that although there were no existing air links between New Zealand and Peru, both countries shared a similar approach in their negotiation of international air services agreements. Prime Minister Shipley and President Fujimori stressed the importance of good air links for trade and tourism. They also recognised the significant future potential for the further development of tourism between their two nations and expressed a desire for improved cooperation. With the prospect of further expansion of scheduled air services between New Zealand and South America later in 1998, opportunities to stimulate a greater level of tourism activity would be further enhanced.

Accordingly, the Leaders agreed that, consistent with APEC and the globalisation of trade in goods and services generally, officials should meet to consider the possibility of an ?open skies? air services agreement between New Zealand and Peru, for the mutual benefit of each country?s consumers and business people. The Leaders also noted that both New Zealand and Peru enjoy a privileged geographical situation, as Pacific Basin countries and could become hubs between Latin America and South East Asia respectively and hoped that the possibility of enhanced airlines would further stimulate the two-way flow of trade in goods and services.

Educational and Scientific Links  
The Prime Minister and President warmly welcome the links developing between educational institutions in their countries, and said these links reflected on-going person to person links between the two countries. They referred in particular to a Memorandum of Understanding currently under consideration between Auckland University and the University and the Universidad Pacifico in Lima, and another nearing conclusion between Lincoln University and the Universidad Agraria La Molina. Prime Minister Shipley and President Fujimori noted the negotiation of an inter-institutional arrangement between the Nelson School of Fisheries and the Peruvian Technological Fishing Institute.

Mr Fujimori and Mrs Shipley welcomed the scientific and technological links between their countries. These included an Agreement for Technical Cooperation on Fisheries, signed between Peru?s Maritime Institute (IMARPE) and New Zealand?s Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (IGNS). The Leaders hoped that the areas of cooperation listed in the annex to the Agreement would give rise to fruitful projects of benefit to both countries. The two Leaders noted that Peru?s Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN) was also interested in negotiating an interagency cooperation arrangement with New Zealand?s Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (IGNS).

Also, New Zealand?s Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Regulatory Authority (MAFRA) was interested in negotiating a Memorandum of Technical Cooperation with Peru?s National Sanitary Service (SENASA).

The Leaders welcomed the fact that closer contact had been amply achieved now between their two countries. Extraordinary progress had been made by Peru in developing its linkages with the Asia-Pacific region. This would, they believed, ensure closer ties between Peru and New Zealand in the areas of trade, investment, politics, technology, culture, and education in the years ahead.

On behalf of his Ministers and delegation the President thanked the Prime Minister for the warm hospitality extended to them by the New Zealand Government. He also invited Mrs Shipley to pay a reciprocal visit to Peru at a mutually convenient time.
