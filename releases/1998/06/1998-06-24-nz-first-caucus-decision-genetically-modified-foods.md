Associate Health Minister Hon Tuariki Delamere announced today that the New Zealand First caucus, after taking careful heed of public concerns, has decided to seek more information on the question of compulsory labelling of genetically-modified foods.

"We have asked officials to prepare a paper for us outlining the implications for food safety and trade relations of such a policy, should it be adopted," he said.

"We want as much up-to-date information as possible on what other countries like the United States and the European Community are doing in this area, since it is becoming apparent that differing policies are being pursued.

"We acknowledge that Alliance MP, Phillida Bunkle, has a Private Member's Bill before the House seeking the compulsory labelling of GMF's, and in last year's debate on this Bill, New Zealand First MP's had some sympathy for its general principles.

"But we didn't support it last time because it was deficient in certain areas, in that it was inconsistent with New Zealand's international obligations; was imprecise about exactly what would be required of food manufacturers and importers; and failed to address the question of compliance costs. These are still areas of concern.

"Once all the information has been presented to caucus, a decision will be made on how to proceed on this question.

"In taking this action, caucus notes that many New Zealanders, while accepting the Government's role is to ensure food must be safe, still want the freedom of choice to decide whether or not they will consume foods that have been genetically-modified," said the Minister.
