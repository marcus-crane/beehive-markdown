Health Minister Bill English said today he had concerns about the advertising of drugs direct to the public, particularly television advertising, and would be asking the Ministry of Health to investigate whether recent advertisements complied with the Medicines Act.

"Doctors have told me they are concerned about the advertisements for Xenical in particular. Doctors say they are being put under significant pressure by people wanting this drug when it is not appropriate for them.

"I have heard anecdotal evidence that people are prepared to 'shop around' until they find a doctor prepared to prescribe it.

"Another drug that there has been a lot of publicity about recently is Viagra. While this is not yet available in New Zealand, when it does become available there are likely to be similar pressures around it.

"The New Zealand Medical Association has also written to me raising concerns about the growing tendency of the drug companies to advertise prescription medicines direct to the public.

"Direct marketing of drugs is happening world-wide as drug companies look to by-pass Government controls on spending.

"The sale of medicines in New Zealand is governed by the Medicines Act and Section 57 of the Act puts the onus on drug companies to prove the claims they make about a product. Most advertising to doctors is accompanied by data sheets or at least summaries of them which doctors can use to assess whether they think a drug is appropriate for a patient.

"I have particular concerns about whether it is possible to meet the requirements of Section 57 in a television advertisement.

"In the first instance I will be asking the Ministry of Health to investigate whether the drug companies which are advertising directly to the public are meeting the requirements of the Medicines Act.

"If any breaches are found, appropriate action will be taken. If the requirements of the Act are being met it may be that we need to look at tightening controls on the advertising of prescription medicines, but I don't want to prejudge the issue at this stage," said Mr English.
