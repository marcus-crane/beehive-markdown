The independent team to examine issues relating to the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) performance arising out of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission's report on the United Aviation accident in the Tararua Ranges, was announced today by Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson.

John Upton QC, of Wellington, and Don Spruston, former Director General of Civil Aviation in Transport Canada, will be undertaking the inquiry.

"Having an experienced legal expert and a highly regarded international safety expert will give us the results we need," said Mr Williamson.

"I want the inquiry to examine:

- the adequacy of the systems that the CAA had in place at the time of the Tararua accident, for ensuring that corrective action was taken
- whether, given the information available prior to the accident, the CAA made appropriate judgements with respect to United Aviation
- the systems for taking corrective action the CAA now has in place
- the adequacy of the present legislation for enabling the CAA Director to take appropriate corrective action.

"I expect the inquiry team to have finished their work by the end of August and, although this is a Ministerial rather than a public inquiry, its findings will be released to the public," Mr Williamson said.
