Progressing the early liberalisation deals for the forestry and fisheries sectors is Trade Minister Lockwood Smith's main priority for the APEC trade ministers' meeting starting in Kuching, Malaysia, tomorrow.

"In November in Vancouver, APEC leaders directed this Kuching meeting to progress liberalisation deals for nine sectors, including forestry and fisheries," Dr Smith said. "While the subsequent Asian financial crisis has complicated the liberalisation agenda, a bold outcome from the meeting would make an important contribution to restoring business confidence in the region."

Among Dr Smith's bilateral meetings while in Kuching are those with Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, South Korean Trade Minister Han Duk-Soo, Vietnamese Trade Minister Truong Dinh Tuyen, Chinese Vice Trade Minister Long YongTu and Australian Senator David Brownhill.

Dr Smith returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
