The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) today released its report on the fatal accident in June last year of a United Aviation Beechcraft BE58 Baron ZK-KVL.

"Both TAIC's report and an oral briefing I received from its Commissioner, have raised serious concerns about the CAA's auditing, monitoring and follow up system in relation to United Aviation's operation," said Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson today

"I have subsequently met with the CAA's Chairman, and its Director, seeking their comments on TAIC's findings.

"I believe there are sufficient inconsistencies between the Commission's findings and the Authority's comments to me, to warrant an Independent Inquiry into the CAA systems referred to in the Report.

"The terms of reference, and the membership of the Inquiry will be announced shortly.

"I would expect a finding in late August and, although this is a Ministerial rather than a public inquiry, its findings will be released to the public," Mr Williamson said.
