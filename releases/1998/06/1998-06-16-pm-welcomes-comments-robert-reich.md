Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed comments by former United States Secretary of Labour Robert Reich that building New Zealand's wealth into the future requires investing in our people.

"Mr Reich is absolutely right when he advocates the importance of investing in people through education and training. As he says, 'people who are well-educated and have good skills, stand to gain from globalisation and technological change'.

"The Coalition Government is doing just that. At the heart of this Coalition Government's education policy is its pledge to build greater confidence in our education system and ensure that all young people are able to make the most of the opportunities that education provides."

"We are spending more on education now than we ever have. We are investing in our local schools, our universities and our polytechnics.

"But investing in our people will always require a partnership between Central Government and the community because no matter how committed a Government is, it is also up to individuals and employers to make education and training a priority part of business.

"New Zealand also has some excellent corporate citizens who are demonstrating, over the long term, that investing in its workers has positive spin-offs for their businesses.

"The Coalition is also investing in people through the Community Wage. Making people feel they are valued for their contribution is the right thing to do, and I note that Robert Reich agrees with that."

Mrs Shipley said to successfully invest in people also meant tackling some of the tough social issues.

"Government funded programmes only deal with the symptoms of the issues we are concerned abot. If we are serious about dealing with the causes and about investing in our people, we must all face up to a debate on the responsibilities of every New Zealander.

"That is why the Government produced the proposed Code of Social Responsibilty, earlier this year.

"The Code document made all New Zealanders think about what the Government can do on behalf of the taxpayer and what New Zealanders and their families must do for themselves."

"Our greatest source of wealth is our people and New Zealand and New Zealanders have built a strong and competitive economy internationally on that.

"As Mr Reich has said during his visit, the worldwide challenge is to work to continue building on that wealth.

"Coming up with policy solutions is something that Reich strongly advocates. In a recent interview he said 'It's far easier to make headlines by vilifying and demonizing, by casting blame, instead of doing the more difficult work of coming up with solutions'. The Coalition Government agrees and is determined to find solutions. I hope other parties will also take up that challenge," Mrs Shipley concluded.
