Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters said today that he was looking forward to a satisfactory resolution to the issue of compensation for those suffering from Hepatitis C and HIV, contracted as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.

"I am confident of achieving a positive result shortly," Mr Peters said.

Action on compensation for Hepatitis C and HIV sufferers was listed in the Supplementary Agreement to the 1996 Coalition Agreement.
