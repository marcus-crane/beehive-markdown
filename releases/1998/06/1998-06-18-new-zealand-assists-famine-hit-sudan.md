New Zealand has responded to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan with a series of grants announced today by Associate Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Upton.

World Vision, Christian World Service and TEAR Fund will receive funds from NZODA totalling $582,000 to help feed displaced people in the Bahr el Ghazal and Southern Blue Nile regions of Sudan.

"New Zealand's contribution will support the efforts to improve food security for thousands of people affected by the crisis in southern Sudan. The projects will address immediate nutritional needs through supplementary food distribution, as well as the provision of seeds and tools to help establish crops for the future.

"The Government's grants will combine with the contributions of individual New Zealanders who have given generously to aid organisations. The Government's $200,000 grant to World Vision, for instance, adds to $560,000 already pledged by individual New Zealanders," Mr Upton said.

In addition to the Sudanese projects, Burundi, Ethiopia and Myanmar will benefit through grants to the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), Caritas, Corso, Save the Children Fund and TEAR Fund.

In Rwanda, Save the Children will receive $169,000 for a family tracing and reunification project for unaccompanied children. In Burundi, New Zealand is contributing $173,000 to a Caritas project which will assist with reintegration and housing for returnees.

New Zealand will also provide $112,000 for Corso's relief efforts to assist areas of Ethiopia where drought and flooding has lead to crop failure. ADRA will get $40,000 to help provide basic education facilities for Karen children living in refugee camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.

"These contributions, totalling over $1 million, reflect New Zealand's commitment to assist in humanitarian efforts and our recognition of the important work carried by non-government relief agencies in areas of great need," Mr Upton concluded.
