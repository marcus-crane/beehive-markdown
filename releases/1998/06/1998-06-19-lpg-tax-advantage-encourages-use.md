The Coalition Government continues to encourage the use of LPG through a significant tax advantage relative to petrol, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

Responding to claims by LPG supplier Rockgas Limited that the Government should remove the excise tax from LPG, Mr Bradford said the tax on LPG was currently just 10.4 cents per litre compared with 32.3 centres per litre on petrol.

"LPG is a premium fuel with a significant tax and pump price advantage over petrol," he said.

"The Government is fully supportive of sustainable, locally produced energy sources."
