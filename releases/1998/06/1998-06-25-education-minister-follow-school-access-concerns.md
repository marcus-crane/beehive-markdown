The Minister of Education plans to follow up concerns about student access to schools in central Auckland during a visit to the area next month.

Issues about student access to schools on the Auckland Isthmus have been raised by Epsom MP Christine Fletcher during discussion about the Education Legislation Amendment Bill.

"The Bill has been through full select committee process and has been reported back to the House. Despite that, some concerns remain. Therefore before proceeding with the committee stages I will go to the area where these concerns arise to make sure they are being properly  
addressed," Mr Creech said.

Mr Creech will visit Auckland in mid July to talk to people from the Epsom area about how their concerns about the provision of schools in the area are best answered.

"I am going to listen and to hear. I want to get a really good picture of the situation in Auckland and find the best way forward. It is important to establish exactly what the issues are before the legislation is passed.

"I hope that meeting a wide range of locals will help resolve what has been a long standing problem for people in central Auckland," Mr Creech said.

Epsom MP Christine Fletcher is to arrange a meeting in Auckland where the issues can be discussed.
