Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today that special meetings being held in Geneva and Vienna will provide another opportunity for the international community to express its condemnation of nuclear testing by India and Pakistan.

"New Zealand and Australia called for a special session of the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to address the situation as a matter of urgency. I am pleased that agreement has been reached to enable this important meeting to be held today. New Zealand's Disarmament Ambassador will be making a strong statement condemning nuclear testing and calling on India and Pakistan to join international norms against nuclear proliferation. We hope a number of like-minded countries will join with us."

"There will also be a special meeting today in Vienna of the states parties of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). New Zealand has supported calls for an early meeting, and we hope that it will result in a clear declaration by Treaty members against nuclear testing by Pakistan and India. Our Permanent Representative will be working with other countries for this result," Mr Upton concluded.
