Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today called for easier access to the New Zealand health system for suitably-qualified overseas doctors.

"I believe that where doctors can show they have been properly trained and practised overseas, in countries such as North America or those belonging to the European Union, then they ought to be able to practise in New Zealand with as few bureaucratic barriers as possible," said Mr Delamere.

"After all, the health system is intended to help New Zealanders, not provide a comfortable lifestyle for medical specialists who keep a tight control over entry to their professions.

"I fully accept the argument that medical qualifications and experience must be checked very carefully, in order to enhance the safety of New Zealand patients.

"But I repeat - properly qualified and experienced doctors should be able to work in this country as soon as possible after they apply for registration, so that affordable and excellent health care can be delivered to New Zealanders," said Mr Delamere.
