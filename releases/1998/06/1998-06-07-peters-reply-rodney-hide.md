ACT Party  
Parliament Buildings  
WELLINGTON

Dear Rodney

I'm enclosing a copy of my press statement of this evening in response to your statement, undated, which I assume was put out over the weekend.

If you read my press statement carefully, you will see why you are getting a reputation as Parliament's heaviest lightweight.

In addition, I would advise ACT not to continue to engage in one of their most obvious practices - deceit.

1\. I did not meet financial institutions secretly in New York last week.  
2\. There was not a flurry of meetings involving my Caucus and staff last Friday night.  
3\. I have never frequently said that "the ACT party has a good network of contacts in the financial community both here and overseas." What looney-tune contacts ACT has is its own business.

You know that those three statements in the first page of your letter are dishonest. So the question is, why do you persist in such behaviour, making silly, wet-behind-the-ears, naive political statements.

That said, the real purpose of this letter is to ask you to retract your silly letter, for if any international credit rating agency saw the interest calculation in the fourth paragraph of your letter, you being "Parliament's only professional economist", they might get a distorted picture of the intelligence of New Zealand Members of Parliament. Frankly it's one thing for you to embarrass your own party, it's quite something else to embarrass the rest of us Parliamentarians.

Withdraw your statement, there's a good chap.

Yours sincerely

RT HON WINSTON PETERS  
Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer
