Health Minister Bill English released figures today which showed more elective surgery was being done in New Zealand's public hospitals and waiting lists were dropping.

"More than 120,000 New Zealanders have had elective surgery in our public hospitals over the last year, an increase of four percent. This increase is welcome news and confirms that the extra money the Government has spent in this area through the Waiting Times Fund is having an impact.

"The Booking System for elective surgery is about better care and better service for patients. Implementation is now in full swing, with hospitals and doctors working hard around the country to get their systems in place. I have been advised that Booking Systems are now in place for 70 percent of services in our public hospitals.

"Doctors have told me that the Government needs to fund a credible level of elective surgery for the Booking System to work properly, and these latest figures prove the Government has taken this call seriously.

"I have said on a number of occasions that a reasonable level of elective surgery needs to be done in our public hospitals and I am keeping an open mind about the level of funding that will be required. I think it is likely that gaps will be found in certain areas as the Booking System is fully implemented.

"I will be getting regular reports on the implementation of the Booking System and will be making these public.

"The March waiting lists figures also show a drop, which is to be expected given the extra surgery being done. At 31 March 88,611 people were on waiting lists, compared to 91,253 at 30 June last year and the high of 94,328 at 30 June 1996.

"Waiting lists have never been a good measure of the need for elective surgery, because they don't tell us how long people have been waiting, what the levels of need are for surgery, and how much surgery is actually being done.

"However, this is now the second consecutive drop in waiting list numbers and it will prove to people that the Government is putting its dollars where its mouth is. The latest figures are at 31 March, which shows the drop is ahead of any moves to take people who fall below the clinically acceptable thresholds off the list.

"The Booking System is being put in place so that patients get the best deal possible. People waiting for surgery have a right to know when to expect their surgery.

"This is simply a fairer way of dealing with people, because everyone is assessed according to criteria agreed by doctors, and it gives people who need surgery certainty about when they will get it. Better care and better service is what it's all about," he said.
