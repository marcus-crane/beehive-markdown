Treasurer Winston Peters said today that the future of ENZA was in the hands of the growers and they should make their views known to the Board in time for the 15 November deadline, by which time Producer Boards must furnish Government with their plans.

"As I said to the growers in Hawkes Bay yesterday, each Producer Board's plan will be judged on their individual merits and on what is in the best long-term interests of their members and, where possible, individual producers will be given a direct say in the future of their Board.

"As I also said to the growers, if every single grower in New Zealand wants to support ENZA then it will, in effect, keep its virtual monopoly.

"The ball is in ENZA's court. If they retain the support of growers, there is no reason why they can not remain competitive. It is up to them to perform up to growers expectations," Mr Peters said.
