New Zealand is continuing to call for a major overhaul of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Labour Minister Max Bradford said today.

Speaking from Geneva where he is attending the 86th session of the ILO, Mr Bradford said the change in ILO Director-General offered a unique  
opportunity for the ILO to face up to the 21st Century.

"New Zealand supports the underlying core principles of the ILO and many of its conventions," he said.

"But we believe there should be a complete overhaul to bring the ILO into line with modern industrial relations practices.

"We are also calling for reform of the ILO's management structures so they are more focused on outcomes, and that we should be ensuring States that cannot meet the standards are assisted by way of technical programmes."
