Acting Minister of Agriculture, Hon John Luxton said that he had today received the formal application for an extension to the Governments drought relief package beyond the 30 June this year.

Mr Luxton said that he had briefed Cabinet today of how the existing support package had been used to date.

Today he said, " Droughts are a frustrating and energy sapping experience for farmers. It is important that they get support from the rest of the community but also from Government in an appropriate way.

"The Government has agreed in principle to extend funding into the next financial year. However as we have only received the application from Federated Farmers this morning we have yet to work through the proposal in detail."

A further announcement is expected once this had been done the Minister said.
