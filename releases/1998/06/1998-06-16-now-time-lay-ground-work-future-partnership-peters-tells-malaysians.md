Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters told an investment seminar in Kuala Lumpur today that the high calibre of New Zealand representation clearly signaled his country's commitment to expand its link with Malaysia, and underscored the value that New Zealand placed on those links.

"It is not the way of my country to abandon friends when the going gets tough," Mr Peters told those present, who included Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anwar Ibrahim.

"We are in a region of crisis and together we can work our way out of it by helping each other, relying upon each other and broadening that co-operation throughout our region."

Mr Peters said difficulties often meant new opportunities and "we want to lay the ground work for future partnership."

"Tough times should be a catalyst for fresh initiatives and commitment," he said.

"That is why New Zealand is represented here today in strength by many of the most senior of our captains of industry, the Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as the Chairman of Asia 2000."

New Zealand was a long-standing and reliable partner for Malaysia, an innovative and successful country, Mr Peters told those present.
