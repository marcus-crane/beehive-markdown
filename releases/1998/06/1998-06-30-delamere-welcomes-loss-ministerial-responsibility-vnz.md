The Minister formerly in charge of Valuation New Zealand, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today welcomed the loss of that ministerial responsibility.

"The Government is constantly seeking new ways of reducing costs in the New Zealand economy and with the implementation of the Rating Valuations Act 1998 from today July 1, that goal continues to be achieved.

"With the evolution of VNZ into Quotable Value New Zealand, local authorities will see contestability introduced into the business of building and land valuations.

"I anticipate costs for local bodies dropping and ratepayers receiving the benefit of those cost reductions.

"I want to state publicly my thanks to the former chief executive of VNZ, Mr Rob Hutchison, for the work he put in over recent times preparing VNZ for this change.

"He instituted the changes without major staff upheavals and within time and budget. This was an excellent achievement and full credit must go to him and his team," said Mr Delamere.
