Health Minister Bill English said today a report which found that social, cultural and economic factors were the main determinants of health was not news to policy makers and reinforced the Government's strategies in a number of areas.

The report from the National Health Committee, The Social, Cultural and Economic Determinants of Health in New Zealand: Action to Improve Health, was released today.

"A number of initiatives are already in place to address the issues raised in the report, including:

Strengthening Families

- an employment and welfare strategy which is targeted to help all working age beneficiaries move from welfare to work
- free health care for under-sixes
- public health programmes for smoking and immunisation
- targeted health programmes for Maori and Pacific Islanders

"It is widely accepted that factors such as income, housing, employment, education, social cohesion and services such as sewerage, water, public transport and recreational facilities, have a general impact on health status.

"The committee makes a number of recommendations on actions for the Government to take to break down inequalities between groups in society. It also recommends more co-operation between health and other government agencies.

"I am pleased that many of the recommendations endorse action already being undertaken by the Government. However, the Ministry of Health and other relevant agencies will be looking at the recommendations in detail to see if there are areas where further improvements can be made.

"In particular, the Government is sponsoring a health conference in October, Action for Health and Independence. This working conference will bring together people from all parts of the sector to find practical, hands-on ways of improving the health of communities and families.

"I hope the conference will act as a catalyst for much more co-operation across the sector and give us ideas for directly improving how we fund health services and how we measure progress in improving people's health.

"Improving the health status of all New Zealanders lies at the core of the Government's public health goals. Across all areas of Government we want policies to enhance people's employment prospects, give people choices, and give people control over their own lives," said Mr English.

Background on specific Government initiatives to address issues raised in the report

Health

New Zealand is making good progress in a number of areas of public health. These include heart disease, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), road traffic injuries, alcohol-related harm, and cervical cancer. In other areas there is more work to do, specifically reducing our Maori SIDS rate, reducing infant mortality rates, increasing immunisation rates and reducing rates of youth suicide. Smokefree strategies are targeted at young people and Maori.

A National Child Health Strategy is being developed and will be released later this year to address ways of improving child health. Doctors visits and prescriptions are free for children under six. This policy was introduced to ensure that the cost of seeing a GP was not a barrier to any family needing care for their children.

Welfare

The Coalition Government believes the best form of welfare is work. Government has a responsibility to help people move back into the workforce so they can help themselves.

The Coalition Government's changes to the welfare system announced in the May Budget will provide a work-focused welfare system that offers people real help to get work and security for those who can't work.

The purpose of state income support is to fill the gap between jobs. It is transitional help, not a long term solution.

Strengthening Families is a significant work programme bringing together Health, Education and Social Welfare to address problems of fragmentation and poor co-ordination of services for families at risk. The formula is proving to work very successfully in communities around the country. Other government agencies, including Housing New Zealand, will be progressively added to local co-ordination groups.

The co-ordination of Health, Education and Social Welfare under Strengthening Families, means that the three departments are already working in close consultation on policy development.

The Family Start programme is intensive home visiting service targeted at high risk families with new born children. It is being trialed in four locations and a thorough evaluation will be done of the trial's success to determine future expansion to other areas.

Anyone receiving a main benefit, including pregnant women in receipt of a Sickness Benefit, may apply for supplementary assistance to help meet essential costs. Those on low incomes and not in receipt of a benefit, also have access to supplementary assistance to help meet essential costs.

Employment

The Government is fully aware of the importance of paid employment, and recent economic policy is aimed at getting the fundamentals right to promote a healthy economy. New jobs can only be created by the private sector if the economy is sound.

And in fact jobs are continually being created, though most media coverage goes to job losses. Latest figures (to March) show growth in manufacturing, retail, transport and storage jobs.

The employment strategy includes the one-stop shop (Work and Income Agency) to provide job search assistance and income support in one place, replacement of unemployment and sickness benefits with the community wage, development of the community work approach to sustaining employability and earning income, benefit reforms to remove disincentives for job search, and further child care support for people in work who have children.

Housing

The Coalition Government will spend a record $886M on housing assistance for low income and beneficiary households in 1998/99.

As at the end of March 1998, 311,070 households received the Accommodation Supplement, at an average payment of $48 per week. This includes 142,397 families renting from private landlords and 45,809 renting from Housing New Zealand.

The Accommodation Supplement is the main form of Government housing assistance provided to low income earners and beneficiaries. Eligible (low income or beneficiary) households of three or more in Auckland, for example, can receive an Accommodation Supplement payment of up to $150 per week. Depending on their individual circumstances, they might also be eligible to receive Special Benefit payments in addition to the Accommodation Supplement.

Housing New Zealand (the Government's landlord company) also owns 64,000 state houses throughout New Zealand. The company will provide additional properties in Auckland this year to help ease housing pressures.

Education

The Government has a range of initiatives to improve the school environment to better meet the needs of all students. These include School Improvement and Support Projects, Special Education 2000, Strengthening Families and the Family Start programme. The Government has set aside funds for innovative programmes to meet students at risk.

A Maori Education strategy is being developed to improve educational outcomes for Maori students.
