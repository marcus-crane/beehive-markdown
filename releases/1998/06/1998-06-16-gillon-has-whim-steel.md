Alliance MP Grant Gillon doesn't seem to know his own mind, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

"First he writes a letter predicting a typical female firefighter would be 'the huge butch with the massive mammaries'.

"Then he joined the caring, sharing, Alliance and had an attack of Political Correctness, with his views on women changing 180 degrees.

"Now he has done exactly the same flip-flop over his admiration for Fire Service Commission Chairman Roger Estall," Mr Elder said.

"In 1991, he wrote to Mr Estall expressing his complete support for him as a commissioner."

"I could not have picked a more worthwhile candidate and feel sure that your administrative ability coupled with your fire engineering experience will advance the New Zealand Fire Service immeasurably"

"Seven years later we find he has made another complete about-face, and has mounted a long campaign to attack the character of Mr Estall. A campaign that has failed miserably," Mr Elder said.

"The public has every right to ask what Mr Gillon really thinks, or if he really thinks. Already we have had the firefighters union thanking him in writing for asking parliamentary questions on its behalf.

"Mr Gillon should remember he is in Parliament to represent the public of New Zealand, not his mates in the union movement."
