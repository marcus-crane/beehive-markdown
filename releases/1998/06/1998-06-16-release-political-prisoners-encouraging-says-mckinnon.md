Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has welcomed media reports of the release of political prisoners in Nigeria as a positive signal of a renewed commitment by the new Nigerian leader, General Abdulsalam Abubakar.

"I hope this is a signal of a commitment by the Nigerian government to a return to democracy and to respect for human rights" Mr McKinnon said.

Among the prisoners released by the new Head of State is the former President of Nigeria, General Olusegun Obansanjo, who had been detained under General Abacha ?s administration for plotting to overthrow Abacha in 1995.

"The reports indicate that General Abubakar has ordered the immediate release of nine prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation in Nigeria and the successful completion of the transition to democracy programme", Mr McKinnon added. "This is encouraging news".

It is not yet clear from the reports whether the civilian candidate and presumed winner of the cancelled 1993 elections, Moshood Abiola and other political detainees will also be released.

"I hope General Abubakar will seize the opportunity afforded by the change in leadership to press ahead with the early restoration of civilian rule and the release of the remaining political prisoners."

Mr McKinnon is the Deputy Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG). CMAG was established at the 1995 CHOGM in Auckland to monitor the compliance of Commonwealth states with democratic principles.
