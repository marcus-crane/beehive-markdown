The Minister of Defence, Hon Max Bradford, visits China next week at the invitation of China's Minister of Defence, General Chi Haotian, who visited New Zealand earlier this year.

"The invitation is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the relationship between New Zealand and China," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford departs New Zealand early on Sunday morning (30 August), and arrives home on Saturday morning (5 September).

While in China, Mr Bradford will visit both Beijing and Shanghai. He will meet again with General Chi Haotian, visit several PRC defence establishments, including the Quingdao Naval Base (which the HMNZS Wellington and Endeavour will visit in October), and address the National Defence University.

Mr Bradford, who is also Minister of Immigration, will take the opportunity while in China to visit the New Zealand Immigration Service's office in Beijing.
