Education Minister Wyatt Creech today firmly rejected claims that the Government was cutting funding for students with special education needs and that students would not benefit from Special Education 2000.

"The claims to this effect are wrong. There have been no cuts to special education funding, in fact it is up significantly.

"We are putting up to $200 million more over three years in to give more support to students with special education needs and to pay for almost 600 extra teachers to help the students," Mr Creech said.

"School staffing adjustments are being made to spread the increased staff numbers fairly over all schools. In the past some schools were much more generously funded than others, that was not fair on the under-resourced schools. The unfairness is being corrected.

"All schools should find out their full situation before they react," Mr Creech said.

Wellington High School has claimed the Special Education 2000 decisions will mean the school will have to lay off two staff.

"My advice is that the school is likely to get extra staff once schools finalise the new arrangements for clustering to help support special education students.

"The Special Education 2000 changes are significant, and they improve the situation for students and teachers. They do involve a change of mindset from some."

Special Education 2000 includes guaranteed resourcing for students with high and very high special education needs, better support for students with speech and language difficulties, more and better support for students with severe behaviour problems, help for children before they reach school age, and extra funding through the Special Education Grant for every school.

"We are not 'dumping' students as some are claiming. We are reorganising and changing the system to help and benefit students," Mr Creech said.
