A campaign being run by the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is to receive funding from the Lottery Grants Board, Internal Affairs Minister and Board chairman Jack Elder said today.

Mr Elder will be presenting a cheque for $24,000 to RNZSPCA President Mrs Peg Loague at 3.30pm on Wednesday, 12 August, on the steps of Parliament. Reporters and photographers are invited to attend.

Mrs Loague will be accompanied by Vice President Andy Waters and two canine guests from the Society's Newtown shelter.

Mr Elder said the money was to support the Society's spay and neuter campaign for cats and dogs, which is of great significance in reducing the number of unwanted animals.

"I am sure many New Zealander's share the concerns of the Society at the large number of unwanted family pets that are put to death each year, and I am very pleased to be able to provide this money from my lottery discretionary fund to support the spaying and neutering programme," he said.
