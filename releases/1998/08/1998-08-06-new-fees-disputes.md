The Minister for Courts, Wyatt Creech today announced new fees for filing claims with the Disputes Tribunal.

The increased fees apply from 4 September 1998.

Applications for Tribunal hearings have increased by over 60 per cent in the last seven years and the number of claims filed is estimated to continue rising by 2000 each year. The Tribunal's jurisdiction has also been increased recently to $7,500 (or $12,000 with the agreement of all parties) giving consumers greater access to this type of justice.

The fee increase, which represents only 25 per cent recovery of costs from users, is to ensure that the quality of the service can be maintained against the increased demand and scope of claims heard, Mr Creech said.

As well as increasing the jurisdiction of claims before the Tribunal, new legislation recently passed also established the position of a Principal Disputes Tribunal Referee to enhance the Disputes Tribunal Service. The Referee, who will be legally trained, will be responsible for the administration of Tribunal Referees and working with Referees to ensure decisions are consistent and of high quality. The appointment is being funded in part by the increased fees.

Details of the new fees are attached to this Media Release.

ENDS

The Disputes Tribunal Amendments Rules 1998 to increase the fees payable by those who file claims in the Disputes Tribunal are expected to be notified in the Gazette on 6 August and come into force on 4 September.
