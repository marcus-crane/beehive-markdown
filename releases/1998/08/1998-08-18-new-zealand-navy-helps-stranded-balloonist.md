Defence Minister Max Bradford today congratulated the Royal New Zealand Navy on its rapid response and assistance to stranded balloonist Steve Fossett.

Mr Bradford said Mr Fossett was transferred from the yacht Atlanta to the Navy's tanker HMNZS Endeavour at 10:45 New Zealand time this morning.

"I'm told Mr Fossett considers himself to be a very lucky man to be alive, and is in remarkably good health considering his ordeal," Mr Bradford said.

"After a check up in the sick bay, Mr Fosset will stay onboard the Endeavour until it reaches Townsville late on Thursday. He will then be reunited with his support crew."

The Endeavour has also provided the Atlanta with fuel, and the yacht has now continued on its Pacific voyage.

Mr Bradford said the 12,300 tonne Endeavour, with 49 crew on board including a Navy medic, was sailing to Townsville to take part in a New Zealand-Australian Navy exercise when it was diverted to assist with the rescue mission.
