Genetically-modified foods will not be allowed to be sold in New Zealand unless they have passed rigorous assessments of safety on a case-by-case basis, Trade & Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Dr Smith was commenting after an experimental trial in the UK suggested that rats fed genetically-modified potatoes suffered slightly stunted growth and increased vulnerability to disease.

The results of the experimental trial in the UK are being further analysed in order to assess their real significance. Dr Smith said New Zealand authorities would take a close interest in seeing the data and examining it thoroughly.

"Since agriculture and horticulture first began, farmers and growers have sought to genetically improve their herds and crops through breeding programmes," Dr Smith said today.

"Now science has advanced to allow us to use more advanced forms of genetic development.

"Under our recently agreed joint standard with Australia established by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA), sales of genetically modified foods will be prohibited in New Zealand unless they have passed a rigorous assessment of safety.

"The ANZFA process will provide the highest level of safety assurance."
