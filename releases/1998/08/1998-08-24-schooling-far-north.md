The Minister of Education said today he would be closely examining the Education Review Office report into schooling in the Far North.

"I am aware of the issues and concerns about some schools in the Far North and the quality of education for some students.

"The Government is determined to remove the disparities in the provision of education, the Far North is one area where further work is needed to lift the quality of education.

"The Education Review Office report does identify many examples of excellence in schools and education provision in the Far North. Our challenge is to ensure that all schools can meet this test in the future."

Mr Creech said that what goes on inside the school gates is only part of the answer.

"We also have to make sure every child comes to school ready and willing to learn. The Government's Strengthening Families programme is just one example of how we can make families stronger and more supportive of their children's education."

Mr Creech said he would be consulting with his Ministry of Education officials about the contents of the report and the Education Review Office proposals.

The Government is already putting in place programmes to improve schooling in Mangere and Otara, and on the East Coast of the North Island.
