Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has welcomed the sale of the Auckland Yellow Bus Company, noting that Infrastructure Auckland has received an excellent price.

"Stagecoach is an excellent operator, as has been demonstrated in Wellington over recent years.

"This sale should allow Infrastructure Auckland to consider more new projects for funding.

"This is a 'win-win' situation for Aucklanders and reinforces recent signs that things are moving in Auckland in a very positive way," the Prime Minister concluded.
