Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today announced that he had released a report into the long running dispute over the management of the Tauranga Harbour fishery.

The report, prepared by Judge Peter Trapski, deals with the complex social, cultural and economic issues associated with commercial, recreational and customary fishing in the Tauranga Harbour.

In his report, Judge Trapski concludes that a way should be found to enable local people to be more directly involved in managing and enhancing the harbour and its fisheries. He suggests a local management group be established with the primary goal of enhancing the harbour environment to promote the growth of fish populations.

In commenting on the report, Mr Luxton said his initial impression was that the Judge ?s suggestions may provide a good basis for moving beyond the rather entrenched positions which the parties to this dispute appear to have adopted in recent years.

?However, I intend to consider Judge Trapski?s recommendations in more detail before deciding what action should be taken to resolve this dispute,? said Mr Luxton.

The Tauranga Harbour fishing dispute centres around commercial fishing activities in the harbour. Recreational and customary fishers have claimed that such activities are directly responsible for the depletion of fish stocks and that as a consequence, catch rates obtained by non-commercial fishers are unacceptably low.

The dispute has been in progress since 1992 when the Ministry released the findings of a survey of recreational fishing in the harbour, although concerns about commercial fishing in the harbour had previously been expressed at times in the mid- late 1980?s.

In February this year, the Minister of Fisheries appointed Judge Trapski to look into the dispute and develop a series of recommendations based on his findings as to how best to resolve what has been a high profile issue.
