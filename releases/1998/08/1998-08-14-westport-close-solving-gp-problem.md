Health Minister Bill English said today a package put together by local health agencies, with support from other groups, means Westport may be close to solving its GP shortage.

Mr English congratulated the Mayor of Westport and all those involved in finding a way to get more general practice services for the town.

"This is a good example of local people, who know what's needed, getting their heads together and solving the problem.

"It is clear that the town wants to attract skilled doctors and nurses - preferably some who may stay for a few years. The problem they faced was that most of the town's six GPs were either leaving or planning to do so.

"At a meeting this week in Westport, the first steps to putting a 'rescue' package together have been achieved. The package for prospective GPs includes good support from the community and colleagues, adequate time for study and leave, a reasonable salary and some help with accommodation.

"The new approach has the support of the community, the local hospital, the Health Funding Authority and the Ministry of Health.

"Strong community-based health services are vital for the West Coast and other areas around the country. Westport's approach and the package it is putting together will be of interest to other communities who face difficulties in attracting GPs to their area," said Mr English.
