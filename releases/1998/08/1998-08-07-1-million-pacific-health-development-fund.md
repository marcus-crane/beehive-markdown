Health Minister Bill English and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Don McKinnon announced today that $1 million had been allocated to a Pacific Providers Development Scheme, which will extend the business capacity of Pacific Island health providers.

"We are very pleased to announced that $1 million has been allocated for the 1998/99 year to a Pacific Providers Development Scheme. This will enable Pacific health providers to operate on an equal business footing with other providers," said the Ministers.

"Pacific peoples do not enjoy the same health status as other New Zealanders. We need to do something about that and this Scheme will provide the support that is needed to improve Pacific people's health," said Mr McKinnon.

Speaking to the Pasifika Medical Association and University of Auckland Medical School Children and Youth Conference in Auckland, Mr English said that a number of recommendations had been made from the conference last year.

"One of the recommendations emphasised at this conference last year was the importance of developing new leaders in Pacific health care, developing the skills of those already working in the field, increasing the numbers of Pacific health workers, and increasing the awareness of the importance of Pacific health issues.

"The Scheme will go a long way towards meeting these needs. It will increase the numbers and improve the business skills of people working in Pacific health care, promotion and prevention and will also greatly raise the profile of Pacific health issues throughout the entire health sector.

"In making this announcement I want to recognise the efforts of National MP Arthur Anae, who has pushed hard for this Scheme for Pacific peoples," said Mr English.
