The President of Ireland, Mrs Mary McAleese, is to visit New Zealand on 10 and 11 September, the Prime Minister announced today.

During her visit, the President will spend time in Auckland meeting members of the Irish community, representatives of the young people of New Zealand and civic and national leaders.

"I am very much looking forward to welcoming such a prominent woman political figure to New Zealand," Mrs Shipley said.

"Mrs McAleese's visit will also further cement the excellent family and cultural ties which exist between New Zealand and the Irish people.

"This visit comes at an important time when New Zealanders are very conscious of the challenges faced in Ireland as the process of peace and reconciliation seeks a permanent foothold.

"The President will be reassured of the strong support which New Zealand has traditionally given to this process and of those of goodwill on all sides who seek to promote it," she said.
