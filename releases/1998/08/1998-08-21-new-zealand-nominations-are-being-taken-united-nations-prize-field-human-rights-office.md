Foreign Minister Don McKinnon leaves on Sunday for the South Pacific Forum in Micronesia. Following the Forum he will make a bilateral visit to Namibia, attend the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in South Africa, and visit Australia for six-monthly Foreign Minister talks.

The NAM, formed in 1961, is a group of 113 largely developing nations whose leaders meet every three years with the aim of working collectively international policy goals. New Zealand obtained 'Guest' status in 1989 and will be attending a Summit for the fourth time.

Mr McKinnon said attending the Summit in Durban would offer a valuable opportunity to present the Government's view on major international issues during meetings with more than 80 Heads of Government and many other senior representatives.

"Attending the NAM offers New Zealand a chance to reinforce our commitment to using multilateral fora to solve global issues," Mr McKinnon said.

Key issues likely to be discussed in Durban include disarmament, reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council; globalisation and liberalisation of trade, and sustainable development.

Mr McKinnon's trip begins with the two-day South Pacific Forum, starting in Pohnpei on Monday. On his way back from Southern Africa he will stop over in Sydney on September 4 for talks with Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer.

The talks are likely to take a strategic focus on developments in the Asia/Pacific region and their impacts on New Zealand and Australia. The Asian crisis, developments in the Pacific, the Bougainville peace process and various bilateral issues will be among leading items on the agenda.

Mr McKinnon returns to New Zealand on Saturday 5th September.
