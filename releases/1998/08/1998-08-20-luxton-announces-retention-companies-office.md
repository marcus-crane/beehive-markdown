Commerce Minister, Hon John Luxton today announced that the Dunedin companies office would not be closed down, but would be retained.

A recent review considered options for the structure of the Companies Office and the Insolvency and Trustee Service, both operational units of the Business and Registries Branch, Ministry of Commerce.

Decisions have now been reached on the review, and core services in the Dunedin Companies Office and Insolvency Service will be maintained.

Mr Luxton said today, "I know there has been much interest in the future of the office locally. I have had representations from my three southern National colleagues, Bill English, Eric Roy and Gavin Herlihy.

"It is technology which is the key driver of change in these types of services as it allows customers to access the office without having to physically go there. However, following further examination of the relevant issues, the Dunedin office will now be retained," Mr Luxton said.

Companies Office  
The decision has been to retain the Companies Office registry in Dunedin until such time as there are alternative access arrangements for clients such as on-line document processing. The Companies Office currently provides immediate on-line searches of the companies register 24 hours a day. An on-line document registration service is being progressively introduced by the Companies Office. Company name reservation is currently available, and on-line incorporation is planned for the end of the year. When other registration processes are complete, clients will have full registration and search access to the Companies Office 24 hours a day, from any city or town.

Insolvency Service  
The Dunedin office will become a sub-office of Christchurch - the Otago-Southland region will continue to have sufficient ?front-line? staff to carry out field work, while their administrative duties will be centralised.

Approximately nine staff will be impacted by the changes in the Dunedin Office.
