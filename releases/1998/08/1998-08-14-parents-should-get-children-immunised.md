Health Minister Bill English said today the recent case of diphtheria highlighted the need for parents to get their children immunised.

"Parents should get their children immunised. I understand that some people do have objections in principle to immunisation, but the recent case of diphtheria in Auckland shows just how important immunisation is.

"This case shows we must not become complacent just because these diseases are not commonly seen. We simply cannot afford to let diseases like diphtheria back into the country.

"Children are at risk of serious illness and even death from the diseases they are immunised against - measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib). We must protect our children by increasing the level of immunisation coverage."

Mr English said he was concerned at the results of a study published in today's New Zealand Medical Journal, which indicated immunisation rates were dropping.

"This study shows that vaccination rates for the childhood vaccine DPTH3 (Diphtheria, Tetnus, Pertussis, Hib - 3rd dose) had increased to 91 percent by 1996, but then dropped to 87 percent in 1997. In addition, a 1996 North Health coverage survey published this month showed only 63 percent of children are full immunised by the age of two and the rate for Maori children is even lower at 45 percent.

"While these studies provide an indication of trends, they do raise doubts about whether we will meet the Ministry of Health's target of 95 percent coverage by the year 2000. Reaching this target is especially important for Maori and Pacific children, who are often the most vulnerable group to these diseases," said Mr English.
