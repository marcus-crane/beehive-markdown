Yet again Kiwi mums and dads are responding to the chance to purchase shares in a government business, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"Over 3,200 calls have been made to the 0800 2 CAPITAL number since the first advertisements for Capital Properties New Zealand were shown on Sunday," Mr Ryall said.

"Brokers have also reported keen interest in the share float of Capital Properties New Zealand.

"New Zealand now has a Government that is prepared to offer shares to the public rather than selling government businesses lock, stock and barrel to big companies and consortia. "The successful float of Auckland International Airport and the strong public interest in Capital Properties New Zealand clearly demonstrate that New Zealanders have a hunger for ownership.

"Compare that enthusiasm to the ongoing public resentment against the Labour government's sale of Telecom to two large American companies. Labour never gave the public a look in. The public will forever remember Labour for selling New Zealanders out."

Mr Ryall said Capital Properties New Zealand deserved consideration as an investment but prospective buyers should be aware that shares can go down as well as up.
