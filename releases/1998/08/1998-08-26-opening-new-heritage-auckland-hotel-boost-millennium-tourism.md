The opening of the Heritage Auckland Hotel was described as "a significant milestone in preparations for the Millennium programme of events" by Tourism Minister, Murray McCully today.

Mr McCully was speaking at the official opening of the Heritage Auckland Hotel, once the home of the old Farmers Department Store and a familiar Auckland landmark.

"Auckland tourism, and indeed New Zealand tourism, is poised to experience the most exciting period of growth and opportunity we are likely to see for some time. I am delighted that major hotel groups such as Dynasty are willing to invest in developing infrastructure to make the most of these opportunities", Mr McCully said.

"This new hotel, right on the doorstep of the America's Cup Village, will play an important part in ensuring the expectations of our visitors are fully met."
