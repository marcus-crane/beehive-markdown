Trade Minister Lockwood Smith is to present a Trade NZ Export Commendation Award to Auckland-based Glidepath Ltd tomorrow.

The company has won its latest Export Commendation Award for winning a contract to upgrade the baggage handling facility at Ansett's domestic terminal in Sydney, worth around $13 million. It has previously won awards for earning 90% of its revenue off-shore (1990) and for successful marketing in Malaysia, China, Cyprus, Bali, Japan, Turkey and Indonesia (1995).

Dr Smith will make the presentation at 3.00 pm, Friday 21 August, at Glidepath Ltd, 30 Cartright Road, Glen Eden, Auckland.

Dr Smith said today that Glidepath Ltd was an example of an innovative and technologically-advanced New Zealand exporter continuing to grow despite the present tough international trading environment.

"The company has won a well-deserved international reputation as a leading supplier to the specialist industry of airport baggage handling systems and associated industries," Dr Smith said.

"It originally supplied the inbound and outbound baggage conveyer systems for Auckland International Airport, after which it came to dominate the domestic market.

"Since then, it has exported to over 30 countries. It is another New Zealand export success story."

Dr Smith said the company was continuing to thrive despite the Asian Economic Crisis, winning the contract to supply Ansett's Domestic Terminal in Sydney and a $1 million contract to supply the new FedEx cargo handling facility in Sydney, while a major order for Athens Airport in Greece demonstrated that its global marketing strategy is paying dividends.

In 1972, owner and chairman Ken Stevens purchased Thompson Engineering Ltd. In 1983, the decision was made to change the company's name to Glidepath Ltd and focus on its baggage handling strengths. It now employs 63 staff in Australia and New Zealand, up from six at its inception.

The company highlights its People Plan, cost effective technology plan and long-term strategic relationships as keys to its continuing growth.
