The Minister for the Environment has released a technical paper on the design of a domestic emissions trading regime to promote further discussion on the development of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions policy. The paper discusses key design issues for a domestic emissions trading regime, should the Government decide to implement such a policy.

The paper has been developed by officials from the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Commerce and the Treasury. It covers technical issues and is a companion piece to the working paper on the design of a possible carbon charge released last year.

In May this year the New Zealand Government signed the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes legally binding greenhouse gas emissions targets for developed countries. New Zealand's target, subject to ratification of the Protocol, is to stabilise emissions of the six main greenhouse gases at 1990 levels, on average, during the period 2008-2012. The Protocol provides for net increases in carbon dioxide stored by (some) forests to contribute toward meeting countries targets.

Minister for the Environment, Hon Simon Upton, stated that "the Kyoto Protocol makes provision for international emissions trading, to help countries meet their targets. International trading will prove to be invaluable in helping New Zealand reduce the costs of meeting our international commitments. New Zealand has consistently sought a least-cost approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

"A domestic emissions trading regime is, potentially, a key element of that approach. Such a regime will need to be able to interface with international trading. This technical paper is an important contribution to underpin the policy discussion about how New Zealand might best meet its commitments."

Targets under the Kyoto Protocol cover emissions of the six main greenhouse gases:

\- carbon dioxide - which comes from burning fossil fuels and certain industrial processes  
\- methane - mainly from agricultural livestock and waste  
\- nitrous oxide - mainly from agriculture  
\- perfluorocarbons - mainly arising from aluminium smelting  
\- hydrofluorocarbons - mainly used as coolants, and as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances  
\- sulphur hexafluoride - an arc suppressant for electrical switchgear.

Copies of the technical paper are being circulated to people and organisations who have already indicated an interest in climate change policy, and are also available from the Ministry for the Environment, Publications, P O Box 10-362, Wellington, tel: 04 917 7500, or via publications@mfe.govt.nz. The paper will shortly be made available on the Ministry web site: www.mfe.govt.nz.
