The examination of schooling in the Taumaranui region is part of the Ministry of Education's normal day-to-day business of looking at how best to deliver education when school rolls are forecast to fall, Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"There is no general review of education going on. The Ministry of Education, as part of its ongoing work to prepare advice for Ministers, is looking at the best options of providing education in an enduring and viable way when there are lower student numbers."

Mr Creech said the work being done was part and parcel of what normally happened when it was clear that the number of students in a particular region was dropping significantly.

"Absolutely no decisions have been made about what the future provision of education might be. I have received no advice on any decisions on schooling in the Taumaranui region.

"A lot of water is to flow under the bridge yet. I urge the local community and the Ministry of Education to work closely together," Mr Creech said.

Since 1991 the number of primary school children in the district has fallen by 300, to 1,100 and could fall below 1000 in the next two years.
