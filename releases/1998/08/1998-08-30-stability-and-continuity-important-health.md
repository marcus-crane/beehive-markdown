Health Minister Bill English said today he was pleased to be able to continue his work in the health portfolio, particularly around child health and the forthcoming Hospital Plan.

"In the last few weeks I have had a significant amount of support from the sector to continue in the role. It is clear to me that the sector is looking for stability and continuity and I will be able to provide that.

"I am also pleased to have Georgina Te Heu Heu as a new Associate Minister. She has extensive experience in the sector and I am looking forward to sharing responsibility with her, particularly as I expect to be spending significant time in the role of Associate Treasurer," said Mr English.
