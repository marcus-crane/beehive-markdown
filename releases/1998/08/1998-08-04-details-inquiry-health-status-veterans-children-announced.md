An Advisory Committee has been set up to report to Government on the health status of children of Vietnam and Operation Grapple Veterans, Minister in Charge of War Pensions, Hon Roger Sowry, said today.

This formalises the announcement made by the Prime Minister in June. The Advisory Committee will be headed by Sir Paul Reeves.

"I am very pleased that such a well respected and able person as Sir Paul has agreed to head the team which Government has established to address the very serious concerns raised by veterans," Mr Sowry said.

The Committee is charged with determining whether exposure to defoliants during the Vietnam War or to nuclear radiation during the British atmospheric tests at Christmas and Malden Islands has been responsible for health problems experienced by veterans' children, and if so, to recommend to Government appropriate measures to assist those affected.

The Advisory Committee comprises:

Sir Paul Reeves Chair  
Lt Gen. Tony Birks, CB, OBE Chief of Defence Force, NZ Defence Force  
Margaret Faulkner, QSM War Pensions Manager, Department of Social Welfare  
Dr Colin Feek Chief Medical Adviser, Ministry of Health  
Patrick Helm Adviser, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet

The Terms of Reference for the Advisory Committee are available on request. The Committee is expected to complete its report to Government by the end of February 1999.
