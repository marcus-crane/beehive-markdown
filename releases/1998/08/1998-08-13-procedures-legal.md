The Prime Minister has firmly rejected any suggestion that there was some legal irregularity in the Cabinet's decision last night to proceed with the sale of the Crown's share in Wellington Airport.

"It is fully in accordance with the principles of Cabinet government for a decision to be taken at a meeting of less than the full complement of Ministers. These principles are described in the Cabinet Office Manual and the process that was followed last night was in accordance with the description in the manual," Mrs Shipley said.

"I took advice prior to last night's meeting and have had this advice confirmed today from both the Solicitor General and the Cabinet Secretary and their conclusion is that the procedures last night were absolutely correct.

"They advise that the Coalition Agreement does not override the principles of Cabinet government. It sets out a series of understandings between the parties at the time the Coalition and how the parties intended to apply them.

"Departure from the terms of the Coalition Agreement indicates no more than a political difference and certainly does not put at issue the integrity of the Cabinet decision-making process," Mrs Shipley concluded.
