The Wairarapa electorate has been stretched even further north with the release of new electorate boundaries, Wairarapa MP Wyatt Creech said today.

"The revised boundaries for our electorate takes the north of the electorate closer and closer to Hastings and Napier. I imagine this will come as some surprise to locals in Featherston and Masterton!

"The top of the electorate is closer to Hastings than Masterton is to Martinborough.

"Some electorates, such as ours in the Wairarapa are just getting larger and larger. This is what happens when the growing population gets divided up among just 60 constituent MPs.

"As the local MP I am looking forward to meeting and exploring the new part of my electorate to the north of Dannevirke."

The new larger electorate extends to the north east of Dannevirke, to north of Kairakau Beach, which is south of Waimarama. It extends along the east coast from Waipukurau and Waipawa.

"The enlarged size of the electorate will mean I will be dividing my time between a larger area and a larger number of people."

Mr Creech said the National Party had sought to get a name change for the electorate to reflect the diverse nature of the large electorate.

"We had wanted the electorate name to be changed to Wairarapa-Tararua to reflect the area that was covered."
