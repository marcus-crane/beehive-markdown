The Prime Minister Jenny Shipley tonight called on ACT and its Leader Richard Prebble to clarify two issues for New Zealanders in light of his recent statements.

Firstly, does Mr Prebble and his Party want to participate in the Government and if so, on what basis?

Mrs Shipley also called on Mr Prebble and ACT to provide details on ACT's proposed $1 billion in spending cuts, identifying which portfolio areas they will come from and what the social implications of those proposed cuts would be.
