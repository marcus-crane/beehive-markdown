The Government has announced the new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance rates for students  
and tertiary providers in the 1999 academic year.

"The Government is putting $155 million more into tertiary education over the next three years to implement the new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"1999 will be the first time every student in an approved course provided by a public or private tertiary provider will be funded.

"The new system of tertiary tuition allowances is simpler, more transparent and will see tertiary institutions respond much better to the needs of students. It is also a lot fairer.

"While some fees at some institutions may increase, those providers that currently have a lot of 'unfunded' students, and are growing, will gain significant new resources. This should keep the lid on their fees.

"I am announcing the new rates for the Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance for 1999 today - ahead of the Tertiary Review White Paper so tertiary education providers can complete their planning and fee setting in time for the new academic year.

"The decisions will give tertiary providers certainty about the funding for 1999 and help them plan for the next year."

No changes are proposed in 1999 to the basic funding category structure, to the Study Right policy, to resourcing for base infrastructural grants, or to the structure of subsidy levels for research.

Mr Creech said the White Paper, due out later this year, completes the package of tertiary education decisions.

Key features of the Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance:

$155 million more for tertiary students over the next three years. By the year 2000, every domestic student who chooses to embark on approved tertiary courses will get the same level of subsidy towards student tuition costs, regardless of where that student studies;

From the year 2000, all domestic students taking approved courses will be treated equally, whether at public institutions or private establishments.
