Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon, today commended the contribution made by New Zealanders who were part of the Joint International Observer Group which monitored the recent elections in Cambodia.

"The Joint International Observer Group (JIOG), coordinated by the United Nations, concluded that the outcome of the election was broadly representative of the will of the Cambodian people," Mr McKinnon said.

"The election marks an important step towards a return to political stability in Cambodia. It is now up to the political leaders in Cambodia to negotiate to form a new government in accord with the election results. Cambodia needs a legitimate and stable government, it needs an efficient administration and a return to the rule of law, and it needs economic development. The election opens the way for progress in these areas."

The preliminary results of the election in Cambodia indicate that Prime Minister Hun Sen's CPP party gained the most seats, ahead of Prince Ranariddh?s Funcinpec party and the Sam Rainsy party, but insufficient to form a government on its own.

"The New Zealand observers have told me that the election process was not perfect, and there were complaints about irregularities which are being investigated. However there had been a high voter turnout and a relatively open campaign," Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealand will continue to extend support to the Cambodian people and looks forward to working cooperatively with the new Government of Cambodia".
