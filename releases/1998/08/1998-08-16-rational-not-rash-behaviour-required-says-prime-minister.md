The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jenny Shipley said tonight the current political situation will be resolved in an orderly fashion.

"Rash, reckless behaviour has no place in good Government. New Zealanders have been subjected to too much of this lately. Leaders of all political parties, including ACT leader Richard Prebble, can best help our country by allowing due process to take its course.

"Currently, New Zealand still has the same minority Coalition Government which won the confidence of Parliament in a vote last week. There is no need to repeat that vote at this time."

The Prime Minister clarified that she has invited existing New Zealand First ministers to retain their Ministerial Warrants until the Coalition Dispute Committee process has been completed, subject to their giving an undertaking that during this period they will fulfil their ministerial obligations consistent with the requirements set out in the Cabinet Office Manual.

"No undertakings have been given beyond that point," Mrs Shipley said.

"All other options and arrangements must wait until the Coalition dispute process is completed, and the future of the relationship between National and New Zealand First is clarified. Then and only then can new understandings be considered.

The Prime Minister says she expects the Coalition dispute process to begin this week and to be carried out on the same basis as the Coalition talks - in good faith and in private.

"National remains the largest party in Parliament, and remains willing to work with like-minded people in order to secure economic and political stability.

"It is the actions of politicians more interested in personal politics than the future of New Zealand that have created the current situation. National is determined to put the interests of New Zealanders first, by providing sound, stable management and strong leadership.

"This country has had a minority Government before, as it has now, and has seen that deliver stability and responsible management.

"The international economic climate remains uncertain, and the flow-on effect on the New Zealand economy may yet worsen. In these circumstances I am sure no New Zealander wants to see irresponsible headline-seeking behaviour undermine our common interests as a nation. I recommend that all political leaders temper their remarks and think carefully about their role in maintaining stability at this time," the Prime Minister concluded.
