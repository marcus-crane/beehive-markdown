Foreign Minister Don McKinnon is seeking further reports from New York on Iraq's decision to stop cooperating with United Nations weapons inspectors.

"Iraq's decision to freeze cooperation is a serious and backward step which challenges the authority of the UN," Mr McKinnon said today prior to departing for Melanesia and Micronesia.

"We are entering a tense time, but the international community needs to stand firm in support of UN objectives."

One of the key UN obligations for Iraq is that it give a full account of its weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) weapons inspectors have been trying for the last seven years to get to the bottom of Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.

"Once again Iraq is frustrating UNSCOM's work," he said.

"The UN inspectors have faced endless obstructions and continually found evidence which clearly challenges Iraq's claims of a clean bill of health on its weapons programmes particularly its lethal biological weapons stocks."

Mr McKinnon said sanctions and the presence of the Multinational Coalition in the Gulf have been required to pressure Iraq into meeting its international obligations, as set out in a number of Security Council resolutions.

"The sanctions must remain in place until the Security Council is satisfied that Iraq has met its UN obligations. The solution to lifting of sanctions is in Iraq's hands."

New Zealand currently has 12 Defence Force personnel in Baghdad serving with UNSCOM.
