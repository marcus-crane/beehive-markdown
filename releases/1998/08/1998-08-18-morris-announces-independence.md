Deborah Morris has today resigned from New Zealand First to become an independent Member of Parliament. Her resignation was given to New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters and President, Doug Woolerton MP this morning. She has also informed the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jenny Shipley.

Deborah Morris said, "I have not taken this decision lightly. However, I do not wish to be a party to a lengthy disputes resolution process between the two Coalition parties. The uncertainty created by the current hiatus is not in the best interests of the New Zealand."

"I have consistently done my best as a New Zealand First MP and the Minister of Youth Affairs. However, I have found the constant sense of crisis that surrounds the New Zealand First Caucus and the Coalition Government to be time wasting and destructive.

"I campaigned for electoral reform since 1992 so I am disappointed by the current situation. I remain committed to MMP as an electoral system that can deliver a representative Parliament and I believe MMP has delivered many good things.

"New Zealand First has achieved a number of policy successes while in Government. However, the lack of discipline, cohesion and strategy has caused me constant frustration.

"Having committed four years to his party, I have great admiration for the determination of Winston Peters. I will always be grateful for the confidence placed in me by New Zealand First and I intend to remain true to the ideals that I brought into Parliament.

"A National-led Government will continue to receive my support on confidence and supply measures, however other votes in Parliament will be decided on a case by case basis," Deborah Morris said.

Ms Morris has ruled out joining the National party.
