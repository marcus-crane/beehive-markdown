Minister of Consumer Affairs, Hon Robyn McDonald said today she supports the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters' review of competition in the telecommunications industry, including the Kiwi Share arrangement:

"While Telecom has improved its performance to customers over the last year in terms of service delivery, I share the Treasurer's concerns over the company's practice of raising its service charges by the maximum amount allowed under the Kiwi Share.

"As Mr Peters' says we shouldn't be afraid to review the Kiwi Share as it only exists because we haven't got the regulatory framework right. The Kiwi Share han't been reviewed since its inception in 1990 and it's time to examine it's effectiveness," the Minister said.

The Minister said she was ready to work with Parliamentary colleagues to complete the review process which was focussed on delivering the best possible outcome for the New Zealand consumer.
