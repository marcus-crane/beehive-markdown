Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she had accepted the resignations of Brian Donnelly and Robyn McDonald from their portfolios and from the Executive, effective from 1pm today, and had advised the Governor-General accordingly.

"Mr Donnelly and Mrs McDonald have made a positive contribution to the Executive and Coalition Government over the last 20 months," Mrs Shipley said.

Until his resignation, Mr Donnelly was the Minister responsible for the Education Review Office, Associate Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs. Mrs McDonald was Minister for Senior Citizens and Consumer Affairs.

The Prime Minister said for reasons of stability and portfolio management, she has asked the four former New Zealand First Ministers - Tau Henare, Peter McCardle, Jack Elder and Tuariki John Delamere - to remain in their portfolios until she announces the new Cabinet. This is expected to be no later than Sunday 30th August.

"I have given no undertakings regarding Cabinet appointments at this stage although positive discussions are well underway about the new Government's future direction and the composition of the new Cabinet," the Prime Minister concluded.
