The Attorney-General, Minister of Justice and Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, announced today that he would not be standing for election at the next general election.

Mr Graham said he been privileged to have been an MP since 1984 and a Minister of the Crown since 1990.

'I have reached the conclusion that I have made such contribution as I could and it is time to stand aside,' he said.

Mr Graham said that he was pleased that amongst legislation for which he had responsibility, a number of valuable reforms had been put in place.

These include reforms to criminal law including the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, the introduction of compulsory DNA testing for convicted criminals, measures to restrict gang activity including the greater use of interception warrants and for the removal of gang fortifications and laws against stalking.

Other areas of law addressed include electoral reforms, the citizens initiated referenda procedures, human rights, privacy, protection for victims of domestic violence and the company law reform package.

'As Minister of Justice, I hope that these reforms will prove to be beneficial to all New Zealanders,' Mr Graham said.

As Minister of Cultural Affairs from 1990 to 1996, Mr Graham said he was pleased the restructuring of the Arts Council was completed and he gained enormous satisfaction in obtaining Government approval for the completion of Te Papa, the Museum of New Zealand.

'Perhaps the most challenging area has been to play a role in the settlement of Treaty grievances,' Mr Graham said.

'The issues are complex, controversial and challenging.

'I like to think that we are now making good progress to recognise injustices where they have occurred and to encourage a reconciliation between Maori and non-Maori.

'While the negotiations have been exhausting, the settlements reached to date place New Zealand in the forefront of the healing process between indigenous people and the colonists who came amongst them with all the problems that followed.'

Mr Graham said he was uncertain what the future would hold, but he hoped there would be opportunities to contribute further outside political life.
