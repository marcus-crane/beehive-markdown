Contact Energy Ltd Minister Lockwood Smith says he's proud to be associated with the first company to provide competition in the retail electricity market.

"Contact Energy Ltd will go down in history with Ansett New Zealand, Clear Communications and Bell South as a pioneer in its industry, introducing competition to reduce prices and improve services for consumers," Dr Smith said.

"I'm proud to be associated with a company showing such innovation, and taking advantage of the new opportunities provided by the Government's electricity reforms."

Dr Smith said he was confident Contact Energy Ltd's plans will lead to lower electricity bills for Aucklanders, and eventually for all New Zealanders.

"I welcome this initiative to reduce costs for families and businesses."

Dr Smith was commenting after Contact Energy Ltd announcement this afternoon that it is entering the Auckland retail electricity market.

He was fully briefed on the company's plans yesterday and, as the minister responsible, supports them wholeheartedly.
