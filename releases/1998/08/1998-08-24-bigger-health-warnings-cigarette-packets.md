The Government today announced it's toughening up the health warnings on cigarette packets, making them bigger and more specific.

The new health warnings should be in shops by mid to late next year.

Tobacco products will be required to display, in rotation, the following health messages:

- Smoking kills
- Smoking is addictive
- Smoking causes heart disease
- Smoking when pregnant harms your baby
- Smoking causes lung cancer
- Your smoking can harm others

These messages will take up not less than 25 percent of the front of packets of tobacco products.

Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said it was important that smokers were fully aware of the effects of tobacco, which led to the deaths of 4500 New Zealanders each year.

"The larger, more forceful health warnings will better inform the public of the terrible health effects of smoking. As well as the warnings on the front of packs, more detailed information about how smoking kills will be displayed on the back - for example, how smoking is addictive and causes lung cancer, how smoking when pregnant harms the baby and so on."

"I hope the visibility of the new warnings will spark debate about smoking, and provide a catalyst for some people to give up."

A health message in Maori - Ka mate koe i te kai hikareti (smoking kills) - would be displayed on the front and back of packets.

"Maori smoking rates are particularly frightening - one in two Maori smokes meaning that, if they continue, a quarter of all Maori will die from a smoking related illness.

"By including a health warning in Maori, the Government is signalling its recognition of just how serious a threat smoking is to the health of Maori."

Mr Delamere said he was not suggesting that stronger health warnings were the complete answer to the smoking problem in New Zealand.

"It is internationally accepted that the best tobacco control programmes use a number of strategies to discourage smoking. The stronger health warnings will work with other strategies currently in place in New Zealand to reduce the number of New Zealanders who smoke."

In addition, tobacco products will be required to display:

- increased information about tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (CO) on one side of the pack (cigarette packs only)
- the telephone number of the Health Funding Authority?s planned manned quitline that smokers can ring for help and advice on quitting. The new warnings, and other information will be in black writing on a white, black-bordered background, making the messages striking and noticeable.
