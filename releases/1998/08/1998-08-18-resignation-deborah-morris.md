The Prime Minister the Rt Hon Jenny Shipley said today that she had, with great regret, accepted the resignation of Deborah Morris from her portfolios and from the Executive, and had advised the Governor-General accordingly.

Until her resignation Ms Morris was the Minister of Youth Affairs, and Associate Minister of Women's Affairs, Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance and Environment.

Mrs Shipley said she was pleased that Ms Morris had clearly indicated her intention to support a National-led Government on confidence and supply measures.

"That decision is very helpful to the stability of this country at this time.

"Deborah Morris has been a very talented young Minister, and I'm sorry that she has decided to step down, but I accept and respect her decision," Mrs Shipley said.

The Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Hon Tony Ryall, will be the acting Minister of Youth Affairs.
