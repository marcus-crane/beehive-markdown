Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced the new National-led Minority Government Cabinet saying that she had sought to balance political stability, experience and innovation.

"This line-up takes into account the overwhelming need for political stability at a time when the international economic environment is extremely uncertain.

"I believe that the recent resurgence in business confidence and the need to be able to capitalise on the lower exchange rate and falling interest rates provides New Zealand with a genuine opportunity to experience an economic recovery in very difficult circumstances. But we must maintain political stability.

"In putting together this Cabinet, I sought to balance my medium-term goals for a smaller inner Cabinet, with my need to address the issue of succession. I have also introduced a new approach to how the Executive Government and the State Sector puts policies into practice by introducing six teams of Ministers, which will ensure the Government listens to New Zealanders and delivers them results."

These six teams are:

The Economic Team, led by the Rt Hon Bill Birch as Treasurer and Minister of Finance, will focus on developing programmes and policies that will encourage and sustain prosperity and growth for all New Zealanders, in particular focussing on measures that will help manage the economic recovery.

The Enterprise and Innovation Team, led by the Hon Max Bradford, Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, will focus on what we can do as a Government, as communities and as individuals to leverage off our current strong economic foundations, and position ourselves well for the next century.

This team will have responsibility for exploring the full potential of the Foresight Project. It will oversee the recommissioning of the Porter Project that was undertaken in New Zealand in the early 90s. It will also provide an opportunity for the Ministers to consider what other features of our economic framework or priorities and initiatives could be undertaken that could  
make a genuine difference to the future prospects of New Zealand.

The Social Policy Team, will be led by the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income. A feature of the work of this team will be the cross-sectoral input by Government departments, both in policy design and effective purchase and delivery of services. It is Government's intention to design and develop strategic result areas which Ministers  
and their respective departments will work towards achieving.

The Justice and Security Team, will be led by the Hon Tony Ryall, Associate Minister of Justice, assisted by Rt Hon Doug Graham, Minister of Justice, and will focus on issues to do with breaking cycles to encourage people who are currently in social crisis to reconnect with society.

The New Zealand 2000 Team, will be led by Hon Murray McCully and will work to firmly establish 1999 as "Our Year", while also making sure that New Zealand makes the most of the tourism, trade and media opportunities that will present themselves in the lead up to the Year 2000 and beyond.

The APEC Team, lead by the Prime Minister will work to manage New Zealand's interest in, and responsibility to chair APEC in 1999.

"I will be working with all the Ministers to ensure that we set goals in each portfolio area and keep on track towards reaching those goals," Mrs Shipley said. "It is my expectation that these teams will help us to better coordinate, manage and promote the Government's overall package and message. It is my task as leader to create the frame, and the role of Ministers to fill in the parts of the picture for which they are responsible."

Mrs Shipley said the new Cabinet line-up, which follows the dissolution of the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First on Wednesday, 26 August 1998, draws to the fore the strengths of the National team while also retaining the experience and knowledge of former New Zealand First Ministers, in the interests of political stability.

"We have a programme to deliver that is important for the future of this country. We now have the team in place that can and will meet that challenge," the Prime Minister concluded.
