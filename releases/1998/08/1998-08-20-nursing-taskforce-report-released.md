Health Minister Bill English said today the launch of the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing was an important first step in nurses achieving a wider role in health services.

"The Taskforce members have put a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm into preparing this report and I commend their efforts. This Taskforce was the first major review of nursing in New Zealand in 15 years and the report reflects the range of issues which needed to be looked at.

"I support nurses being able to play a wider role in providing health services. Better care and better service for New Zealanders is about tapping into the huge potential for nurses to work in different ways.

"The Taskforce was set up to investigate barriers to change and advise on what steps the Government can take to assist in making those changes. Its recommendations include the need for:

- an over-arching framework for occupational registration within the health professions
- competency-based certificates for nursing practice that are enforceable
- proposals to extend the scope of practice that will be considered for nurse prescribing
- encouraging more effective use of nurses, particularly in primary care
- recognition of the need for collaboration among all health professionals.

"The Government accepts the broad objectives the Taskforce has laid out and is satisfied the Taskforce went through a thorough process in preparing this report, including wide consultation within the sector.

"There are, however, some differences of opinion within nursing about the report. In particular, the New Zealand Nurses Organisation has stated that it does not support the Taskforce's recommendations.

"There are more than 40,000 registered nurses in New Zealand who will be looking for united direction and leadership. Nursing will only make progress if it is united and I am keen to discuss with the NZNO how we can bring nursing together behind a plan of action.

"In the meantime I have asked the Ministry of Health to advise me on what specific tasks are the responsibility of Government so we can begin the process of implementing the recommendations. Some of the recommendations will be achieved through proposed changes to occupational registration and the Nurses Act and this work is underway within the Ministry," said Mr English.
