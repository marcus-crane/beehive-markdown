The Minister of Commerce, Hon John Luxton, announced today that he was inviting students studying Form 7 Economics to participate in an essay competition which is related to New Zealand's international competitiveness.

The topic of the essay is:

"Explain how New Zealand can increase employment, growth and wealth for New Zealanders by improving its international competitiveness."

Mr Luxton said today, "Capital, people and technology can move in and out of the country at any time. Once gone, so too will the wealth created, the jobs, and the taxes that pay for our social and environmental goals.

"It is therefore important that we create in NZ an economy that provides a world-best environment for doing business.

"Today's students are tomorrows leaders. I hope that this essay will stimulate discussion and understanding of our changing economic world. " the Minister said.

This essay competition is being organised on behalf of the Minister by the Ministry of Commerce, in co-operation with Enterprise New Zealand Trust.

Three students earning the top marks will receive an award of $250 each, with an additional $250 given to each prize winner's school.

These three students will then be invited to Wellington, where they will make a presentation to a panel to explain and expand on their suggestions outlined in the winning essay. The winner of this part of the competition will be announced at a reception on 2 November 1998 for delegates and others to mark the opening of the Junior Achievement International Asia Pacific Rim Regional Conference. The winner will receive an award of $500 to be presented by the Minister of Commerce.

The three finalists will be provided with return airfares and overnight accommodation in Wellington.
