The Prime Minister, by Command of Her Majesty The Queen, has announced that, as a mark of respect to acknowledge the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, all New Zealand flags are to be flown half-mast on Monday 31 August 1998.

Background:

Her Majesty The Queen, on 24 July 1998, issued instructions that flags on Royal Buildings in the United Kingdom (other than the Royal Standard) should be flown at half-mast on Monday 31 August. The British Prime Minister then extended this instruction to include all public buildings in the United Kingdom.

Her Majesty The Queen has left the decision of half-mastings of flags in each of her Realms to the Governor-General and Government concerned.

The Prime Minister approved the half-masting of the New Zealand flag on 14 August 1998.

These instructions will take effect in 1998 only.
