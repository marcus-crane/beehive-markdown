New Zealand nominations are being taken for the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade said today.

Candidates for the five-yearly prize would be people or organisations who had made outstanding contributions to the promotion and the protection of human rights, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the office said.

1998 is the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, former Irish President Mary Robinson noted it was fitting that the prize would be awarded in such a landmark year for human rights.

Previous prize winners include Eleanor Roosevelt, Rev Martin Luther King, Amnesty International, and Nelson Mandela.

Nominations for the prize can be made by countries, UN agencies, non-governmental organisations and other organisations and individuals with an interest in human rights issues. They should reach the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva by 15 August.

Nomination forms can be obtained from the website of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights: http://www.unhchr.ch.
