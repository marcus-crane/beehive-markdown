Tax Discussion Document on Self-assessment Released  
A discussion document outlining proposals for legislating for taxpayer self-assessment was released today by Treasurer and Revenue Minister Rt Hon Bill Birch.

"The proposals aim to bring the law up to date with actual practice in tax administration,"he said. "Taxpayers have been assessing their own tax liabilities for many years, by filing out their tax returns. But tax law still has the Commissioner of Inland Revenue making the assessment.

"The Government proposes to change the law to confirm that individual taxpayers, rather than the Commissioner, are responsible for assessing their tax liabilities.

The proposals are part of a package of modernisation measures that have been introduced into the tax system over recent years. The reforms include the introduction of binding rulings, new resolution procedures for tax disputes, new standards and penalties that clarify taxpayer responsibilities, and the progressive rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Ensuring that the law reflects the existing practice of self-assessment is one of the last stages of the reform process.

Mr Birch said the proposals also make the law on assessment consistent with other recent reforms, and clarify income tax law, particularly in the area of discretions, where they replace some discretions with more objective rules.

"Other proposals concern timing for refunds of excess tax, and amending income tax and GST returns. Their purpose is to make the dispute resolution process faster and more effective."

"The release of these proposals is part of the Government's commitment to a tax policy process that emphasises early consultation over major reforms. We invite submissions on these proposals, and look forward to receiving submissions from interested parties."

Submissions should be sent to the Self-assessment Project, Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, by 2 October.

The discussion document, Legislating for Self-assessment of Tax Liability, is available at Bennetts Government Bookshops.
