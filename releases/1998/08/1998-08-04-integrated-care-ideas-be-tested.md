Health Minister Bill English said today new ideas in health needed to be tested to make sure they achieved better care and better service.

Speaking at the launch of 10 integrated care demonstration projects, Mr English said there was a great deal of interest among health professionals in working with others to provide better services.

"The demonstration projects will show others the way. These 10 projects have been chosen because of their ability to provide information to test the benefits of integrated care on an on-going basis.

"While intuitively integrated care seems like a common sense way of improving care, we still need hard evidence to prove it. These 10 projects will be evaluated by the Health Funding Authority over the next few years." he said.

Mr English launched the demonstration projects at Age Concern in Christchurch, where the Elder Care project has brought together GPs, hospitals and Geriatricians to improve care for older people.

"These integrated care projects are about keeping a child out of hospital by having a nurse visit them at home or making sure an elderly person does not have to have unnecessary tests by ensuring the hospital don't repeat tests done by their GP. It is often the simple things that can make the biggest differences to people's lives.

"This approach to health services makes sense because it is about people working together to provide better care and better service for the patient. It is about organising services around the patient, rather than making the patient find their way from one service to another," he said.

"A year ago most integrated care projects were still in the planning stage. Now there are 33 actually up and running around the country.

"Integrated care is being talked about all over the world as a way of providing better care and better service. What we are doing in New Zealand is putting the ideas to the test and that is a milestone for health in this country," he said.

The demonstration projects chosen are ProCare Paediatric Asthma, North, West and Central Auckland; Waitakere Child and Youth Health, West Auckland; Elder Care, Canterbury; Cardiac Guidelines, Christchurch; South Med COPD, South Auckland; Kaipara Care, Kaipara; Tairawhiti Health (reproductive health), Gisborne; ProCare Mental Health, Auckland; Mangere Health Resources Trust and Comprehensive Health Services, South Auckland; and Integrated Child Health Services, Hamilton.
