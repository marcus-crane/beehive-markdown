Fifteen training and business grants to support private sector development in the Pacific Islands were announced today by Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Upton.

The grants, totalling NZ$464,650, come under the Pacific Islands Investment & Development Scheme (PIIDS), part of New Zealand's Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme. They cover private sector activities in eight countries.

"The development of a vigorous private sector is necessary to obtain a sustainable increase in living standards in the Pacific," Mr Upton said.

"With public sector budgets facing real constraints, the private sector has the capacity to generate sustainable economic growth in the Pacific region."

Mr Upton said PIIDS promoted more effective business and training links between the private sector in New Zealand and their counterparts in neighbouring South Pacific nations.

"The scheme is an innovative, forward-looking use of our ODA funding, and provides an opportunity for the New Zealand private sector be involved in assisting our neighbours to meet their own developmental needs," he said.

In the July bidding round, 30 proposals were submitted. Grants were allocated according to each proposal's development merit, commercial viability and the likely long-term economic and employment benefits for the recipient country. Proposals were assessed by a panel including development specialists, and New Zealand private sector representation.

Proposals for the next round of PIIDS grants should be sent to the Development Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade by 2 October, 1998.

List of grant recipients and background note attached.

The fifteen proposals cover activities in eight South Pacific countries:
