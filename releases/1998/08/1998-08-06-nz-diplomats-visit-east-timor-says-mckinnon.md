A team of New Zealand officials will visit East Timor from 7-12 August to assess the political situation and review New Zealand's aid programme there, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

"The delegation, which consists of New Zealand Embassy and aid programme staff, will meet with senior government and military representatives, non-governmental organisations and local East Timorese," Mr McKinnon said.

"Many New Zealanders are concerned about East Timor. It is important that the Government is well informed about the situation and is in direct contact with key players.

"The delegation will monitor the New Zealand aid programme's community and rural development projects in East Timor and will be pursuing our concerns about human rights there."

"This is a timely visit. There have been welcome and positive signs recently. Yesterday, Indonesia and Portugal met at the UN in New York to discuss Indonesia's proposal for special autonomy. These Tripartite talks made some encouraging progress and there has been agreement to involve the East Timorese parties themselves more closely in the search for a solution. More rounds of talks will be held in September and October, and we urge all involved to build on these steps and redouble efforts to reach a lasting settlement. Our delegation will reinforce this call during its visit to East Timor," Mr McKinnon concluded.
