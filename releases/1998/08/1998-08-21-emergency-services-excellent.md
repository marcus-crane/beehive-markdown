Health Minister Bill English said today New Zealand's emergency services were excellent and a health poll which showed only 55 percent of people were confident emergency services would be there if they needed them was disappointing.

"Our rescue services and public hospitals provide excellent emergency services and staff are incredibly dedicated. The doctors and nurses who work in emergency departments are treating people and saving lives every day and deserve much more recognition for that.

"Anyone who needs emergency health treatment in New Zealand gets it and people can be confident those services are there if they need them. Overseas visitors to our country often remark on the excellent treatment they get if they are unlucky enough to have a health emergency and I think we should be proud of the work that our hospital staff do.

"People do want certainty about their health services and the poll reflects that. Next month I will release the Hospitals Plan which will provide certainty and security about our public hospitals.

"Much of the uncertainty around services is driven by uncertainty over elective surgery. The Government is bringing in the Booking System which will ensure people are treated fairly and give them certainty about what elective services they will get and when," said Mr English.
