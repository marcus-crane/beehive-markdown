Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, announced today that the New Zealand First caucus had decided not to vote for the Private Member's Bill sponsored by Alliance MP, Phillida Bunkle, calling for the mandatory labelling of all genetically-modified foods.

This decision follows last week's announcement that Australian and New Zealand Health Ministers had decided at last week's Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council meeting that all foods produced using gene technology would be prohibited for sale unless they had been assessed as safe for human consumption.

"In addition, all foods containing genetically altered material that is not substantially equivalent to their conventional counterparts will have to be labelled as such.

"A final decision on labelling of GMF's that are substantially equivalent to their conventional counterparts has been delayed to December while we await developments in Europe and the United States.

"Caucus noted that, since anything up to 90% of foods could contain some genetically-modified material, the Bunkle Bill with its call for mandatory labelling of all GMF's would be impractical, unworkable and would impose significant compliance costs on food importers and manufacturers," said Mr Delamere.
