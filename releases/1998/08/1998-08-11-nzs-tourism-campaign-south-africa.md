Tourism and Sport Minister Murray McCully is predicting that the number of South African visitors will double inside three years, following today's launch of the NZ Tourism Board's campaign by the All Blacks.

The Minister described the use of the use of the All Blacks to launch New Zealand's tourism campaign in South Africa as "an important first, in using our foremost sporting icons to give us a beach head in a new market".

All Black manager Mike Banks led a party of ten, including Jonah Lomu, who flew from Durban to Johannesburg for the launch.

Mr McCully said over 14,000 South Africans visited New Zealand last year.

"There are a whole stack of reasons why we should be able to double those numbers over the next three years, " he said.

"There are now a significant number of South Africans living in New Zealand. And with the advent of the Super 12 rugby tournament, there are huge opportunities in the area of events tourism.

"Most importantly, our exchange rate has not moved as severely as the US dollar or the European currencies against the rand.

"So New Zealand is a very attractive destination for the foreseeable future.

"The use of the All Blacks has given New Zealand tourism a very high profile in South Africa, " said Mr McCully.

"The fact that the $100 million All Black brand has been made available free of charge is an extraordinary contribution to New Zealand by both the All Blacks and the NZRFU."
