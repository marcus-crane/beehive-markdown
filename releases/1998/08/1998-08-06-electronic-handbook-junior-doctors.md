Health Minister Bill English said a new electronic handbook to help junior doctors manage and investigate patients in emergency conditions was a perfect example of technology being used practically to help patients.

"In the past some hospitals have given junior doctors booklets they could refer to during an assessment of a patient. While useful, there were limitations on the amount of information a booklet could contain and on keeping it up-to-date.

"In contrast, the electronic notebook uses the internet as a channel to provide about 500 pages of information on the treatment of more than 40 conditions requiring acute care. Information in the handbook was drawn from the New Zealand Medical Council's list of indicative skills for the Intern Year.

"Patients will benefit through better and quicker decision-making by doctors, better communication, reduced adverse drug reactions and reduced ordering of unnecessary tests," he said.

Mr English visited Capital Coast Health today to view a demonstration of the handbook, which is one of the initiatives supported by the Ministry of Health as part of developing the Health Information Strategy for the Year 2000.

"The electronic handbooks show how technology, which most hospitals have or are about to get, can be used to promote high standards of practice. Using the internet is a relatively cheap and easy way to distribute information and means that information can be updated quickly. It's also two-way. Direct feedback from doctors means improvements can be ongoing and users get the information they really need on the job," said Mr English.
