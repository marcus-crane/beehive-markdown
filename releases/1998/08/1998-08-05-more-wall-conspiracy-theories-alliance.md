Health Minister Bill English said today the Alliance had proved yet again how ready it was to buy into off-the-wall conspiracy theories with its statement this week that Tauranga Hospital was being privatised.

"On Monday the Alliance claimed that Tauranga Hosptial would be turned over to a joint-venture company and privatised. That is, frankly, a load of nonsense and typical of the off-the-wall conspiracy theories that the Alliance likes.

"Tauranga GPs, through a company half owned by them and half owned by First Health Ltd, and the local hospital are interested in working more closely together to provide better care and better service for their community. If this project gets off the ground it will involve a mix of public and private providers working together and I have no problem with that in Tauranga or anywhere else in New Zealand where people think they can do a better job.

"The idea that it means the hospital is being privatised is ridiculous and could not be further from the truth.

"Most of the Alliance's claims appear to be based on the belief that this would be one of the projects chosen to test the benefits of a more integrated approach to health care. I announced these 10 projects yesterday and the Tauranga proposal was not one of them because it needs further work.

"I am keen to see further substantial negotiations between the Health Funding Authority and the Tauranga group. The two parties met yesterday to initiate this and have made a commitment to further talks," said Mr English.
