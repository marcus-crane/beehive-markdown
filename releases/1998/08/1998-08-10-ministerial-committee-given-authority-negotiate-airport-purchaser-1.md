Cabinet today discussed the Wellington International Airport and agreed that the Committee comprising the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, and the Finance Minister complete further work on proposals under negotiation and bring this matter to a conclusion.

"Cabinet expects to make a final decision on this matter one way or another on Wednesday. No further comment will be made pending a decision being announced," the three Ministers said.
