Former Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Don McKinnon said today that he was very sorry to lose the portfolio of Pacific Island Affairs.

Speaking from the Durban, where he is attending the Non-Aligned Movement Summit, Mr McKinnon said during the seven years he has held the portfolio he has always been warmly received by Pacific peoples throughout New Zealand.

"Pacific peoples add a rich cultural dimension to our society. However in health, employment, housing and education they face a growing number of challenges," Mr McKinnon said.

"The structural changes that have taken place in the Ministry over the last year will deliver a better service to the Pacific people than has ever been possible before."

"I wish Mr Delamere well in his new role and trust that as a Minister outside of Cabinet he will be able to invest the time that is needed to familiarise himself with the needs of New Zealand's Pacific community and ultimately advance their cause."
