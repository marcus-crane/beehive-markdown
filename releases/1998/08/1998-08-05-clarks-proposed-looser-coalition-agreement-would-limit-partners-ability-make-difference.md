Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters said that Labour's proposed "looser" coalition agreement with the Alliance would limit the degree of influence a coalition partner would be able to exert and, also, the degree to which they would be able to impose positive change on the same party that implemented a far right agenda under First Past the Post.

"A "looser" agreement is a recipe for disaster.

"The Coalition Agreement between National and New Zealand First contained detailed promises because that was the only way to ensure that a significant number of election promises and policies would be implemented. It was the only way we could be sure of making a difference.

"And it is the only way we have been able to pull New Zealand Politics towards the centre," Mr Peters said.

The Treasurer said any "looser" coalition agreement would enable the Labour Party to act as they did under First Past the Post and get out of making the changes that should be mandatory in an MMP political environment.

"As a late MMP supporter Mr Anderton should know that - and as a First Past the Post Supporter, Ms Clark should know that the public will not tolerate that sort of dominance under a new, more representative MMP political environment.
