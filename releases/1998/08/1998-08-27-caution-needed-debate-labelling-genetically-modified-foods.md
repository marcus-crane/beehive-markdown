Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today recent experience in Europe showed that great caution is needed while New Zealand debates whether labelling of genetically-modified foods should be compulsory.

He pointed to a report in The Times of London which says consumer groups there have described as a shambles a labelling scheme for GMF's, which is due to come into force across Europe next month.

Under the scheme, foods containing genetically-altered soya and maize will have to carry a logo. But foods containing oils, flavourings, modified starches and additives from genetically-altered crops will not have to be specially identified.

The Times report says genetically-modified soya, grown mainly in America, is by far the biggest source of GMF's, followed by tiny amounts of maize. Distributors in America refuse to separate genetically-changed crop from conventional varieties, claiming they are indistinguishable.

Mr Delamere said the European consumer reaction showed that the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council had acted wisely, when it recently put off till December a final decision on labelling of GMF's, pending a resolution of the issues in the major food markets of Europe and the USA.

"The European difficulties support my recent arguments in the House during the debate on Phillida Bunkle's GMF Bill that the issue is complex, not readily susceptible to simplistic solutions, and we ought not to rush into any ill-considered and unworkable legislation," said Mr Delamere.

He said he had written to Ms Bunkle, saying he had sympathy with her Bill's aim to provide consumers with full information about the makeup of the food they are buying. "In an ideal world I am certain this would be everyone's preference. However, I do not believe that the approach proposed in your Bill would achieve this aim."

"I look forward to Ms Bunkle's input on the issue when it is revisited by the Australia New Zealand Food Council in December this year," said Mr Delamere.
