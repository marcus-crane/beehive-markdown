"Martin Cooney's claim on TVNZ's Holmes show last night that my office was involved in a "conspiracy" to topple him is completely false. Mr Cooney has completely mis-represented the facts in a situation. This is not the first time this has happened," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"What happened was this. The PPTA approached my office asking my staff to confirm an account of an incident that occurred during the School Trustees Association conference in Nelson last year. My staff correctly refused to confirm anything. That was all. That is not a "conspiracy".

"I am very concerned about this sort of utterly unwarranted attack on my staff and the attempts from Mr Cooney to try to publicly draw my office into the internal PPTA dispute. My staff and I have vigorously kept out of it. The PPTA's problems have nothing to do with the Government.

"I have tried to have a constructive relationship with all groups in the education sector, including the PPTA," Mr Creech said. "The Government is trying hard to introduce policies that help teachers do their jobs well.

"We place real value on good teachers. Without quality teachers in our schools our young people won't get the quality education we are committed to delivering.

"Two years ago we increased secondary teachers' pay by an average of 13% with new starting rates of $29,000 per year rising to $47,100 at the top of the scale.

"The new pay offer currently being negotiated significantly increases pay rates yet again. The Government wants to increase the starting rate to $34,000 by the year 2000. The rate at the top of the pay scale would rise to $50,000 by the year 2000."
