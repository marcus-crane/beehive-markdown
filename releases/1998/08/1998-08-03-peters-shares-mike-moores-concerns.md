Treasurer Winston Peters said today he shared Christchurch MP Mike Moore's concerns that elderly victims of violent crimes were spending life savings to pay for hospital care, and said he will speak to the Prime Minister about the matter.

"I have read the news stories and they are truly alarming. Addressing the plight of these victims is a case of doing what is fair and right.

"While Income and Asset Testing for older people in long stay residential care in public hospitals and asset testing for those in long stay residential care in private hospitals will be removed from 1 October this year, there may be other ways in which elderly victims of crime can be helped with recovery care without paying out of their own pocket.

"I intend to raise this issue with the Prime Minister to see if a solution can be found. Mr Moore has raised a valid concern and the Government is duty bound to take a closer look at the issue," Mr Peters said.
