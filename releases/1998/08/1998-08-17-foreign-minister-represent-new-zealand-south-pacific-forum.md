Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced that Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon will represent New Zealand on her behalf at the South Pacific Forum Heads of Government Meeting, to be held in Pohnpei.

"With the current domestic political situation, it is unfortunately not possible for me to attend the Meeting this year," the Prime Minister said.

"I am very disappointed I will be unable to attend and meet with South Pacific leaders.

"However, New Zealand is lucky to have such an experienced Foreign Minister in Don McKinnon who will ably represent our country at the Forum," concluded Mrs Shipley.
