"The PPTA leadership's motives for refusing to negotiate pay issues must now be seriously questioned with the revelation it wants teachers to take industrial action over bulk funding," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"The PPTA's agenda has been exposed in a notice sent to schools setting out the recommendations teachers will vote on during their paid union meetings.

"The PPTA is seeking a mandate from teachers to take industrial action over something that is not even in the employment contract. It wants teachers to say they will walk off the job over bulk funding.

"The notice also claims the Government is refusing to negotiate. This is incorrect, we are ready and willing to negotiate on pay issues. But negotiating a pay increase for teachers is being frustrated by the PPTA leadership's insistence on negotiating Government policy."

Mr Creech said that teachers should know that the Government will listen and talk to the PPTA about the education policy issues raised.

"I have said many times that I am serious about alleviating workload pressures where they exist. The Government has already shown it is prepared to move in this regard.

"The PPTA is again going out to teachers to get a blank cheque for industrial action. They did this last year, and many teachers were forced to take strike action when they did not agree with it.

"I want to give all teachers a clear message that those tactics cut no ice with the Government.

"It is unfair on students for the PPTA leadership to even consider putting education on hold to protest at bulk funding - something that is not even part of the contract or part of the PPTA claim."

The Coalition Agreement sets out that the Government can review the direct resourcing formula to remove anomalies.

"As each day passes the PPTA leadership seems prepared to venture further into the political arena and into the domain of Government policy making. One week it is the Treaty of Waitangi, the next it is roading and electricity reforms, this week it is bulk funding.

"The PPTA leadership is well known for its ideological opposition to bulk funding. Parents and students should not tolerate the PPTA mixing their political agenda with the pay talk process," Mr Creech concluded.
