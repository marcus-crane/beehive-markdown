Five Russian vessels forfeited to the Crown in February will be returned to their Russian owners, Murmansk-based firm Karelrybflot, Minister of Fisheries John Luxton announced today.

Karelrybflot had chartered the ships to European firm Interkarel, who in turn had sub-chartered the vessels to Abel Fisheries Ltd (in receivership). Abel Fisheries were earlier this year convicted of 79 counts of quota fraud.

The vessels will be released to Karelrybflot within 30 days of the Minister ?s decision on payment of $NZ100,000 per vessel.

In making this decision the Minister considers Karelrybflot to have been the innocent owner of property at the centre of a series of illegal actions.

With respect to the crew remaining on the ships, Mr Luxton said he was satisfied their interests would be catered for.

?I draw some comfort from assurances from Karelrybflot?s New Zealand lawyers the crew will be paid in full within one month of their return to Murmansk,? Mr Luxton said.

?I have also been provided with material indicating payment has been made to 12 crew members who have already returned to Russia, as well as Settlement Deeds apparently signed by a total of 32 of the crew in respect to their claims for wages and allowances.

?I would also note I have recently received a letter from the Russian Ambassador which has provided me with further assurances with regards to payment of the crew? wages.?

Mr Luxton said his decision had also been made in recognition continued delays in determining the fate of the vessels would further add to the current $12,000 per week it was costing the New Zealand taxpayer while the ships remained the property of the Crown.

The vessels involved are the Om, Osha, Orlovka, Olenino and Ognevka.
