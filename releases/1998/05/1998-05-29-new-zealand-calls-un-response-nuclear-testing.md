Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today that since news broke of Pakistan's nuclear tests, New Zealand missions have been active in United Nations organisations in seeking to increase international pressure against nuclear testing.

"In international meetings and in bilateral representations, we are strongly urging both Pakistan and India to end their nuclear weapons programmes and adhere unconditionally to the CTBT and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."

"In Geneva, our Disarmament Ambassador has joined with Australia in calling for a special meeting of the Conference on Disarmament. We strongly hope that neither Pakistan nor India will seek to block this attempt to have the world's leading disarmament forum address, as a matter of urgency, the dangerous situation caused by both countries' nuclear tests."

"In Vienna, New Zealand, together with like-minded countries, has asked the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to consider a special agenda item on nuclear testing when it meets in June. We are also calling for a special meeting of states parties to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to issue a statement opposing nuclear testing by both countries."

"In New York, our Permanent Representative is writing to the Presidents of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, to place on record New Zealand's grave concerns about this situation."

"We are working closely with other like-minded countries to explore other options to keep up the pressure on both Pakistan and India in international forums."
