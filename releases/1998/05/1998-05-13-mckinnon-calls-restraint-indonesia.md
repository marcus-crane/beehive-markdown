Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon, today expressed the Government ?s concern about recent developments in Indonesia, including the killing of six students during a political demonstration in Jakarta yesterday.

"The Government is concerned about the developing situation in Indonesia. I have instructed our Ambassador in Jakarta to appeal for restraint as Indonesia grapples with rising tensions and the country?s severe economic difficulties", Mr McKinnon said.

"We are seeing spreading unrest in various parts of Indonesia, most recently the tragic killings of students during a demonstration in Jakarta yesterday. The Government deeply regrets the deaths of civilians and police that have occurred during political demonstrations in recent weeks."

"I have asked our Ambassador in Jakarta to express the concern of New Zealanders about recent developments including the disappearance and detention of political activists and other restrictions on human rights. We want the Indonesian authorities to establish responsibility for these incidents and take appropriate action."

"The Government sympathises with Indonesia as it faces enormous challenges and we call for restraint and calm by all parties to enable the people and government of Indonesia to address these challenges."

"In the light of recent events, the New Zealand Embassy in Jakarta advises New Zealanders visiting Indonesia to exercise caution,but it is not advising people to cancel travel to Indonesia, or advising people to leave Indonesia."
