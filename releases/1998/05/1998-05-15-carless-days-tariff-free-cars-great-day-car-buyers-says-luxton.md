It was a great day for new car buyers today, the Minister responsible for tariffs, Minister of Commerce, the Hon John Luxton said tonight.

"Today was a great day for car buyers. New Zealand has moved from carless days to tariff free cars. This Saturday will be New Zealand's first car tariff free weekend.

"Since car tariffs were totally remove at midnight last night we have seen substantial savings advertised for new car buyers, with some average sized cars reduced by up to $6000. This is good for New Zealand families and businesses. It means more money for other things, Mr Luxton said.

Last year the Government collected over $300,000,000 in car tariff revenue. Yesterday Mr Luxton announced $400,000 transitional funding for car plant communities, a $10.25 million package for car assemblers to continue assembling until their pre announced closure dates, and $30 million tariff rebate on cars imported in the last three months so that they could be sold tariff free immediately.
