Ken Shirley's resignation as chairman of the transport and environment select committee confirms he is a part-time MP drawing a full-time salary, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"He has been present for just 5 ½ of the 41 hours the committee has met for deliberations and missed 12 of the committee's 16 meetings, thereby neglecting the job that taxpayers have paid him to do.

"Now Mr Shirley wants to join the health select committee. But why? He's never in Parliament and health is a serious matter.

"The pursuit of other interests at the expense of one's Parliamentary duties is becoming endemic among ACT MPs including Derek Quigley who are engaged in paid consultancy work outside Parliament.

"Added to this is the lavish expenditure of Parliamentary travel by ACT leader Richard Prebble. The "perk-busters" are fast becoming the biggest joke in Parliament and they should resign enmasse to make way for other people who are willing to fulfill all the duties of a full-time MP.
