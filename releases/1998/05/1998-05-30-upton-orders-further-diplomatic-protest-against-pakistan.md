Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said he was appalled at Pakistan's further nuclear testing. "Pakistan may have been seriously provoked by India. But, the latest tests show a wilful disregard for international opinion. We are now witnessing the crudest imaginable pandering to inflamed domestic opinion.

"We will be using diplomatic channels to register our total rejection of this provocative step in the strongest possible terms. The High Commissioner for Pakistan will again be receiving the bluntest possible message from New Zealand's High Commission in Canberra. And our Embassy in Teheran will also be conveying our formal protest to the Pakistan authorities."

"New Zealand's missions to United Nations organisations are also working hard to ensure that this escalation towards a nuclear arms race in South Asia is denounced by the world community. We are working with like-minded countries to this end in the Conference on Disarmament (CD), the meeting of states parties to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other multilateral bodies."
