New Commerce graduates were asked, at a breakfast speech by the Minister of Youth Affairs, to remember their responsibility to communities and their role in creating a decent society.

Ms Morris said, "Business gains from the community, and I feel that it is only right that it gives something meaningful back."

"The policies that the Coalition Government has been promoting are in line with that kind of thinking. We realise that we need to be responsible both economically and socially. That is why New Zealand put New Zealand First where it is.

"People wanted a slowing down of the ideological dogma that had driven previous Governments. We have created a government with a human face that reflects the people's wishes.

Ms Morris warned that parties like the ACT Party would wind all this good work back saying, "The ACT Party has said that it would cut health services by 80%, welfare by 30% and education by 60%. However, the people of New Zealand want something else."

"I have spent much of the past year listening to communities describe what's going on for them. Most of them say they've had enough of the economically pure philosophies that bear no resemblance to real life. They want policies and politicians that can strike the balance.

"As qualified commerce students entering the job market you need to have the widest possible view of the world. To know that the potential to make your mark lies in making a difference for people. And in so doing, you can still make a profit," said Deborah Morris.
