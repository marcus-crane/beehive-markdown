New Zealand's SAS deployment with the Multinational Coalition in the Gulf is to be extended for a further three months, the Prime Minister announced today.

"The Government's commitment in the Gulf will continue but the New Zealand contribution to the ANZAC detachment will be reduced.

"New Zealand's 24 SAS personnel presently deployed in the Gulf will return to New Zealand and will remain on standby while a new SAS deployment of 11 personnel will continue to work in an ANZAC detachment with Australia and our other Multinational Coalition partners.

"New Zealand will retain a presence there while Iraq's compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions continues to be tested.

"The United Nations Security Council considered the latest Sanctions Review and report of the UNSCOM inspectors on 27 April. It was decided then that there would be no substantive change to the United Nation's current arrangements with regard to Iraq until a further Sanctions Review and UNSCOM report are tabled in the Security Council in October.

"New Zealand supports the view that a continued Coalition presence in the Gulf will assist the United Nations efforts to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction," Mrs Shipley said.

"Cabinet has also agreed that the other part of New Zealand's contribution to the Multinational Coalition, the two P-3 Orions, would remain on stand-by at Whenuapai.

"New Zealand's decision is an appropriate response to the progress which has been achieved in Iraq and also recognises the need for a continued presence in the Gulf," the Prime Minister concluded.
