Finance Minister and Acting Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today that the report out of the Australian National University (ANU) about the risk to the New Zealand economy was grossly misleading.

"I fully concur with the Treasurer's comments that there is no reason for investors to lose confidence in the New Zealand dollar, "Mr Birch said.

"The fundamentals of the New Zealand economy remain sound.

"Growth is still averaging more than 2.5% at the bottom of the economic cycle, inflation is low, and this coming financial year is the sixth consecutive in surplus.

"With net public debt also halved this decade, and forecast to fall under 20% of GDP within three years, the New Zealand economy is better equipped than ever to deal with external shocks such as the Asian economic downturn."

Mr Birch said the report prepared by the Asia Pacific Economics Group at the ANU appeared exaggerated and out-of-date.

For example the report states New Zealand has a number of similarities to the five nations of East Asia - but all the factors it cites relate to just one, the current account.

"It also talks of a "strong appreciation of the New Zealand dollar" and says the current account poses a risk of a sharp fall in the currency.

"If these academics paid any attention to the real world they would know that the New Zealand currency, which was considered over-valued, has depreciated by around 14% on a trade weighted basis over the past year."

Mr Birch said the Government acknowledged that the current account deficit was high, but Treasury, Reserve Bank and private sector forecasts were for it to reduce from this year. In fact, Reserve Bank forecasts released this morning show the current account deficit reducing to 5.8% within two years and trending down beyond that.

"And as we have said many times, it is important to understand the nature of New Zealand's current account:

our trade balance has been in surplus for ten years  
it reflects private investment has been higher than savings  
and the Government does not contribute to the deficit - by running surpluses and paying back debt it is a net saver."  
Further, as the ANU acknowledge, New Zealand's banking system is open, transparent and strong, the Minister said.

"This and our floating exchange rate differentiates us substantially from the S.E Asia countries. Our framework has already seen adjustments occur which will work to reduce the current account deficit.

"The weaker NZ$, for example, makes exports more competitive, and higher interest rates have taken the heat out of the housing market and led to an expectation that savings rates will increase substantially.

"Our current investment focus is on production rather than consumption."
