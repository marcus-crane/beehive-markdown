The Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Simon Upton, today announced three appointments to the New Zealand Film Commission.

One of the sitting members, John Barnett has been re-appointed for a further two-year term. "Mr Barnett is a highly regarded and very experienced film and television producer and I wish to retain his skills and expertise on the Film Commission for a further term", Mr Upton said.

Riwia Brown of Paekakariki, and Barrie Everard of Auckland, have been appointed to the two vacancies of the Commission. Riwia Brown is a noted Maori scriptwriter who has written the screenplay for a number of New Zealand feature films, including Once Were Warriors. Barrie Everard has wide experience across a number of areas in the New Zealand film industry, including production, distribution and exhibition.

"The skills and film industry experience brought to the Commission by Riwia Brown and Barrie Everard will complement the abilities of the other members of the Film Commission and enhance the quality of its work", Mr Upton said.

The Minister paid tribute to the outgoing members Sue Thompson and Brian Richards.

"Both Sue Thompson and Brian Richards have made valuable contributions to the Film Commission over the past three years and their commitment has been much appreciated by the Commission and Government", Mr Upton concluded.
