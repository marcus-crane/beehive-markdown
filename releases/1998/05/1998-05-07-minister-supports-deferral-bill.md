The Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Roger Sowry hopes that the House will reject the majority report from the Social Services Select Committee on the Social Security (Conjugal Status) Amendment Bill and instead refer the bill back to the committee for further consideration.

"Whilst the Opposition parties are able to dominate this select committee they do not present a majority in the House.

"The committee heard a large number of submissions from the public on the bill and consequently the Department of Social Welfare proposed a number of amendments to address many of the concerns raised. I believe that committee requires more time to work on detailed aspects of the bill.

"Labour and the Alliance politicking on this issue fails to recognise that for many women trapped in a violent relationship the answer lies in a carefully managed exit recognising the danger of their situation and the financial needs of the woman and children involved.

"The Conjugal Status Bill will provide this and Steve Maharey's position of 'opposing' without offering anything constructive does little to deal with the realities facing many in these circumstances.

"It is yet another demonstration of Mr Maharey's total lack of social policy ideas," says Mr Sowry.
