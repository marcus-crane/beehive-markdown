"New Zealand deeply deplores India's action in exploding two further nuclear devices," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The New Zealand Government, Parliament, and people, are united in their condemnation of nuclear testing. This latest action is contemptuous of world opinion.

"We are consulting with likeminded countries about the Indian tests. We shall be taking every opportunity in the United Nations and other relevant multilateral forums to make clear our total rejection of this reckless behaviour."

The Prime Minister noted that New Zealand's Disarmament Ambassador at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva will be making a strong statement condemning India's action when the Conference resumes tonight.

"Once again, I appeal to India's neighbours to continue to exercise restraint in this tense situation."

Mrs Shipley noted that the Indian Government has now said that it does not need to conduct further tests.

"If India wants to start repairing the damage it has caused, it should sign unconditionally the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and accept the commitments contained in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," she said.
