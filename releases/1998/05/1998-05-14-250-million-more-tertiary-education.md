Tertiary students will win with big changes and improvements to the way their education is funded, Education Minister Wyatt Creech and Associate Education Minister Brian Donnelly said today.

"By the year 2000 every student who chooses to embark on approved tertiary courses will get the benefit of the new taxpayer funded Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance. For any particular course, the same level of subsidy will go towards student tuition costs, regardless of where they study.

"The Government expects that overall tuition fees will not rise, and in some cases they should fall."

The Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance will be fully in place by the year 2000, replacing the current system where only a fixed number of student places in public institutions get taxpayer funding, and the institutions themselves have to find the money to pay for any extra students.

Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance Key Points:

An additional $250 million over three years for the new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance resourcing system.

From 1999 the cap on numbers of students funded by the Government will be removed.

From the year 2000 all students taking approved courses will be treated equally, whether at public or private institutions.

Government will fund further increases in student numbers as they occur.

The proportion the Government pays towards total costs of a student's study should stay about the same in 1999.

The funding changes will act as a real incentive to tertiary providers to keep their costs in check and keep fees down.

The level of tuition subsidies under the new scheme will be reviewed regularly from 2000.  
"The Government's work on developing the proposal for a universal student allowance has resulted in the more focused policy of a Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance.

"This will ensure that the substantial support taxpayers provide for students goes directly to where it matters most - into the costs of their tuition.

"The new system will open up more opportunities for more students to get a tertiary education. It is simpler, more transparent and will see tertiary institutions respond much better to the needs of students," said Mr Creech.

"The significant reduction in compliance costs will allow institutions to use resources previously used for administrative purposes for the educational benefit of students.

"We expect the significant new funding to keep the level of Government subsidy next year at a similar rate to this year. It should also keep the lid on tuition fees charged to students.

"The new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance is much fairer. Students studying at private training establishments have received little or no taxpayer support no matter how valuable their course. Now these courses also benefit.

"There will be tight controls on the quality of courses and the financial status of those providing tertiary education to ensure taxpayer funding is well spent."

The decision to fund every tertiary student who is studying an approved course is part of the Government's Tertiary Education Review. The funding of actual number of students will be paid directly to institutions.

Other aspects of Tertiary Review Funding Package:

There will be no 1.3% cut in subsidies for each student as has happened in previous years. In 1999 there will also be a 1% increase in the average subsidy per student.

For the next three years there will be extra funding for expected growth.

The new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance deals with problems with the current funding system where the Government funds 75% of the total amount that tertiary institutions charge. There has been no consensus and continual disagreement from institutions about what should be included in the 75%.  
"We don't want costs of tertiary education to stop students from undertaking study. The student loan scheme helps students with their living costs. We will be looking at ways to make the loan scheme work better and be less onerous for graduates with low incomes."

"Investing almost $250 million more over three years into tuition allowances for all students will deliver more benefits to students than introducing a universal student allowance. Students from low income backgrounds, who need a student living allowance the most, are already getting it through the current system," the Ministers said.
