"New Zealand has pledged additional funding of US$45,000 for UNEP", Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Upton announced today.

"This payment reflects the importance New Zealand attaches to UNEP and New Zealand's support for the current process of reform recently initiated by UNEP's newly appointed Director Dr Klaus Toepfer".

The Minister explained that, "it is hoped that such reform will strengthen UNEP's leading role in taking forward the international environmental agenda. This one-off additional New Zealand voluntary contribution will be paid into UNEP's core Environment Fund shortly".
