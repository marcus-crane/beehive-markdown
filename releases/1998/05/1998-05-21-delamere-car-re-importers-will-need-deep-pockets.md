Customs Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said tonight that any importers who tried to exploit a loophole in the law concerning the tariffs on imported luxury cars would find it a very expensive exercise.

"The Customs Service has been monitoring the situation and, as soon as it is proven that importers are attempting to fiddle the tariff regime, I will go immediately to Cabinet seeking a law change to make the original tariffs apply to any re-imported cars.

"This means that any such importers would not only have to pay the cost of the tariff, they would also be up for the expense of shipping the car overseas, storing it and shipping it back to New Zealand," said the Minister.
