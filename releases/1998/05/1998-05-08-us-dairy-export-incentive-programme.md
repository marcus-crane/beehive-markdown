New Zealand is disappointed that the United States has decided to significantly increase its volumes of subsidised dairy exports under the Dairy Export Incentive Programme (DEIP), Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Exports of subsidised product will be up nearly 30 million kilograms this year.

"We regard this as contrary to the spirit of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) disciplines on export subsidies and inconsistent with our shared objective of eliminating the use of export subsidies in agricultural trade," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith has previously raised New Zealand's concerns with US Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and will reinforce those concerns with Dr Glickman and US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky at the WTO meeting in Geneva the week after next.
