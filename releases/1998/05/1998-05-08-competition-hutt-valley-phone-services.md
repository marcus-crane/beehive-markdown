"It is fantastic Saturn Communications is now offering consumers choice resulting in better services and better prices," Minister of Communications Hon Maurice Williamson said today.

"I would hate to see a repeat of the disgusting behaviour of the major oil companies who for years held their prices more or less fixed and only moved once a new entrant came on to the scene.

"Saturn has raised the issue of whether Telecom's introduction of customer discounts only where Saturn is operating is anti-competitive. It is reported to have asked the Commerce Commission to consider this issue.

"The Commission enforces the Commerce Act which has a range of penalties for anti competitive behaviour. The Commission is therefore the most appropriate body to consider this matter in the first instance.

"The Commerce Act also provides for the parties to take private action through the courts.

"I look forward to hearing the commissions views on this matter," Mr Williamson said
