Radio New Zealand will investigate converting National Radio from the current AM band to the FM band, Minister Responsible for Radio New Zealand Hon Tony Ryall said today.

"I have invited the Board of RNZ to include a case in their 1998/99 business plan for moving National Radio to the FM band," Mr Ryall said.

"Moving to the FM band would certainly provide a considerable increase in quality for National Radio's estimated half-a-million listeners.

"A move to FM might also save costs in the long run as FM is generally cheaper to transmit than AM. The Government would expect RNZ to manage the costs of any move to FM within its own balance sheet, in consultation with shareholding Ministers."
