The risk of babies in New Zealand being still born or dying in their first week of life remain at record low levels, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"Our perinatal mortality rate was 6.1 per 1000 births in 1996, placing New Zealand sixth out of the 22 OECD countries.

"A lot has changed in maternity services in New Zealand in recent years. Changes to the Nurses Act in 1990 allowed independent midwives to practice and the contracting environment for maternity services has changed significantly in the last couple of years.

"Change is never particularly easy, but these changes have brought more controversy than most. In particular there have been claims that these changes have increased the risk of things going wrong, but I am pleased to see that the data does not bear this out.

"International Midwives Day is an appropriate time to celebrate maternity services in New Zealand. That is not to say that we can't do better, as in any area of health, but I think we can be proud of our record," said Mr English.
