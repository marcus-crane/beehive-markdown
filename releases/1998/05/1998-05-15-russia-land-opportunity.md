TRADE MINISTER LOCKWOOD SMITH will be the first foreign guest of key ministers in the new Russian Government when he visits our fastest growing export market this week. While Russia has its problems, Dr Smith argues in this article that these are not insurmountable and that the country offers great opportunity to New Zealand exporters.

Many New Zealanders may have a negative view of Russia, seeing it as a one-time superpower now in decline. They'd be wrong. Russia may have its problems, but its new reformist government is determined to address them. It has a 400 year history as a major power and it will continue to be so. It offers our exporters an exciting opportunity.

This week I will be meeting with key members of President Yeltsin's new reformist Cabinet in Moscow, and the powerful Economic Policy and Agriculture committees of the State Duma. It will the first visit by a New Zealand minister to Russia for three years and kicks off an 18 month period where New Zealand's relations with Russia will enter a new phase.

The Agriculture Minister and I will next week sign a new veterinary agreement which will ensure continued access for our primary products. Discussions will also involve the terms of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation.

In November, Russia will also join APEC. That will mean APEC will include the four powerhouses of the United States, Russia, China and Japan. It will tie Russia into APEC's goal of free trade around the Pacific Rim next century, confirming that APEC is indeed the biggest trade policy initiative in history.

New Zealand takes the chair of APEC in December, meaning we can look forward to a visit to Auckland by President Yeltsin next year, along with the presidents of the United States and China, the prime minister of Japan and all other APEC leaders. The focus that will give to New Zealand in APEC's huge and growing economies will be invaluable.

This 18 month strengthening of our relationship with Russia, and its integration into APEC, is good news for New Zealand exporters with an interest in the country.

Russia is already our fastest growing export market. Exports were up 64% in 1997 over 1996 making it our 17th biggest market. Total exports were worth $310 million, but a further $90 million of New Zealand exports were estimated to find there way into Russia via Europe.

Already, Russia has overtaken Japan as our largest market for dairy products by volume. We sell more butter to Russia than to any other country, including the UK. Meat and offals, prepared foodstuffs, fruit, fish and beer are other major exports, but I believe there is significant scope for us to expand the value and range of products we send to the country.

The average Russian is a lot less well off than the average New Zealander. However, the low cost of housing and utilities and a lack of incentive to save means there is a significant segment of the population with considerable spending power and an appetite for consumer products after 70 odd years of communism.

What's more, Moscow's economic growth is expected to be 6.5% this year, and Russia's US$40 billion trade surplus means it can afford to pay for more imports.

That's all good news for New Zealand exporters who are able to take the time and effort to establish themselves in the country. Exporters like the Dairy Board or NewTrade have gained a great deal from thinking broadly about the possibilities offered by such a rapidly developing market.

Russia is modernising itself rapidly. Much of the equipment and technology it needs still has to be imported, making it particularly attractive to New Zealanders in the high-tech manufacturing business.

Doing business in Russia is not always plain sailing. There is a degree of truth in perceptions of corruption and that some parts of the economy are in poor shape. It is not a market for the casual or opportunistic trader. But these negative perceptions should not be allowed to disguise the fact that many foreign companies are doing well in Russia and making money. As Russia completes its transition to a modern economy, integrated with the rest of the world, New Zealand enterprises which are able to take a longer-term view, research the market thoroughly and develop links with local partners, have a lot to gain for themselves and for New Zealand.
