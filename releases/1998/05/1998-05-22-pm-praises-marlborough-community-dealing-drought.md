"The people of Marlborough have faced testing times with the severe drought and the Asian financial situation adding to a difficult business climate," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley acknowledged during a visit to the district today.

"While it has been and is demanding for all concerned, there is room to be optimistic about our future, both locally and nationally.

"It is worth recalling that the reforms of the last decade-and-a-half are still delivering positive growth. The efforts of New Zealanders have seen our economy grow by more than 22 percent in the past five years. That's more growth in the past five years than in the previous 15 years.

"While many farmers in the Marlborough region are struggling at the moment, the drop in the New Zealand dollar, the predicted drop in interest rates later in the year, and the early signs of improvement in the commodity markets, such as the wool demand from China, all provide reasons for encouragement.

Mrs Shipley today met with local farmers and their families to get a first hand impression of the extent and seriousness of the drought on the region.

"As a former farmer, I know what it is like to be at the mercy of the weather and the stresses and strains it puts on individuals, families and communities.

"The Government has recognised the need for extra support for those farmers in the worst drought-affected areas through drought assistance packages in Marlborough, North Canterbury, Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa.

"These at least go someway to easing the pain and making it easier to plan for the post-drought future. However, as in all times of adversity, the real support comes from communities working together.

"I congratulate the Marlborough community for the way they have pulled together to cope with the affects of the drought in Marlborough. In addition, Federated Farmers must be congratulated for the coordination job they have done in the district," said Mrs Shipley.

"Overall Marlborough still has a strong future ahead of it despite the demands the current climatic conditions.

"Other industries, such as the region's wine industry, are recording spectacular growth, generating both economic and tourism benefits. While the current drought conditions have seen quantity down, wine quality has increased as a result of the dry, hot conditions.

"Winemaking is a major winner for this area. In 1997, there were 260,000 visits to winery cellars and it is estimated that $70 million was spent in the region in the purchase of goods and services.

"Tourism is also a growth industry in Marlborough. The last season was good for the region with noticeable increases in awareness both internationally and domestically," the Prime Minister concluded.
