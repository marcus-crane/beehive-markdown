Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey's three-day journey to Wellington should give him ample time to reflect on the actual facts of the Fire Service modernisation plan, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said.

"Riding on a fire engine to Parliament may seem like an exciting way of drawing attention to himself, but Mr Harvey conveniently overlooks the widespread support the proposed reforms have within the Fire Service."

Mr Elder said that the association representing 80 percent of all firefighters has given the plan its strong support.

The President of the United Fire Brigades' Association welcomed the plan saying:

"Clearly, across New Zealand, we must all do a better job in preventing fires and reducing the consequences of fire. The Commission is correct in recognising that the solution lies in a partnership with the community."

A letter received from a chief fire officer added further support the modernisation proposals, Mr Elder said.

'I wish to advise my full support for this programme. The Fire Service has languished for some many years to the detriment of not only all members of the service, particularly the volunteer members, but also the general public. It is pleasing to see the Commission has now come out with a modernisation programme that will provide the Fire Service and the public of New Zealand with a greater opportunity to reduce the number and consequences of fire.'

The aim of the modernisation project is to halve the number of people who lose their lives in fires, Mr Elder said.

"It will see Fire Officers receiving significantly higher incomes, it will see newer and better fire engines, better located fire stations, faster response times and more resources available to volunteers.

"Recently tragedies involving young children in house fires highlights the fact that the current way the Fire Service operates is not good enough.

"People in Waitakere should ask themselves why Mr Harvey is standing in the way of them receiving a better standard of fire service coverage and improved home safety."
