The Government's commitment to boosting public safety is continued with 114 extra police to be added to the front line this year and another 100 next year, Police Minister Jack Elder said.

"This Budget commits the resources required to fully complete the Coalition Agreement programme of 500 extra police by the end of the parliamentary term," Mr Elder said. Over $36 million has been set aside to cover the staff increase. This is over and above the extra $157 million funding for the Police budget.

"The extra officers will mean an increased ability of the Police to respond to the needs of New Zealanders. They will attend to burglaries and emergency situations, target organised crime and gangs, and implement crime prevention strategies," Mr Elder said.

"Higher staff numbers will also greatly enhance Police capabilities during upcoming high profile events such as APEC and the America's Cup. Both events will require intensive policing to ensure safety and security.

"The Auckland region, currently under the greatest staffing pressure, will benefit significantly from additional staff," Mr Elder said.
