Tourism Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the appointment of Scott Morrison as inaugural Director of the Office of Tourism and Sport, which will enable the new top-level policy unit to be in operation by its 1 July target date.

"Having studied the development of tourism and sport across the Tasman closely during recent years, I am conscious of the extent to which our Australian counterparts have established organisations with strong leadership and intellectual capital," said Mr McCully.

"New Zealand is fortunate to have obtained the services of Mr Morrison, the General Manager of the Tourism Council of Australia, whose broad experience and achievements with the Council and the Tourism Task Force in Sydney make him ideally suited to be the Director of the new office.

"I place a high priority on the contribution that tourism and sport make to New Zealand's economic development, and the advantages which they bring to New Zealanders. This is an important and growing sector which will benefit from a person of Mr Morrison's calibre."
