"New Skies Satellites," a new communications company established by INTELSAT has today been welcomed by Minister of Communications, Hon Maurice Williamson.

"This is a major reform of the organisation which will produce benefits for users and investors in INTELSAT and New Skies," Mr Williamson said.

INTELSAT is a global cooperative formed in 1964 by a treaty between governments, which established the first global telecommunications satellite system. It is used for telecommunications, data and broadcasting signal distribution.

With the emergence of other satellite companies providing competing services and the development of trans-oceanic fibre optic cables, pressure has been put upon INTELSAT to reform so that it can respond more quickly to competition.

New Skies Satellites will be able to concentrate on providing new services, such as video signal distribution, and will add another player in the satellite market in the Asia-Pacific region.

"The increase in competition in the region will lower prices for communications links throughout the region and therefore contribute to the lowering of costs to consumers and improvements in the range of services available," the Minister said

"It will also put further pressure on INTELSAT itself to be more efficient.

"Competitive safeguards are to be put in place to ensure that there is an 'arms length' relationship between New Skies and INTELSAT. There also remains an ongoing need to progress further reform of INTELSAT.

"The international treaty-based structure of INTELSAT was once the only means to ensure global access to reliable international satellite telecommunications circuits. Now new technologies and the liberalisation of many telecommunications markets worldwide mean that private companies not only provide those services, but in addition offer a range of competitive options for users.

"New Zealand will support future moves to reform INTELSAT into a more commercially oriented organisation," Mr Williamson said
