"The Government is working to provide seats on charter flights for New Zealanders wishing to leave Jakarta from this weekend," Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon, announced this afternoon.

"The Government is closely monitoring the situation in Jakarta. It remains tense. While the streets were calmer overnight, sporadic outbreaks of violence continued," he said.

"I have just spoken to the New Zealand Ambassador in Jakarta, Mike Green. In view of the volatile situation, the Embassy continues to advise New Zealanders there to consider leaving as soon as is practicable. While it has proved too difficult to fly from Jakarta in the last few days, the Embassy reports that as of last night traffic to the airport has been flowing freely and the airport itself functioning smoothly.

"New Zealanders who have been unable to secure seats on scheduled flights should be able to apply for seats on charter flights, leaving Jakarta from Sunday," the Minister said. Commercial fares will apply.

New Zealanders wishing to seek seats on flights should contact the Embassy in Jakarta which will be open through the weekend, Mr McKinnon said. The Embassy number is 570 9466 ext 220.

"The Government continues to monitor the situation in Jakarta around the clock," the Minister concluded.
