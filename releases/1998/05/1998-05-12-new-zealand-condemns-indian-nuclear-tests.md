"The Government is gravely disturbed at the testing of three nuclear devices by India," the Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"We condemn these tests, just as we have condemned all nuclear testing in the past.

"We had hoped nuclear testing had ended for all time, with the recent conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). That hope has now been shattered.

"Despite its decision not to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty India has always professed its commitment to nuclear disarmament. It is extremely disappointing that they have failed to live up to these ideals.

"I hope other countries in the region will remain calm in response to these events. It is imperative that there should be no further steps which might weaken the international norm against nuclear testing.

"We will be making clear to the Indian authorities that New Zealand strongly objects to their actions.

"We shall also be consulting with like-minded countries on any other measures that can be taken to register the international community's consideration of this provocative act by India," the Prime Minister said.
