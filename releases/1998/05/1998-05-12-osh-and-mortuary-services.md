"The Government and Auckland University are working to resolve the issues raised in the Occupational Safety and Health report on mortuary services at Auckland Medical School," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"There are some complex ownership and purchase policy issues that have to be resolved.

"We are well aware of the safety concerns surrounding the provision of mortuary services by Auckland Medical School.

"The Ministers of Education, Health and Finance have met to discuss the issues and officials have clear instructions to provide advice about the best way forward.

"Ministers are expected to consider proposals shortly."
