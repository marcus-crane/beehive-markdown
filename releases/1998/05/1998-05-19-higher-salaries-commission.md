Labour Minister Max Bradford today announced the appointment of Ross Mulholland as a new member of the Higher Salaries Commission. Mr Mulholland's appointment fills an existing vacancy on the Commission.

The Higher Salaries Commission is responsible for determining the salaries paid to Members of Parliament and the Judiciary, as well as to some other senior public sector positions. Appointments to the Commission are made by the Governor-General by Order in Council for terms of up to three years.

Mr Bradford said Mr Mulholland is a Victoria University LLB graduate with extensive legal experience, particularly in the areas of commercial and property law, managed funds, investment products and financial services, superannuation schemes and unit trusts.

Mr Mulholland has been with the law firm Phillips Fox since 1964, rising to the position of National Chairperson from 1992-94, and is currently a senior partner. He has been a director of Tower Trust Services Ltd, a representative of the New Zealand Law Society on the Unit Trust Law Reform Committee, and is a member of the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand.

"Ross Mullholland combines insight and practical experience of the commercial and superannuation sectors which will stand him in good stead as a member of the Higher Salaries Commission," Mr Bradford said.
