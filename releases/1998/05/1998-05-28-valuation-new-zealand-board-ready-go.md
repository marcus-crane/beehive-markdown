Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Tony Ryall, announced today the appointment of five directors to the inaugural board of Valuation New Zealand Ltd, the Government's newest Crown Owned Company.

Valuation New Zealand Ltd will begin operations on 1 July.

VNZ will be chaired by Cantabrian Richard Westlake, formerly chairman of MetService. Mr Westlake will be joined by retired Wellington valuer Malcolm Hanna, Alan Haronga, a Wellington chartered accountant, Shelley Thomas, a Tauranga-based business consultant and Alan Hannay, a Lower Hutt-based managing director of a marketing and distribution company.

"We are fortunate to have a board of this calibre," Mr Ryall said.

"These appointments bring us one step closer to making Valuation New Zealand a commercially focused organisation capable of competing for valuation contracts in both the local authority and commercial markets.

"The Government is confident that the Board will be successful in establishing Valuation New Zealand Ltd as a competitive and profitable provider of valuation services. I am also confident that the establishment of VNZ will lead to lower prices for local authorities and other customers."
