The Government is giving the go ahead for a new Institute of Judicial Studies to enhance the quality of justice.

"Currently, the judiciary is one of the largest professional bodies without extensive formal provision for development and training. The Institute of Judicial Studies is a judicially-led initiative and will now address this situation," Minister for Courts Wyatt Creech said today.

"The Institute will better coordinate continuing education, information and research services for judges and other judicial officers such as coroners and JPs.

"The principal functions of the Institute will be to help professional development and promote judicial excellence. It will foster an awareness of developments in the law, judicial administration and social and community issues amongst judicial officers."

The Budget provides $2.1 million over three years to fund the institute.

The Budget also includes new funding to help the Disputes Tribunal cope with its widened jurisdiction.

An extra $3.2 million over three years will help manage the 3,000 additional claims expected due to extending the monetary limit on claims which come before the Disputes Tribunal. The monetary limit is being increased from $3,000 to $7,500 or from $5,000 to $12,000 when both parties agree.

"The Disputes Tribunal has been successful in giving people quick, informal and inexpensive access to justice at the lower end of the civil jurisdiction. Extending the monetary limit sets a more realistic level for the late 1990s," Mr Creech said.
