"The PPTA leadership appears to be preparing to use the secondary teacher pay talks to fight what is simply just a political campaign against Government policy," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

The PPTA says it will make an announcement about its response to the Budget tomorrow, directly linking its response to the employment contract talks.

"The PPTA is making it absolutely clear it wants a political fight with the Government. It clearly has little interest in what is in the best interest of schools and students.

"Our young people's education is too important to be abused in this cavalier way. Students should not be pawns in a political game.

"Instead of trying to buy into a political fight for absolutely no purpose, the effort would be better spent negotiating to improve teachers' pay and conditions."

The PPTA President is quoted as saying that negotiations have fallen apart because of the bulk funding announcement.

"The PPTA walked away from the negotiating table on the pretext that the Government would not talk about its claim for the Treaty of Waitangi to be included in the contract, the claim for 1200 more teachers and claim to have preferential treatment for PPTA approved training  
courses.

"It is now saying that bulk funding has broken down negotiations. "The PPTA leadership does not seem to be at all interested in getting the employment contract  
settled. The Government wants to get on and talk about pay and conditions. The Budget decisions don't change that," Mr Creech said.

?Every New Zealand teacher should think carefully before following like sheep their union leadership that is sees itself in the political rather than the industrial contest.

"The PPTA leadership continues to try to scaremonger about giving schools control of their total school budget through the new Fully Funded Option of resourcing schools.

"More than 300 schools already have control of their staffing budgets and the horror stories painted by the PPTA leadership have not been borne out in reality," Mr Creech said. "The reality is that the schools have been able to put extra resources into helping and supporting teachers, reduce their workload, respond better to the specific needs of students and lift the overall performance of the school.

"The PPTA might want to keep beating the drum against letting schools do this because they fear it will reduce their power. The Government and many others in the education sector are more interested in giving schools the ability and flexibility to deliver for their students."
