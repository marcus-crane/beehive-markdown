Waiomio School in Northland will close on July 19, Minister of Education Wyatt Creech announced today.

Mr Creech says during the last few months the Ministry of Education has consulted the school and other local schools about the possible closure of Waiomio School under section 154 of the Education Act 1989.

?All of the evidence provided and written submissions have been weighed up very carefully, with a particular focus on making the best possible education provisions for students and making effective use of education resources,? Mr Creech said.

"I have spent considerable time considering what the best step forward is for the students at Waiomio school. I have discussed the matter with a number of people.

"Closing the school is the best option to ensure that the young people in the area receive the education they need to set them up for the future."

The school roll has declined over the past seven years from 24 students in 1991 to 10 in March 1998.

Mr Creech said there were a number of larger schools within easy reach of Waiomio School on sealed roads. Kawakawa Primary School was only 5.8 kms from Waiomio.

"No decision had been made about the future use of the Waiomio School site," Mr Creech said.
