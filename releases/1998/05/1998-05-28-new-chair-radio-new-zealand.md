The Government has appointed a new Chairman for Radio New Zealand. Mr John Isles, currently Acting Chairman, takes over the helm from Mr Bryan Kensington who retired at the end of April.

"The Government is delighted that Mr Isles has agreed to accept this position," Minister Responsible for Radio New Zealand, Tony Ryall, said today.

"Bryan Kensington and his fellow Board members resolved a number of funding issues and oversaw the successful restructuring of what is now the new Radio New Zealand.

"I am confident that Mr Isles will continue the excellent work started by Mr Kensington.

"Mr Isles has considerable experience in public radio. This is his second term on the Board and throughout his time with Radio New Zealand he has demonstrated his commitment to quality public radio."

"The appointment of Mr Isles to the Chair, and the additional funding for RNZ of $6 million over three years, demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to public radio in New Zealand.

"I am looking forward to working closely with Mr Isles over the next few years. However, this appointment means he will have less time available for his passion for high brow French literature."
