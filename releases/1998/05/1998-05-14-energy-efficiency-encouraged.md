The Coalition Government is continuing to encourage people to learn how to use energy more efficiently, Energy Minister Max Bradford said today.

"At the same time, the Coalition Government is also encouraging greater support from the private sector," Mr Bradford said.

Total funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) will be $4.3 million for 1998/99, $1.9 million up from the $2.4 million allocated for core activities. A further $2 million has also been allocated over the following two years (1999/2000 and 2000/2001) to assist EECA's transition to focus on core activities and greater input from the private sector.

Mr Bradford said a decision had also been made to continue the Energy Saver Fund (ESF), a scheme administered by EECA to provide grants for household energy efficiency projects. However, balanced against the funding of EECA above core activities, the ESF annual funding level will be gradually phased down over the next two years to $2.5 million in 1998/99 and $2 million in 1999/2000.
