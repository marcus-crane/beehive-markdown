School students will benefit from improved standards and a better quality education all round through more resources than ever before being pumped into education.

"This is the second phase of the Coalition Government's education programme. The Budget reinforces existing initiatives, but also moves education forward by improving quality and standards, involving parents and communities and preparing for a skills-based 21st Century," said the Minister of Education Wyatt Creech and Associate Minister of Education Brian Donnelly.

"The Budget recognises that no education institution has exactly the same needs. Students have their own individual learning styles. The Budget responds by fostering flexibility and choice in education."

Today's Budget takes the commitment to new education spending so far to almost $1.7 billion, including capital during the term of this Coalition Government.

The Budget includes extra education funding of $590 million over three years.

In addition it contains $180 million more (GST not applicable) this financial year for new classrooms and school upgrades.  
New Freedom to Respond to Student Needs

This Budget together with the recent salary settlements, earmarks close to $730 million extra for schools over the next three years, an average of more than $270,000 per school.

"We are introducing a new funding option which encourages each school to prioritise their funding in a way that works best for their students."

Schools can choose between the:

Existing scheme: schools are funded centrally for the staffing they actually have,  
OR

New Fully Funded Option: schools will have total control of their budgets, including salaries and will be funded based on the top teacher pay rates. (This replaces the old direct resourcing system.)  
"The Budget boasts more funding and a new freedom for schools, principals and teachers to use their judgement to better meet student needs and raise education standards. Schools will do better if they take this opportunity and leave the straightjacket of central control behind," said the Ministers.

Fully Funded Option

The extra cost of the Fully Funded Option depends on the number of schools taking it up. The Budget allows for a high-take up rate and $222 million is provided for over three years.

"Schools taking control of their total school budget through the Fully Funded Option will be able to use the funding for innovative new arrangements to improve the education for their students.

"They can employ more teachers, more support staff or other professionals to alleviate workload pressures. The extra funding, if all used for teachers, means schools could employ close to 2000 more teachers.

In addition all schools can also exercise their judgement on how best to spend the $34.5 million (over three years) additional Operations Grant money.

"It should be used in a way that gets the best possible educational results for the school."

Skills for the Future

"The Budget reflects that the future will change at an even faster rate than at present. Students need to be set up for a skills based 21st Century.

"We are developing a new project to get students comfortable with information technology. Details of this $14.5 million initiative will be released when finalised."

An extra $250 million over three years will open up more opportunities for tertiary education. From 2000 every student studying an approved tertiary course will get the benefit of the new taxpayer funded Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance to go towards their tuition costs.
