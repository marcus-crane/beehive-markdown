A web site on the internet which shows all the best ideas from New Zealand hospitals was launched today by Health Minister Bill English.

"New Zealand hospitals are doing a great deal of innovative things and we want those good ideas shared. It is all about finding ways of doing things smarter, based on sound evidence and experience.

"This web site is concrete proof that our hospitals are working together cooperatively and ready to learn from each other.

"Already there are 141 initiatives on the site. So far 21 of the 23 Crown health enterprises have contributed to the site, which has been put co-ordinated by the Ministry of Health.

"Initiatives on the site cover a range of health issues, including mental health, Maori health, work force initiatives, integration of service delivery and application of guidelines. A directory sums up each initiative and includes the contact details so other health professionals can easily access more information.

"The public will be able to access the site and learn about the initiatives. There is also a 'benchmarking lounge'. This is an area of the site which will have restricted access and where health professionals can continue discussion on the projects.

"The big advantage of the internet is that access is immediate and information can be updated at any time," said Mr English.
