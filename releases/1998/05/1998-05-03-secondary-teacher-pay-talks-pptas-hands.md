"The Government has made it clear that it wants to make real progress with the secondary teachers' pay talks, but is still being impeded by the PPTA attempt to include non-pay issues in pay negotiations," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

?I am deeply disappointed that the PPTA leadership has not moderated its position so that we can get the talks underway.

"The Government?s position is clear. The Secretary of Education cannot enter negotiations on matters of a policy, resourcing or constitutional nature.

"The Ministry of Education negotiators are close to developing a pay offer for secondary teachers, but they can not present it to teachers because the PPTA leadership has failed to move in anything other than a cosmetic way. Their actions can not be seen as a serious attempt to get pay talks underway.

?The so-called ?concession? by the PPTA is not what it seems. It fails to address the central issue. The Government does not accept that policy, resourcing and constitutional issues should be matters included in an employment contract.

"Time is dragging on. We want to move on pay rates so school communities can recruit and retain quality teachers. But we can't make any progress until we get agreement on the principle that non-industrial issues will not form part of the industrial process.

?I do not want to have a row with teachers. I share with many teachers at the chalkface the desire to give our young people the best possible education we can. I realise they have concerns about workloads and am willing to continue to look at the policy issues driving workload. Those at the chalkface need have no fear about that.

?But the Government and the public will grow increasingly concerned if the stubbornness of the PPTA leadership impedes our ability to modify pay rates so we can attract graduates into teaching. The PPTA leadership has an obligation to the young people of New Zealand and its members to show that the bargaining system can work for the betterment of the New Zealand education system.

"The next step in the secondary teachers' pay talks is now in the PPTA's leadership?s hands. There will be no progress until it focuses on pay and conditions in the pay talks.

"We need to get down to proper negotiation. The PPTA leadership should note that the public will react very angrily to further disruption," Mr Creech concluded.
