"They are protesting against an agreement which will not be signed in the foreseeable future and which wouldn't have done any of the things they think it would have done," Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Dr Smith was commenting on today's protest against the OECD's proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI).
