Health Minister Bill English said an attack yesterday by Labour MP Pete Hodgson on a staff member of the Health Funding Authority was nasty and out of order, and he called on Labour to apologise.

"Mr Hodgson says he is happy for health bureaucrats to lose their jobs, as long as they are not from Dunedin. That is fine and he is welcome to make his views known to the HFA, which is consulting widely about these moves.

"However, the way he has personally attacked the HFA Southern Regional Director, Kath Fox, is nasty and out of order. I will be writing to Labour Leader Helen Clark and asking that she request Mr Hodgson apologise to Ms Fox.

"This is the second time since I have been Minister that a Labour MP has made a personal attack on someone working in the health sector. Last year Lianne Dalziell launched a quite extraordinary attack on Health and Disability Commissioner Robyn Stent. I asked Ms Clark to apologise then, but no apology has been made.

"It is to be expected that opposition parties will challenge policy decisions and question changes. However, I believe it is quite unacceptable to make a personal attack like this. If Labour does not apologise to Ms Fox I can only assume that it condones this sort of behaviour.

"The staff of the Dunedin office of the HFA are going through a particularly difficult time.

"For the last four years they have worked hard to do the job asked of them, but have been the butt of continuous criticism in Dunedin. I am sure they are gratified to know that Mr Hodgson and the rest of the city are now so supportive," said Mr English.
