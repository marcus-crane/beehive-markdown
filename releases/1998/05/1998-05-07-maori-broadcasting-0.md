"I'm extremely disappointed following a meeting Wednesday evening (6 May 1998) between Ministers and the National Maori Organisations that some of the participants have decided to speak publicly about matters under discussion," the Minister of Communications, Hon Maurice Williamson said today.

Mr Williamson made his comments in reference to a meeting set to discuss how the Government was proposing to give effect to its Maori television policy.

The purpose of the meeting was to seek the views of the National Maori Organisations before final decisions were taken by Cabinet on a Maori television policy. It follows a number of formal and informal meetings between Ministers and the National Maori Organisations, and their advisors, held over a long period of time. The Crown has also consulted more widely with Maori.

" At this stage, Cabinet has considered a report on the matter, but it has not made final decisions and until Cabinet meets again to consider the subject I won't be commenting further," the Minister said.

" The Crown is committed to meeting its Treaty and legal obligations to promote the Maori language through television broadcasting," Mr Williamson said.
