Health Minister Bill English announced today that he would introduce legislation allowing the Government to extend the right to prescribe medicines to nurses under certain conditions.

"Allowing nurses to prescribe some medicines will improve access to health services and give more flexibility to the ways in which health services can be delivered for patients. These are the main reasons I have always been a supporter of it.

"I am especially pleased to be able to make this announcement on International Nurses Day. The introduction of limited nurse prescribing is important for advancing nursing practice and has been sought by nurses for many years now.

"Nurses make up by far the largest group of trained health professionals in this country and it makes sense to use their skills as widely as possible. There are more than 31,000 registered nurses in New Zealand, or 866 nurses per 100,000 people, compared to 81 GPs and 64 specialists per 100,000 people.

"Nurse prescribing will be introduced for identified scopes of practice within which nurses will be able to prescribe limited medicines in defined circumstances.

"The competencies required to safely prescribe in these circumstances will then be identified and only nurses who pass post registration training in the defined areas of practice will be able to prescribe medicines.

"Two areas of nurse practice have been chosen where work will start first, child family health and aged care, because nurses have a long history of providing continuing care to the aged, and the Coalition Government has placed a great deal of emphasis on child health," he said.

"However, I expect that nurses in other areas will be interested in defining their practice and then approaching the Ministry and the Council to work toward extending prescribing rights in those areas.

"In February I set up a Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing to look at barriers to advancing nursing and strategies to address those barriers. This is the first major review of nursing in New Zealand in 15 years.

"I am making this announcement today ahead of the Taskforce reporting back to me because already the advice is that nurse prescribing needs to go ahead. Members of the Taskforce are of the view that New Zealand's restrictive prescribing environment is causing a major barrier to evolving nursing practice and is limiting access to service.

"More than 1,000 individual submissions have now been made to the Taskforce, as well as submissions from a significant number of key organisations, which shows just how keen the interest is," said Mr English.

Mr English said the legislation extending limited prescribing rights to nurses would be introduced later this year as an amendment to the Medicines Act 1981. The amendment would also pave the way for other defined classes of registered health professionals, such as optometrists and pharmacists, to be given the right to prescribe medicines. Interested groups would have the opportunity to scrutinise draft legislation during the select committee process.

In the meantime, the Ministry of Health would be working with the Nursing Council to scope the two areas of practice chosen and develop the competencies that nurses would have to demonstrate to be able to prescribe. The Ministry would also work with the nursing schools to develop proposals to teach and test the competencies.

The new regulations could be in force by March next year.
