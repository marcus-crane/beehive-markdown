Health bureaucracy is being reined in, with savings of more than $30 million to be made over the next three years in the costs of administering the health service, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"Nearly $10 million ($9.9 million) will be saved this year and $11.5 million each year for the next two years, giving total savings of $32.9 million to plough back into health services.

"The Coalition Agreement promised to limit bureaucracy and this Budget confirms that savings have been made and will continue to be made in the cost of running health services.

"The four regional health authorities have been merged into one organisation and this has generated savings. The Ministry of Health has also been streamlined, adding to the savings," said Mr English.
