The Coalition Government will recall for consultations, its High Commissioner in New Delhi, following India's testing of three nuclear devices, Foreign Minister and Minister for Disarmament, Don McKinnon said today.

The announcement follows the Prime Minister's condemnation of the tests and Mr McKinnon calling in the Indian High Commissioner, Shehkholen Kipgen, to protest this morning.

"Mr Simcock will be recalled immediately for discussions with the New Zealand Government. Our High Commission in New Delhi will lodge with the Indian authorities New Zealand's protest to the testing." Mr McKinnon said.

"I made it very clear in my meeting with Mr Kipgen this morning that New Zealand and the rest of the world see India's testing of three nuclear weapons as a gross insult."

"Despite not being a party to the relevant disarmament treaties, India had always professed its commitment to nuclear disarmament. I was surprised and very disappointed by the news they have undertaken these tests.

"Withdrawing our High Commissioner for consultations in New Zealand sends a very strong message that New Zealand condemns further nuclear testing."

Mr McKinnon also appealed for calm among Indian neighbours and said he hoped India would be persuaded by the international community's outrage not to conduct any more tests.

"It is imperative that nations continue to focus on the greater good and the elimination of these horrendous nuclear weapons," he said.
