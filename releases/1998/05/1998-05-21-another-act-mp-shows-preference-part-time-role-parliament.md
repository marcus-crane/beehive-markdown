Yet another ACT MP has established a record for part-time work at Parliament at the expense of taxpayers', Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"ACT deputy leader Ken Shirley has already confirmed he is a part-time MP by turning up for just 5 ½ of the 41 hours of deliberations by the environment and transport select committee.

"Now we learn that Donna Awatere Huata has failed to attend any of the education and science select committee meetings this year. Last year she attended just 6 ½ hours of meetings. Who will be next?

"It seems like ACT MPs are running a competition to see who can get paid the most for the least amount of work.

"The taxpayers of New Zealand deserve more than this from their elected representatives and it's about time ACT MPs resigned enmasse to make way for other people who are willing to fulfill all the duties of a full-time MP," Mr Peters said.
