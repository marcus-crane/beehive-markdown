A third ACT MP has been exposed as a part-timer at Parliament, at the expense of taxpayers, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said today.

"First we had Ken Shirley turning up for just 4 of the 16 meetings of the environment and transport select committee. Then we had Donna Awatere Huata who hasn't turned up for a single meeting of the education and science select committee this year.

"And to top it all off, we've now got Derek Quigley missing in action. Mr Quigley has not been seen at the health select committee since 25 February.

"He's attended only one of the committee's 13 meetings this year. That's an attendance rate of a whopping 7.6 per cent.

"The competition for Parliament's laziest part-timer is fierce among ACT MPs. But no one's a winner in this race. They're all losers and they're costing the New Zealand taxpayer dearly.

"The taxpayers of New Zealand deserve more than this from their elected representatives and it's about time ACT MPs resigned enmasse to make way for other people who are willing to fulfill all the duties of a full-time MP," Mr Peters said.
