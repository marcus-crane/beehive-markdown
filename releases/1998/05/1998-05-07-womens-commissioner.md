A Women's Commissioner is to be appointed, delivering yet another of the Coalition Agreement initiatives, announced the Associate Minister of Women's Affairs, Deborah Morris.

The Women's Commissioner is to be appointed on the Human Rights Commission. The Women's Commissioner will be able to utilise all the powers and functions of the Commission as set out in the Human Rights Act.

"The Human Rights Commission will receive an additional $150,000 per year for analytical and research support for the Women's Commissioner. The Women's Commissioner will be one of the existing Commissioners and their role will complement the work of the Ministry of Women's Affairs. The Women's Commissioner will report each year on progress on the human rights of women.

"I hope that the Women's Commissioner will be able to meet regularly with women's organisations and be able to play an educative role within the community. The Commissioner's work will help to identify priority areas of work for the Human Rights Commission," said Deborah Morris.
