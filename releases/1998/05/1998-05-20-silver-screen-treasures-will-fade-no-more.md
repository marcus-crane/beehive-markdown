"A grant of $117,000 for the New Zealand Film Archive's Rosier Fund will help ensure the safekeeping of this country's film heritage", the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Simon Upton, said today.

The money, which is to be paid out over three years, is in addition to the New Zealand Film Archive's annual funding from the government of $161,000.

The Rosier Fund was established in 1997 with a bequest from the late Vaughan and Laura Rosier, of Wellington. The Archive has dedicated the fund to the urgent task of preserving New Zealand's earliest film heritage. Starting with the Rosiers' $60,000, it hopes to raise $250,000 by 2000.

"In a time when government spending still has to be kept under tight control, this is the most effective kind of extra contribution the government can make to the Archive's work", the Minister said. "This truly was a terminal case - those who cared had to act swiftly or these film treasures would have been irretrievably lost".

"I have urged all of my colleagues in Parliament to make a donation, and I encourage companies - and anyone who loves film and has even a little money to spare - to contact the Film Archive and enquire about the Rosier Fund."

Today's is the last in a series of budget announcements for arts and culture. The overall Cultural Affairs vote falls from $67 million in 1997/8 to $46 million in 1998/9, but that is only because the Museum of New Zealand has been finished. "In reality, excluding the construction costs of Te Papa, baseline funding for cultural affairs has risen by over $4 million, from $34.9 million to $39.1 million - an increase of over 10%."

"On top of the baseline increase - which has directed new funds to the Royal New Zealand ballet, Kapa Haka and the Rosier Fund - nearly $3 million will be spent improving the Otago Museum over the next two years.

Mr Upton concluded, "in a difficult budgetary environment the arts and culture sector has done rather well."
