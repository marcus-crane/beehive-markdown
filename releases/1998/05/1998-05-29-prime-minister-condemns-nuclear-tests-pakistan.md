"New Zealand denounces these tests unequivocally. We knew that Pakistan was under great provocation from the tests already conducted by India, but this response will only aggravate a tense situation.

"In public statements, and in letters sent recently by me and Don McKinnon to our Pakistan counterparts, we called on Pakistan to exercise restraint. I am therefore deeply disappointed that they have now taken this step.

"New Zealand will be making clear to Pakistan, as we did to India, that these actions are totally unacceptable.

"We will also be consulting other Governments about what steps the international community can take to defuse this potentially dangerous situation.

"New Zealand will once again be strongly supporting all efforts in the United Nations and other multilateral bodies to try to avert a nuclear arms race in South Asia, and to maintain the international norm against nuclear testing," the Prime Minister concluded
