Total education spending $7.1 billion in 1998/99.

The Coalition Government has so far committed almost $1.7 billion extra for education during its term of office.

In this Budget:

$590 million more over three years.

$180 million extra (GST not applicable) for capital projects (classrooms, school upgrades).

This Budget, together with the recent salary settlements, earmarks close to $730 million extra for schools over the next three years, an average of more than $270,000 per school.

A new funding system for schools choosing to extend responsibility for managing their overall school budgets to include teachers' salaries. An extra $222 million over three years has been allowed for the new Fully Funded Option. Under the new system schools will be funded based on the top teacher pay rates. The old system saw these schools paid through a formula based on the average teacher pay rate.  
The extra funding through the Fully Funded Option could be used to employ additional teachers, or support staff, extend information technology, or to purchase additional resources which could help ease workload pressures. If all the additional funding was spent on more teachers, schools could employ close to 2,000 additional teachers by 2000/01.

Increased access to tertiary education for all students through a new funding system. An extra $250 million over three years will provide a new Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance to go towards the tuition costs of every student. All students in approved tertiary education programmes will receive a government tuition subsidy. This replaces the current system where only a fixed number of student places get Government subsidies. Subsidies will be set annually. Students studying for approved qualifications at any tertiary provider, public or private, will be funded. By the year 2000 students at all institutions will be funded on an equal basis.

New funding of $180 million will contribute to building a planned 460 new classrooms to cope with increasing school rolls in the 1999 school year (361 new primary school classrooms and 99 new secondary school classrooms). This is over and above the 965 new classrooms planned to be built this school year. The extra funding will bring forward many deferred works projects and allow for the purchase of nine new school sites.

More funding for schools day to day running costs. An additional $34.5 million over three years for school Operations Grants. This 2% increase builds on the 5% increase in 1997 and 4% increase in 1996. With these increases, schools will be getting 23% more money per pupil than they did when the funding system started in 1990, or 5.7% more when adjusted for underlying inflation.  
The Government is considering further improvements to the structure of the Operations Grant. Decisions on this will be made later this year.

Development of a new project to get students familiar with computers and information technology. Details will be released in due course. Up to $14.5 million has been provided.

New investment in early childhood education of another $17.8 million over three years is designed to make pre-school education more affordable and of better quality to families. Early Childhood Services will receive a 2% increase in funding. The Government wants to encourage early childhood education providers to lift quality. New quality criteria will be developed and any further financial incentives to lift quality will be based on them. Decisions will be taken as part of the 1999 Budget.

The Budget includes provision to fund the proposals arising from the Green Paper, Assessment for Success in the Primary Sector. Included in the proposals are external tests for primary school aged students at key year levels.

Increased focus on those schools finding it difficult to deliver a quality education through school improvement and support initiatives. Another $10.2 million over three years is being added to funding available to help these schools. The Ministry of Education will work with individual schools and clusters of schools to develop action plans to lift the quality of education.

An innovations funding pool will be set up to support programmes for at risk students. In addition the Project K Trust will receive $56,000 this financial year to help with their work to improve the self esteem and achievement of young people at risk.

Books in Homes will be extended to offer all students in the schools in the lowest socio economic areas (decile one) books to keep. The $1.4 million new funding will pay for another 20,000 children in the poorest 10% of schools to own books which they can enjoy at any time.

Renewed commitment to making sure funding needed for Special Education 2000 is available. Special Education 2000 is being phased in to schools and further decisions are being made. Special Education 2000 means more resources and professional support for teachers and students to the benefit of students.

As part of the need to ensure school leadership is top quality, boards of trustees will receive extra funding to help pay for their principal's performance assessment. An extra $6.75 million over three years.

There have been a large number of initiatives in the last two Budgets specifically focused on Maori education. This year's Budget seeks to improve outcomes for Maori students through the range of general education initiatives.

The new Family Start Programme will use $3 million of education funding to get better educational results for the young people involved.

Students from low income families will have greater choice for their education with the continuation of the targeted individual entitlement scheme. An extra $3.15 million over three years will pay to continue the scheme. The scheme, which gives students who would not have the chance to attend private schools the opportunity to do so, was due to finish this year. It will continue to fund 160 new places each year from now on.

Students will be able to take part in more educational experiences outside the classroom with another $3.4 million over three years for the pool of money to pay for learning experiences outside the classroom. These experiences will be offered in more geographical areas and schools will have a greater choice.

The subsidy for private schools will be adjusted to cover extra costs the schools have to bear because of changes to government policy such as the Unified Pay System, $9.8 million more over three years.
