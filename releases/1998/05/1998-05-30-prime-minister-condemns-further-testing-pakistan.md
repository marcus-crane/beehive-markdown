Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight that New Zealand utterly condemns the further nuclear testing carried out by Pakistan.

"This highly irresponsible action will only increase tension in South Asia. It is essential in this dangerous situation that the countries in the region should exercise the greatest restraint and avoid any moves which might lead to further escalation.

"Once again, I strongly urge Pakistan and India to step back from confrontation.

"They should immediately cease testing, give up their efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and unconditionally adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

"New Zealand will be consulting other Governments about what steps the international community can take to register its strong concern," Mrs Shipley said.
