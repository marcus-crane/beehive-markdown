"Mt Albert Grammar is among the many schools nationwide to benefit from extra government funding for new classrooms and upgrading work," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said on opening Mt Albert Grammar's new aquatic centre today in Auckland.

The Government contributed $200,000 towards the cost of the new facilities as part of a Financial Assistance Scheme where the Government and the school community split the bill for the project.

"As well as the stunning new Aquatic Centre, Mt Albert Grammar has recently received $1.6 million in government funding to build a 10 classroom block, which includes a music and art suite.

"This block will not only provide first-class facilities for students and teachers, it will also help the school towards catering for any expected growth in its roll over the coming years."

Mrs Shipley said the Coalition Government will build nearly 1000 more classrooms in a total of 520 primary and secondary schools around the country this year.

Furthermore, a record of 1200 schools have also been given the go ahead for new property projects under the Financial Assistance Scheme.

"This Government has set very high standards for education. In the Coalition Agreement we stated that we see education as the single most important investment that can be made in New Zealand's future," said Mrs Shipley.

"We are living up to that commitment. This year, schools will receive close to $270 million extra funding. They'll get more for their day-to-day running costs, more to help students with special education needs and more to help meet the growing demand for classrooms.

"The Government is committed to funding quality outcomes and to achieve that we have a clear obligation to see that the resources in the sector are used to best advantage.

"Anything less than excellence in education for our children's future must be judged unacceptable," said Mrs Shipley.
