The Minister of Fisheries, Hon John Luxton, today announced that Dr Brent Wheeler would no longer be involved in the review of the Fisheries Act 1996.

'Dr Wheeler has made a good start to the review, but he has informed me that due to pressing work commitments, he is no longer in a position to complete the review within the agreed timeframe'.

'Work on the review is well advanced, and I am pleased with what has been achieved to date. I will be considering a number of options to maintain the momentum of the review.

'It is important that there is continued independent input into the review' Mr Luxton said.

'I am committed to simplifying the operation of the Fisheries Act, and if possible reducing compliance costs on stakeholders. It is important for the sustainable utilisation of our fishery resource that we ensure the Act is as user friendly as possible.'
