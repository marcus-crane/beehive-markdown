The number of registered nurses per head of population working in public hospitals has shown a dramatic increase since 1980, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"There are now nearly 50 percent more registered nurses, including midwives, working in public hospitals per 100,000 people than there were in 1980.

"In 1980 there were 345 registered nurses per 100,000 people. In 1996 that number had climbed to 513, an increase of 49 percent.

"People are always talking about the number of nurses in public hospitals falling, but these figures show this is not true.

"The number of doctors per 100,000 population working in public hospitals has remained fairly static since 1992, after falling slightly from 1988," said Mr English.

The information was collated in response to a Parliamentary Question from Labour MP Annette King.
