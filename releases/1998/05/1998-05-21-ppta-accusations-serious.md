The Minister of Education said today he was treating very seriously repeated accusations from the PPTA President that the Minister was a "liar."

"I utterly refute Mr Cooney's claims made on National Radio and TVNZ this morning.

"The PPTA President is desperately grasping at any straw to defend his executive's decision to put the education of thousands of secondary school students at risk because of their opposition to a Budget decision," Mr Creech said.

"I am offended by the PPTA President's repeated assertion that I am lying to the public. I have been approached by many people who are upset at the tactics the PPTA President is using.

"I am more than happy to debate the issues in a fair and frank manner, but to resort to personal abuse in this manner is completely unacceptable.

"The real issue at stake is the loss of education for secondary school aged students. It is incredibly unfair and professional irresponsible for the PPTA to use students to promote their opposition to the Fully Funded Option of resourcing schools.

"The Budget decision has absolutely nothing to do with the secondary teacher's pay talks. All secondary school teachers need to know that the Ministry of Education is willing to negotiate their pay and conditions in good faith.

"I urge them to think very seriously about what they are doing."
