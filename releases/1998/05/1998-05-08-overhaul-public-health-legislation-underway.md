Health Minister Bill English said today a major overhaul of public health legislation was underway, with new legislation likely to be introduced to Parliament late next year.

"Public health legislation covers things like water, sewage and other waste disposal, food, and the misuse of drugs. It includes a large amount of complex legislation and the Health Act 1956 in particular has long been in need of overhaul.

"At present it is easier for a Medical Officer of Health in this country to get a rubbish bin emptied than to respond to an outbreak of cryptosporidium in public drinking water. This is the bug that has caused enormous problems in some public swimming pools recently.

"The first stage of the work to overhaul public health legislation involves a review of existing legislation, along with wide consultation about options for the scope and shape of future public health legislation.

"Community input into the review is vital. A public consultation paper being prepared by the Ministry of Health should be ready for release in late July or early August," he said.

Mr English said new legislation would be designed to improve, promote and protect public health. It would include provisions designed to:

\- manage actual and potential risks to public health  
\- give clear responsibilities and accountabilities  
\- ensure monitoring and reporting of public health  
\- give explicit emergency powers  
\- co-ordinate with other laws and regulations, including international obligations  
\- avoid undue infringement of human rights and privacy

Submissions on the consultation paper would close later this year, with a Bill drafted for introduction to Parliament towards the end of next year, said Mr English.
