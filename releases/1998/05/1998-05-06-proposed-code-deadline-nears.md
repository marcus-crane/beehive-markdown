Individuals, families, households and groups have just two days to have their say and respond to the proposed Code of Social and Family Responsibility, says Minister of Social Welfare Hon Roger Sowry.

"The eleven social issues covered in the proposed code booklet are relevant to every New Zealander so it is important that everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the debate.

"All too often Governments are criticised for not consulting with New Zealanders, so with this debate we have very deliberately sought the views of all New Zealanders.

"Every response to the proposed code that is sent in to the Department of Social Welfare irrespective of who it is from, will be analysed.

"Many New Zealanders have already taken the opportunity to have their say on the vital issues raised in the proposed and to date we have received around 90,000 responses with more coming in every day.

"This discussion booklet signals the beginning in the debate about what New Zealanders believe their social responsibilities are. I expect the discussion to continue well beyond Friday's deadline for responses," says Mr Sowry.

To order extra copies of the booklet, translated copies - available in Maori, Cook Islands Maori, Samoan, Tongan and Chinese - audio tapes or group discussion packs, call the freephone number 0800 400 100.
