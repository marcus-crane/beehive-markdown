"New Zealand's success in the emerging global Knowledge Economy will largely depend on our research organisations ability to assist our primary and secondary producers to become first in time and fleet of foot," Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Hon Maurice Williamson said today.

Mr Williamson made his comments while opening the Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research Building extension at Massey University earlier today.

"New Zealand's research organisations need to respond to international initiatives such as the Global Village," the Minister said.

"This is a development of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which seeks to redefine the role of information technology for science and to maximise its benefits both nationally and internationally.

"Landcare is one of our leading research organisations that can put New Zealand at the forefront of today's knowledge revolution. There is a need to develop new knowledge that enables us to lead technologies and processes that add value to new and traditional products.

"Scientific research is advancing explosively on all fronts.

"The benefits include a vast array of new knowledge, economic opportunities, and products. These range from genetic testing, biological controls, prediction of climate events, and new information systems, to the discovery of new drugs derived from natural products.

"I congratulate Landcare for its leadership role in applying Foresight principles to its strategic planning and its commitment to the application of Treaty of Waitangi principles.

"Manaaki Whenua - Manaaki Tangata, Care for the Land - Care for the People." Mr Williamson said.
