The Coalition Government is fully committed to increasing the number of frontline police on the streets, Police Minister Jack Elder said today.

"A central goal of the Coalition Agreement is to take a tougher approach to law and order. This means moving Police resources from the tail to the teeth wherever possible."

Mr Elder said that since this Government came to power in December 1996, there has been a steady increase in the number of police officers on the beat, and an increase in the Police budget.

"I am very confident all law-abiding New Zealanders will welcome what this week's Budget will deliver for community safety."

The development of redundancy provisions for sworn staff was driven by the requirement to move resources from administration to the front-line, Mr Elder said.
