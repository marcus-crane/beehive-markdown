Health Minister Bill English today announced that he had approved a $80,000 grant to the Marlborough Transitional Health Trust for development work.

"The Trust has done a lot of work already and built up public support for its plans. However, it has a lot of work ahead of it still and this grant will reward the Trust's initiative and ensure that work can continue. It is also a tangible sign of my commitment to this project.

"I am supporting this proposal with a development grant because the idea is well developed, it has commitment from a number of important groups, and because it is unique in that it is on a much larger scale than other projects for new types of health services to date.

"The Government is very keen to have the opportunity to look at how local control and integrated services actually work in practice. The Trust is working towards being chosen as one of the Health Funding Authority's integrated care demonstration projects and this grant will help the Trust reach this status.

"There are no guarantees of success, but I believe we ought to try out an idea that looks like an improvement on existing services. The Trust has shown its ability to get the local services to work together as demonstrated by the changes to the emergency service.

"The grant will be made from the Provider Development Fund," said Mr English.
