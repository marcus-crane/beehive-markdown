"The public and students will welcome the PPTA's decision to stop the proposed industrial action next week," Education Minister Wyatt Creech and Associate Education Minister Brian Donnelly said today.

?The proposed action would be totally counter to the interests of the education of the young people of New Zealand. Young people should not be used as pawns in a political campaign.

?While we welcome the decision of the PPTA to call off its industrial action, we want the union leadership to now end all the political games and get back into proper negotiation on teacher pay and conditions."

Education Minister Wyatt Creech outlined the proper process from hereon in the House today.

?The Government position is very clear and has been all along. We are willing to talk but the PPTA leadership must inform the Ministry that it will immediately call off all industrial action and threats of industrial action, both local and national, and agree to negotiate in good faith on pay and conditions matters. They should put to the Secretary of Education a realistic claim on industrial matters and remove all claims that are essentially items of government policy.

"We have made it clear that once these actions have been complied with, the Secretary of Education can quickly make an offer on pay and conditions.

"The Ministry of Education has always had its door open for the PPTA, to return to talks on pay and conditions.

"Over recent weeks a lot of work has been done to prepare a very fair pay offer to secondary teachers. We have been working in good faith to prepare a pay offer so issues such as teacher recruitment and retention can be dealt with.

"It has been disappointing that the PPTA has put all its energy into opposing the Government's policy on direct resourcing of teachers' salaries and trying to set the Government's policy agenda so as to make it impossible to get meaningful talks underway.

"A lot of time is being wasted that could be used more constructively on settling the employment contract," the Ministers concluded.
