Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says she expects the debate on social responsibility to continue after the official close-off date for submissions tomorrow.

Speaking at a function introducing the new Auckland City Missioner Diane Robertson, Mrs Shipley said the Government has so far received almost 90,000 responses from individuals and groups to the discussion document "Towards a Code of Family and Social Responsibility".

"I am heartened that so many New Zealanders have put their minds to the issues in that document. In particular I have been struck by the number of teachers who have welcomed this debate. Many have expressed the urgent need for us to get to the heart of social issues, rather than leaving teachers and schools to struggle with the symptoms of social dysfunction.

I'm aware we have provoked some New Zealanders by even raising these questions. That's a good thing in that it has prompted people to take an interest. I understand the majority of responses are from people who have taken the time and trouble to make constructive comments and the government appreciates their contribution.

"I look forward to seeing the analysis of the responses, and I am sure further debate will be sparked when the analysis is made public.

"The central question, of what the Government should do for New Zealanders and what we can and should expect people to do for themselves, is something we must all think about every day.

"The Auckland City Mission, like other voluntary groups, makes an important contribution to assisting disadvantaged New Zealanders, both in emergencies and by adding a caring dimension such as with its holiday camps and library services.

"The caring society we all want can best be achieved by a partnership in which individuals, communities and the Government all take a share of responsibility," Mrs Shipley concluded.
