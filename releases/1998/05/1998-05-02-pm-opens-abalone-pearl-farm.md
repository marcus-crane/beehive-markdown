"Foreign investment that creates jobs for New Zealanders should be welcomed by us all," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today as she opened the Rainbow Abalone Pearl Farm at Port Taranaki in New Plymouth.

"Rainbow Abalone has branched out from producing juvenile paua for farming to pearl production, following an investment of capital from Taiwan.

"This is a good example of foreign capital and kiwi ingenuity combining to produce jobs for New Zealanders.

"For New Zealand to continue to do well in the world, our business people must constantly be looking for the next new idea for adding value to our abundant natural resources.

"Developing a business often requires capital investment, and for many years New Zealand companies have looked overseas, as well as at home, for that investment. I note that the meat industry for example was built on foreign investment, when British companies paid for the first refrigerated ships.

"The paua or abalone pearl industry is relatively new, with only a handful of producers so far. However, I am sure the unique beauty of these pearls will see the market for them continuing to expand.

"I wish the company well for the future."

Rainbow Abalone has been farming paua since 1993, and is now moving into pearl production in the new building opened by the Prime Minister today. The company has 11 staff.
