The Government has decided to free up the New Zealand hop industry, by removing the statutory backing for the New Zealand Hop Marketing Board, Hon John Luxton, Associate Minister of Agriculture announced today.

As with other producer boards, the Government has invited the Board to report back by 15 November 1998 on its deregulation plans and proposed time line.

"The Government recognises the need to manage the transition to a deregulated industry structure in a way that minimises disruptions to the production and marketing of New Zealand hops, Mr Luxton said

"I want to encourage all industry participants to take part in developing plans to free up this industry."
