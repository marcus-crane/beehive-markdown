Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton welcomed political and economic measures announced earlier this week by the Indonesian Government as an encouraging step towards peaceful and constitutional reforms in Indonesia.

"President Habibie and his new Cabinet announced plans to prepare for new parliamentary elections and to continue working with the IMF on measures to restore economic confidence. There was also welcome news on the human rights front, with the release of two political prisoners and progress with a military investigation into the killing of six students at a Jakarta protest earlier this month. The Government welcomes Indonesia's early response to calls for peaceful change", Mr Upton said.

"New Zealand recognises the enormous challenges facing Indonesia as it implements these necessary reforms. Indonesia has been through traumatic times recently and many difficult decisions still lie ahead. But, the Indonesian people, military and government have displayed considerable restraint over the past week. We hope this calm will prevail and will be reinforced by early implementation of the reform programme proposed by the new President and Cabinet", Mr Upton said.

"Our Embassy in Jakarta is continuing to monitor developments in Indonesia closely. The situation in Jakarta and elsewhere in Indonesia is slowly returning to normal and many of those who had left the country are starting to return. We have amended our travel advice for New Zealanders. We are now suggesting that those with essential business in Indonesia could consider returning there. Our advice to tourists, however, is that travel to Indonesia should be restricted to Bali and Lombok. All New Zealanders in Indonesia should continue to take sensible security precautions", Mr Upton concluded.
