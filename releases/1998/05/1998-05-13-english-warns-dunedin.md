Health Minister Bill English warned today that constant hostility in Dunedin to public health agencies could mean the city lost the race for the jobs that went with the Health Funding Authority support functions.

"I am working to see government functions located in the south because I believe we can offer advantages with low overheads and a stable labour force.

"On the other hand, Dunedin leadership has been consistently hostile to the regional health authority, now the HFA, often for political reasons. Other cities have a better understanding of why the HFA is a good idea and would welcome the jobs it brings.

"Last week's attack by Labour MP Pete Hodgson on the HFA's Transformation '98 project is just the latest example of the problem. I don't want to subject the HFA staff to consistent attack," said Mr English.
