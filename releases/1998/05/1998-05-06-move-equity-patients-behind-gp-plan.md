Health Minister Bill English said a fairer system for patients was behind the national strategy on general practice being developed by the Health Funding Authority.

"Not all people in New Zealand get a fair go from the way we currently pay for primary care services such as visits to the doctor, prescriptions and laboratory tests.

"Currently about $300 is spent each year for every person in the country for these services, but whether people get a fair share of that fluctuates considerably depending on where they live. Some areas get more spent on them than the national average and, more worryingly, some get less.

"Traditionally people in rural areas have missed out because doctors are less likely to go there and the money goes with the doctor, not the patient. People in low income areas have also missed out and we know this new system will benefit Maori and Pacific Island people in particular.

"By paying for general practice services in this new way we will get more focus on preventative health in the community. Doctors will have to do more to keep people healthy, rather than waiting for them to get sick.

"We are spending more and more on health in the community and this plan is an important step towards a fairer system and better health services for all New Zealanders," said Mr English.
