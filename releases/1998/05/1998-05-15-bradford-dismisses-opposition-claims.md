Energy Minister Max Bradford today dismissed Opposition claims about Budget funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) as showing the Labour Party's lack of understanding of the Estimates.

Mr Bradford said the estimates showed, as had been summarised in a media release yesterday, that total funding for EECA will be $4.3 million for core activities in 1998/99, plus a further $300 000 for administration of the Energy Saver Fund.

This is an increase over the $2.4 million which had originally been allocated for core activities. A further $2 million has also been allocated for the following two years to assist EECA "s transition to working with less Government funding and greater input from the private sector

Meanwhile, Mr Bradford today released a consultancy study which assesses the costs, benefits and effectiveness of the activities of EECA.

The report by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) looked into the effectiveness of EECA"s broad strategy and eleven of its specific energy efficiency programmes.

"The review has highlighted a number of major programme areas where EECA"s activities have been rated as highly effective, and has also identified some smaller programmes which are less effective," Mr Bradford said.

"Following on from the review, the Government has concluded that it will continue to fund the promotion of energy efficiency, as noted in the Budget press statement.

"There is a strong view, however, that EECA"s present organisational form could be improved to enhance its future progress. Officials are will now be looking at this."
