The world's most powerful country, the United States, has agreed to support the Cairns Group's trade liberalisation vision for the 1999 agricultural negotiations, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said from Geneva today.

The United States' commitment came at a meeting between US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and US Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and representatives of Cairns Group countries, at this week's World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial in Geneva.

New Zealand and its allies were successful at the WTO ministerial in ensuring that the agricultural negotiations will be successfully launched at the end of 1999 as mandated by the Uruguay Round agreement.

"To now have the US fully on board will provide an enormous boost to the Cairns Group's agenda," Dr Smith said.

Earlier this year in Sydney, Cairns Group countries agreed to work together to have agricultural trade put on the same basis as trade in other goods. Specifically, the Cairns Group will seek:

- the elimination of export subsidies and government subsidisation of export credits;
- open market access and deep cuts in tariffs; and
- improved disciplines on domestic support, including the decoupling of support from production.

"Secretary Glickman also reconfirmed the US's intention to add state trading enterprises to this list," Dr Smith said.

"Now that we have that issue out of the way in New Zealand, we are well placed to work with the US to ensure our extremely important Cairns Group objectives are met."
