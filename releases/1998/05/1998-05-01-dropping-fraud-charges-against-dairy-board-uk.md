Trade and Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed news that UK Customs has decided to drop the two remaining fraud charges against Dairy Board staff and companies in the UK.

He said the "very pleasing decision" establishes that the individuals and companies in the UK are not guilty of the charges.

"This is another very significant contribution towards resolving in a sensible way the issues which have arisen concerning the board's trade with the European Union.

"The board will now be able to bring its full attention to the remaining issues contained in the European Court of Auditors' report released last week.

"The decision by UK Customs is to be welcomed. I hope that it will set the seal on restoring a climate of reasonableness in which all parties can address the remaining issues affecting the Dairy Board," he said.
