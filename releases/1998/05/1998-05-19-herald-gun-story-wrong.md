A story on gun control published in Monday's New Zealand Herald stated the Government had decided to buy-back firearms, Police Minister Jack Elder said today.

"This is incorrect.

"The front-page story alleged the Government had decided to implement all the recommendations in the Thorp Review of Firearms Control, including a buy-back of military-style semi-automatic weapons, and had budgeted $25 million for this.

"It appears, however, the journalist did not understand the nature of the Budget document he was reading, and did not notice the explanatory statement."

The journalist found reference to the firearms review in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update document, not the Estimates document itself.

The reference to the firearms review was in the section titled 'Specific Fiscal Risks' and it clearly stated:

'The risks have been not included in the main forecasts because: their fiscal impact cannot be reasonably quantified; the likelihood of realisation is uncertain; and/or the timing is uncertain."

"I repeat: the Government is yet to decide on the extent of its implementation of the Review of Firearms Control recommendations."
