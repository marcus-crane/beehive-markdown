"Parliament will host a reception to honour the achievement of the New Zealand Women's Rugby Team, in winning the Women's Rugby World Cup tournament in Amsterdam," the Minister of Sport Murray McCully said today.

"The Prime Minister as Minister of Women's Affairs, the Associate Minister Hon Deborah Morris and I have met, and we have decided that some formal recognition is due given the scale of the NZ Womens Rugby Team's achievement," he said.

"I have extended an invitation to the NZ Rugby Football Union on behalf of the Government, and a date will be fixed when most squad members have returned."

"The NZ Womens Rugby Team has really put women's rugby on the map in this country. The huge volume of support and interest in their World Cup campaign will be reflected in an official Parliamentary reception."
