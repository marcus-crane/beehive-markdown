Ministers from New Zealand and Fiji today signed a package of new air services arrangements.

The signing ceremony at the New Zealand Official Residence in Suva brought together New Zealand's Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson and Fiji's Minister for Tourism and Transport, Mr David Pickering CBE, during the South Pacific Forum Aviation Ministers Meeting in Suva.

"The arrangements will give the airlines of both countries increased opportunities and flexibility to provide services for the benefit  
of tourism industries in Fiji, New Zealand and other countries in the South Pacific", Mr Williamson said.

"Airlines of both countries will have greater flexibility in determining the frequency of new services through the other country," Mr Pickering said.

"Fiji's airline, Air Pacific, will be able to operate, if it wishes to, through New Zealand to Honolulu and Los Angeles with the same frequency as operated by New Zealand airlines through Nadi to these destinations," the Ministers said.

"The new arrangements also make provision for code-share services, including third-country airlines, and remove a previous restriction on the number of airlines that may be designated by each country.

"These arrangements are a positive step in moving the aviation relationship forward to the benefit of both New Zealand and Fiji", the Ministers said.
