Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said that he is dismayed and disappointed that Pakistan has exploded a nuclear device.

"I had hoped that Pakistan would continue to exercise restraint, despite provocation from India. New Zealand has been urging Pakistan not to respond, including a message Don McKinnon sent to their Foreign Minister".

"Pakistan had the opportunity to refrain from testing, and thereby show its international maturity. It is deeply disappointing that it has not taken that opportunity, and is now contributing towards a spiralling arms race in South Asia, as well as dealing a further setback to the cause of nuclear disarmament. I totally deplore the fact that Pakistan has decided to take this step onto the escalation ladder."

"I have instructed the New Zealand embassy in Tehran, which is accredited to Pakistan immediately to convey our formal protest to the Pakistan Government in the strongest possible terms."

"The Pakistan High Commissioner to New Zealand is resident in Canberra. I have accordingly instructed our High Commission in Canberra to advise him formally on my behalf of New Zealand's total opposition to this test, so that this message can also be conveyed to the Pakistan Government."

"We will be using every opportunity in the United Nations and other forums, working with other like-minded countries, to bring home to both Pakistan and India the enormity of their actions, which are rejected by the entire world community."
