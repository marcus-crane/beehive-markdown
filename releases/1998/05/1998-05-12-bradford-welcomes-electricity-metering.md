Energy Minister Max Bradford today welcomed energy company Powerco's launch of leading technology that will enable residential electricity and gas consumers to manage their power use and choose their energy supplier.

Mr Bradford said such developments were a vital aspect of the energy reforms announced by the Government last month. "This is the future in the electricity sector and will give the benefits to small consumers that they deserve".

Mr Bradford said that he was told a year ago that there was little potential for price saving for small consumers but the announcement today suggests small consumers could save between three and four hundred dollars a year. "This development gives consumers more control about when to use electricity and make savings by making decisions such as when to use the washing machine" Mr Bradford said.
