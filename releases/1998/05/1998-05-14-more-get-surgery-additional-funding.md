About 30,000 people will get elective surgery procedures each year with the additional funding of $253 million over three years in this year's health package, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"This previously announced additional money will mean that the increase in elective surgery made possible through the Waiting Times Fund (WTF) can be maintained and a further increase in surgery achieved in 1998/99. An estimated 130,000 procedures will be done in 1998/99 - an increase of 16 percent.

"Doctors and nurses around the country are working hard to put in place a booking system for elective surgery, which will mean a much fairer system for people waiting for surgery.

"This extra funding shows that the Government has listened to doctors' concerns and is prepared to find extra money to pay for more surgery.

"It is Government policy to fund a reasonable level of elective surgery. This money is on top of extra funds in last year's Budget to extend the Waiting Times Fund."

Mr English said the additional elective procedures would be purchased by the Health Funding Authority and would be allocated fairly to regions to help move towards national consistency in surgery rates. However, the additional funding would only be made available as hospitals got up and running with the Booking System.

"It has been anticipated that Booking Systems will be in place for at least 70 percent of elective surgery services in hospitals by 1 July 1998. The complexities of implementing this system nationally should not be underestimated, but I expect the system to be fully in place within two years.

"People who need surgery the most must be treated first. The Booking System is the only fair way of prioritising need around the country," he said.
