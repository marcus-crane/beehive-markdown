The ACC scheme is a compulsory, government regulated, 24 hour, no fault, accident compensation scheme. It covers all New Zealanders, employers, self employed, earners, non-earners and motor vehicle owners, for physical injuries that happen at work and outside of work.

Major scheme benefits include 80% weekly income compensation, death and funeral benefits, medical treatment, vocational rehabilitation, social rehabilitation and the independence allowance. The scheme is managed and delivered by a Crown monopoly, ARCIC, which employs more than 2000 people.

There are six accounts: Employers', Earners', Non-earners', Motor Vehicle, Medical Misadventure and Subsequent Work Injury.

Currently, all accounts are based on a pay as you go system where premiums are set each year to recover the expected actual costs of the scheme for that year. About 85 cents of every dollar of the current premium in all accounts is paying for injuries that occurred in previous years.
