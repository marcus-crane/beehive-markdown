Israelis will be able to visit New Zealand for up to three months without needing a visa, Immigration Minister Max Bradford announced today.

He said the decision was taken to foster closer contacts between Israelis and New Zealanders, particularly in business and tourism.

"Increasing numbers of Israelis are seeking to visit New Zealand and it is important that we put in place a people friendly arrangement that encourages  
and facilitates an easy exchange between our two countries," Mr Bradford said.

The announcement is particularly timely, Mr Bradford said, as today New Zealanders are extending their warmest wishes to the people of Israel as they celebrate the establishment of the State of Israel 50 years ago.
