Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today welcomed the new health initiatives that have been made possible by massive savings resulting from recent contracts signed between PHARMAC, the Government's drug purchasing agent, and two big overseas drug companies.

A contract signed with the Swiss company, Roche Products, means more than a million dollars will be slashed from the national drug bill over the next year, while New Zealanders will get subsidised access to a new drug to help prevent acute kidney rejection; interferon treatment for hepatitis; a new medicine to combat Parkinson's disease; and lower prices for other medicines.

Another recent deal with Parke Davis widens the number of subsidised treatments available to New Zealanders and is expected to save $150 million over the next six years.

"Savings of that magnitude mean PHARMAC and the Health Funding Agency can start planning for

- the supply of nicotine patches to help people stop smoking
- full subsidy on a specialist drug for glaucoma
- the investigation of possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease and
- the development of a treatment package for osteoporosis.

"The anti-smoking programme may be aimed at Maori, among whom heavy smoking is a significant factor contributing to health problems," said the Minister.

"I am delighted that the work of PHARMAC in battling to reduce the cost of drugs is flowing through into other parts of the health services of this country," he said.
