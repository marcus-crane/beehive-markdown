The quest for Parliament's laziest MP is over. We have our winner. Ladies and gentlemen the prize for the all-time, part-timer goes to ACT leader Richard Prebble.

In announcing the winner, Deputy Prime Minister and New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters says the competition was fierce.

"But in the end Mr Prebble was a clear winner, coming from behind to beat his colleagues Ken Shirley, Donna Awatere Huata and Derek Quigley.

"Ken's attendance at the environment and transport select committee meetings was an admirable 25 per cent. Poor Donna scored zero for her attendance at education and science select committee meetings this year, while Derek attended at least 7.6 per cent of the health select committee meetings.

"But the winner by a country mile is Mr Richard Prebble, the part-time work horse of the ACT party.

"Mr Prebble hasn't been seen at the commerce select committee since 12 August, last year, making him the laziest MP in Parliament. This might explain why the Wellington Central MP has such a high travel bill.

"The failure by ACT MPs to fulfill their Parliamentary duties is unfair to taxpayers and a disgrace to Parliament. They should resign to make way for other people who are willing to work full-time," Mr Peters said.
