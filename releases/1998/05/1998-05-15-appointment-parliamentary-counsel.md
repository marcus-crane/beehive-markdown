The Attorney-General, Hon D.A.M. Graham, today announced the appointment of W.A. (Bill) Moore as a Parliamentary Counsel in the Parliamentary Counsel Office.

Mr Moore, currently Corporate Manager of the Ministry of Justice's Legal Services Group, will take up his appointment in August.

Mr Graham said the Parliamentary Counsel Office is fortunate in securing the services of such an experienced and highly regarded lawyer. The appointment will add further strength to the office, which is in the process of building up its drafting resource.

Mr Moore, who graduated BA LLB from Victoria University in 1979, has extensive legal experience in Government.

In his current role he is responsible for the co-ordination of the Ministry of Justice's legislative programme, he is a core official on the Cabinet Committee for Legislation and House Business and he is a member of the Criminal Practice Committee.

He provides legal advice to the Ministry and the Minister of Justice on a wide range of issues, including advice on applications for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and on the exercise of powers under section 406 of the Crimes Act. He is also responsible for Bill of Rights monitoring of Government legislation apart from legislation in the Justice portfolio.

Mr Moore is a former Senior Legal Adviser in the Department of Justice's Law Reform Division. His area of expertise includes criminal law and procedure, extradition, official information, electoral law and copyright. He has also had an extensive involvement in the development of legislative proposals in other areas, including transport and child welfare.

He worked on a number of significant Bills including those relating to bail, electoral reform, copyright and extradition.

Before joining Law Reform Division, he worked as a solicitor in the Department of Labour where his responsibilities included litigation, contracts and opinion work, and legislation.

The Parliamentary Counsel Office is responsible for drafting most of New Zealand's legislation.
