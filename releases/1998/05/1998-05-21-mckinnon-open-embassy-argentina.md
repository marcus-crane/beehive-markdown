Don McKinnon will become New Zealand's first Foreign Minister to officially visit Latin America when he makes a five-nation visit to Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile from May 26 to June 11.

A key part of the visit is the opening of the New Zealand Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This means New Zealand will have full diplomatic representation in Argentina, as well as in Chile and Mexico.

"This visit reflects the growing expansion of trade, political and people-to-people links between New Zealand and Latin America," said Mr McKinnon.

"The time is right to build on the contact established through the large number of recent visits to New Zealand by Ministers from Latin America. These countries are showing an interest in New Zealand. Each of them has diplomatic representation in our Capital. It is now time for us to reciprocate this interest."

Mr McKinnon said many assumptions about Latin American countries are well out of date.

"The countries I am visiting are all democracies, with economic policies driven by market forces. They have a combined population of 236 million - the potential is huge.

"We have much in common. We have consulted closely with Latin American nations in the United Nations, where our term on the Security Council coincided with Argentina's, and we have worked together in the WTO and the Cairns Group on agricultural trade access issues. We also share many concerns on environmental issues, including Antarctica."

During the visit Mr McKinnon will be progressing trade and bilateral issues in his discussions with senior ministers. He will also meet with President Fujimori of Peru, who visits New Zealand in June; President Sanguinetti of Uruquay; President Menem of Argentina, who visited New Zealand in April; and President Frei of Chile.

Mr McKinnon will first visit Peru, which will have its first year as a full member of APEC under New Zealand's chairmanship in 1999. He will meet with New Zealand business people in Peru, and will address the Peruvian Diplomatic academy on APEC.

He will then travel onto Uruguay and Brazil, before visiting Argentina, where on 5 June he will open New Zealand's new Embassy in Buenos Aires. The Embassy will be accredited to Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. These countries combine with Argentina to make up the member states of the Mercosur customs union. He will also address the Argentinian Council of International Relations.

He will travel to Chile for bilateral meetings on June 6.

Mr McKinnon will also visit New Zealand 'sister schools' in Argentina and Chile. These school-to-school relationships were established as part of the Focus Latin America programme the Minister launched in 1996.

He is scheduled to return to New Zealand on Thursday 11 June.
