Health Minister Bill English said today the start of Diabetes Awareness Week was a good time for people to think about their lifestyle and the changes they could make to help prevent diabetes and other lifestyle-related health problems.

"Good health is so much in our own hands. We must all take responsibility for doing what we can to keep ourselves healthy, which is the message in the Code of Social Responsibility.

"Diabetes is a good example. Simple lifestyle changes like more exercise and cutting down on fat, especially animal fat, can vastly reduce our chances of getting diabetes.

"A recent study from Auckland showed that it is possible to control weight in an entire community through lifestyle changes. The study, led by Dr David Simmons of Auckland University's School of Medicine, involved two Samoan church groups which is particularly significant because Pacific Islanders are a high-risk group for diabetes. The findings from this study have enormous implications for the control of diabetes and other lifestyle diseases.

"There are an estimated 82,000 people with diagnosed diabetes in New Zealand and the costs of hospital care from diabetes is estimated at $95 million. This shows quite graphically the impact this condition has on society as a whole," said Mr English.
