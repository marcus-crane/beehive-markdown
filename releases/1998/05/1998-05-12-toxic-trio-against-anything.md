Labour, the Alliance and the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists were the toxic trio of health because they opposed anything and everything, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"Capitation funding has been criticised as a Trojan Horse, but there are no secrets in this health policy.

"I invite the toxic trio to go and talk to people who have tried capitation funding so that they are better informed about it. That way we can debate the benefits for patients, rather than the tired prejudices of the extreme left wing.

"Oddly enough, capitation is supported most strongly by Maori health services, Union clinics, and GPs in low income areas - all of whom Labour and Alliance purport to represent. The toxic trio's opposition to capitation funding is based more on political correctness than understanding of how better services can be provided.

"There are no secrets in this scheme. I have always stated openly we are willing to work with anyone who can help us do a better job of health services for New Zealanders.

"No-one has a magic answer, but I will look for progress anywhere I can find it," said Mr English.
