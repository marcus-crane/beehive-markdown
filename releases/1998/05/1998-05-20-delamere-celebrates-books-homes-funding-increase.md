Associate Treasurer Hon Tuariki Delamere has welcomed the extra funding of almost half a million dollars announced in last week's Budget for the Books in Homes programme, operated by the Alan Duff Charitable Foundation.

Mr Delamere, who is also a Foundation director, said "This extra funding is a tribute to the vision of Alan Duff and the tenacious hard work of Christine Fernyhough in implementing that vision."

The programme targets schools in low income areas with high numbers of Maori and Pacific Island children. It currently provides 39,000 pupils in 150 schools with five books a year.

The new funding will raise the Foundation's annual budget to $827,000, allowing the provision of books to be extended to 20,000 more students.

Mr Delamere said "An October 1977 evaluation of the Books in Homes programme found it had generated positive attitudes towards reading by both students and their families, and in improving student reading achievement levels."
