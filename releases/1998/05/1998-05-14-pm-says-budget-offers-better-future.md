"Today's Budget gives New Zealanders good reason to be confident about the future," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said.

"The National-New Zealand First Coalition Government Budget positions us well for the next year and the next century, by continuing sound economic management while delivering enhanced social services and a firm but fair approach to welfare. "In the currently difficult international climate, times are tough for many businesses.

The government is acknowledging that by putting on hold $300 million of planned spending. "We are also making significant progress on the micro-economic reforms that will make it easier for business to get on with the job.

"The careful fiscal and economic management demonstrated in this Budget provides the necessary support for our economy while still delivering in the areas New Zealanders tell us are important to them. "New Zealand families will benefit, both directly through increased spending on services such as health and education, and indirectly through measures aimed at building stronger communities.

These include: ·

More cash in the hand through tax cuts ·  
More certainty that health services will be there when they need them · Improved standards and better quality education for their children at school · More protection from criminal offenders ·  
Extra support for families at need through the Children Young Persons and their Families Service and the Community Funding Agency ·  
A fairer approach to social welfare, by shifting the focus to encouraging people into paid work.  
"The National New Zealand First Coalition is working for a better future," Mrs Shipley concluded. .
