Figures released today by Health Minister Bill English show New Zealand's health spending was the highest it had ever been at 7.8 percent of GDP.

"As well as health spending being the highest ever, the publicly-funded share of health spending is growing and is now 77.3% of total spending compared with 76.7% last year.

"The Government now spends more on health for every person in this country. This year public spending is $1,577 per head in real terms on health, which is an increase of 4.3% over the year before.

"This shows the Government is meeting its commitment to spend more on health," said Mr English.

The figures are contained in the Ministry of Health's report Health Expenditure Trends 1980-97.

Health funding information in this year's report is more complete as it now includes money provided by Government to allow CHEs to meet their debts (deficit funding). The bulk of CHE deficit funding is used to provide health services (around 92% of total CHE deficits or $236 million in 1996/97) and is included as part of public health expenditure.

Total health spending has gone up from $6.9 billion in 1995/96 to $7.4 billion in 1996/97. This includes public and private spending on health.

Public spending on health increased by $418 million to $5.76 billion. The amount of privately funded spending during 1996/97 also rose by about $65 million to $1.7 billion although the percentage of total spending dropped from 23.3% to 22.7%.

The amount spent by private health insurance companies continues to grow - up 7.7% to $503 million. However, the number of people privately insured is down to 37% from 40% the previous year. The rise in expenditure is attributed to increasing costs and more or bigger claims.

Health Expenditure Trends in New Zealand is produced each year by the Ministry of Health. The latest report provides information on health and disability expenditure in New Zealand during 1996/97 and trends for the period 1980-97.
