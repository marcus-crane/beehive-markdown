Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced that the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung Chee-Hwa will visit New Zealand from 17 to 19 June.

"New Zealand has strong links with Hong Kong and I welcome Mr Tung Chee-Hwa's forthcoming visit." Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley noted that Hong Kong is New Zealand's 7th largest export market, and important source of foreign investment and a destination for offshore investment by New Zealand companies.

In addition, Hong Kong is the base for the largest resident community of New Zealanders in Asia. Since 1986, it has been New Zealand's third largest source of migrants.

While in New Zealand, Mr Tung will meet the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce. In Auckland, Mr Tung will meet representatives from the New Zealand Hong Kong community. The Asia 2000 Foundation will host a business dinner for Mr Tung.

In her talks with Chief Executive Tung, the Prime Minister said she hoped to exchange views on the Asian economic situation, future directions for APEC, the bilateral relationship and developments in Hong Kong since its return to China last year. Mr Tung has headed the HKSAR since the handover.
