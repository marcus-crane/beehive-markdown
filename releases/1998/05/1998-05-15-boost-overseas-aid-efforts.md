New Zealand is to increase the funding available for overseas development assistance, with most of this being earmarked for the Pacific, the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Upton announced today.

Total funding for overseas aid through the New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme, managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will rise to $204.47 million in 1998/99, an increase of $6.28 million over the 1997/98 Budget allocation.

Building on New Zealand's ongoing commitment to the peace process in Bougainville, a major investment is being made in redevelopment in Bougainville. Working with the people of Bougainville and NZ-based NGOs such as OXFAM and VSA, NZODA will support a range of assistance including the reopening of community schools, the provision of lifeskills and vocational training for the ex-combatants, health services, agricultural projects and other technical assistance.

Additional funding has been provided also to support further environmental projects in the Pacific, and some adjustments have been made to funding for Pacific regional organisations to recognise the need to allow greater flexibility in administering ongoing programmes.

Government encouragement for development work undertaken overseas by New Zealand NGOs under the Voluntary Agency Support Scheme has also received a boost to $6.25 million.

Bilateral programmes with the countries of South East Asia will continue at much the same level, with increased emphasis on technical assistance programmes in recognition of the economic difficulties faced by the region and the need for assistance in areas such as public sector reform.

A small increase has been made also to New Zealand's bilateral allocation to Africa and New Zealand's contribution to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation will be lifted by $100, 000 to $1.9 million.

In recognition of New Zealand's Presidency this year of the Executive Board of UNICEF and of the high value placed by New Zealand on the work of this organisation, our core contribution to UNICEF has been increased.

As a percentage of GNP, New Zealand's total commitment to overseas development assistance remains at around 0.25 percent which is the average for OECD countries.

"New Zealand has a reputation for delivering well-targeted, high quality aid.

"This increase, and the way in which it has been allocated, underlines our commitment to addressing the development of our immediate neighbourhood and high priority needs further afield," Mr Upton concluded.
