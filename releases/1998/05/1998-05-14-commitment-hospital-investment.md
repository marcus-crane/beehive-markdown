This year's Budget confirmed the Government's on-going commitment to investing in the country's hospitals, Health Minister Bill English said today.

"Changes were made last year to Vote: Crown Health Enterprises (now Vote: Health Service Providers) to reflect the Government's on-going commitment to the country's hospitals. Those changes are continued this year.

"In the coming financial year about $360 million is expected to be invested to improve public hospitals. This includes new equity invested by the Government, internally generated funds and private sector borrowing.

"Finance has already been committed by the Government for the new Hawkes Bay regional hospital, the Princess Margaret Hospital redevelopment, improvements to Palmerston North Hospital site, and theatre upgrades in Nelson. A significant number of additional projects are being planned around the country and will be considered by the Government in the coming financial year," said Mr English.
