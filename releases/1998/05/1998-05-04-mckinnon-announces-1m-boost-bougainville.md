Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon today announced a $1 million dollar aid package to help kick-start reconstruction on Papua New Guinea's war torn island of Bougainville.

The contribution is the first part of a substantial New Zealand aid package and will assist aid agencies Oxfam and Volunteer Service Abroad (VSA) to implement reconstruction programmes.

Oxfam will assist the islanders to re-open schools and help former soldiers with the transition to civilian life, while VSA will provide teachers, trainers and other personnel for the reconstruction effort as required.

Mr McKinnon said while the initial focus of New Zealand's support would be on schooling, and the rehabilitation of former soldiers, this would broaden as the needs of local people became clearer.

"We will liaise closely with government agencies, other donors and Bougainvilleans to ensure we provide what is actually needed," he said

Mr McKinnon said he hoped New Zealanders would assist with contributions to restoring services on the Island.

"New Zealanders sent $7 million to Somalia. The Bougainville conflict is a lot closer to home - I believe New Zealanders will agree we should be helping the women and children in our own part of the world."

The New Zealand Government is seeking formal approval from the Papua New Guinea Government to set up an aid office in Arawa to coordinate New Zealand's aid effort.

New Zealand reconstruction efforts underway include:

\- A $100,000 contribution to Red Cross to be used by health workers who have worked without clinics or medicines for almost 10 years  
\- A New Zealand police officer is in Arawa to help train the first group of local police.  
\- In addition the New Zealand Government is:  
\- Responding to a request for restoration of health services.

Looking at sending a group of engineers to Bougainville to assist with small-scale projects such as rebuilding schools, meeting houses, health clinics, bridges and transport.

Investigating support for Non-Governmental Organisations' maternal and child health programmes.
