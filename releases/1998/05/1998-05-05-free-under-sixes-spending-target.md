Health Minister Bill English said today that spending on the Government's free under-sixes policy was on target.

"Claims totalling just over $58 million had been made under the programme by the end of April. We budgeted $69 million a year for this scheme and that is proving about right.

"What this means is that families have taken advantage of this scheme by taking children to the doctor for free more than 1.9 million times since the scheme was introduced.

"Today is the International Day of the Family so it is appropriate to look at what the Government is doing to help families with health care. The chief reason for introducing the free under-sixes programme was to make sure that cost was not an obstacle for families wanting to take children to a doctor.

"The total number of claims for free doctor visits is expected to be around 2.3 million by the end of the financial year in June.

"The Government also recently announced another important initiative to help families. Family Start is a very targetted programme to make sure we are reaching families most in need of help.

"An evaluation of the free under-sixes scheme is due to start shortly. This is being done to ensure the programme is as effective as possible in meeting the needs of families. It will also be looking at the question of why spending on this programme is proportionately so much higher in the northern region," said Mr English.
