The rules relating to details permitted on memorials for ex-service people will change, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said today.

A recent 'Fair Go' programme drew attention to the case of an Irish former member of the British Parachute Regiment, Mr Richard O'Dwyer, who did not want to have the Imperial Forces emblem on his headstone in a military cemetery, wishing instead to have the crest of that regiment.

The policy to date has been that only the emblem of the armed service branch the person served in could be shown. This was decided by the Returned Soldiers' Association (the forerunner to the Returned Services Association), the Defence Force and the Department of Internal Affairs after WW1.

The aim of this policy has been to reflect the wishes of former service men and women.

However, Mr Elder said today he had asked the NZRSA to restate their position on the rules. He has now been advised that ex-service people now support a change to the rules, which will allow anyone to have their regimental badge on their memorial plaque or headstone if they wish.

"Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that from today families and estates of ex-service people will be able to order memorials showing a unit or regimental badge if that is what the deceased wanted. I am sure this change will meet the concerns of all those involved."

Mr Elder pointed out there would be an additional charge involved in changing the rule and that this cost would have to be passed on to the estate of the ex-service person. There would be some delay in processing new orders.
