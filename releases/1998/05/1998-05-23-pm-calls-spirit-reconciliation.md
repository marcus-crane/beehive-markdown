"The New Zealand soldiers who served their country in Vietnam deserve our respectful recognition and support," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Speaking at the opening of the exhibition Vietnam - A Struggle for Peace in Wellington, Mrs Shipley said all New Zealanders need to positively acknowledge the contribution of those men and women who answered their Government's call to serve in Vietnam.

"They were volunteers who fought for freedom. They served. They served professionally. They brought credit to our country.

"After 30 years, it is time to put behind us any personal views about the rights or wrongs about New Zealand's participation in Vietnam and honour the men and women who acted with distinction in their service," Mrs Shipley said.

The Prime Minister said Parade 98 - Vietnam Remembered, the national reunion of Vietnam War veterans, is a time for reconciliation and understanding.

"It is also a time to satisfy ourselves that the veterans and their families are well cared for.

"The veterans of Vietnam in this country have had full access to war pensions since they returned from the war. All war veterans are treated equally. Social and medical support is available in this country to address the requirements of our war veterans.

"Thankfully, New Zealand Vietnam veterans have always received greater consideration than their Australian counterparts.

"But there remains one area on which I have some uncertainty and that is the question of any flow-on effects in relation to the children of veterans who are currently not specifically recognised or covered. I believe that it would be appropriate for the Government to consider whether the use of defoliants in Vietnam has left any residue in the children of those who served there.

"For this reason, the Government has begun to consider the case for a review of veterans claims of children's disabilities. Whatever is concluded I can assure those involved that the Government will not stand aside from the issue. Veterans are owed that at the very least.

"New Zealanders should heed the example of forgiveness and reconciliation demonstrated by visiting Unesco Goodwill Ambassador Phan Thi Kim Phuc - who as a child was etched into our minds in that graphic picture so many years ago.

"We can all learn lessons from the images captured in this exhibition. But this week, New Zealanders must remember the weight the Vietnam veterans and their families have carried for 30 years. We must share that load as a nation, so that the veterans can be confident in the knowledge that their service is recognised and respected," the Prime Minister concluded.
