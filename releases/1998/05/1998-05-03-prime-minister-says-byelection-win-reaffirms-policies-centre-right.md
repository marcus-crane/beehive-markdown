Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today said the Taranaki/ King Country byelection sent a strong signal that voters want the policies of the centre-right to continue.

"It is clear to me from the result of the Taranaki/ King Country byelection that those in the productive sector know that their future relies on the policies of the centre-right.

"What voters said yesterday loud and clear is that they do not want the high-tax and spend policies of the left.

"Traditionally voters do use byelections to send a message to the Government and I can assure the people of Taranaki/ King Country that the National Party has heard their concerns.

"It is clear to us that farmers and people with small businesses want the Government to create an environment where they can do well and that means continuing with the ambitious reform programme set out in my Statement to the House on 17 February.

"The Government is committed to doing all we can to reduce costs for our productive sector because without the wealth they create there is nothing for the rest of us to share in.

"The other message I have heard clearly during the byelection campaign is that rural people are anxious about social service provision. Modernising our health and education services will bring benefits for all New Zealanders.

"Change in service delivery is always unsettling and the Government must assure New Zealanders that while services may be delivered in a new way their health and education needs will continue to be met.

"We clearly need to do better in how we plan, deliver and explain these changes."

"National is committed to delivering strong leadership, political stability, lower interest and tax rates and modern social services to all New Zealanders.

"Thanks to the people of Taranaki/ King Country yesterday Shane Ardern will now work hard locally to just that.

"The National Party is committed to delivering real benefits to all New Zealanders," the Prime Minister concluded.
