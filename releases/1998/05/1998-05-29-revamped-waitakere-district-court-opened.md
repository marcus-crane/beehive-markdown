The Minister for Courts Wyatt Creech today opened the revamped and renamed Waitakere District Court in West Auckland.

"The Courthouse has been refurbished and extended to better meet the needs of those who use it, and to cope with the growth in cases going through the court," Mr Creech said.

The refurbished court buildings include:

- facilities for those working with victims of crime
- 4 new court rooms
- 5 new hearing rooms
- more secure prisoner transfer facilities and 9 new cells
- better facilities for lawyers and a new law library
- purpose designed space for the Collections Unit

"Renaming the Henderson District Court the Waitakere District Court gives the court more of an identity with the local community and Waitakere City. The new name should help with perceptions of how the local court fits in with the community.

"Our courtrooms and facilities need to be more user friendly. Facilities for advisors working with victims of crime are important new features of the new court building to help those who find themselves in the court system."

The upgrade also means the facilities and courtrooms will no longer be spread out over two buildings. The total cost of the project was $4.5 million with the Government meeting $2.65 million and the developer the remainder.
