The 1998 Budget demonstrates this Government's commitment to producing real benefits for New Zealanders. Halfway through the parliamentary term, it is clear that significant progress has been made.

There is a level of annual growth that compares favourably with our major trading partners. Inflation has been reduced, operating surpluses are projected to continue and prudent debt levels are on track. It hasn't been without its external challenges. The downturn in Asia's economic fortunes has presented challenges for us all - business and government included.

A sound economic framework, with a careful and responsible approach to spending, has meant that our economy is more capable than ever of coping with these challenges. Flexible and innovative businesses are responding by taking advantage of the lower dollar and at the same time searching out new markets for their products. Government is doing its part by delivering a range of initiatives, as part of its ongoing programme of microeconomic reforms, which will enhance economic growth.

These include the recently announced electricity reforms. Other key initiatives announced in this Budget are the immediate removal of motor vehicle tariffs and the introduction of competition in the delivery of the employer's account in the ACC Scheme from 1 July 1999. Government is also taking action to bolster operating surpluses by setting aside $300 million of available resources under the $5 billion Coalition Agreement limit. Recognising that the current net debt target of 20% of GDP will be met by 2000/2001, we have also revised the debt target to below 15% of GDP. On current projections, the new target will be met within the next five years. Economic and fiscal policies are only part of the equation in providing for the well being of all New Zealanders.

A range of social policy initiatives launched in the Budget will significantly progress the Government's employment and welfare strategies. This will help more New Zealanders move from dependency on the state to independence. The Budget also ensures improved access to quality education and health care and completes the Coalition's target of recruiting an extra 500 police by 2000/2001.

The 1998 Budget sets out a clear direction for business and the community with responsible and caring spending, tempered by financial imperatives that avoid the pitfalls of debt. It points to a future where social needs are met by increased economic activity.

This clearly reflects the vision we set ourselves in 1996. In the second year of our parliamentary term we have proved that we can deliver, while producing quality benefits for all New Zealanders.

The 1998 Budget demonstrates this Government's unparalleled achievement towards working for a better future.
