Health Minister Bill English announced today he had given approval for work to start on the first stage of Wellington hospital's site redevelopment, including a new Accident and Emergency department.

"I am very pleased to announce that urgently needed work at the hospital can now start. This includes work on Elderly Services, Orthopaedic Services and the new Accident and Emergency department.

"Final costings are not yet complete, but this first-stage work will cost at least $15 million to $20 million.

"At this stage approval has been given for the most urgent work only to start. We have turned down the remainder of the $52 million proposal because the organisation has yet to improve its performance sufficiently to give the Government reassurance that all the work should proceed. However, the Government would expect to consider a case for the remaining work within the next 12 months.

"The need for substantial upgrading work at Wellington hospital has been recognised for some time. Before it committed money to the project the Government wanted to make quite sure that Capital Coast Health had made sufficient progress after its enormous losses last year.

"The board, management and staff at Capital Coast Health are all committed to providing Wellington with modern hospital facilities and I am pleased that this work is now underway," said Mr English.
