Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says she welcomes the involvement of business people in the debate on social responsibility.

Mrs Shipley is today visiting Hubbard Foods, to discuss with Managing Director Dick Hubbard his concept of Businesses for Social Responsibility.

"The Government released the discussion document "Towards a Code of Social and Family Responsibility" in a bid to prompt debate about what the Government should be doing, and what people can and should be doing for themselves.

"It is good to see business people discussing what they can do for their communities.

"New Zealand business people already contribute in many ways, from corporate sponsorship to voluntary mentoring, to partnerships with schools, to employee involvement in community projects.

"Businesses also have a more direct contribution to make, by creating wealth and jobs. A thriving business sector making profits and paying taxes means there is more prosperity for all New Zealanders to share.

"I commend Dick Hubbard for his personal commitment to putting about 10 per cent of his company's profits into projects benefiting young New Zealanders, such as Outward Bound and local schools. I note he is also focussed on providing jobs for local unemployed people where possible.

"It is good to see people like Dick Hubbard raising the level of debate on how active businesses should be in pursuing social goals, and I look forward to seeing this debate continue," Mrs Shipley concluded.
