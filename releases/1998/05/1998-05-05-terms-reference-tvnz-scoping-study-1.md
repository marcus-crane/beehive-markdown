Terms of Reference for the scoping study of the Crown's ownership interest in Television New Zealand (TVNZ) were released today by Treasurer Winston Peters, Finance Minister Bill Birch and SOE Minister Tony Ryall.

They said the Government had not made any decision to sell TVNZ.

"The Terms of Reference detail the nature of the scoping exercise currently being undertaken by the Government and, in keeping with the Coalition Agreement, make it clear that Television One is not being considered for sale," said Ministers.

"The scoping study, announced on 5 December last year, focuses on TVNZ's business environment, the technological issues facing the company, its value in continued Crown ownership and under alternative ownership and possible sales methods for parts of TVNZ.

"The completion of the report has been delayed to allow time to examine fully the complexity of the issues. The report is now expected to be completed before mid-May. Ministers will then consider its findings."

A consortium of Ord Minnett, Andersen Consulting and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research were appointed late last year to carry out the study, after a competitive tendering process, Ministers said.
