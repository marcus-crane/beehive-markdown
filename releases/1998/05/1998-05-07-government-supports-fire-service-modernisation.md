Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder welcomed the modernisation of the Fire Service announced by the Fire Service Commission today.

"All New Zealand families should welcome the changes, which are vital to the Fire Service meeting its goals of halving the number of fire fatalities and reducing the number of fires by a quarter over three years."

Mr Elder said that last year he had specifically charged the newly appointed Commission with developing strategies to reduce the incidence and consequence of fire.

"The need for this has been highlighted by the recent tragic deaths of young children in a series of house fires. Maori and Pacific Island families in particular have been affected by these tragedies."

The strategy includes:

- increased support for volunteer brigades, which are the backbone of the New Zealand Fire Service;
- substantial investment in the assets of the Fire Service, encompassing better located and more modern fire stations, and newer and more technically capable fire engines;
- significant improvements in the response to fires, which will reduce the death toll and high property damage that currently occurs;
- significant additional expenditure on public education aimed at increasing the understanding of the dangers of fire. This will take into account the different needs of the different communities that make up New Zealand;
- additional expenditure on research so that we better understand the behaviour of fire in New Zealand buildings, and the behaviour of people when confronted by fire;
- a significant increase in workforce skills, in which the new type of Fire Officer will have a much broader range of skills, a more challenging job, and will be far more productive. They will be very well remunerated, with pay rates up to 30 percent higher than those currently applying to paid firefighters.

Property owners will also be pleased with the Fire Service commitment to reducing property loss by fire by 30 percent.

Mr Elder said he approved the Commission's request for a higher expenditure budget this year to ensure it had a sound financial basis for the modernisation project. The 1997/98 budget was recently finalised at $165.6 million, an increase of $9.4 million over the previous year.
