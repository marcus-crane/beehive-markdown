Up to $20 million funding is being made available for New Zealanders to celebrate the arrival of the new Millennium, Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder announced today.

"The Millennium gives us the opportunity to celebrate the unique heritage, identity and culture of New Zealand and to look forward to our future," Mr Elder said. The Coalition Government has approved $10 million (GST inclusive) in the Budget for the New Zealand Year 2000 and Millennium programme for the years 1998 to 2000.

This funding will cover a programme of national events and projects designed to mark the Millennium in an enduring way. It will assist in making the most of the opportunities available from the upcoming Sydney 2000 Olympics, the America's Cup defence in Auckland and other major events such as the APEC conference, Mr Elder said. Additional funding from the Lottery Grants Board will also be available for the programme.

A special Board subcommittee is being formed with an initial budget of $4 million. In his capacity as chairman of the Lottery Grants Board, Mr Elder said additional funding of up to $6 million may be available over the next three years. The Government has set up a structure to help with the coordination, promotion, and where necessary, funding of the various events.

The Millennium Board, chaired by the Prime Minister, is responsible for establishing an overarching national vision. Under the umbrella of this Board, three taskforces have been established - the Towards 2000 Taskforce, Sydney 2000 Taskforce and the America's Cup Taskforce.

These will report to the Board and are responsible for making the most of the Millennium opportunities, Mr Elder said.

"We will fund projects which fit the Millennium themes: celebrating the achievements of New Zealanders in all fields of endeavour; enhancing our natural environment; reflecting and respecting the place of the Tangata Whenua; appreciating our cultural diversity; and promoting international appreciation of the Pacific," Mr Elder said.
