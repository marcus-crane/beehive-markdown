Defence Minister Max Bradford has deplored the latest action by Pakistan in exploding five nuclear devices.

"A tit for tat response to the equally deplorable action by India two weeks ago is how wars start," Mr Bradford said.

"I believe the greater criticism belongs to India for starting the nuclear escalation in the Indian Sub-continent region. Pakistan would have received the support of the international community for its security if it had exercised restraint.

"Pakistan has more to fear from a nuclear armed country eight times as large and more economically advanced on its border. That much we can understand. But by reacting in this fashion, Pakistan has taken the international heat off India where it properly belongs, and will have to shoulder some the blame if the security situation deteriorates further in a part of the world where India and Pakistan have a history of serious border disputes.

"These developments are not that far away from New Zealand, and puts even greater emphasis on the defence and security ties we have in the Asian-Pacific region. New Zealand and Australia have put great store on deepening defence ties and confidence building measures in the Asian region as the best way of promoting peace. Perhaps we need to play a part in the Indian Sub-continent as well.

"Only 10 years ago many people thought peace was guaranteed when the Berlin Wall came down. The reality is quite different. I believe it reinforces the need for New Zealand to have the insurance policies of forceful diplomacy and a well equipped defence force. Only then can we play a full part in the security pacts we are part of, as well as joining other peace loving nations who do not want to see another nuclear arms race in the world again."
