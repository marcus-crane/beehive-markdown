Only a few weeks since I was here for Bill English ? AGM.

I want to talk about our party and my portfolio, education. You have also asked for thoughts on the role of list MPs.

First, our party and the role of List MPs. I have visited many electorates since becoming Deputy Leader and I have seen some very good things happening. We need to extend that activity out into the community.

It is taking a while for the role of List MPs to be understood by all parties, not just National. You have only Eric who keeps a watching brief over the bottom half of the South Island. Some List MPs have quickly established their place; Pansy Wong?s hard work with the Asian community is well recognised. I know that the party is already thinking about the List for the next election. I say only this; the last thing we need is divisions in any part of our political movement. All members whether list or constituency need to work for our common cause and all our efforts should aim to support that goal.

Our new leadership has already given new vigour to our efforts in Parliament and among our party activists. Jenny Shipley has connected well with the people of New Zealand and our party ratings in the polls have gone up - but we cannot afford to be at all complacent. Polls come and go.

The last real poll was last weekend. Every pundit has told us what the Taranaki-King Country result means. For my part it is reminding us that it is very difficult on the land these days - made worse in my area by a serious drought.

Yet no-one I talk to wants to return to the old solutions of the past - subsidies etc. First, they want us to recognise their difficulties, to lower compliance costs, to make it easier to do business whether it be by addressing ACC costs, OSH costs. John Luxton is keen to move on these issues.

And second they want us to build confidence and certainty that they will receive quality and relevant services; education, health and so on. In our Caucus we all respect the way Bill English has tackled his difficult portfolio. Health is a hard portfolio. The Hospital Plan when it comes out is however intended to address that need for certainty. But within that framework of certainty we must continue to modernise services and change when it will improve the services that we have.

Just like the rest of our society and economy, it is inevitable that education will change and change significantly over the coming years.

The education we give our children in our schools today will determine the standard of living in a generation when the world will be radically different to what it is today. The quality of the education we offer is the most influential factor in securing the future for the next generation of New Zealanders in twenty to thirty years time. We need to prepare young people now for the kind of world they will live in then, a world that will see many radical differences to what we see now.

You know it can be kind of scary when you think about it. What will life be like in twenty or thirty years time. My colleague Maurice Williamson, a self professed technology zealot, is fond of telling us how with new voice recognition technology in a few years time we will be able to issue voice instruction to our fridge.

Yet that is the world we will live in.

And it will be different in this respect too. The manual low skilled jobs that provided for the lifetime of that about 20% of young people who have for years left our schools without any substantial qualification are already going. In future all young people are gong to find they need for knowledge and skills that are gathered in at school if they are to make it.

When they leave school more options will become available to them too. Last year when visiting New Zealand the German Minister of Education told me of their plan to build english speaking universities faculties in Germany to teach 100,000 students so they could attract english speaking students to their country from all over the world. A young New Zealander could decide to do their degree from the University of Heidelberg.

They would not even have to leave New Zealand. Already the Waikato University is doing a degree in teaching on the Internet. Overseas courses will soon be available.

Many more new developments are on the way - I have only scratched the surface. When they come they will appeal to many New Zealanders. Our institutions will have to meet this competition head on before many years pass.

Technology has already radically changed so many of our industries. It will too with time have a profound influence on the way we educate. It has often been said that although a medical doctor from a century ago would not qualify as an orderly in a modern hospital, a Victorian school-master would be quite at home in a contemporary classroom.

Given the liberality of the 90's, I suspect such a teacher would be more than a little surprised at some of the language he heard, and, I suspect, more than a little dismayed at some of the spelling but, overall, the organisation of the school, the teaching techniques used and the eventual outcomes, would not be too unfamiliar.

The clear point is this. We need to accept change if we are to succeed.

Last Thursday we released a Green Paper on our new proposals for national tests for primary school children. In my local area a principal went public saying that amongst other things this would lead to the watering down of all tertiary qualifications. What nonsense! The negative reaction from the teacher organisations was absolutely predictable. Exactly the same thing happened in Victoria, Australia when they introduced similar tests four years ago. There the unions took out full page advertisements with a list of eight dreadful things that would happen if children in primary schools were tested using a consistent national approach. In summary they were horrific. The sort of thing only our worst enemy could wish on us. You know what; none of this happened. Now teachers tell me it is a great tool to help them know how ell their programme for their kids is doing. They like it! The controversy in Victoria has completely disappeared.

Interestingly parents always supported the idea. They saw how it would raise standards and quality. It was always too easy for a school to say we have the best reading programme in New Zealand. The point was they never knew. And the fear of finding out is the fear of being found out. Teachers need this information so they can see how they are doing and where they need to improve the programmes for their pupils.

It is easy to get a bit frustrated at what is happening now with so much energy and effort being put in by teachers organisations to resist any changes at all.

I say this to warn you that things could get more tense over the next few months with PPTA leaderships bid to include non-industrial matters in employment contract negotiations. The government has made it clear; we will not agree to negotiate on policy matters.

I want to make it clear that does not mean we are not interested in the workload concerns of teachers at the chalkface; we are. We have already applied millions of dollars to special new programmes and reorganised the introduction of new curriculum statements to address teacher workload problems. More initiatives are on the way.

The draft recommendations from the PPTA leadership to grassroots members during their current round of paid union meetings say the Government is not prepared to negotiate on pay and conditions. That is completely wrong. Those recommendations also make it clear that the PPTA leadership is seeking authority to take industrial action over policy issues that are clearly the prerogative of the elected Government.

It will not work. And they can certainly expect tougher actions in response if it continues.

This selfish militancy from the PPTA is totally out of keeping with the needs of young people for the 21st Century. I am happy to see well performing teachers paid well. But gone must be the days when everyone must get the same; when the role of the organisation that represents our teachers sees its only task as stroppily defending the view that all teachers are equally good and reward for superior performance is wrong. Workplaces don?t work like that now.

A sense of achievement is the key to academic accomplishment. It can turn a struggling and disgruntled student into an excited pursuer of knowledge by ensuring that they had success and received praise for it. Look at the success of the project at Aranui High School in Christchurch that received much publicity last year.

We can all remember teachers we found inspiring and others we blame for our lack of progress in this or that subject - all too often science, languages or mathematics.

We need now to focus on a new agenda. Decisions should be driven by three principles. We must:

1\. Lifting quality and standards  
2\. involve parents and communities in young people?s education  
3\. and be sure we prepare well our youth for a skills based 21st century

The need for change to adjust to these new demands has come upon us very quickly and I doubt if we have yet grasped their full importance.

The old idea of work has gone. More than 50% of people in advanced industrial societies are now self-employed, or are working on a part-time or project-by-project basis. The need for unskilled workers has declined rapidly and the need for many conventional skills is equally disappearing. I am thinking of shorthand typists, bank clerks and office workers among others.

And it will not matter that you are good at your job if it is one of those skills that is supplanted by the new demands of a new age. There is the old example that explains this well; the buggy whip maker. It did not matter how good a buggy whip maker you were - when the car arrived and made the buggy redundant, there was no longer a need for buggy whips no matter how good.

Successful societies will be those that adapt. Those that work with change; not resist it. It is so easy to look the other way, to say that it won't happen. That is what the industrial revolution was all about. The information revolution will be equally profound and its first inroads are now being felt.

I saw a good example recently in the Bulletin. Imagine you have been pulled over for speeding by police using a laser gun. A zoom video camera in the squad car is recording the whole incident, a miniature radio in the police officer's label is capturing your whole conversation. While you are talking, your breath alcohol level is being measured on a "passive direct" breathalyser powered by a space age fuel cell. With a hand-held, pen-operated computer, the officer checks your licence and registration number and knows within three seconds whether you are wanted for any outstanding offences. Meantime the details of the speeding offence are digitally beamed from the video-laser/radar unit in the police car to a central processing office. This sounds like far-fetched science fiction - a glimpse into the future. But according to the Bulletin, it is technology that is actually been used in Australia today.

It just shows what technology can do.

But young people must not only carry useful skills into their adult life. As well, they will need the ability to be flexible and to learn new skills whenever required. They also need useful attitudes for their adult life, not the least of which is the self confidence to know that the challenges ahead can be met.

What skills will be useful? There are those who want to return to the basics and I personally have some sympathy with this. I think citizens should be able to read and write, know something of their history and background, understand the philosophical under-pinnings of their society. It would help too I am sure if they were knowledgeable in maths and science.

There are those, often employers, who want the young people fitted for immediate work in offices and factories. This focus alone is too narrow. There are employers who believe that the best training for the work place is a general education. This wider focus is better overall.

Increasingly schools in our society have two roles. One, of course, is to educate. The other is to teach the values needed to interact with others and to learn how to conduct themselves in society. This second role is becoming more important.

Using the word values worries some. In the past the organised churches were the general society source of values, but the churches do not reach as they did in our modern society. Schools already teach values. School walls are plastered with injunctions against violence, discrimination, smoking etc. We need to stress as well the importance of hard work, commitment, honesty.

The teaching profession's greatest challenge is to excite pupils by capturing their interest and engaging their brains. It matters little how it is done. It could be through a hobby, through a sport, through drama, but it must aim to get all young people.

When I see schools doing this, and I do, I find it inspiring.

The young so called "tuned out" people are not idiots even if they are being a bit stupid for the meantime. Some of them, many I hope, will come to own houses, run businesses and run farms. But too many of them will also end up in prisons, or permanently on the dole, because they did not reap the benefit from the education system.

The ideal school of the future, it seems to me, will bring pupils together to help, instruct and encourage them through the experiences of "growing up", but will allow each of them to learn as individuals at their own pace and with their particular abilities and needs in mind. The teaching activity may still take place in the school, but if it does, it for the most part will not be conventional classroom activity but will be with modern electronic technology. Through learning machines - computers which communicate through speech - through television links with the world's best teachers, through the stimulus of linking with pupils in other countries, through teaching programmes designed to stimulate, coax and reward the user, all these things will soon not only be possible but inevitable.

Schools will have more experts to deal with social needs. These will be sports instructors, counsellors and just plain, inspiring personalities. They will help with personal problems and act as guides and mentors.

In the modern world we will, as a country and a people, be on our own. As Britain became great because she was the first country to appreciate and exploit the industrial revolution so must we be smart enough not just to exploit the oncoming changes but to be in front of the other countries of the world in getting there. Increasingly the difference between economic and social stagnation and a happy and prosperous country is quite simply a matter of education and attitude.

If you want modern examples of what education and attitude can do you need look no further than Japan and, now Hong Kong and Singapore. It has little to with politics in the ideological sense. It has everything to do with leadership, with, dare I say it, discipline, but above all, with education and attitude. Education to provide the ability to cope with the new world, attitude which gives the self-confidence and determination to succeed.

Times of change are always times of danger but they are also times of opportunity. They require a willingness to be flexible, the commonsense not to be seduced by every passing fad, structures which can adapt to and accommodate to new ways of doing things, and a clear view of principles so that overall goals remain clear.

Life in the 21st Century increasingly requires a combination of individual motivation and values coupled with an personal commitment by each and every individual to develop their knowledge and skills. To make our democracy work requires us to be well informed population capable of understanding the issues of the day, and with a stake in our common destiny.

The bottom line is surely to use our commonsense and to do what is sensible. We are on the threshold of being able to clone humans. To have the collective wisdom to handle sort this new knowledge we need to educate our young well.

Our policies aim to do just that.

President Lyndon Johnson put it this way. He said; "We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some an advantage over others. It has become a necessity, without which a person is defenceless in this complex society".

Our new leadership has given us new vigour to take on these challenges. We that take an active interest in politics all need to play our part. I look forward to working with all in my role on that common cause.
