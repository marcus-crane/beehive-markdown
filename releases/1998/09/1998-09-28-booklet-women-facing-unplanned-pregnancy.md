Health Minister Bill English said a booklet released today was designed to help women facing unplanned pregnancies make an informed decision that was right for them.

"It is important that women can access information they need at the right time so they make a decision they will feel comfortable with.

"The booklet Considering an Abortion? What are your options? was produced by the Ministry of Health and outlines the options a woman has, including parenting, adoption and guardianship. It also provides facts about abortion and a list of contacts for more information.

"Everyone undergoing a medical procedure has the right to be fully informed about it. This booklet means that information about abortion is available for all women considering this procedure.

"It is based on a draft booklet negotiated several years ago between a number of the groups with different views about abortion. That draft booklet was never published," said Mr English.

New Zealand's abortion rate has steadily increased since the mid eighties. In 1987 it was 11.3 per 1000 women of child bearing age. In 1996 it was 17.7 per 1000 women of child bearing age. In 1996 there were 14,805 abortions.

The booklet is being distributed to all GPs and Family Planning clinics. Further copies are available from the Information Officer, Ministry of Health, PO Box 5013, Wellington or fax 04 496 2430.
