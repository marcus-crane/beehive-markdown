Minister of food Fibre, Biosecurity Border control and Associate International Trade, Hon John Luxton, today said that increasing farmer, growers and rural communities incomes was far more important than the conflicting statements of the Labour Party.

This follows reported statements today from Michael Cullen and Helen Clark.

"Improving farmer, growers and rural incomes was far more important that Labour Party internal politics," Mr Luxton said today.

"Labour and the Alliance are all over the paddock on Producer Board evolution. Jim Sutton appears to have been sacked as spokesperson on Producer Boards for supporting the Government's sensible and careful moves.

Michael Cullen, the new Agriculture spokesperson appears at odds with his leader, Helen Clark. And Helen Clark and the Alliance are against rural people having a genuine say in their future. They don't trust farmers to make their own decisions about their own money and produce. This Government does.

"If the first time in three generations that a government has shown enough leadership to give rural people the opportunity to have a genuine say.

"I have to sympathise with Jim Sutton who appears to have lost the battle against the Alliance, who want to nationalise all the Boards assets, and all the urban Labour MPs, which is almost all of them, who don't really care about rural people. They say they are currently interested in rural people but in reality they are more interested in backroom deals to put up taxes and spend hard earned farmers money, " Mr Luxton concluded.
