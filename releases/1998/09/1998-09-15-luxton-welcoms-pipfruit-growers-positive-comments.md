New Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity, Border Control and Associate International Trade, Hon John Luxton, today welcomed reported comments from Mr Paul Brown of Pipfruit Growers New Zealand.

"Mr Brown is reported as saying his organisation wants to "get away from black and white arguments" and "look more carefully at the industry's goals." I couldn't agree more," Mr Luxton said today.

Mr Paul Brown of Pipfruit New Zealand was reported making the comments on Radio NZ this morning.

"Producer Boards are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. What is really important is how their owners, the growers are doing. The Government wants solutions that work for growers, not ideological opposition to evolution," Mr Luxton said.

"The key issue is how can we build a more profitable future from the current base. Growers have had some tough years under the current over politicised systems. It is important for the benefit of growers, and also rural communities, that we take this opportunity to examine how we can evolve things and do things better. We need to look at the outcomes we want and then what structure may be appropriate as Mr Brown also suggests.

"Growers should have the biggest say and need to get involved. And as I have said before, the Government wants minimum disruption and will carefully and sensibly move towards evolution. Each Board plan will be considered on it merits.

"It is encouraging to see Mr Brown reported as saying the Pipfruit growers are now focussing on the real issue - improving growers net incomes
