Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity, Border Control and Associate International Trade, John Luxton today welcomed the release to M aori, by the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, of a new proposal to allocate part of its quota assets.

Maori will now have the opportunity to consider this proposal and to make their views on its acceptability known to the Commission by 21 October 1998.

Once Maori have had an opportunity to provide their views to the Commission, the Commission is required to provide a report of its preferred allocation model to the Minister. The Commission have indicated that they hope to report to the Minister by 5 November. The Minister then has thirty days to accept that proposal, or ask the Commission to reconsider and amend it.

Mr Luxton said today, "It is good to see progress being made. I hope Maori will consider the Commission?s new proposal carefully and seek to resolve any areas of disagreement as quickly as possible amongst themselves. Further protracted court action is denying the Maori community the legitimate fruits of the Treaty settlement and the opportunity to grow their assets use them for the best benefit of their communities," he concluded.
