"Learning you have cancer is devastating and the effects of cancer treatment can sometimes be as difficult as the disease itself," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today on attending a "Look Good, Feel Better" seminar for women cancer patients.

Mrs Shipley said that the "Look Good Feel Better" seminars helped to boost women's confidence in themselves and their ability to fight the disease.

"Chemotherapy and radiation not only make some people feel sick, they can result in hair loss, changes in skin colour and texture and changes in weight. That can leave women depressed about their appearance.

The seminars show women how to enhance their appearance with cosmetics, wigs, hats and scarves.

"The seminars are a valuable support network, giving women the opportunity to share with others who have been through the same ordeal," the Prime Minister said.
