"This report on the environmental effects of road transport will be a useful contribution to the discussion on road reform," said Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson today.

Mr Williamson was commenting on the Transport and Environment Select Committee's report released today inquiring into the environmental effects of road transport.

"It is certainly important that we focus on environmental issues as we put together the road reform package - and the Government is currently doing just that. This is crucial for any decision made for New Zealand's future," Mr Williamson said.

"The Select Committee is right in pointing out that there is a lack of detailed information available about the environmental effects of road transport. The Ministry of Transport is doing extensive work to identify the impacts so that we have the information we need.

"A document which focuses on local air quality, called the Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy: Final Report, will be released by the Ministry later this year.

"The Government is presently working through road reform issues. It is complex and the more information we have the better the result will be for all New Zealanders, " the Minister said.
