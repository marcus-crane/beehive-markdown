Associate Minister of Justice Tony Ryall confirmed today that an 80-year-old Justice of the Peace convicted of four charges of indecent assault has been removed from office.

Last weekend's Sunday Star-Times reported the man's unsuccessful appeal against conviction, and successful appeal against sentencing.

Mr Ryall said the Ministry of Justice began formal procedures to remove the man from the list of Justices of the Peace as soon as it learned that the appeal against conviction had been dismissed.

Mr Ryall has recommended to the Governor General that the man be removed from the list of JPs by notice in the Gazette, this will be effected forthwith.
