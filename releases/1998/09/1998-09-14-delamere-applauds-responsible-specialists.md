Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today commended those surgeons and other specialists who are willing to work honestly with the surgical booking system.

"The booking system, was after all, designed by doctors for doctors, and is not some cumbersome system imposed from above by out-of-touch bureaucrats, as has been suggested in recent days," he said.

"Those specialists who have arrogantly claimed they will abuse the system are merely demonstrating their short-sighted selfishness and will justly be condemned by their peers, who know that when one specialist's patients jump the surgical queue, all other patients throughout the country will lose out.

"Should any of those patients who miss out die as a result, will the abusers of the booking system stand up to take responsibility? I suspect not. Nor, I note, are they offering to reduce their substantial fees in order to stretch the public health dollar further.

"Scanning recent newspaper stories, I am heartened to see there are responsible specialists who are willing to give the booking system a fair go and see that it is a fairer, more transparent system than the old waiting lists."

The Minister particularly commended a Waikato Times editorial of September 8 which rightly condemned threats to cheat the system as arrogant and bloodyminded.

"The paper also points out that demands for health care are insatiable and no country in the western world is rich enough to fund every new treatment.

"New Zealanders' desire for a good health system will be met when we all work together in co-operative fashion, rather than in selfish isolation," concluded Mr Delamere.
