"Maori are succeeding in business in New Zealand." Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today on launching Tohu Wines in Nelson.

"Tohu Wines is a first for New Zealand. It is an indigenous 'brand' being produced principally for the export market.

"New Zealand must stop being preoccupied with failure and negative statistics. There are good stories to tell. Sealords, Whalewatch Kaikoura, Rochtech and Tamiki Tours are all success stories - and I am sure Tohu Wines will also join this growing list.

"Tohu Wine's innovative thinking, strong marketing and collective approach make it another example of the dynamism in the New Zealand wine industry.

"The New Zealand wine industry only started 25 years ago and is now our 15th largest exporter with $100 million worth of sales.

"We receive international recognition for the quality of our wines, as recently seen at the world's leading wine competition in London where New Zealand wines won 8 golds, 54 silver and 114 bronze. For a country that produces only 0.2 percent of the world's wines, this is a stunning success.

"In the current international economic climate, we need exporters to pursue every competitive advantage we can create for ourselves. I applaud Tohu Wines for their vision and commitment in taking on the world with true Kiwi spirit," the Prime Minister said.
