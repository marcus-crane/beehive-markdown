It is encouraging to see the Waikato regional economy holding its own during a period that is challenging New Zealand's economy as a whole," Prime Minister Rt Hon Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley spent the day in Hamilton visiting a number of successful local businesses - McArthur Marine, Greens Industries and Gallagher Group.

"Waikato has one of our country's strongest economic growth rates, with a growth rate for the year to June of 1.6 per cent. This means jobs and prosperity for the people of this region.

"Real estate activity in Waikato has also been comparatively high in recent times with the average level of turnover increasing in all categories in the June quarter.  
"It is clear from the local businesses I am visiting today that while economic times are challenging, innovative and determined businesses are helping sustain Waikato's regional economic activity.

"The best way we can move forward in these difficult economic times is to remain optimistic and seize every opportunity to market our products and skills to the world," said Mrs Shipley.
