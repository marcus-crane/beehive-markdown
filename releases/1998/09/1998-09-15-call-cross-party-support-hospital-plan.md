Health Minister Bill English said today he would be asking for support from across the political spectrum when the hospital plan was released tomorrow.

"The Hospital Services Plan will give New Zealanders certainty and security about the future of public hospitals. It is my hope that opposition political parties will publicly support the hospital plan as a step towards a wider political consensus on health issues.

"It will be a challenge for Labour and the Alliance to overcome their mindless opposition to everything the Government does in health. This is an opportunity for them to show they are capable of thoughtful analysis of high profile health issues.

"It will also be hard for them to climb off the bandwagon of scaring every community they go to by telling them their hospital will close, but it is time they did. Scare-mongering is no substitute for developing policy.

"I was disappointed when opposition parties refused to endorse the Child Health Strategy I launched earlier this year, although it has widespread support in the health sector. The security of the local hospital and the health of our children are surely issues important enough to overrule the usual political posturing.

"When the hospital plan has been launched, I will be writing to all party leaders seeking their public support," said Mr English.

Mr English will launch the Plan at Wanganui Hospital on Wednesday, 16 September at 9.45 am.
