Risk management is a critical tool in all decision making", Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today at the launch of a new book on integrated risk management practice.

The book, Owning the Future: Integrated Risk Management In Practice, is being published by the Centre for Advanced Engineering of the University of Canterbury with the support of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Ministry of Civil Defence. It has been developed as a co-operative venture between industry, government and academia following a highly successful conference last year.

"The risks we must plan for are not only the major threats such as earthquakes but also the unpredictable events of daily life that might jeopardise our goals wherever we undertake planning.

"The Government has to manage risks as we develop policies, weigh up competing priorities and plan ahead. It is the same for every business.

"Any methods for improving techniques for understanding and managing risk will be of wide interest, and Owning the Future should be a useful tool," Mrs Shipley concluded.
