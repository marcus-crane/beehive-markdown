"The level of reported dissatisfaction amongst school teachers is disappointing, and in stark contrast to what I frequently see at the chalk-face," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech was commenting on Massey College of Education reports that teachers were dissatisfied with aspects of their work. He has sought further advice about the research, its methodology and findings.

"It concerns me that this sort of research purports to show that teachers are dissatisfied. More often than not when I go to schools the staff morale is high, and teachers seem to be enjoying their jobs.

"It does seem to be human nature for people to be more prepared to express their dissatisfaction than their satisfaction.

"The changes going on in schools are designed to improve the quality of education young people receive, in order to give them more and better job opportunities in the future.

"Teachers play a crucial role in meeting that goal. The Government takes the need for quality teachers very seriously. We are not making the changes to increase teacher workload or to put more pressure on teachers.

"We have worked hard over recent years to lift the pay for primary and secondary school teachers.

"We have just spent $250 million to lift primary teachers' pay to the level of secondary teachers'. In 1996 we committed $80 million to create better secondary teacher pay rates. We now want to put even more in to create a new pay scale for secondary teachers starting at $34,000 for new graduates and $50,000 at the top of the pay scale.

"We have eased workload by slowing down the pace of the implementation of new curricula.

"We have employed a lot more teachers, and are training more, including more Maori teachers. We added another one thousand teachers into schools just to reduce class sizes.

"We have introduced Special Education 2000, put in place new truancy and drug programmes all to help with disruptive and problem children.

"The list goes on and on. We have put a lot of effort into making schools work better and a better working environment," Mr Creech concluded.
