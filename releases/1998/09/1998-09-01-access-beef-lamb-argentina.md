Exporters of beef and lamb hit by the turmoil in Asia will now have an opportunity to shift product into Argentina, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Dr Smith was commenting on the successful negotiations between New Zealand and Argentinian quarantine authorities which have led to Argentina agreeing to accept imports of meat that are accompanied by an approved health certificate.

"It's good news that we now have access to meat-hungry Argentina," he said. "Good market opportunities exist in South America and I know that our meat exporters are confident of their ability to succeed."

While Argentina is a big producer of beef, Dr Smith said recent domestic shortages had prompted suppliers to seek permission to import New Zealand beef.

"The reason they have done so is that they know their consumers have confidence in the high health and quality standards of New Zealand product."

New Zealand and Argentinian quarantine agencies are currently working on a reciprocal access arrangement which would allow Argentinian beef to be sold in New Zealand. In the meantime, Argentinian authorities have confirmed their market is now open for licensed New Zealand companies to export lamb and beef to Argentina with the approved health certificate.
