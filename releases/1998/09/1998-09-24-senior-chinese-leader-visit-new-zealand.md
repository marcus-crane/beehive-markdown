Senior Chinese Communist Party figure Wei Jianxing will visit New Zealand from 24-29 September, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

"Mr Wei will be the most senior Chinese visitor to New Zealand this year. His is ranked 6th on the standing committee of the Politburo, effectively China's top decision making body. Mr Wei will be accompanied by Mr Dai Bingguo, Minister of the Chinese Communist Party's International Department.

"New Zealand has made significant progress in trading and political relations with China and a visit by such a senior figure will give us an opportunity to reinforce the strengths of the relationship. China is also a valued partner in APEC dialogue and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

"China, including Hong Kong, is New Zealand's fifth largest export market and one of the few Asian countries where exports have increased over the past year. It is also an emerging market for tourism and education services," Mrs Shipley said.

While in New Zealand Mr Wei will visit Auckland, Rotorua and Wellington. He will also meet with the Governor General, and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and International Trade.
