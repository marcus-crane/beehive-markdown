Defence Minister Max Bradford says the Australian Labor Party's policy of establishing a fully integrated Australian-New Zealand Battalion is an "interesting idea, but not on our agenda".

Australian Labor Party Shadow Defence Minister Arch Bevis said today his party would "reinvigorate the Australia-New Zealand alliance with a plan to establish a fully integrated ANZAC battalion".

Mr Bradford said New Zealand already works very closely with Australia under the Closer Defence Relations (CDR) agreement between our two countries.
