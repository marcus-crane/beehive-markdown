Health Minister Bill English confirmed today that the Government was considering changing the Medical Practitioners Act to make it easier for some overseas-trained doctors to practice in New Zealand.

"I believe the Medical Council operates the current law in good faith. However, the law itself may be the problem. Examples of where difficulties have arisen are in recruitment of doctors for rural areas, and well-publicised concerns about ophthalmology.

"We are looking at proposals to allow overseas doctors to be registered on the basis of their registration to practice medicine in specified countries. These countries would be likely to include Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, other European Union countries, South Africa, and the Scandinavian countries.

"The legislation included such provisions prior to 1995. While we do want to be sure that we set appropriate standards for medical practice, I would like to be assured that New Zealanders who need health care don't miss out because of too restrictive a law," said Mr English.
