ACC Minister, Murray McCully, says he hopes public opinion will weigh on the minds of MP's in voting on the ACC reforms in the Accident Insurance Bill being introduced today.

Mr McCully says, "New Zealanders are overwhelmingly in favour of choice in ACC", quoting a recent UMR Insight poll. The poll showed 52% support for the introduction of choice, 34% against, and 15% undecided.

"Even a majority of Labour voters favoured the Government's plans for ACC, with 44% in favour and 42% against."

Mr McCully described the Accident Insurance Bill as "the most significant reform of ACC since its introduction 24 years ago".

"If Parliamentarians are listening to their constituents, the Bill will enjoy good support in Parliament."
