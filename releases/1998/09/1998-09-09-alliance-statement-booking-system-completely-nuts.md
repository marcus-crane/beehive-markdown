Health Minister Bill English said today an Alliance statement that the Booking System would cost $84 million a year to administer was "completely nuts".

"This statement is absolutely wrong. It is completely nuts. The money referred to is the extra money for elective surgery announced in the Budget. Every dollar of that money will go on more surgery for New Zealanders.

"The Alliance has completely misunderstood quite straightforward information. This proves beyond all doubt why the Alliance should never be let anywhere near anything to do with money and budgets.

"The 1998/99 Health Funding Agreement, which is publicly available, makes it clear that the Ministry of Health will release $84.373 million each year to the Health Funding Authority for elective surgery under the Booking System. This is the extra money for elective surgery announced in the Budget - $253 million over three years," said Mr English.
