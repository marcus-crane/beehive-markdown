Foreign Minister Don McKinnon leaves today for a seven-nation visit to the Caribbean before attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

In the Caribbean, Mr McKinnon will hold talks with Prime Minsters and Senior Minsters in the Bahamas, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua, and Jamaica.

In New York, Mr McKinnon will deliver New Zealand ?s annual statement to the UN General Assembly and hold meetings with a number of countries including Chile, the Philippines, the United States, Israel, the Ukraine, Korea, Brazil and France.

This is the first visit to the Caribbean by a New Zealand Foreign Minister.

"While our relationships with these countries are in good shape, I will be exploring opportunities to give extra weight and substance to our dealings," Mr McKinnon said.

"My discussions will concentrate on commercial and trade links, our shared Commonwealth membership, and our common views on issues affecting small states.

"There are global, environmental and economic challenges which have to be confronted just as equally in the Caribbean as in the South Pacific, and I hope that we will continue to tackle these collectively."

The Caribbean is one of New Zealand's oldest and most diversified markets for dairy products, while other export and commercial opportunities are entering a period of growth.

The New Zealand Dairy Board has invested in a dairy processing factory in Jamaica, and New Zealand Post recently won a contract to manage the Trinidad and Tobago postal service for five years.
