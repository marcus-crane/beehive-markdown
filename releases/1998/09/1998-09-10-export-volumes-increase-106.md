June quarter export volumes are predicted to be up 10.6% compared with the March quarter despite the Asian Economic Crisis, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

Dr Smith was commenting on the latest Terms of Trade figures released by Statistics New Zealand today.

"Doom and gloom Alliance/Labour politicians predicting disaster have been proven wrong again," Dr Smith said. "Our exporters have exceeded their expectations.

"June 1998 quarter exports volumes of food and beverages, forestry products and non-food manufactured products are all predicted to be up over the March 1998 quarter. Total export volumes are predicted to be up 10.6%."

Dr Smith acknowledged that trade volumes in the June 1998 quarter were down compared with the highly successful June 1997 quarter just prior to the Asian Economic Crisis. But he said no one could realistically have expected trade volumes to have stayed at that level given the subsequent events in Asia.
