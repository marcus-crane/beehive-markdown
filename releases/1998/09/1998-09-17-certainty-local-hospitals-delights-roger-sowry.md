The status of Horowhenua and Kenepuru hospitals has been guaranteed under the Government's Hospital Services Plan announced yesterday.

"This will put an end to all the negative speculation which opposition politicians have engaged in over the past few years," said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

"The plan clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to maintaining a national network of hospital services - which are a vital component of our public health system."

"Our community can be assured we will see these hospitals continue to operate and with the same level of services they have now."

Mr Sowry said the challenge for these hospitals now would be to provide more services.

"Government recognises local problems need local solutions. We'll continue to work with communities around New Zealand to look for better ways of delivering health care within the current framework."
