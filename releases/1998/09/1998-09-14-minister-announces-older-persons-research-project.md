Minister for Senior Citizens, Hon David Carter, today announced $50,000 had been granted to a Wellington research company to identify the factors that help older people remain independent in the community.

The funding has been allocated as part of the Government's contribution to International Year of Older Persons, which will be observed around the world next year.

Mr Carter said Wellington research company, Gray Matter Research Ltd, had successfully tendered for the research project, which aims to identify the factors which enable older people to remain at home, while actively contributing to the community.
