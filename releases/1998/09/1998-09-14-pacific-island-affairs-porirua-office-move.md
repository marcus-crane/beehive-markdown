The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs will combine its Porirua office with head office in Wellington from October 1, the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Tuariki Delamere, announced today.

"The Ministry is changing its strategic direction from being a delivery agent for hands-on programmes to becoming an expert provider of policy advice for the Government," he said.

"This change in strategic direction means the Pacific communities of Wellington, Porirua and the Hutt Valley will be better served from the one tightly-focused head office."

The Porirua office currently has two staff members, who will join the 17 head office Ministry staff after October 1.
