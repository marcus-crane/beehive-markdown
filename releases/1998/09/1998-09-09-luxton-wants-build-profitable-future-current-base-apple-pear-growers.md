New Minister of Food and Fibre, Hon John Luxton told pipfruit growers this afternoon that the Government wanted to build a profitable future from the current base.

"We live in a fast changing world," Mr Luxton said. "We need to ensure that our valuable pipfruit sector is not constrained by politics and can concentrate on delivering what overseas markets want at a profit to New Zealand growers."

The Minister quoted the 1997 ENZA Annual Report, and CEO Gary Smiths comments on page 7 who said, "Its a hugely competitive market and international pressures are giving us two choices: we stay where we are - where things can only get worse - or we change, and change immediately."

But Mr Luxton said that the Government wants minimal disruption and will carefully and sensible move toward more commercial outcomes and removing dependance on an MMP Parliament to make some of the industry's decisions as at present.

"We want to ensure that growers assets are protected and that they might ultimately make their own decisions about such off farm investments now being made on their behalf," he said.

"The Board does some things very well. We need to build on that existing base to ensure that growers incomes, assets and wealth grows into the future," he said.

Initial plans are due from all the Producer Boards in mid November. The Government will then carefully work through the proposals in the plans and sensibly continue the evolution process on from there.

"As ENZA says in the title of its 1997 Annual Report, "Its a new World". We now all need to work constructively and sensibly to meet that challenge," Mr Luxton concluded.
