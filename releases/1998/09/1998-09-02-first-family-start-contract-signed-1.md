"The Government's new Family Start programme has taken a big step forward, with the signing of the first contract for the delivery of Family Start services," the Ministers of Education, Health and Social Services, Work and Income announced today.

"The contract signed today with Tipu Ora marks significant progress towards the delivery of Family Start services in Rotorua," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said.

"Family Start is an exciting new programme designed to help families in the greatest need from the birth of their baby, if necessary, right up to the time the child starts school. Assistance will be provided in the family home by skilled family workers, committed to making a difference.

"Family Start is an important element of the Government's Strengthening Families Strategy which co-ordinates health, education and welfare services for high risk families in need of help.. Family Start will make a difference for children now and in the future," Mr Creech said.

Family Start in Rotorua is due to begin helping families from December this year. It is expected that at least 100 families will be receiving Family Start services by July next year and 300 by year three of the programme when it is fully operational.

Maternity carers, well child providers and general practitioners will be asked to identify families who they think would benefit most from the Family Start service around the time of the birth of a child. Tipu Ora will work with the family to assess their needs and strengths, and actions they need to take to build a better future for their children and themselves.

The Family Start programme is in addition to the services Tipu Ora already provide to children and families - it does not replace those services. Tipu Ora is a Maori community health mother and child support programme.

The Family Start service in Rotorua is one of three prototype services funded by Government. The others are in Whangarei and Ranui-Massey (West Auckland). In addition, the Early Start programme in Christchurch will be extended. These initiatives were announced in April this year and the contract with Tipu Ora in Rotorua is the first of them to be signed. Tipu Ora's contract is with the Early Childhood Development Unit Board.
