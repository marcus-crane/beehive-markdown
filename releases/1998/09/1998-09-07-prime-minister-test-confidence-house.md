Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today that she will seek leave in Parliament tomorrow to test the confidence of the House in the National-led minority Government.

"The new Cabinet is in place and the new teams of Ministers are focused on the task in hand. It is now time to test our support with a confidence debate and vote tomorrow afternoon.

"I expect that the Government will win the confidence of the House confirming the Government's commonsense approach to managing economic, social and political challenges and our  
ability as a Government to deliver credible responses in all three areas.

"In debate the Government will strongly argue that it's sound management of the economy coupled with its effective social policies have benefited all New Zealanders and we will continue to do so. We will also consider new and innovative solutions that will make a difference," Mrs Shipley concluded.
