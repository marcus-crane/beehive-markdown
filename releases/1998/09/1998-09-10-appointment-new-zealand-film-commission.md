The Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Marie Hasler, today announced an appointment to the New Zealand Film Commission. Mr Hirini Melbourne of Hamilton, has been appointed to the Commission to fill the extraordinary vacancy created by the death of Matiu Mareikura who died suddenly in July.

Mr Melbourne is currently Senior Lecturer at Te Tari Maori within the School of Maori and Pacific Development at the University of Waikato. He is an established writer of Maori songs, poetry and stories and has had a long involvement in films and other audio visual media including being musical consultant and performer for the feature film Once were Warriors.

'Mr Melbourne will bring extensive knowledge and experience to the Commission that will be an excellent complement to the skills of the other members of the Film Commission' Ms Hasler said.

Ms Hasler also paid tribute to the late Matiu Mareikura. 'He made a tremendous contribution to the Commission over many years, both in his role as the Commission's kaumatua and as a member following his appointment in 1996. With his wide knowledge, sound judgement and ability to represent Maori perspectives, Matiu was a highly valued and greatly respected member of the Commission'.

Mr Melbourne's appointment will be until 31 March 1999, that being the expiry date of Mr Mareikura's appointment.
