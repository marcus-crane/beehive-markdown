"For at least the last eight months I have been discussing the review of the Resource Management Act around the country and through my website ( www.arcadia.co.nz and select EnviroNet)," the Minister for the Environment Simon Upton said today

"Key dates coming up are:

The report and recommendations of the Minister's Reference Group will be available from next Monday (21 September 1998).

On 25 September I will give a speech to the RMLA conference outlining the issues that the Government will be looking at.

Then in mid-October formal proposals for amendments to the Act will be released for a further round of public comment, prior to final Government decisions before Christmas.

Any amendments will be introduced into the Parliament at the beginning of the new year."

"For anyone who has followed the debate there will no surprises: there is nothing to leak since everything is in the public domain," Mr Upton concluded.
