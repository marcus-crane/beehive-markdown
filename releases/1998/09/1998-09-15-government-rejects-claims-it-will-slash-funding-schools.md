The Government will not slash funding of all schools who choose to take the Fully Funded Option, as suggested by the PPTA and other teacher organisations. Smaller and poorer schools will generally get more resourcing not less. In fact those schools opting into the new scheme that have had trouble attracting experienced staff will get a larger gain," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech said he had been concerned about some of the critical claims made by the PPTA about direct resourcing.

"Schools who choose the Fully Funded Option will do well because they take real control of what they do.

"The hyped up claims about the Government setting up the scheme generously and then cutting it from under schools are also wrong. The new formula is tied to the top teacher pay rates in primary and secondary schools. If those pay rates increase then so too will the amount of money schools receive.  
"Under current Government policy, the decision of whether to go into the Fully Funded Direct Resourcing Option is a choice for school boards to make. It should be based on educational merit alone - free of duress or unreasonable pressure," Mr Creech said.

Earlier this year schools received details about the new Fully Funded Option of resourcing, with many finding out specifically how it could impact on them. The Ministry of Education distributed information about the new scheme for direct resourcing of teachers' salaries as announced in the Budget.

Schools were given examples of what the difference in dollar terms would be of opting into the Fully Funded scheme.

"Many schools have chosen to manage their total school budgets to help provide extra programmes for their students and to ease workload pressures for teachers," Mr Creech said.

"No school can miss out - there will be no more winner and loser schools."
