Defence Minister Max Bradford will meet visiting United States Pacific Command (CINCPAC) Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Joseph W Prueher, in Auckland tomorrow.

Admiral Prueher is in New Zealand to speak at the Pacific Area Senior Logistics Officers Seminar (PASOLS) conference being held in Auckland this week. He will also take the opportunity to visit New Zealand Defence Force Navy, Army and Air Force bases and units in Auckland, and Army units at Linton.

Mr Bradford said he expected tomorrow's meeting would include discussion on a wide range of mutual interests, including the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region and any developments in the New Zealand-United States relationship.
