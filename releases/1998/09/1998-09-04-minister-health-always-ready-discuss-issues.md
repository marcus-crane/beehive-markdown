Health Minister Bill English said today he was always ready to discuss health issues with interested groups, including Anglican Church leaders.

"Anglican leaders have organised the Hikoi of Hope and want the Government to listen to their views on social issues. My door is always open and every week I meet a wide range of groups to discuss health issues, but I have never been approached by Anglican Church leaders.

"I would be interested to hear their proposed solutions to the health issues they think are important. The Government is working hard to shift health resources into areas with high health needs, such as Maori and Pacific health, and child health, but this does put pressure in other parts of the health service.

"One issue of concern that has been addressed recently is the need for better co-ordination among Ministers. With the recent Cabinet reshuffle the Prime Minister announced the appointment of six teams of Ministers to coordinate and better manage the Government's programmes in each area. The social policy team will be particularly concerned to ensure that health, welfare and education continue working together along the lines started with the Family Start programme.

"There is growing interest from a range of people concerned about social issues and interested in the progress being made right now in social policy.

"For example I met with Grey Power representatives this week. We had a constructive discussion about those areas where they believe the Government is making progress in the care of older people, as well as the areas where they believe improvements could be made. I hope that the participants in the Hikoi of Hope will also be interested in constructive discussion," said Mr English.
