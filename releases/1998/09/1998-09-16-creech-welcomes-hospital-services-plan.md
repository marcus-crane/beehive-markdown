Wyatt Creech, MP for Wairarapa, today welcomed the release of the Government's Hospital Services Plan and said it was good news for the Wairarapa.

"The Hospital Services Plan gives a clear commitment to our hospital services. It states that access to services and quality of services are more important than financial considerations. It sets out the Government's intentions for our hospital," Wyatt Creech said.

The Hospital Services Plan was released today (Wednesday 16 September) by Health Minister Bill English.

"The commitment is to maintain the current services for the next three years. While the Government will keep looking for better ways of providing health services and will work with communities who want to make changes locally, we can be sure that what we have now will be maintained as we work through any discussions."

"Maps in the plan show people where our hospital services fit in and how they relate to other hospitals. Hospitals are ranked according to the complexity of their procedures and the kinds of emergency care they provide. Masterton fits in as a secondary hospital.

"With this Plan it is clear that we can look at hospital services in the Wairarapa with confidence," Mr Creech said.
