Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she was delighted with the performance and commitment of New Zealand athletes who competed at the 1988 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.

"On behalf of all New Zealanders I would like to personally congratulate all of our competitors and officials who proudly represented their country at the Commonwealth Games.

"Kuala Lumpur's searing heat in made it particularly difficult for the athletes, yet all of our competitors did themselves and their country proud.

"Our medal haul was also a fine effort, despite unjustified criticism from some quarters. I think some people will realise they were too quick to judge.

"I congratulate all the team for their outstanding performance in representing our country on the international sporting stage," Mrs Shipley said.
