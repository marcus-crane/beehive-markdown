"New Zealanders must become passionate about making sure our children get the best start in life. If we are to achieve this, families, communities and Government must work together," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley told the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect in Auckland tonight.

"We must be passionate about the value we place on parenting. We must be passionate about recognising and supporting mothers and fathering. We must be passionate about being for nurturing and giving to children.

"We must also be passionate about the importance we put on speaking to children, listening to children and reading to them.

"For children to do well we must be positive and pro-family. At the same time we must be passionately against abuse and neglect.

"Working with families who are struggling to break cycles of abuse and neglect is a difficult but essential task if we are to stop destructive patterns being passed on through generations of New Zealanders.

"We must challenge policy makers and practitioners alike to be innovative and creative, to provide programmes which support and strengthen families to improve the lives of children seriously at risk.

"It is about public support and provision and establishing how we value children and families. We must define these values if we are to move forward and ensure that every child gets the best start to life," Mrs Shipley says.
