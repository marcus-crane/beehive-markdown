The world's largest superyacht race will be part of the America's Cup festivities Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today. The New Zealand's marine industry will host the Millennium Cup race in February of the Year 2000.

It is expected to attract approximately 60 superyachts in the two-day event. This race will be from Auckland to Kawau Island and back and will add to the spectacle of the Americas Cup event.

"That event is not just a chance to celebrate our sporting prowess, it is also a huge opportunity to show New Zealand and Auckland off to the rest of the world." said Mrs Shipley.

"Auckland has an enormous amount to look forward to as we approach the year 2000.

"The APEC conference and associated events will bring to Auckland the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and the United States of America, as well as the leaders of the other 17 leading Asia-Pacific economies, their spouses, their advisers and the world media as well.

"It's a great chance to show what we can offer as a dynamic tourist and business destination," Mrs Shipley concluded.
