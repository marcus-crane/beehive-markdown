"Next year's series of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings will see the eyes of the world on New Zealand and we will be ready to knock their socks-off," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today on launching the official branding for APEC 1999.

The APEC logo will either be in black or in white with the New Zealand Way fern incorporated into it, and has nine distinctive New Zealand colours and images attached to it.

The colours have been specially named for APEC 1999 to reflect unique New Zealand attitudes and values. We have specifically chosen tones that are seen everyday in homes, workplaces, at play and in rural and urban settings all over New Zealand.

"They are more than just New Zealand colours, they also represent our essence as a people," the Prime Minister said at the launch at Auckland's Mt Roskill Grammar School.

The colours represent:

quarter acre OCHRE - landscape, lifestyle, personal space  
kiwi BROWN - our roots, kiwiana, down to earth  
cultuRED - passion, artistic and cultural flair  
SILVER lining - potential, enthusiasm, youth, young industries  
awe BLACK - competitive spirit, sportiness  
zeal TEAL - pioneering spirit, adventurous  
GREEN as - our environment, outdoor recreation  
long WHITE - an island nation, purity, individuality, our vision  
BLUE horizons - entrepreneurs, new ventures, no limitations

"APEC 1999 is a tremendous opportunity for huge numbers of people from around the world to view New Zealand and our region - either directly as visitors, or through international coverage.

"APEC has a combined population of nearly 3 billion people and represents more than half of the total world income and half of world trade.

"Chairing APEC gives New Zealand an unprecedented opportunity to influence the shape of this forum's work on trade and economic cooperation. We are looking forward to hosting 21 of the world's most powerful leaders, more than 11,000 delegates, and the international news media during APEC.

"We have some of the best scenery, food, culture, products and businesses in the world, and APEC will be an unparalleled opportunity for New Zealanders to showcase our corner of the world.

"With so much happening next year, from APEC 1999 to the America's Cup campaign through to the Millennium events and the Rugby World Cup campaign, the eyes of the world will be on New Zealand and we will be ready," said Mrs Shipley.
