Career diplomat Nick Hurley will be New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand?s relationship with Solomons Islands had developed over many years of close association and the political goodwill built up over that time had recently been enhanced by both countries' involvement in the Bougainville peace process.

"The Solomons provided very solid support to the Burnham peace process for Bougainville," Mr McKinnon said. "The contribution of Prime Minister Ulufa'alu at the Lincoln talks directly resulted in the Bougainville ceasefire agreement."

Mr McKinnon said that although exports to Solomon Islands currently totalled only $12 million annually, New Zealand's help in developing the Solomons' economy would have benefits for the longer-term trading relationship.

"The New Zealand Official Development Assistance contribution underscores our commitment to assisting the Solomons with the sustainable development of their social and economic infrastructure," he said.

Mr McKinnon said that Mr Hurley had the attributes and experience to advance New Zealand's strong relationship with Solomon Islands.

Mr Hurley, currently a Deputy Director of the Ministry's Development Cooperation Division, joined the Foreign Service in 1974. He has served in Paris and Rome, and has had Pacific assignments in Rarotonga and as Deputy High Commissioner in Suva.

Mr Hurley will take up his position in January, replacing Mr Rhys Richards who is returning to Wellington.
