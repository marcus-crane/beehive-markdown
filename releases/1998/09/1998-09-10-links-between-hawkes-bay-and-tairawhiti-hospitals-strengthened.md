Health Minister Bill English announced today that links between Health Care Hawkes Bay and Tairawhiti Healthcare were to be strengthened with the appointment of both board chairs as a director on the other board.

"Ms Patricia Seymour, who I have recently appointed as chairman of Tairawhiti Healthcare, will be appointed as a director of Health Care Hawkes Bay. Mr Peter Wilson, who has been chairman of Health Care Hawkes Bay for a number of years, will be appointed as a director of the Tairawhiti board.

"I am making these reciprocal appointments to strengthen the relationship between the two hospitals and to emphasise the close working relationship that they need to have. It is important that they work together cooperatively in the best interests of the people of the Hawkes Bay and the East Coast.

"Similar reciprocal appointments have been made on other hospital boards where they need to work together cooperatively.

"Ms Seymour is a farmer and a member of a number of community organisations. She has recently completed research projects in community health administration. Mr Wilson is a business consultant and an experienced company director," said Mr English.
