New Zealand has joined seven other countries in calling for greater action by nuclear weapons states to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons.

At a meeting in New York, the Foreign Minsters of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden reaffirmed their intentions to introduce a resolution at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly calling for urgent action on nuclear disarmament.

Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today from New York that while there has been some movement by nuclear weapons states to reduce nuclear weapons, much still needs to be done.

"When we signed up to the indefinite extension of the Non Proliferation Treaty we expected significant movement in the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons by nuclear weapons states," Mr McKinnon said.

"This has happened to some degree, but testing in South Asia has made us all aware of the need to move more rapidly towards a nuclear free world."

Mr McKinnon said it was important to keep up the momentum on disarmament and not allow international opinion to become preoccupied just with economic problems.

"We would like to see as many countries as possible support the resolution and currently consultations are underway amongst UN members to assess their support."
