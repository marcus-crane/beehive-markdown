Health Minister Bill English said the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Amendment Bill introduced into Parliament today would give victims the right to be notified of the release or escape of people detained in mental health services.

"The right for victims to be notified of the release or escape of people detained in mental health services will be achieved through related amendments to the Victims of Offences Act 1987.

"The other key change proposed in the Amendment Bill is the need for whanau to be consulted as part of the assessment and treatment process.

"The Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992 provides for the compulsory assessment and treatment of people who are considered to be mentally disordered. The proposed amendments are largely technical in nature and will remove a number of practical difficulties that have emerged with the operation of the Act. The key changes are:

- additional powers for compulsory assessment and treatment of proposed patients
- the need for whanau to be consulted as part of the assessment and treatment process
- clarification of the powers of officials acting under the Act to use necessary force
- extension of civil immunity for district inspectors and review tribunals
- greater flexibility in appointment, functioning and removal of officals
- clarification of matters relating to Review Tribunals
- procedural amendments to facilitate the effective operation of the Act
- related amendments to the Victims of Offences Act 1987 and to the Coroners Act 1988 (to correct reference to the Mental Health Act 1969).

"The proposed amendments are consistent with recommendations in the Mason Report. The Bill is expected to have its second reading when Parliament sits again in November," said Mr English.
