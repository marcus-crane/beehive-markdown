Health Minister Bill English today announced that 17 people nominated by their communities would be appointed to 11 of the country's hospital boards.

"This is the first significant group of people appointed to hospitals since the intention to appoint people nominated from the community was announced a year ago. Up to two positions on each board are available for community nominations.

"The first community nominations were announced in May when the new boards were appointed to run the two Bay of Plenty hospitals - Western Bay Health and Eastbay Health.

"I am pleased to be able to make these latest appointments. The process has taken a little longer than anticipated, but we now have some excellent new directors on our hospital boards. Not all local authorities have chosen to make nominations, but the option is still open to them if they wish to do so in future," said Mr English.
