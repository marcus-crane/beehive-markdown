State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today the Government has no plans to sell TVNZ subsidiary BCL.

"Our commercial advice is that it does not make sense to sell BCL separately to TVNZ," Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall was responding to a statement released by Alliance MP Pam Corkery. Mr Ryall said the confusion was caused by the long-winded question put by Mrs Corkery in the House this afternoon.
