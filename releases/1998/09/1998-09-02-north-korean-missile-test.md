"New Zealand is deeply concerned at North Korea's testing of a ballistic missile on 31 August", the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon Simon Upton, said today.

"North Korea's test firing of a ballistic missile is extremely worrying and provocative. It will have an adverse affect on the security situation in North East Asia".

"The Government is also concerned that the test might herald a new round of missile proliferation, should North Korea seek to export the new design. We call on North Korea to show restraint and refrain from the export of missile equipment and technology."

As an active member of the Missile Technology Control Regime New Zealand is opposed to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and, indeed, all forms of weapons of mass destruction.
