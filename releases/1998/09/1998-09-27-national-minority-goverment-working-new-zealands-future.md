The National-minority government is committed to producing more jobs for New Zealanders, paying our way, paying off debt and improving our future prospects for all New Zealanders," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"While other political parties carp on about what they are against, this Government is getting on with trying to find real solutions which will deliver hope and success to our country.

"The severe drought and the current international economic troubles require all of us as New Zealanders, to renew our efforts. In order to have a positive and successful future the Government is working with other political parties and independent members to see how we can best achieve this.

Short, medium and long-term measures are required. Paralysis and inaction is not an option. Progress and an energetic response is required," the Prime Minister said.

In considering all the options, this Government is currently focussing on:

\- Increasing New Zealand's competitiveness and New Zealanders' disposable incomes  
\- Protecting high-quality social spending  
\- Ensuring that low-income people are not taxed to pay benefits to the better off  
\- Reducing disparities of opportunity and breaking cycles of disadvantage  
\- Protecting and enhancing New Zealand's fiscal position with sound public policy.

"The Government is actively working on measures that will deliver a recovery in prosperity and confidence. We will do this carefully and effectively and make announcements when agreements are reached and decisions are taken," the Prime Minister concluded.
