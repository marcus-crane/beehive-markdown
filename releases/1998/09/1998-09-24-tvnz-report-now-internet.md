In response to considerable public demand, the Ord Minnett scoping report of TVNZ has been made available on the Internet, State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today.

The report can be accessed through Mr Ryall's homepage at:

Mr Ryall said the telephones in his office had been ringing off the hook this morning for copies of the Ord Minnett report.

"There is a great deal of public interest in the future of TVNZ," he said.

"We want the public to be fully aware of the risks associated with ongoing public ownership of TVNZ. The report has been released in its entirety, save for commercially sensitive information that could affect TVNZ's market position if it were known to competitors."

Mr Ryall reiterated that the Government would continue to monitor developments in the television industry but had no plans to sell TVNZ.
