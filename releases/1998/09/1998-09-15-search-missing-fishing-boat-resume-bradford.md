Following a request from the families of a missing commercial fishing boat's crew, Defence Minister Max Bradford said today he had asked Defence to renew its search.

The Endeavour III and its crew of three were last heard of on Tuesday, 18 August, just out from the Bay of Islands. The alarm was raised on Thursday afternoon, 20 August, and the National Rescue Coordination Centre (NRCC) began the search that afternoon.

No trace of the Endeavour III or its crew were found during the NRCC search, which included the use of an RNZAF Orion which covered around 23,000 square miles of ocean, and the official search was called off.

Mr Bradford said new information from the family about the possible location had now prompted a further search in a specific location using the Navy's sonar equipment. The seabed search will begin as soon as a Navy ship can reach the area.

"My sincerest sympathies to the families of the missing crew, and the frustration they must feel in not having some form of resolution," Mr Bradford said.

"We hope the sonar search will find the Endeavour III's location and provide some resolution to the tragedy."
