Associate Minister of Justice Tony Ryall welcomed today the 'Dealing With Crime' report commissioned by Auckland City.

Mr Ryall said he would be seeking a full copy of the report and a chance to bring the Safer Auckland City group together with the justice and security team of Ministers to look into the recommendations of the report.

"From what I have seen, the report contains valuable information and ideas on crime prevention. I welcome any chance for the justice and security team of Ministers to sit down and discuss proposals that make our communities safer," Mr Ryall said.
