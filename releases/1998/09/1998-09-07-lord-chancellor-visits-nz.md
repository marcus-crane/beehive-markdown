The Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom, Lord Irvine, is to visit New Zealand this week.

In welcoming the visit, the Attorney-General, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today Lord Irvine is a member of the British Cabinet, head of the judiciary and Speaker of the House of Lords.

'Lord Irvine's visit will allow Ministers and senior members of New Zealand's legal fraternity to discuss issues we have in common with him,' Mr Graham said.

Lord and Lady Irvine arrive tomorrow and leave for Australia on Friday.
