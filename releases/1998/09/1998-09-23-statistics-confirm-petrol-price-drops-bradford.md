Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says Statistics New Zealand figures confirm petrol prices have fallen significantly as real competition has hit the industry.

Statistics New Zealand quarterly data shows that prices for regular (91 octane) petrol have fallen from 91 cents a litre in December last year to 89 cents in March and 83.9 cents in June this year (weighted average prices for the whole of New Zealand).

Mr Bradford said one of the Government's major objectives in the energy sector has been to get real competition into the petrol industry, and through that, lower prices for consumers.
