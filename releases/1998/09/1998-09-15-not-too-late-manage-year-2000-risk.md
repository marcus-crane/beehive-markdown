The Government made it clear today that it is not too late for organisations to manage their Year 2000 computer risks.

"The report of the Prime Minister's Task Force on problems associated with the Year 2000, released today confirms that if remedial action is taken now, the risks of serious disruption can be significantly reduced," the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon Jenny Shipley said.

The Y2K Readiness Report makes 10 key recommendations for Government to improve New Zealand's readiness to manage any threats to vital infrastructure, health and safety services and businesses caused by widespread failure of computers and other equipment containing computer technology.

"The report finds that awareness of the Year 2000 problem is high with many organisations claiming they are well prepared. However, in reality many organisations in vital areas have not yet completed an inventory of critical systems or allocated the resources and people to identify and fix problems.

"The key areas of concern include providers of electricity, water, sewage disposal and health services, while the banking and finance, oil and rail sectors appear to be managing the risk well.

"It is clear that the Government must act as a catalyst for action to ensure that Year 2000 risks across the private sector and the public sector are well managed so as to avoid disruption to the lives of New Zealanders.

"There is still sufficient time for organisations to put contingency plans in place to cope with failures if and when they arise.

"The major risk is that failures may occur when computers fail to recognise the transition from 1999 to 2000 and shut down. This could involve any machine from the family video player to a city's sewage disposal system.

"In response the Government has established the YK2 Readiness Commission to raise awareness and understanding of the Year 2000 problem, to be chaired by Basil Logan, with David Henry as Deputy Chair. This will particularly focus on collaboration and information-sharing for organisations supplying electricity, water, sewage disposal and health services."

The Government will also:

\- take a leadership role on the issue which is of vital importance to the country's social and economic wellbeing and the health and safety of citizens;

\- strengthen the accountability of chief executives and board members in the wider public sector to manage the Year 2000 problem;

\- develop a Year 2000 risk assessment across the wider public sector;

\- require all Crown agencies to include a Year 2000 compliance condition in all their supply contracts; and

\- set up electronic directories of Year 2000 information for sharing among New Zealand organisations.

The Task Force recommended the Government consider legislation to limit the legal liability of those sharing information in good faith.

"We have decided against pursuing so-called "Good Samaritan" legislation to protect the legal liability of those sharing information in good faith, as other countries are finding that this kind of legislation because of legal difficulties may not necessarily achieve that objective.

"Instead, the Government will require the Y2K Readiness Commission to explore other ways in which the sharing of information on testing results and regimes can be achieved."

The Task Force also recommended changes in the tax treatment of Year 2000 expenditure to encourage businesses to bring forward their Year 2000 remedial spending, and a public information campaign to inform the public about the problem.

"We have decided not to proceed with the tax initiative for three main reasons. Firstly, private sector businesses have strong commercial incentives to rectify their Year 2000 problems without the need for further taxpayer-funded incentives. Second, many of the organisations in critical areas are publicly owned and do not pay taxes and a tax initiative would not provide  
any incentive for them. Finally, giving businesses a tax advantage now would be unfair in respect of those businesses who have already taken action to prepare for Year 2000.

"We also believe that consumer interest would be best served through the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and that at this stage a campaign aimed at the general public is not necessary.

"The fact that we have accepted the bulk of the recommendations is a tribute to a Task Force that has come up with a sound set of recommendations that strike the right balance between sensible risk management and imprudent and alarmist over-reaction.

"We are committed to playing a key role in making sure that, as far as we are able, we will be prepared for any Year 2000 problems and, if systems do fail, we have contingency plans in place in all the critical areas to make sure there is minimal disruption to our social and economic environment, and that the health and safety of New Zealanders is not compromised.

"Minister for Information Technology, Hon Maurice Williamson will oversee the commission and associated work," Mrs Shipley concluded.

The total cost Y2K programme is likely to be between $3 and $3.5 million.
