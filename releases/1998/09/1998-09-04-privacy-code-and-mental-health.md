Health Minister Bill English today launched guidelines for people working in the mental health sector on the Health Information Privacy Code.

"Too often we hear of families frustrated because they cannot get the information they need about a family member who has been admitted as a mental health patient.

"It will always be a fine line between patient's rights to privacy and family or close friends need for information," Mr English said.

"These guidelines aim to help mental health professionals strike that balance. A second set of guidelines is currently being developed for consumers and their families," he said.

"The guidelines are a collaborative effort between the Mental Health Commission, the Ministry of Health and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. By working together these agencies have developed a practical, user-friendly guide.

"This work also fulfils another of the Mason Report recommendations to help health professionals understand how the Health Information Privacy Code applies to the mental health sector.

"All service providers have a responsibility to be very clear with consumers about what their rights are for privacy," Mr English said.
