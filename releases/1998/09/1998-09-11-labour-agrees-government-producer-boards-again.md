Yet another Labour spokesperson agrees with the Government on the evolution of and continuing change to Producer Boards, Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Boarder Control, Hon John Luxton said tonight.

"Labour's Agricultural spokes person, Hon Jim Sutton yet again copied another progressive Government policy," Mr Luxton said tonight in response to a release from him. "Yesterday Dr Cullen agreed with the Government that some functions of some Boards are "essential and need support", and we needed "more value added".

"Tonight Jim Sutton is again copying Government policy on several fronts. He says that Labour;

1\. "doesn't oppose change",  
2\. that "there will be changes to producer board legislation to ensure that New Zealand responds to the ever changing global marketplace",  
3\. "is interested in solutions that work",  
4\. that "the producer will have the biggest say"  
5\. "that change must be well informed and careful"

"It is good to see support from both Dr Cullen and now again Jim Sutton for the producer board evolution that the Government is encouraging to help lift farmers and growers incomes, wealth and standards of living. And despite what some people in the cities thing, when farmers are doing well the people in the towns do well

"The Government has no intention of rushing into any changes although some Boards have indicated to the government that they want some changes as son as possible On November 15 nothing will change, but we will carefully and sensibly work through the industry proposals." he said.

November 15 is the date that former Treasurer announced in the May Budget for each of the 9 Producer Boards to provide initial plans to Government on their strategies for the new millennium.

"The Government is not anti Producer Boards it is pro increasing farmers incomes. Farmers and growers have had some tough years under the current over politicised systems. We will carefully respond to the Board's initial plans to ensure that Farmers and growers can build a more profitable future from the current base. It is good to see Labour showing some support for the Governments moves," Mr Luxton concluded.
