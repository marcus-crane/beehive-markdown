A Deed of Settlement will be signed in Turangi on Saturday by the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, and representatives of Ngati Turangitukua to settle the tribe's claim over Turangi township.

The claim arose from Crown breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi during construction of the Turangi township following the decision to proceed with the Tongariro power scheme in the mid-1960s.

The negotiated settlement follows the Waitangi Tribunal's remedies report on the claim which, for the first time, made interim binding orders for the resumption of properties subject to Section 27B of the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act 1988.

The Crown and Ngati Turangitukua had 90 days to negotiate a settlement and avoid the orders becoming binding on 5 October.

Details of the settlement will be available after the signing at 11am at Hirangi Marae, Turangi, on Saturday morning.
