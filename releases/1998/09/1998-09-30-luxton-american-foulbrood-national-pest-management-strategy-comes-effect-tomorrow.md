The national pest management strategy for American foulbrood formally comes into effect tomorrow (Thursday October 1), the Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, John Luxton has announced.

It is the second national pest management strategy given formal effect under the Biosecurity Act and will provide the legal mechanism for the control of American foulbrood (AFB), a disease of honey bees, throughout New Zealand. The strategy replaces the previous control programme implemented under the Apiaries Act 1969.

Under the strategy, the National Beekeepers ? Association of New Zealand Incorporated will be responsible for the control of American foulbrood. The strategy provides incentives for beekeepers to take responsibility for identifying and destroying the disease in their own hives, with the long term goal of eliminating AFB from New Zealand.

The strategy has been prepared by the Association after an extensive process of consultation with beekeepers and other interested parties.

?I am very pleased to see a small industry group like the National Beekeepers? Association using provisions under the Biosecurity Act to take responsibility for managing a disease of concern to them, and putting into effect a strategy that suits their needs,? Mr Luxton said.

The strategy will remain in force until 30 September 2008, but will be reviewed after five years to ensure it stays on target to meet its objectives.
