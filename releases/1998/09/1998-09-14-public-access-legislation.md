Issues surrounding public access to legislation are canvassed in a discussion paper distributed by the Parliamentary Counsel Office.

The Attorney-General, Rt Hon D.A.M. Graham, said today the paper is principally about how legislation should be made available to the public.

It also raises the issue of how proposed changes to Acts in the form of Bills presented to Parliament might be better presented to the public.

'Official versions of legislation are currently made available to the public only in a printed form,' he said.

'These days the printed medium is just one way of obtaining information. Much information is now available in electronic form.

'In particular, information previously made available in printed form is now disseminated on CD-Rom or is accessible on-line from the Internet.

'This new technology is equally applicable to the dissemination of legislation, and many overseas jurisdictions are now making their legislation publicly available in both printed and electronic form.

The discussion paper raises the following issues:

What role should the state and the private sector play in providing access to legislation?  
What forms (printed, electronic, on-line) should an official version of legislation take?  
On what basis should the Government charge for access to legislation?  
In what forms (printed, electronic, on-line) should Bills be published?  
Mr Graham said the Government invited comments by 31 October from users of legislation and the general public on these issues.

'While the Government has yet to determine its policy on these issues, their comments will be taken into account when formulating recommendations on these issues,' he said.
