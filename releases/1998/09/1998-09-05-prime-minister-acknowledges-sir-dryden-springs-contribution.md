"Sir Dryden Spring has made an enormous and outstanding contribution to the New Zealand dairy industry over the last 30 years," said Jenny Shipley today after Sir Dryden announced his retirement.

"He has successfully managed change within the industry nationally and internationally to the benefit of not only the dairy industry but New Zealand's economy."

In Sir Dryden's time as chairman of the Dairy Board he has seen the number of manufacturing companies fall from around 19 to 9, has strongly supported the move away from commodity trading into consumer products and the expansion of the dairy industry's marketing operation into the four corners of the globe, resulting in export receipts in excess of $7 billion this past year.

"I wish Sir Dryden and his family all the best for the future.

"As we manage our way forward with Producer Board reform I look forward to working with the new leadership of the dairy industry," concluded the Prime Minister.
