State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall has written to Damien O'Connor seeking clarification of the West Coast MP's support for the West Coast Accord and sustainable forestry management on the West Coast.

"Helen Clark's Labour party, Native Forest Action and Forest and Bird all signed the West Coast Accord in 1986. The Accord locked up 181,000 hectares of native forests to bring the total area of protected forest to 1.4 million hectares. It also made 130,000 hectares available for production forestry in perpetuity.

"Labour, NFA and Forest and Bird are now welching on that deal and breaking faith with the people of the West Coast.

"Damien O'Connor has been an ardent supporter of the West Coast Accord in the past. I am writing to him asking whether he will continue to do so, or whether he will desert the people of the West Coast and get in to bed with Native Forest Action and Forest and Bird.

"West Coast families could lose their livelihoods thanks to Helen Clark and her mates in Native Forest Action and Forest and Bird.

"Damien O'Connor must make it clear to the people who sent him to Parliament where he stands on this issue."
