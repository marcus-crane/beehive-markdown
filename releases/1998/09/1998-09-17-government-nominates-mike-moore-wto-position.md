Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today announced the Government's decision to nominate Rt Hon Mike Moore, Waimakariri MP, as a candidate for the position of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation.

"Mike Moore has the experience to provide firm, even-handed and farsighted leadership to the WTO that is appropriate for the times, " Mrs Shipley said today.

The position will become vacant in 1999 when the first Director-General Renato Ruggiero completes his term.

"As a former Prime Minister and senior Cabinet Minister, Mr Moore has had a high profile on the international stage and is committed to open economies and free trade as opposed to outdated protectionist ideals of the far left.

"Mr Moore's political skills and determination are well known to his colleagues in New Zealand and overseas. Many recall his active engagement in the Uruguay Round and his concern to deliver the benefits of international trade widely, including to developing countries.

"The WTO has been well led by Renato Ruggiero and I believe Mr Moore would be a worthy successor, bringing the necessary authority and leadership as the WTO moves towards a new round of negotiations in the year 2000."

"New Zealand's decision to field a candidate was not lightly taken. The importance of the WTO position is evidenced by the quality of nominees.

The WTO position is being contested by a number of candidates, including the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand and the former Canadian Minister of International Trade.

"Our national input and commitment first to the GATT and now to the WTO reflects the importance of trade in generating income and employment. We have all been reminded over the past year of the importance of global trade links and of a rule-based system. We hope other WTO members - large and small - will give Mr Moore their support and we will be helping him to secure this," Mrs Shipley said.
