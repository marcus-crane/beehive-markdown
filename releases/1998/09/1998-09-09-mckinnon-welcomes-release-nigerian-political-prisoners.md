Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, today warmly welcomed the release of 21 Nigerian activists who have been held in detention since 1994.

The activists were released from detention under order from the Nigerian High Court which ruled that the continued detention of the Ogoni prisoners without trial was unconstitutional and unlawful. The Ogonis were among the last remaining political prisoners in Nigeria to be released.

"New Zealand welcomes the release of the Ogoni prisoners after four long years in prison without trial," Mr McKinnon said.

"General Abubakar has said to the international community that he is committed to releasing all political prisoners and to restoring democracy in Nigeria. The release of these prisoners is a further positive signal that the new Nigerian leadership is serious about honoring its international commitments."

"When I met General Abubakar last week in Durban I conveyed the support of the New Zealand Government for the positive steps he has taken."

The Minister noted that the Commonwealth has taken a lead role internationally in encouraging the restoration of democracy and improving human rights in Nigeria.

"It is clear that Nigeria still has a number of challenges ahead before democracy is fully restored and human rights are improved but the international community, including the Commonwealth, will be considerably encouraged by the release of the Ogoni prisoners. It is another positive step forward."

Mr McKinnon is the Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), established at the 1995 Auckland CHOGM to monitor Commonwealth countries' compliance with the principles of democracy and human rights as set out in the 1991 Harare Declaration.

CMAG is next scheduled to meet in London on 8 and 9 October when recent developments in Nigeria will be a focal point of discussion.
