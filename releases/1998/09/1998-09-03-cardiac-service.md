Health Minister Bill English announced today the new cardiac service for the South Island was a step closer with the first patients expected to be treated before the end of the year.

"Canterbury Health, HealthCare Otago and Mr Dick Bunton, on behalf of the surgeons, advise that the Heads of Agreement is now unconditional. The three parties are committed to getting the service operating from the two sites, Dunedin and Christchurch. It is now up to them to work with Southern Regional Health to develop the best possible service.

"The two Crown health enterprises will form a joint venture with 50/50 ownership. The joint venture board will be chaired by an independent chairperson and include representation from the two CHEs and the surgeons. Where there are conflict of interests the interested parties will step down from the decision making," Mr English said.

"South Islanders who live away from Dunedin have already waited too long for a more local service.

"It is now up to the three parties to complete final contractual arrangements and prepare for the first patients at the Christchurch site this side of Christmas," he said.

"I have been as frustrated as anyone by the delays in getting this service up and running. If we had been able to spend every cent that went on lawyers fees on the services the people of the South Island would be better off," Mr English said.

"One potential hold up could be the delivery of new equipment needed to set up the Christchurch site but the parties advise me they are hopeful of the service being in place by the end of the year," Mr English said.
