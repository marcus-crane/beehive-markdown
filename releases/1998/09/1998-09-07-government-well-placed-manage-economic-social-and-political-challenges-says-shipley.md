The Government is in a good position to manage economic, social and political challenges with a new strategy that builds on its existing programme, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"The Government has been fully briefed on Treasury's forecasts which will be released tomorrow and they present ongoing challenges for the Government and New Zealanders.

"We have a commonsense strategy to meet those challenges to help New Zealand build on the gains we have already made.

"To date the Government's programme has resulted in more disposable incomes through tax cuts, electricity reforms and parallel importing. We have also introduced the Community Wage, increased funding for education, improved support for families, reduced Government spending and debt.

"We are currently working on ACC reform, roading reform, the review of producer boards, simpler tax laws, the new Work and Income Service and improving outcomes in other key social areas such as education and housing. We are also continuing the tariff review and the review of tertiary education, preparations for the APEC conference, and simplifying legislation such as the Resource Management Act.

"In the coming weeks and months the Government will introduce specific measures which build on the gains already made. This is a progressive Government with a strategy to manage the economic, social and political challenges before us," Mrs Shipley said.
