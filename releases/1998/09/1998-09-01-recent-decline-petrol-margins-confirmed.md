The Minister of Enterprise and Energy, Hon Max Bradford, says the latest Ministry of Commerce analysis shows that since the second quarter of 1996 petrol importer margins have been falling at about 1.6 cents per litre a year. This compares with the trend of the margin increasing by about 1 cent a litre per year from 1990 through to 1996.

"I fully expect the price competition brought about by the entry of Challenge! into the market early this year, and pending entry by other retailers, to lead to further pressure on petrol margins," Mr Bradford said. The analysis is included in the Ministry of Commerce's Energy Data File, which is published every six months. The publication includes extensive energy supply and demand data for New Zealand, providing valuable information for the efficient functioning of the energy market.

The latest edition includes national energy supply and demand statistics up to March 1998, and covers the range of energy markets - oil, gas, coal, electricity and renewables.
