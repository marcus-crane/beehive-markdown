Health Minister Bill English said today National Heart Week was a timely reminder that people needed to take responsibility for their own health, starting with a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

Mr English joined runner Ann Hare for an early morning jog this morning to join the National Heart Foundation for a breakfast to celebrate the start of Heart Week.

"People need to help themselves. Heart disease is a very real problem and we hear a lot about it, but not enough attention is given to the simple things each of us can do to change our lives for the better.

"It's the day-to-day actions that count. Walking to work, kicking your smoking habit, having a balanced diet and keeping to the resolutions you set yourself.

"While New Zealanders are often percieved as healthy outdoorsy types, our rate of heart disease remains appreciably higher than that of Australia, Canada or the United States and we need to start taking responsibility for ourselves.

"New Zealanders need to start looking after their hearts. Thirty eight percent of men and 32 percent of women are dying before their time from disease which could be prevented with just a bit more attention to a balanced lifestyle," said Mr English.
