The Minister of Enterprise and Commerce, Max Bradford, said today from Kuala Lumpur that the Asian and emerging world financial crisis weighed heavily on the minds of ministers present at the 5th Meeting of APEC Ministers responsible for SMEs (small to medium sized enterprises).

"Although every country in the region is reporting significantly lower economic growth forecasts than 6 months ago, there is an emerging determination to face up to the problems associated with a collapse in investor and financial market confidence," Mr Bradford said from Kuala Lumpur where he has been attending the APEC SME Ministers meeting.

"It was heartening to hear there was no call from any country to return to policies of the past. Continuing with trade liberalisation was strongly supported, though the pace might differ to reflect the impact of the financial crisis on some countries."

Mr Bradford said there was support for APEC Finance Ministers to pursue with vigour a review of securities and financial market regulatory mechanisms in the region, to ensure the scale and manner of collapse in the last few months could not happen in future.

"This review will be a key component of APEC's economic recovery. The particular measures that had to be taken by Hong Kong and Malaysia in recent weeks could be avoided in large part by a financial and capital market regulatory framework that removes the speculative opportunities characterising the Asian markets at present.

"But equally important is the need to have far greater transparency in the banking and commercial sector so there can be no unpleasant surprises for investors whether from within APEC countries or outside.

"I was able to outline New Zealand's experience and response to a similar financial crisis in 1987 when stock markets collapsed. The parallels between 1987 and 1998 are eerie, but very instructive for many Asian countries which are facing major drops in asset values. In the end, our solutions didn't lie in closing our borders to trade or capital flows.

"It was particularly heartening at the meeting to listen to APEC ministers reject such solutions in their case, and project solutions that embrace further trade liberalisation, and the strengthening and transparency of APEC financial markets."

Mr Bradford outlined New Zealand's proposal to focus the work of APEC in 1999, when it has the Chair's role for APEC leaders, on competition and regulatory frameworks to enhance the fundamental direction of APEC in encouraging trade liberalisation in the Asian-Pacific region.

"This proposed focus was quite consistent with, indeed supportive of, the sentiments expressed by Ministers at the meeting," he said.

"Although the financial crisis is a storm cloud over the Asian region at present, there is great confidence it will pass. The determination of individual countries to grit their teeth and learn from the crisis was very heartening for the New Zealand delegation, but it is clear there is no instant magic bullet solution. APEC is proving to be an important agent for sharing information and experiences, and for promoting collective solutions to what are clearly common problems."

Mr Bradford also announced New Zealand's invitation for the next meeting of SME Ministers to be held in late April-early May 1999 in the South Island.
