The Prime Minister today encouraged all primary producers to get involved in the industry debate that is currently underway.

The Prime Minister will meet with Nelson Growers tonight. The meeting is one of a number of meetings that I and other Ministers and MPs are holding around New Zealand.

"The success of our horticultural and agricultural industries is something I take very seriously, particularly as an MP for one of New Zealand largest agricultural electorates.

"I am committed to the future prosperity of growers and farmers and I believe in always asking ourselves if we can do things in a better way. Agriculture will continue to be a major part of the New Zealand economy.

"I know that the review of producer boards is attracting a lot of discussion. But that discussion is currently tending to focus on the crude arguments of regulation versus deregulation when in fact what the Government has asked the primary sector to come up with a strategic plan for their industry and to outline how they see the future.

"We have raised the prospect that, at some stage, the current regulatory framework may change but there is no suggestion this will happen on 15 November, or soon after as some allege.

"The Government's view is that today's rapidly changing world requires us to review the way we do business and the ways in which Government can encourage business growth. In short, we want to provide an environment that helps - not hinders - growth in our primary production sectors.

"We need to improve returns to growers. We need to improve our performance overseas. We need to increase investment in our industries. We need to plan a marketing strategy for the future.

"These are some of the questions being asked and solutions sought as part of the review of Boards.

"The question as to whether the statutory backing of producer boards is the best way to deliver maximum returns to New Zealand growers is an issue that has largely been left up to industry to decide. The plans received by Government on 15 November will then be considered with the industry concerned. There are nine very different industries which will come up with nine very different plans. The detail, the timetable for change and the commercial and marketing solutions will all vary. That is expected and as it should be.

"I can assure growers right now that there is no agreed legislative agenda to deregulate producer boards regardless of the arguments.

"It is up to each industry to decide how they are going to look forward. Government's role is one of leadership while leaving the mechanics and the detail to industry. The reason Government is involved is that the law currently defines how each of these business can or in some instances cannot work. Government needs to work with growers to decide if this is serving their interests.

"We have indicated to each Board that the types of questions we will be asking as we consider the Boards' plans will include:

- the changing international trading environment is recognised and New Zealand's international trade interests and obligations are met;
- there is a separation of the regulatory function from commercial operations;
- the proposed commercial structures are flexible and future-orientated (with respect to the industry and their markets);
- the potential for domestic competition is accommodated;
- legislative provisions required to give effect to the plan are identified;
- the plan provides the opportunity for the maximisation of returns to producers and to New Zealand as a whole;
- there is increased transparency from producers' perspective;
- accountability and governance structures are improved;
- ownership issues are clarified (including intellectual property rights);
- commercial objectives are enhanced and facilitated;
- the plan improves (or maintains) the effective management of tariff quota rents;
- innovation and alternative marketing strategies are encouraged and accommodated (for example, new branding, organics, new products)
- new investment is encouraged; and
- existing investment is protected.

"When each board provides its plan to Government, Ministers will sit down with each group separately and work through the issues. We will then decide case by case what action will be required. There is no intention to write off value. There is only an intention to seek ways to improve accountability and performance for all concerned.

"I am committed to ensuring that we continue to have a vibrant and confident primary sector which provides satisfactory grower returns. That is what the review of producer boards is all about. This issue is not about politics. It is about ensuring a strong future for the industries." the Prime Minister concluded.
