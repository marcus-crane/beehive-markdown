Minister of Local Government Tony Ryall is urging voters in the local body elections to exercise their democratic right within the next 36 hours.

"Voting in the local body elections ends at midday on Saturday. If you don't vote, then you really can't complain about your rates going up," Mr Ryall said. "Make sure you have your say. It is not too late.

"Electing local mayors and councillors is important. These people have a big say in many of the things that affect our families and communities.

"Not only do these elections provide for representative decision making at local and regional levels, they also decide the people responsible for much of our country's key infrastructure assets. Local government accounts for some 3.5% of all goods and services produced in New Zealand."
