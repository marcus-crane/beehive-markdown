The people of Hawke's Bay have faced testing times with the severe drought and the international financial instability adding to a difficult business climate," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley acknowledged during a visit to the district today.

"While it has been and is demanding for all concerned, there is room to be optimistic about our future, both locally and nationally.

"I believe that the recent resurgence in business confidence and the lower exchange rate and falling interest rates provide New Zealand with a genuine opportunity to experience an economic recovery in very difficult circumstances.

Mrs Shipley today met with local farmers and pipfruit growers and their families to get a first hand impression of the extent and seriousness of the drought on the region.

The Government hopes that the extra support for farmers in the worst drought affected areas has helped make some difference.

"I congratulate the Hawke's Bay community for the way they have pulled together to cope with the effects of the drought. In addition, Federated Farmers must be congratulated for the coordination job they have done in the district," said Mrs Shipley.

"While this will not bring an end to the drought, the funding will ease some of the pain through technical support, rural support, counselling, management and coordination and grants to community trusts. Overall the Government has provided $330,000 of rural sector assistance and $300,000 of technical assistance and rural counselling in all the drought affected districts.  
Welfare assistance will continue to be available until the end of March 1999," concluded Mrs Shipley.
