"Artists and cultural organisations play a major role in adding depth to the tourism experience in New Zealand," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said on opening the cultural tourism symposium Capturing the Cultural Tourist, in Nelson today.

"Our art and cultural heritage adds colour and texture to our story and speaks of who we are, where we have come from. It also provides a strong reflection of what we have to offer the world. They extend the image and the identity of not only our country but also individual regions by adding depth, texture and colour to a visitors' experience.

"As a pioneering nation with an emphasis on an outdoor lifestyle, it has been easy for us to promote New Zealand as an exciting playground for the adventurous, as well as promoting our scenery.

The modern tourist from New Zealand or abroad is wanting something extra. They want to know more, to feel more, to understand more about the people and the country. Cultural tourism development responds to that call and has huge growth potential.

"The 1997 Ministry of Cultural Affairs Survey showed that 77 percent of New Zealanders believe that we are not as well known for our culture and cultural activities as we are for other aspects, such as sport and scenery.

"The challenge for the tourism industry now is to present the complex, diverse and exciting experience of our artistic and cultural heritage to New Zealand visitors.

"New Zealand has some of the best artists in the world. We must continue to use our kiwi ingenuity to engage visitors so that they can discover and experience the artists' work. Artists need to constantly look for new opportunities to work with both the local and governmental level to everyone's mutual benefit. The challenge is for all the players to work collaboratively  
to capture what can be unlimited rewards for individuals, communities and New Zealand.

"We need to draw on the richness of New Zealand's multicultural society and thinking laterally, from promoting events at our cultural treasure houses, such as Te Papa, to running international and local arts festivals and cultural tours. This not only enriches the experiences of our visitors but provides opportunities for our artists to sell their wares and performing arts  
companies to attract audiences.

"New Zealanders are proud of our country's achievements and heritage. It is timely to think about how we can share that pride with the world," the Prime Minister said.

The 1997 Cultural Affairs Survey showed that 96 percent of New Zealanders believe the success of New Zealand artists in various fields gives us a sense of pride and a further 80 percent say that Maori culture and cultural ativities are an important part of New Zealand's identity.
