Health Minister Bill English today challenged critics of the elective surgery Booking System to show him why they think that the old waiting list system was fairer and gave patients a better deal.

"The Booking System is being introduced because it benefits patients by giving them certainty about their surgery and ensuring they are treated fairly. It is not being run for the benefit of bureaucrats.

"It has been designed by doctors and is being implemented in all public hospitals in New Zealand. Critics of the Booking System should tell me why they think the waiting list system was fairer and gave patients a better deal.

"This year about 130,000 people will get elective surgery in our public hospitals and that's 50 percent more that 10 years ago. We have been doing more and more elective surgery each year and will continue doing more, but I want to be sure that the people who need surgery most get treated first.

"I also want to be sure that every New Zealander is treated fairly, no matter where they live. People in Southland deserve the reassurance that they are being treated the same as people in Auckland and anywhere else in New Zealand.

"The Booking System by itself won't mean any more or any less surgery is being done, but it is going to make it much more transparent who is getting surgery and who is missing out.

"Many doctors realise that it will make it much easier to argue for more money once we know exactly who is getting surgery and for what level of need. I have always said I am keeping an open mind about how much funding will be required. But I am not prepared to see more money going into elective surgery until I can be sure that the people who need it most will benefit first," said Mr English.
