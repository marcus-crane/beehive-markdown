Health Minister Bill English said today that recognition for people who cared for others with disabilities was an important first step towards providing better support for them.

Mr English said he was pleased to be able to launch a discussion document from the National Health Committeee How Should We Care for the Carers?, which aims to promote discussion about strategies to better support carers.

"There is no doubt that the work of carers is often demanding and stressful and that it largely goes unrecognised. This booklet starts the process of recognising all that carers do and I am pleased to be able to launch it and acknowledge the work of carers.

"Carers have told me that little things like having information packs for new carers, support groups and recognition would go a long way towards making their role easier and making them feel better supported.

"The National Health Committeee has suggested seven strategies for better supporting carers. These range from providing information and training programmes for carers, improved training for health professionals about the role of carers, to publicly funded carer relief.

"The committee is collecting feedback to the document and will be providing me with advice based on the results of that," he said.

Mr English said about a quarter of the total health budget went on disability support services, and was $1.36 billion in 1996/97. Funding for some areas of disability support had increased dramatically in recent years.

"Spending on home support services, such as assistance with showering, dressing, feeding, cleaning, and preparing food, more than doubled from the 1994/95 year to the 1996/97 year, from $35 million to $72 million. The amount spent on equipment for people with disabilities went from $2.5 million in 1994/95 to $28 million in 1996/97.

"There is still more that could be spent. There is certainly a case to be made for funding for carer relief, but we have a capped budget in health and there are many demands on health care dollars, such as services for children, elective surgery, and services for Maori and Pacific peoples.

"However, many of the ways in which we can help carers don't cost money. For instance, one strategy proposed is the development of comprehensive discharge plans when people are discharged for a health or disability service. Another suggests that needs assessments should look at the needs of the carer as well as the person with the disability.

"Like many areas in health where we can make improvements, some of the strategies are deceptively simple and revolve around health professionals working together to meet the needs of the person and their carer, rather than expecting them to find their way around the system," said Mr English.
