The Gross Domestic Product for the June quarter declined by 0.8% as expected, and GDP increased by 1.2% in the year to June, Treasurer and Finance Minister Bill Birch said today.

"The decline in GDP is not surprising and reflects the ongoing impact of international financial turmoil, particularly in Asia, and last summer's drought," he said "The GDP result for the June quarter shows weakness across a number of sectors. Manufacturing output declined by 3.8% in the quarter, reflecting firms running down stocks in response to weaker international and domestic demand" he said.

He also noted that industries exposed to Asia, in particular forestry, declined significantly in the quarter, down 4.8%. In contrast there was strong growth in the communications sector, up 1.7%.

"Private and public consumption rose by 1% in the June quarter reflecting increased household spending on services, including an increase of 12.3% on overseas travel," Mr Birch said.

Mr Birch noted that the June quarter GDP in combination with Current Account data released yesterday reflects the reality that as a small trading nation New Zealand cannot insulate itself from international developments.

"However, the Government's economic policy framework is assisting the New Zealand economy to adjust to the current economic developments without the difficulties such as high inflation we have seen in the past," he said "The GDP numbers are historical and looking forward the initial indications for growth in September are positive. The Merchandise Trade Statistics for August released yesterday show that the trend in the trade balance has been rising for the last three months, as firms reorient their exports to non-Asian markets.

"Also the 1 July tax cuts in conjunction with the AMP demutualisation have supported retail sales in June and July. Other indicators such as business confidence point to a more positive near term outlook.

The key challenge for Government is to act to ensure that the economy is placed firmly on the road to steady economic recovery" Mr Birch said.
