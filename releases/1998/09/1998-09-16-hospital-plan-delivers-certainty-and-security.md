Health Minister Bill English said the Hospital Services Plan released today provided New Zealanders with certainty and security about the future of public hospital services.

"The Plan makes it clear that the Government sees a national network of hospital services as a vital component of our public health service.

"We are committed to keeping the current distribution of hospital services for the next three years. The Government believes that access to services and quality of services are more important than financial considerations.

"There has been a lot of concern that we were planning to create one or two "super hospitals" and downgrading the rest. That will not happen. Hospitals in provincial centres are not closing. This Plan is not about further centralisation, it is not about super hospitals and it is not about dramatic changes.

"Communities right across the country have been telling me they need certainty and security and I agree," said Mr English.

"The Plan describes five kinds of hospital facility that provide a network of expert health coverage:

- Health centre
- Sub-acute unit
- Secondary hospital
- Lower-level tertiary hospital
- Higher-level tertiary hospital

"Maps set out where services are currently provided and will continue to be provided for the next three years.

"The Hospital Services Plan is driven by five main objectives. These are the essential criteria taken into account when looking at how best to provide hospital services.

- timely access to hospitals
- safe, quality hospital services
- fairness across the country
- value for money
- acknowledging the special needs of rural and provincial communities

"Change will still happen, but it will be evolutionary. I am a strong advocate for locally developed solutions, such as the many new health centres that are springing up from one end of the country to the other. These centres provide a range of different services because they have evolved in response to local needs.

"The Government will keep working to develop better care and better service and will work with communities who want to make changes locally," said Mr English.

A small pamphlet summarising the plan will be distributed to all households next week. Copies of the Plan are available from the Ministry of Health, PO Box 5013, Wellington, or fax 04 496 2340.
