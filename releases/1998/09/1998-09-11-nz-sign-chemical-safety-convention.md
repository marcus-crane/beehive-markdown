New Zealand is to sign an international convention aimed at controlling international trade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides, Associate Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today.

The Prior Informed Consent Convention for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, to be known as the Rotterdam Convention, is open for signing at a Diplomatic Signing Conference currently being held in Rotterdam.

Mr Upton said the Convention would establish an information-sharing arrangement whereby details of particular chemicals would be made available to importing countries before they decided whether to allow the shipments to take place.

"New Zealand is pleased to be one of the first countries to sign the Convention in Rotterdam, having been closely involved in all stages of the negotiations," Mr Upton said.

"New Zealand's early signature of the Convention reflects our concern for the global environment and is consistent with our domestic policy concerning the protection of human health and the environment from potential harm," he said.
