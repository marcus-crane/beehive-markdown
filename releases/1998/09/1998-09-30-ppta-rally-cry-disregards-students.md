"The PPTA rally call to secondary school teachers 'to strike first, think later', shows a complete disregard for students," Education Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"As a parent and as Minister of Education I find it sad to see the PPTA Acting President agitating for more industrial action that will disrupt children's education. I am surprised that they have not learnt from their recent experience. The public is sick of it.
