"There are encouraging signs of a new openness in East Timor and a real chance to make progress towards a settlement. I hope this opportunity will be seized by all involved," Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today.

"New Zealand officials who visited East Timor last month have told me that a much more open atmosphere exists and a less obtrusive security presence. Free ranging discussions are taking place amongst East Timorese on autonomy and self determination, and various processes of dialogue and reconciliation are under way. This change flows from the new leadership and approach by the authorities in Jakarta. They are to be commended for breaking the impasse and contributing to the positive outcome of the UN-sponsored talks last month between Indonesia and Portugal."

"Clearly, the views of the East Timorese groups themselves must also be heard in New York if solid progress is to be made in these talks," Mr McKinnon continued.

"I do not underestimate the difficulty of reaching a settlement that is acceptable to all parties and to the international community. It will take compromise all round. But there is a real opportunity now to write a new and happier page in East Timor's history," Mr McKinnon said.

"We will continue to take a close interest in developments. This means maintaining contact with all points of view. To that end, our Ambassador has met with Fretilin leader, Xanana Gusmao, at Cipinang Prison in Jakarta. The UN Secretary General and the Indonesian Government itself has acknowledged the key role that Mr Gusmao has to play in the settlement process and the future leadership of East Timor. In that context we would welcome his release and have told the Indonesian Government of our view," Mr McKinnon concluded.
