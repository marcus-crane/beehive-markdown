The Minister of Education Hon Wyatt Creech will today hand over $50,000 to Graeme Dingle, head of the Project K Trust. Project K is a youth development programme aimed at at-risk fourth form students. The $50,000 is seed funding (announced in the Budget) to support Project K's work in South Auckland schools this year.

"Project K is a very exciting project which we are pleased to support. The Government expects schools will find that it brings real benefits to their students. The Government is committed to enhancing life outcomes for children and young people at risk," Mr Creech said.

"The Government supports the development of innovative social services backed by communities and businesses. This funding is an example of our commitment to these kind of projects, and backs up the Government's work on the Strengthening Families Programme and builds on current initiatives to support education in South Auckland," he said.

Project K's goal is to prevent young people from drifting aimlessly and failing to reach their potential. It is largely funded by private fundraising and corporate sponsorship.

Project K includes a wilderness experience course, an urban experience in the participants' community, and ongoing mentor support for each participant. It works with teenagers, secondary schools and community groups to bring positive direction to young people's lives. The Project K Trust plans to offer its programme all over the country eventually.
