Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says the Government is committed to delivering energy efficiency initiatives in an effective way.

Commenting on today's announcement by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) to its staff that there would be some jobs losses, Mr Bradford said it was a result of this year's Budget which saw temporary extra funding for EECA being gradually phased back to cover just core activities.

"The Government made it very clear in the Budget that it is committed to energy efficiency, and as well as continuing to fund EECA, is also encouraging greater support from the private sector," Mr Bradford said.

In the House yesterday, Mr Bradford said that work is well under way on establishing a new basis for EECA that will be far more effective and more inclusive of the private sector.

Meanwhile, Mr Bradford said that some media reports about the National led minority Government's position on the Energy Efficiency Bill have been misleading.

"Our position is that in the spirit of democracy and because we are committed to energy efficiency aims, we support the Bill going to a Select Committee so that there is the opportunity for it to be fully debated and exposed.

"However, we don't support the Bill itself because it is a massive step back to towards central planning. We do not need yet another Government agency."
