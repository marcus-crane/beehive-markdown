State Owned Enterprises Minister Tony Ryall said today the government has no plans to sell TVNZ.

Mr Ryall was commenting on the release, under the Official Information Act, of Treasury papers from October and November 1997 that pre-date the scoping study of the Crown's ownership interests in TVNZ.

"At some stage in the future, a government is going to have to look at the sale of TVNZ, especially given the rapidly changing technology and the explosion in the number of television channels," Mr Ryall said.

"We will continue to monitor developments in the television industry, but the Government has no plans to bring legislation to the House removing TVNZ from the second schedule of the State-Owned Enterprises Act ? a necessary step for any possible sale."

The 1997 Treasury papers provided Ministers with background on issues to be considered in the TVNZ scoping study, and detail on the process of appointing commercial advisors to undertake the study. The first of the papers bears the signature of the then Treasurer, Hon Winston Peters, who agreed to commission the scoping study.

The papers drew attention to a number of issues affecting TVNZ, including the rapidly changing nature of the television industry and new technology such as satellite, cable and digital television.

The papers highlighted the critical nature of programming rights, and TVNZ's lack of an alliance with a major international media company to provide the type of purchasing power that TV3 has with Canwest.

The papers also drew attention to the Government's obligations to promote Maori language -- pre-dating the announcement on 19 May 1998 by Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Tau Henare, and Minister of Communications, Hon Maurice Williamson, to increase funding to Te Mangai Paho to purchase Maori language programmes and plans to establish a nationwide Maori television channel.

Mr Ryall said the full scoping report of TVNZ would be released in the near future.
