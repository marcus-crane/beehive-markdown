Minister of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon John Luxton, today welcomed Meat New Zealand's announcement of a 15% drop in the levy they charge farmers.

Mr Luxton said today, " I am sure that farmers will welcome this announcement. It has been a pretty tough year all round with flood, droughts and depressed commodity prices.

"However Meat New Zealand are to be congratulated for reviewing their priorities and, as a result, lowering the amount they charge farmers.

"It is important that farmers get value for the money that they pay to the Boards every year, " he said.

Mr Luxton noted that while some farmers may have wanted a bigger drop in what they pay, this was a good start as he understood it was the biggest drop in levy for some time.
