Education Minister Wyatt Creech has dissolved the Board of Trustees of Awarua School in Northland and a Commissioner has been appointed to carry out the board's functions.

This follows a recommendation by the Education Review Office.

The Review Office has done three reports on the school since May 1997. Its latest report, in August, said the board of trustees had made inadequate progress towards meeting its legislative and contractual obligations. The performance of the board, it said, had put the school at risk and compromised the learning of its students.

After receiving the report, Mr Creech asked the board of trustees to set out its reasons as to why it should not be dissolved. He gave full consideration to its reply before making a decision that it would be dissolved.

The Minister said the commissioner at Awarua School would be Frank Leadley. Mr Leadley, who was also commissioner at Kaitaia Intermediate School in 1997 and a former principal of Bay of Islands College, will be responsible for the functions and duties of the school's board.

Mr Creech said the daily management of Awarua School would continue to be the responsibility of the school's principal, in consultation with Mr Leadley.

"The appointment of the Commissioner is an interim measure," said Mr Creech. "It will be his job to help the school to operate effectively and to address its immediate concerns."
