The Minister of Internal Affairs Jack Elder says it' s time elements in the Firefighters Union ceased their political tactics of undermining the 111 emergency callout system.

He condemned the leaking of internal staff communications to the Alliance MP and former firefighter, Grant Gillon, who claimed the Auckland Communications Centre faced a staffing crisis.

Mr Elder said two police communicators had been seconded to the centre to cover sickness and resignations.

"This was a short-term measure pending other staff completing their training," Mr Elder said.

"It was a sensible option to exercise because the Fire Service and Police are in partnership and there are benefits for both in managing events from within the control room.

"Such secondments will contribute to improved performance and understanding."
