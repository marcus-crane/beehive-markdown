"Sir Dryden Spring has made an outstanding contribution to the New Zealand dairy industry over the last three decades and will be greatly missed by farmers," said Hon John Luxton, Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control.

Mr Luxton was responding to news today that Sir Dryden has announced his retirement as chairman of the New Zealand Dairy Board.

"Sir Dryden is widely acknowledged as a friend of the farmer. He is also highly respected in government, trade and industry circles both in New Zealand and around the world.

"I would like to acknowledge his tremendous input into farming and dairy industry politics and wish him all the best in his retirement.

"The dairy industry will miss his leadership as it prepares for deregulation and the challenges it faces in the years ahead," Mr Luxton concluded.
