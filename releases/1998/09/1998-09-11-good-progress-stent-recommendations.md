Health Minister Bill English said today that Canterbury Health had made substantial progress in implementing the recommendations in the report of the Health and Disability Commissioner on Canterbury Health.

"The Ministry of Health is monitoring the implementation of the Commissioner's recommendations on my behalf. This week the Ministry advised me that 68 of the 76 recommendations relating to Canterbury Health have either been met or substantially met. Progress is underway on the remaining eight recommendations with good processes and timeframes in place.

"A recent visit by the Ministry to Canterbury concluded that the range of quality and safety initiatives underway or planned in the Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department was impressive.

"The Commissioner's recommendations relating to the Ministry itself and the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit have either been met or are underway.

"Reorganisation at the Health Funding Authority has meant some delays in implementing its recommendations. However, the HFA is now finalising an on-site auditing process in conjunction with Canterbury Health.

"The Christchurch Medical School has advised the Ministry that all recommendations relating to the School of Medicine have been considered and actioned.

"The Commissioner's recommendations covered a great number of issues and I am pleased that the Ministry, the HFA and Canterbury Health have established good working relationships to ensure they are implemented as soon as possible. I understand the Commissioner intends doing an audit of implementation of her recommendations before the end of the year and I am confident she will find good progress has been made," said Mr English.
