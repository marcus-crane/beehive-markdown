Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is leading a New Zealand Government delegation on a Pacific regional visit this week.

 The New Zealand delegation is travelling to Fiji, Tuvalu, and Kiribati.

 “This visit is a further reflection of New Zealand’s energised approach to the region as part of our Pacific Reset policy. New Zealand is committed to building deeper partnerships with our Pacific neighbours,” said Mr Peters.

“In each country we are likely to discuss policy areas of mutual interest spanning from climate change, development co-ordination, and the building of deeper partnerships.

The delegation includes Minister for Pacific Peoples, Aupito William Sio, Associate Minister for Pacific Peoples, Carmel Sepuloni, and parliamentarians Poto Williams, Alfred Ngaro, and Darroch Ball.

The group is flying commercially to Fiji but will then travel to Tuvalu and Kiribati on a NZ Defence Force C-130 plane.
