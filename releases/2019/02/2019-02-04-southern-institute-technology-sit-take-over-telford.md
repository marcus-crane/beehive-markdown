Education Minister Chris Hipkins has agreed to a proposal from the Southern Institute of Technology (SIT) to take over the Telford campus of the Taratahi Agricultural Centre.

The Government will invest $1.8 million in SIT to deliver primary industries training programmes both at Telford and through distance learning. SIT is aiming to teach around 200 primary industry students in 2019 at the Telford campus and across New Zealand.

“This is a great outcome for Telford students who want to continue their studies and complete their qualifications, and for those students who were looking forward to starting at Telford this year. It’s also keeps investment and jobs in the local community,” Chris Hipkins said.

“I’m very pleased that the majority of Telford staff – that’s around 20 equivalent fulltime staff – will be employed by SIT, with their existing rights and benefits maintained.

“The primary industries are a vital contributor to the New Zealand economy and top-class training and education in the sector is essential.

“The Government will be working over the coming weeks and months to reform vocational education and training so that it meets New Zealand’s future needs. We’ve chosen to continue to invest at the Telford site while the longer term change is being considered as SIT is a strong institution with solid financial backing. There is no similar proposal for Taratahi at this stage.

“The agreement with SIT is for 12 months. On top of the $1.8 million, SIT will receive further Crown support for expenses if operations cease at Telford at the end of 2019.

“I appreciate SIT’s willingness to step in and its speedy and pragmatic response,” Chris Hipkins said.
