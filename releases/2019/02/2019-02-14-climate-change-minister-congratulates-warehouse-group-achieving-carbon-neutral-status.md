The Minister for Climate Change has congratulated The Warehouse Group on achieving carboNZero certification.

“The Warehouse Group officially becoming net carbon neutral is a great achievement and I welcome the Group’s commitment and contribution towards reducing New Zealand’s greenhouse emissions,” James Shaw said.

“Achievements like this, and the leadership being shown by other members of the Climate Leaders Coalition, together with the Farming Leaders Group, iwi, and others is vital if we are to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050.

“We are already feeling the effects of climate change, such as fires, floods, droughts and storms.

“More and more New Zealanders are concerned about what we could face in the future if we don’t take serious action to limit global warming.

“That’s having a growing influence on people’s decisions across a range of activities. Businesses are aware that they need to be in sync with the increasing consumer awareness about climate change.

“Our window of opportunity to limit the effects of climate change is closing but we still have time - if we act now.

“So I congratulate all those New Zealanders; individuals, communities and organisations who are doing what they can do to help us on the path to carbon neutrality.

“It helps keep me, as Climate Change Minister, and the Government focused on providing the institutional and legal framework through the Zero Carbon Bill to be passed into law this year,” Mr Shaw said.
