Racing Minister Winston Peters today announced that the second round of applications for the $1 million Racing Safety Development Fund will open on February 5.

The Fund, which has been operating for eleven years, has two funding rounds per year. The second funding round for the 2018/19 year opens for applications on 5 February, with $389,351 available for allocation.

Mr Peters says the Fund is an opportunity to improve race course safety, and benefits clubs and racing bodies across the country.

“Racecourses are an important part of communities across New Zealand, so it’s important we help ensure the health and safety aspects,” Mr Peters says.

“The Fund is available to help with vital activities such as updating equipment, repairing grandstands, and improving the safety of running rails”.

“While the Messara Report highlights that changes are needed in the racing industry, the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, officials and others involved in racing will always be of the upmost importance,” Mr Peters says.

New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 60 racecourses. All racing clubs and racing code bodies should consider the condition and standard of their facilities and equipment, and assess whether they are safe for animals, staff, and customers.

The Racing Safety Development Fund covers up to half the costs of a project, with $7,500 – $50,000 in funding available for each project.

Applications must be submitted by 2 April 2019, through the Department of Internal Affairs online system.
