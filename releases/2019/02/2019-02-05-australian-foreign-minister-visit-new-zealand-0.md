Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced today that Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne will visit New Zealand 8-9 February.

 The two Foreign Ministers will meet in Auckland for formal six-monthly foreign policy discussions between the two countries.

 “Australia is New Zealand’s most important bilateral partner and our relationship is overwhelmingly positive. For two independent nations, Australia and New Zealand enjoy an unparalleled level of connection and integration. Our discussion will help ensure the trans-Tasman relationship is working effectively,” Mr Peters said.

 “This meeting is part of the regular foreign policy consultation with Australia. We will discuss in depth the global and regional issues where we have shared interests.”

  The two Foreign Ministers last met in November at APEC. The Foreign Minister meeting in Auckland will also prepare the way for the annual meeting of New Zealand and Australian Prime Minsters due to take place at the end of February in Auckland.
