Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker flies to Australia tomorrow to meet his counterpart, Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Simon Birmingham. 

The two will meet in Adelaide and discuss key strategic trade issues. 

“We will discuss the trade outlook for 2019, including the World Trade Organisation, Brexit, the CPTPP and other issues affecting the Asia-Pacific region such as progress on Pacer Plus and how we can work together,” David Parker said. 

“We will also exchange views on strengthening trans-Tasman economic links under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.”

David Parker referred to the leading-edge work under way in New Zealand and Australia to integrate our two economies into a Single Economic Market.

“As well as being very positive for business, this work is symbolically important in the current climate of rising protectionism.” 

David Parker will also meet Labor Opposition Spokesperson on Trade Jason Clare.
