Major residential developer Mike Greer has partnered with KiwiBuild to build more than 100 KiwiBuild homes in West Auckland and Christchurch – the first for Canterbury, Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford has announced.

The agreement for 104 homes includes the cheapest KiwiBuild announced so far – 11 two-bedroom standalone homes in Kaiapoi for $360,000. Other homes will be built in Huapai, Whenuapai, Pukekohe, Kaiapoi, Rolleston, Pegasus, Woodend, Rangiora, Halswell, Marshland, and Spreydon. They will be completed between now and mid-2020 and are a mix of two and three bedroom, standalone and terraced homes, ranging from $360,000 to $650,000.

Mike Greer is one of the largest residential construction firms in New Zealand, and has been building homes for over 25 years.

“This agreement with one of New Zealand’s premier home building firms show KiwiBuild is gathering momentum. I hope these 104 homes will be just the first of many we will build with Mike Greer over the coming years,” Phil Twyford said.

“Mike has a strong commitment to affordable housing. It’s fantastic KiwiBuild is able to work with him to build great looking starter homes for families to buy.

“Auckland’s North-West is a growing area and we need to make sure we’re getting affordable housing here, not just million dollar homes.

“Our first KiwiBuild homes in Christchurch are part of the Government’s plan to ensure house prices there remain stable and we meet the strong demand for more homes that is forecast over the coming years.

“This deal has been in the works for a number of months and it’s great to see it come to fruition. Mike Greer have been building while the details have been hammered out, meaning the first homes are already ready to sell.

“I am aware of a number of other large agreements with big developers that KiwiBuild is finalising. These deals have taken longer than I hoped to conclude, but we’re starting to see really good progress,” Phil Twyford said.
