Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta today announced an investment of up to $2.3 million into the Whaingaroa Community Development Project.

The first tranche of funds, $650,000, was made available at the end of January.

The project is focused on housing initiatives in Tākou Bay including housing repairs and affordable home ownership options through investment packages.

Minister Mahuta congratulated Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa for successfully bringing this project – called Te Oranga o Ngā Hapori – to fruition having spent the last three years working with Te Puni Kōkiri and other partners to identify the aspirations of the hapū and whānau that will ensure the future wellbeing of the community.

“Together we need to design and enable innovative approaches to accelerate whānau, hapū and iwi development.

“Whānau leading their own development aspirations provides the platform to drive and lead development in their community. If we can support all whānau to thrive, this will create a step-change for New Zealand and create a more prosperous future for everyone.

“Together, government, business and iwi Māori can accelerate whānau, hapū and iwi development by ensuring whānau have access to a warm, dry home in a safe and healthy community,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
