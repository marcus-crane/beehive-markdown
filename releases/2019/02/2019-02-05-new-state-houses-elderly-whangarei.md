Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford today officially opened eleven new state homes in Whangarei designed to cater to the elderly and those with limited mobility.   

The one-bedroom homes on Maunu Road, in the suburb of Woodhill, are less than 500 metres from Whangarei Hospital, and have been designed for those with current or future mobility needs. 

“Housing NZ is building not just for today, but for future generations. That means building for different family sizes, stages of life and needs,” Phil Twyford says. 

“There is a real demand for one-bedroom properties and accessible homes for people with limited mobility. These warm, dry homes tick every box.” 

Five of the houses are fully accessible with ramps, wide hallways and wet-room showers, among other specifications. The other six homes have been designed to be able to be modified, if needed, in future.

Phil Twyford says the homes are part of Housing NZ’s Regional Housing Programme; the biggest state house building programme outside the main centres in more than a decade.

“Finding affordable housing isn’t just an Auckland or a Wellington problem. Around a third of the demand for public housing comes from areas outside the main centres. 

“In Whangarei, demand for housing has been on the rise for a number of years, about 200 families or individuals are currently on the official state housing waiting list.

“The Regional Housing Programme aims to provide more public housing by making the most efficient use of state-owned land. That means replacing existing state houses with more new homes for people and families in need. Housing NZ is also buying new homes in areas close to key services and where people want to live, as is the case with these Maunu Road houses.

“I look forward to opening more new state housing around the country this year as we move towards our target of 6,400 more public housing places over the next four years.” Phil Twyford says.
