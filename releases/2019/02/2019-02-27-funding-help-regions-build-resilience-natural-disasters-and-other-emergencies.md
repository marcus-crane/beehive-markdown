Projects planning for earthquakes from the Hikurangi subduction zone and improving Maori community engagement are among those receiving Government funding to support regions in building resilience to natural disasters and other emergencies, Minister of Civil Defence Hon Kris Faafoi announced today.

Mr Faafoi says $670,000 of grants are being awarded from the 2019 Resilience Fund, an annual fund of $889,000 administered by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management.

Eight projects are awarded grants for projects starting in July 2019, including fuel and generator planning and disaster waste management.  

“The Resilience Fund taps into the knowledge and expertise around the country, making it possible to progress worthy initiatives and test new ideas. These grants will enable innovative, collaborative initiatives to happen, providing the sector with better tools to help keep Kiwi communities safe.”

Kris Faafoi says the Resilience Fund has made possible a number of valuable projects in recent years, such as the AF8 Alpine Fault earthquake response plan, East Coast LAB (Life at the Boundary) and the Marae Preparedness Toolkit. 

He says the funding boost continues the Government’s commitment to bolstering New Zealand’s emergency management system. In August 2018, the Government announced its [decisions](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/emergency-management-system-reform-fly-teams-funded-support-communities) relating to the Emergency Management System Reform, including initiatives such as fly-in teams, a sector-wide common operating picture, and speeding up tsunami warnings.  

Applications were considered by a panel against criteria with emphasis on improved collaboration, improved resilience locally and regionally, and consistent approaches.

The Resilience Fund is distributed on an annual basis. For full details on the successful applicants, see the PDF attached or visit: [http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/cdem-sector/cdem-resilience-fund/#current](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/cdem-sector/cdem-resilience-fund/)
