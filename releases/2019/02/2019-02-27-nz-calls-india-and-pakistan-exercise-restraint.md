Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is calling for India and Pakistan to exercise restraint as tensions between the two countries rise.

“New Zealand is concerned by the latest developments since the terrorist attack in Pulwama, Kashmir on 14 February,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand supports both parties to seek peaceful solutions to the dispute in Jammu and Kashmir through diplomacy and dialogue.”

“As we have previously stated, New Zealand condemns all forms of terrorism and urge all members of the international community to work together to eradicate terrorist activity,” he said.
