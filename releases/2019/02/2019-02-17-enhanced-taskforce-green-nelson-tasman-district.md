The Government has announced further support to help clean up significant fire damage in the Nelson Tasman District.

“We’ve activated Enhanced Taskforce Green, making $500,000 available to help with the clean-up in the Nelson Tasman District,” says the Minister for Social Development, Carmel Sepuloni.

The fires which began on 5 February have damaged forestry, farms and property in an area of more than 2,400 hectares.

“Government is already helping people who’ve been affected by the fires, with Civil Defence payments, financial grants and pastoral care. However it’s clear further support will be needed with the clean-up,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Enhanced Taskforce Green can be used to clean up land in emergency events, helping communities get back on their feet where they might not otherwise be able to.

“The fires are still burning, so we can’t yet assess the full extent of the damage but as soon as fires are controlled, it’ll be possible to go into the affected areas and decide what can be done.

“Property owners, residents and the community will have their needs assessed. They may need help with clearing burnt buildings, fences and debris and other work.”

“Tasman and Nelson Councils, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Rural Support Trust and the Ministry of Social Development are already working together to get this up and running,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
