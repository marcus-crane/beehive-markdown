The latest Public Housing data for Auckland shows that 818 households were provided with a place to call home in the last quarter, and more public housing is being brought on board to address increasing demand.

The figures reflect households who were either on the Housing Register or the Transfer Register, which is comprised of those whose existing public housing no longer meets their needs.

“This Government has been clear that the best way to tackle the housing crisis is to increase supply as quickly as we can, and that’s exactly what we are doing,” Minister of Housing and Urban Development Phil Twyford says.

“Since coming to office, our Government has built 1,191 new state houses. 

“In the last quarter, in Auckland we made an additional 337 public housing places available, 253 of these places were brought on by registered Community Housing Providers in addition to the 84 places delivered by Housing New Zealand.

“In the same time period, the number of transitional housing places increased by 32, which will allow us to support more than 120 additional families and individuals each year. 

“Each home that we bring on board means one less household living in unacceptable circumstances, such as cars, garages and under bridges.

“While progress is being made on increasing supply, we know demand for housing continues to increase as well.  In the last quarter, the Housing Register for the Auckland region increased by 442 households.

“We need to build more public housing, and we remain committed to increasing supply by 6,400 new places in the next four years, 3,550 of which are expected to be in Auckland.

“We are on track to achieve this goal,” Phil Twyford said.
