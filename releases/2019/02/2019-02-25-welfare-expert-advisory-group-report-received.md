The Minister for Social Development, Carmel Sepuloni, has formally received the Report of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group into the future of New Zealand’s social security system.  

“I want to thank the Advisory Group chair Professor Cindy Kiro, and members Professor Innes Asher, Kay Brereton, Dr Huhana Hickey, Trevor McGlinchey, Professor Tracey McIntosh, Dr Ganesh Nana, Phil O’Reilly, Robert Reid, Latayvia Tualasea Tautai, Charles Waldegrave, and special advisor Michael Fletcher,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“Their wide-ranging review has been informed by the views of over 3,000 New Zealanders, and is supported by substantial evidence and research.

“This is a significant piece of work and it will inform how we make our social welfare system fairer and accessible for all New Zealanders. Any changes we make to the welfare system need to be effective and enduring,” Carmel Sepuloni said

The Welfare Expert Advisory Group Report will now be analysed by officials and discussed with Coalition and Confidence and Supply partners and released publicly In late March, early April.

The overhaul of the welfare system is part of the Labour Party’s confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party and Welfare Spokesperson Marama Davidson has welcomed the receipt of the report.

"We need to put the heart back into our welfare system, to ensure it addresses inequality and gives New Zealanders the ability to live with dignity,” Marama Davidson said.

Minister for Children, Tracey Martin says it’s important that all of Government works together to consider the recommendations and ensure that welfare works in a way that is fair to everyone.

“It’s important we get this right. In terms of my responsibilities we need to deliver better outcomes for children and their families and for our more senior citizens,” Tracey Martin said
