One million people have taken the opportunity to apply online for their Student, Work and Visitor Visas – a milestone achievement, says Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway.

Thanks to Immigration ONLINE, over 85 per cent of all visa types can be made digitally, with most online applications coming from China and India.

“Immigration ONLINE is about making the visa application process as efficient as possible for people looking to study, work or holiday here,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.

“New Zealand is also welcoming more and more Chinese tourists with the number of five year multiple entry visas exceeding 150,000 – an increase of 13 per cent in 2018.

“78 per cent of people able to apply online are choosing to do so, with one million people across more than 890,000 applications applying online since the service became available in August 2014.

“The service, available in Chinese as well as English, gives Immigration New Zealand more flexibility to response to applicant’s needs and expectations.

“Immigration ONLINE is an example of the Government making greater use of technology to deliver better services to ensure ease of travel for people coming to New Zealand,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.
