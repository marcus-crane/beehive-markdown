About half of New Zealand homes and businesses have connected to faster, more reliable broadband across the 121 centres where ultra-fast broadband (UFB) is available, says Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Kris Faafoi.

“That’s 714,258 end users who are enjoying the benefits of ultra-fast broadband in their homes and businesses.

“This government programme is about 77 per cent complete, with 1,432,554 users now able to connect to the network. When the UFB infrastructure is fully deployed by the end of 2022, people in more than 390 towns and cities will be able to connect to the country’s fibre network,” Kris Faafoi says.

The latest UFB progress [report](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/aae2c79c33/december-18-broadband-quarterly-update.pdf) shows 15 towns have uptake rates above 50 per cent: Auckland, Blenheim, Cambridge, Dunedin, Hamilton, Nelson, New Plymouth, Pukekohe, Rotorua, Tauranga, Te Awamutu, Tīmaru, Waipu, Waiuku and Whāngārei.

Waiuku has taken over from Dunedin as the centre with the highest percentage uptake – just over 59 per cent.

“Uptake rates across the country indicate UFB is fast becoming Kiwis’ preferred broadband technology,” Kris Faafoi says.

“We also know a lot of New Zealanders are keen internet users, and use is increasing year on year. For example, the Commerce Commission’s 2018 report showed Kiwis’ average monthly data use per fixed-line broadband connection was 172GB, compared to 117GB in 2017.”

In the latest quarter from October to December 2018, the UFB build began in 15 towns, adding to the 51 areas where the build is currently underway.
