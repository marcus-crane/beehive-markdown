Ministers Hon Damien O’Connor and Hon Nanaia Mahuta said today that it was an honour to be part of the celebrations around the prestigious Māori farming award, the Ahuwhenua Trophy.

Minister of Agriculture Damien O’Connor said this was all about excellence in farming and celebrating Māori input into our economy.

“These finalists are at the top of their game and provide the inspiration to others to get out and do even better and grow this country.

“The long-term commitment to the land is something we are all proud of and passionate about and as a Government we commit to working with you to ensure a valuable future for our country and all New Zealanders,” said Damien O’Connor.

“The Ahuwhenua Trophy shows the key role that beef and sheep farming has in the $50 billion that Māori enterprise brings to our economy. It also confirms the importance of Te Tairawhiti to Aotearoa with all three finalists  coming from the coast,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

“The awards are part of a long tradition that began with Sir Apirana Ngata in the 1930’s.

“I am looking forward to May the 24th when the winner will be announced in Gisborne,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

**Editors Note: The three finalists are : Gisborne’s Whangara Farm, Te Awahohonu Forest Trust at Tikokino and the Kiriroa Station on the Motu River.**
