Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor travels to the United Arab Emirates this evening and then onto Egypt for meetings on trade, food security and agricultural technology.  

“Our relationship is growing with these important trading partners and my visit will be a chance to advocate for issues important to Kiwis, listen to Kiwi businesses operating there and grow the links between our economies even further,” Damien O’Connor said.

The United Arab Emirates is New Zealand’s 11th largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth more than $3.7 billion for the year ending December 2018.

“In Dubai I’m looking forward to going along to Gulfood, the world’s largest food and beverage trade exhibition, to support New Zealand suppliers.”

Mr O’Connor will also meet with the Ministers of Economy, Climate Change and Environment and Food Security.

While in Egypt, Mr O’Connor will meet with the Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation and the Minister of Trade and Industry, to discuss the diversification of our trade relationship as well as recent agriculture cooperation projects.

“Egypt is New Zealand’s second largest market in Africa with two-way trade worth more than $350 million a year, mostly in dairy and meat.

“It’s an important time for the New Zealand-Egypt relationship as this will be the first trade-focused ministerial visit since 2006.”

"Trade is crucial to our economies and so is ensuring that the benefits that come from trade are shared by all,” Damien O’Connor said.

Minister O’Connor is travelling from 17-22 February.
