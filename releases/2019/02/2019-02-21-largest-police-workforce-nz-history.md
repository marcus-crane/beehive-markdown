Police Minister Stuart Nash is celebrating a new milestone as the Police workforce reaches the highest figure in its history.

“The total number of frontline officers, support staff, and others in the organisation who work to keep communities safe has now passed the 13,000 mark,” says Mr Nash.

“The number of frontline officers has increased by 595, or seven per cent, since the start of the 2017/18 financial year. The Coalition Government is now a third of the way towards its goal of 1800 extra Police.

“Thanks to increased investment of more than $300 million last year the total number of people who serve within Police is the largest ever. The Police workforce is a crucial part of our efforts to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders.

“The organisation is made up of frontline officers, recruits in training, and non-constabulary support staff. While the workforce of uniformed and plain-clothed officers is often the most visible face of Police, I also want to acknowledge those who work behind the scenes to keep our communities safe.

“The non-constabulary workforce includes those who handle demanding roles such as round the clock work in Police communications centres. It includes specialists on the new digital frontline who tackle cybercrime, child sexual abuse, and complex financial investigations. It includes those who work to prevent family harm, support technical and covert operations, research and develop new policy, and who play a vital role handling police exhibits and examining crime scenes.

“The new milestone has been reached with the intake of the latest recruits at the Royal New Zealand Police College this week. The eighty recruits of Wing 326 have just begun an intensive 16-week training course. While training they are paid the equivalent of a $43,747 annual remuneration package.

“I am delighted with the diversity of the latest wing. Forty-three per cent are women, 19 per cent are Maori, six per cent are Pasifika and eight per cent are Asian. The youngest is 19 and the eldest is 51. When finally deployed they will be sent all over the country to urban and rural areas.

“Police data is now consistently showing a drop in the number of people who are victims of crime every month. The addition of extra police over the coming years will further ensure people feel safe in their communities.” Mr Nash says.

**Background:**

Since the beginning of the 2017/18 financial year the growth in the Police workforce has been as follows:

- Constabulary: currently 9434 frontline officers, an increase of 595.
- Recruits: currently 180 recruits in training
- Non-constabulary: Police staff currently total 3421, an increase of 353.

There is also strong interest from potential applicants who are keen on making a difference with a career in the Police. In the last six months of 2018 more than 2,800 people applied to join Police, an increase of 14 per cent on the same period in 2017.
