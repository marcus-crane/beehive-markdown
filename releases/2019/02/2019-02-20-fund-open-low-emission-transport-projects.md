Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods today opened the Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund for a new round of applications.

“The Government has a comprehensive work programme to transition our economy to a low emissions, renewable future. Helping to get more low emissions vehicles on the road, and helping more Kiwis take advantage of this technology, is a key part of that plan.

“This fund helps do that by offering up to 50 per cent co-funding for projects, with applicants required to match or exceed the amounts granted.

“This year, up to $7 million is being made available, with $3.5 million through this funding round.

“The investment focus for this round aims to stimulate continued innovation and investment in areas such as filling key gaps in the charging network, facilitating the scale-up of low emission vehicles technology, high-visibility demonstration projects and electric vehicle (EV) technology innovation.

“We’ve seen in previous rounds the exciting projects this fund can help deliver. Projects to get the green light in the last round included hydrogen fuel cell powered buses at the Ports of Auckland, electric heavy vehicle trials, development of an EV battery testing method and 34 new public charging stations.

“Over five rounds to date, the fund has committed $17.2 million in government funding to more than 90 projects. This is matched by over $28 million applicant funding. This co-funding removes some of the risk when investing in new and innovative technologies and brings the maximum benefit for the Government contribution.”

“I look forward to seeing how applicants will use this funding round to help bring the benefits of these emerging technologies to even more New Zealanders,” said Minister Woods.

The fund is administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

Applicants have until Thursday 21 March 2018 to submit their proposals.
