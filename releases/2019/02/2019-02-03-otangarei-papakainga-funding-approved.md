Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated the tiny Northland community of Otangarei for significant steps towards achieving its vision of a proud, vibrant, prosperous community.

Minister Mahuta says their efforts were underpinned by the development of the Otangarei Papakāinga.

“The Government’s funding has now been confirmed and construction is expected to start soon. I’m so proud to be with you today and to share in this success. Congratulations.

“It is clear to me that Otangarei whānau are passionate about their community and what the future looks like for its tamariki.

The Minister says this project is an example of a successful partnership between Government and Māori.

Government funding for this project included a grant of $450,000 from Te Puni Kōkiri and $431,241 from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. The Otangarei Papakāinga contribution is $50,000 and Te Hau Awhiowhio o Otangarei Trust will provide a loan of up to $200,000.

“Warm, safe, healthy homes are the right of all whānau. This housing project will do more: it will provide a platform for you to rebuild your future ensuring the ongoing wellbeing of this community,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
