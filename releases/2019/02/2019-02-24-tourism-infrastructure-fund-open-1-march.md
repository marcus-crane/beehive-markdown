The third round of the Tourism Infrastructure Fund (TIF) will be open for applications from 1 March 2019, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

The TIF provides up to $25 million annually to develop tourism-related infrastructure that supports regions facing pressure from tourism growth.

Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis says this year’s fund will continue to focus on prioritising projects that demonstrate current and future need for additional visitor-related public infrastructure.

“Supporting thriving and sustainable regions is a priority for this Government and one way we can do this is by continuing to assist with public infrastructure,” Kelvin Davis said.

“This will help ensure our increasing numbers of tourists have positive experiences, and that local councils and communities can get the best from tourism growth.

“We want to encourage projects that look to address capacity issues and future-proof local infrastructure before problems develop, while also considering the possible impact proposed projects may have on commercial operators in the area.

“In this way the TIF will allow more communities to share the benefits of tourism and be equipped with essential tourism infrastructure now and in the years to come.

“The TIF is open to all local councils and not-for–profit community organisations that can demonstrate support from their local council. It would be great to see a diverse range of applications from our councils and communities to this year’s round,” Kelvin Davis said.

Successful projects will be announced in June 2019.
