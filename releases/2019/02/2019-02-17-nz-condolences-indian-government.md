Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says New Zealand has offered its condolences to the people and Government of India over a bomb attack in Jammu and Kashmir which led to a very large loss of life and heightened tensions in the region.

“As a nation New Zealand has always condemned acts of terrorism and does so in this case. We express our support and solidarity for the Government of India at this difficult time as well as deep sympathy for those mourning,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand wishes to see peace in Jammu and Kashmir. For this reason we also call for dialogue between the relevant parties as the best step to help secure peace and stability,” he said.
