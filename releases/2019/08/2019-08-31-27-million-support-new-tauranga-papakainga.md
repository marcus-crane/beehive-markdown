Minister for Māori Development and Associate Minister of Housing Hon Nanaia Mahuta today announced a $2.793 million  investment to support a new papakāinga in Tauranga, Bay of Plenty.

This investment will support Ranginui 12 Trust with infrastructure and construction costs to develop nine sites for housing on Māori land. The Trust is making their own considerable contribution of more than $2 million towards the project which totals $4.88m.

“This is a true example of Māori working in partnership with the Government to achieve housing aspirations to support thriving whānau,” Minister Mahuta says.

“I commend Ranginui 12 Trust who are taking steps to ensure their whānau have access to safe and secure housing, despite the high purchase and rental prices in the region.”

Tauranga is ranked among the most expensive housing in the world when measured against income.

“This papakāinga will provide further opportunities for whānau to re-connect with their whenua but more importantly to live in a kaupapa Māori community,” Minister Mahuta says.

The development of this papakāinga is expected to be complete in June 2020 and will provide added support to two local marae; ngā pae tapu o Hairini and Maungatapu Marae.

“A strong and thriving cultural identity is essential to sustainable social and economic development within whānau and communities. Not only does it reconnect Māori with their ancestral whenua but provides a strong sense of ownership and  self-determination,” Nanaia Mahuta says. 

**$2.7 miriona hei tautoko i tētahi papakāinga hou ki Tauranga** 

Kua pānuitia e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori, te Minita Whare Āwhina hoki, a te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta te pūtea $2.793 miriona hei tautoko i tētahi papakāinga hou ki Tauranga, Te Moananui a Toi. 

Ka tautoko tēnei whakapaunga i te Ranginui 12 Trust mā te utu i ngā utu hanganga, hanga whare hoki ki te whakawhanake i ngā wāhi e iwa mō ngā whare i runga i te whenua Māori. Kei te whakapau hoki te Rūnanga i tā rātou ake pūtea, rua miriona tāra, ki te kaupapa, he $4.88 miriona tāra te katoa o te utu. 

“He tauira tūturu tēnei o ngāi Māori e mahi ngātahi ana me te Kāwanatanga kia eke panuku ngā tūmanako whare hei tautoko i ngā whānau e momoho ake nei,” ki tā Minita Mahuta. 

“Ka nui te mihi ki te Ranginui 12 Trust e whakapau kaha nei ki te āta whakarite e taea ai e ā rātou whānau te whai wāhi atu ki ngā whare haumaru, ahakoa te nui o te utu ki te hoko, ki te rīhi whare rānei i te rohe. 

Huri noa te ao ko Tauranga tētahi o ngā wāhi nui te utu mō te whare ina whakaritea ki te whiwhinga pūtea o te hunga mahi. 

“Mā tēnei papakāinga e whai wāhi ngā whānau ki te hono anō ki tō rātou whenua, ka mutu, te noho ki tētahi hapori kaupapa Māori,” te kī a Minita Mahuta. 

Tōna tikanga ka oti te whakawhanaketanga o tēnei papakāinga hei te marama o Pipiri 2020, ā, e tautoko hoki i ngā marae tata e rua; ngā pae tapu o ngā marae o Hairini, o Maungatapu. 

“He mea nui te tuakiri ā-ahurea ki te whakapūmautanga o te whanaketanga ā-pāpori, ā-ōhanga hoki i roto i ngā whānau me ngā hapori. Ehara i te mea kei te hono anō noa iho i a ngāi Māori ki ō rātou whenua tūpuna, engari, kei te whakahoki anō hoki i te rangatiratanga, otirā, te tino rangatiratanga ki a rātou,” te kōrero a Nanaia Mahuta.
