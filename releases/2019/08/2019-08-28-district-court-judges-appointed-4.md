Earlier in her career she conducted several jury trials, including for murder, as well as judge-alone defended hearings. She holds approval for all categories with the Legal Services Agency. From 1989 to 1999 she practised as a barrister in Hamilton.  

Ms Bennett has an interest in continuing legal education, having been a member of the Litigation Skills Faculty since 2004. She has chaired the last two triennial National Youth Advocates Conferences as well as contributing to other seminars throughout her career. 

Judge Bennett will be sworn in on 3 October 2019 in Manukau.
