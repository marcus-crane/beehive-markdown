Minister for Māori Development, Nanaia Mahuta, today announced the appointment of Paraone Gloyne, and the reappointment of Vanessa Clark to the Te Māngai Pāho Board.

Mr Gloyne brings a wealth of experience from his background as a Māori language advocate, teacher, composer, mentor, and broadcaster. His appointment to the Board will be welcome news to te reo advocates in the media sector.

“Paraone Gloyne has made incredible contributions to the revitalisation of te reo Māori, most notably through his creation of Mahuru Māori, his leadership of Mōtai Tangata Rau, and his work on Taringa, a bilingual podcast.

“I am confident that he will provide a valuable insight to the work of the Te Māngai Pāho Board,” said Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

Ms Clark has been reappointed as a member of the Board for a further three year term. She brings with her over 20 years of business and management experience specialising in the information and communication technology sector.

“Vanessa Clark is a conscientious and highly valued member of the Board. I thank her for the years of service she has already provided and welcome her back to this role. I know she will continue to contribute significantly to the work of Te Māngai Pāho,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

The Te Māngai Pāho Board consists of five members appointed by the Minister. Members serve three year terms and may be reappointed, as was the case for Ms Clark.
