Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta has launched Te Ahikōmako the first centre of Māori innovation and entrepreneurship that will be open to all Māori business entrepreneurs, innovators and whānau in the Waikato region.

Located at the Te Wānanga o Aotearoa – Mangakotukutuku campus Nanaia Mahuta says this is the ideal place for our people to access these services in order to fulfil their business aspirations. 

“Māori have always been innovative in their thinking and approaches, so it is really important that we have professional services that our whānau can access in the regions that will help them to realise their business ideas,” Hon Nanaia Mahuta says. 

Te Ahikōmako will be a centre that whānau can come to access mentoring and business advice which will enhance their capability to further their business aspirations. 

“The current figures suggest that Māori enterprise is worth over $50 billion and is growing at a faster rate than the economy as a whole. Our regional economies are where Māori are most likely to make more of an impact,” says the Minister.  

“Having a regional hub such as this one in the Waikato is one of the ways that we have invested in our regions to ensure that our emerging Māori entrepreneurs and whānau can come and test their business ideas and concepts. Here they can get access to the required skills and mentoring options that will vastly increase their chances of success. 

“ I am also delighted that this was an act of cross Government cooperation with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment through the Provincial Growth Fund contributing $500,000. This is a joint initiative with Te Puni Kōkiri who contributed a further $150,000. 

“Te Ahikōmako was developed and designed by Māori in order to meet the very specific needs of Māori and will be a place where our whānau can realise and bring to life their business ideas and concepts – this is about whānau success and creating a robust regional economy for the future,” says Nanaia Mahuta. 

This initiative was one of the ideas that was set out in the [Waikato Māori Economic Development Plan 2018](https://www.tpk.govt.nz/documents/download/3682/Waikato%20Region%20-%20Maori%20Economic%20Action%20Plan%20-%20Feb%202018.pdf) and more recently in the refreshed plan [Te Whare Ohaoha](https://www.tewaka.nz/site_files/18710/upload_files/WaikatoRegion-MaoriEconomicActionPlan-FinalJune62019.1.pdf?dl=1) which Minister Mahuta launched in June this year.

**Kua whakaterea he pokapū pakihi Māori hou ki Waikato**

Kua whakaterea e Te Minita Whanaketanga Māori Te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta te pokapū Māori tuatahi o te auahatanga me te toa pakihitanga, ko Te Ahikōmako, e wātea ana ki te hunga toa pakihi, ki te hunga auaha, otirā, ki ngā whānau Māori hoki kei te rohe o Waikato.

Kei Te Wānanga o Aotearoa – te marae o Mangakōtukutuku, e kī ana a Nanaia Mahuta he tino tika tēnei wāhi mā te iwi kia whai wāhi mai ki ēnei ratonga e tutuki ai rātou i ō rātou wawata pakihi.

“He iwi auaha te whakaaro, auaha te mahi te iwi Māori mai rā anō, nō reira he mea nui ā tātou ake ratonga ngaio hei whāwhātanga atu mā ō tātou whānau huri noa i ngā rohe e tautoko i a rātou ki te whakatutuki i ō rātou whakaaro pakihi," tā Te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta.

He pokapū Te Ahikōmako e āhei ai ā tātou whānau te whai wāhi atu ki ngā kaitautoko me te tohutohu ā-pakihi e whakapiki i tā rātou mātau ki te kawe i ō rātou wawata pakihi ki tua.

“E ai ki ngā nama o tēnei wā he neke atu i te 50 piriona tāra te uara o te pakihi Māori, ā, he tere ake tōna piki haere i te ōhanga katoa o te motu.” Kei ngā ōhanga ā-rohe te wāhi e tino kitea ngā mahi a ngā pakihi Māori,’ te kī a te Minita.

“Mā te pokapū ā-rohe pēnei nā ki Waikato koia tētahi o ngā ara kua whāia mō te whakapau pūtea ki ngā rohe hei mātua whakarite e taea ai e ngā toa pakihi, whānau Māori hoki te haere mai ki te whakamātau ō rātou whakaaro, ariā hoki.  I konei e taea ai e rātou te whiwhi ngā pūkenga, ngā ara whakaako pakihi hoki e tino whakapiki ai i te tūpono ka eke panuku ai rātou.

“Hari katoa au i hua mai tēnei i te mahi tahi a ngā tari Kāwanatanga ki te Manatū Whakahiato Ora me te $500,000 mai i te Pūtea Whakatipu Porowini. He mahi tahi tēnei i te taha o Te Puni Kōkiri, nāna tētahi $150,000 anō i takoha.

"He mea whakawhanake, hoahoa hoki e te Māori kia tutuki ai i ngā hiahia ake tonu a te Māori ka noho tonu hoki hei wāhi e taea ai e ō tātou whānau te whakatinana ō rātou whakaaro, ariā hoki – mō te angitū a te whānau, mō te hanga ōhanga, ā-rohe pakari tonu hei ngā rā e tū mai nei,” te kōrero a Nanaia Mahuta

He kaupapa kōkiri tēnei o ngā whakaaro i whakaritea ki te Waikato Māori Economic Development Plan 2018, i whakahoutia anō inā tata nei i te mahere whakahou Te Whare Ohaoha i whakaterea e te Minita Mahuta i te Pipiri o tēnei tau.
