The Government has today announced over 120 standards used for Building Code compliance are now available to be accessed and downloaded for free, says Building and Construction Minister Jenny Salesa.

The announcement was made at Housing New Zealand’s Eveleyn Couzins development in Christchurch, which was attended by industry representatives and members of the community.

“I have listened to the building and construction sector, and professional groups who access these standards regularly, and to New Zealand’s homeowners. They want to do the right thing but say financial barriers make it hard – today I am making building compliance easier for all New Zealanders,” said Jenny Salesa.

“In December 2017, five important building Standards and a handbook were funded, and over 15,000 downloads have been made in the last 18 months. Sponsoring another 120 Standards puts New Zealand on the leader board as one of the few countries in the world offering free access to building standards.

“These building Standards are ones which directly help demonstrate compliance with the New Zealand Building Code. They ensure our buildings and homes are safe and well-constructed.

“They will help building professionals and homeowners with methods for designing and constructing timber framing in buildings and selecting appropriately treated timber used in building work. They will also help engineers with earthquake loads on buildings.

“Step by step we are dismantling road blocks in the building sector. The success of the pilot will now snowball as we fund these standards that directly help demonstrate compliance with the Building Code free for download.

“There is a cost to providing access to standards. The Government wants to help people ‘do the right thing’ and comply more easily with the Building Code. I am delighted we have come up with a solution that acknowledges this cost of access, and removes this barrier for users.” says Jenny Salesa.
