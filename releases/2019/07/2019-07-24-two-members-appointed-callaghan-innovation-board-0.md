“I would like to welcome Ms Trout and Mr Mahuika to the board of Callaghan Innovation” said Megan Woods.

“Research and innovation provide the key to achieving our ambitions for a more productive, sustainable and resilient economy.

“Callaghan Innovation’s role is to support businesses to commercialise their investments in science, engineering, technology and design, and in undertaking valuable research and development.

“Ms Trout and Mr Mahuika are both experienced directors who will provide expert knowledge and advice to Callaghan Innovation. In particular, their expertise will be valuable as the R&D Tax Incentive is implemented and the upgrade of the Gracefield Innovation Quarter gets underway”, says Megan Woods.

She has held senior management roles in the energy, transport and infrastructure sectors and has been involved in a number of high-profile and nationally significant socio-economic infrastructure projects.
