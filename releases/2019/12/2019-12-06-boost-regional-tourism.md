Regions around the country will get a $13.3 million boost from the Tourism Infrastructure Fund (TIF) to help enrich New Zealand-Aotearoa through sustainable tourism growth, Associate Tourism Minister Peeni Henare has announced.

The funding from round four of the TIF is being invested across 23 councils, and will support a range of projects, including toilet and shower facilities, upgraded carparks and walkways, and wastewater facilities.

“Through the TIF, we’re able to help regions to manage and support their tourism industry, so that it enhances the overall wellbeing of their communities,” Peeni Henare said.

One of the recipients is the Ruapehu District Council, which received nearly $4 million for the upgrade of the Ohakune Water Treatment Plant.

Another recipient is the Chatham Islands, which Mr Henare visited recently. 

“The Chatham Islands is an emerging and developing tourism destination that provides a unique and truly one of-a-kind visitor experience, and the funding will greatly benefit the island.”

Tourism Chatham Islands received $168,061 to install public toilets in six places with high visitor numbers.

“The range of projects that have been funded in this round really demonstrates what the TIF is all about. Working collaboratively with local government and communities, to come up with ways to improve tourism in ways that work for them.”

“This is just one way we can work together to implement the Government Tourism Strategy. We’ll continue to work together on developing long-term, sustainable solutions to tourism needs and issues, and I’m looking forward to continuing this partnership,” Peeni Henare said.
