Ethnic communities will be able to plan and deliver more community initiatives thanks to an increase in Government funding, Minister for Ethnic Communities Hon Jenny Salesa said today.

“Ensuring Aotearoa New Zealand is a place we can all be proud to call home has been a key priority of our Government. As part of that we must ensure our ethnic communities are well-supported in their diverse and varied community activities. I am really pleased our Government is delivering this increased support for our community groups,” Jenny Salesa said.

“This increase takes the Ethnic Communities Development Fund from $520,000 to $4.2 million each year, meaning we can support more of the community initiatives that help build a stronger, safer more connected and inclusive society.

“Aotearoa is home to over 200 ethnicities. Providing this funding boost to support ethnic community initiatives will contribute to ensuring New Zealand is welcoming and inclusive for everyone, and our ethnic communities are more connected and have more opportunities to participate and contribute in our society.

“This fund has been utilised for ethnic community sport and youth initiatives, multicultural events, ethnic women’s centres, refugee and migrant services, and language initiatives, to name a few.”

“With this funding boost the priorities of the fund are expanding to support groups to do more work; including and welcoming ethnic diversity; promoting ethnic diversity and understanding – including educating New Zealanders about the contribution of ethnic communities; developing participation in employment and society; and supporting our ethnic communities to thrive through the practice and celebration of culture.” Jenny Salesa said.

The Fund will from now on operate as a rolling fund, with applications assessed and decisions made throughout the year, rather than just once annually. Eligible groups with initiatives that benefit ethnic communities in Aotearoa New Zealand can apply from 6 December 2019.
