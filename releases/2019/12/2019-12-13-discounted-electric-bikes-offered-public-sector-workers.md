Discounted electric bikes will be offered up to public sector staff across the country as part of the Government’s work to reduce transport emissions and support healthier transport options.

 Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter officially launched the new initiative at Wellington Hospital today.

 “The Government has negotiated bulk-purchase discounts on e-bikes which will be made available to interested workers in public sector organisations including DHBs, councils and state sector agencies.

 “The discounts on e-bikes will range from 10 to 50 percent, or $300 to $1200, off the cost of an e-bike.

 “E-bikes are increasingly being used as an alternative for short car trips. E-bikes are fast, fun and free from congestion and parking worries.

 “Having public sector staff bike to work takes pressure of car parking in places like Wellington Hospital, it reduces congestion, and improves health.

 “This initiative is expected to be offered up to around 50,000 public sector workers over the next year, said Julie Anne Genter.”

 Guidance is available to private businesses who would like to run a similar scheme at [www.nzta.govt.nz/employer-e-bike-purchase-support](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/employer-e-bike-purchase-support)&gt;
