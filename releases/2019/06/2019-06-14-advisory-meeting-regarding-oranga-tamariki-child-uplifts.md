“I have listened to the concerns being raised about recent events, and I know that many people have been deeply impacted,” Tracey Martin said.

“I have made contact with Ngāti Kahungunu and the Maori Council and will travel to the Hawkes Bay to meet with them tomorrow. Kanohi ki te kanohi, we can consider a pathway that will do better not only for Maori children, but for all children.

“I will be joined by Minister Kelvin Davis and Minister Nanaia Mahuta.

“I know that all parties involved in this discussion come from exactly the same place – none of us want any more babies harmed or killed,” Tracey Martin said.
