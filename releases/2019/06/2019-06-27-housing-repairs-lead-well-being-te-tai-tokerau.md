The Minister of Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta was visiting whānau in Te Tai Tokerau this week to hear about positive impacts on whānau from their essential housing repairs programmes. 

Te Puni Kōkiri Māori Housing Network has invested $1.025m to repair 31 whare in the region over the past year. They have completed 125 repairs region-wide since the Māori Housing Network began in early 2016. 

“The impact on whānau is that they are feeling more energetic and happy. They don’t have the added stress of dealing with constant health issues and the enormity of living in poor conditions. Whānau have said these repairs have created  safer, warm dry homes where they can provide manaakitanga and stability for their whānau,” Minister Mahuta says. 

“I want to mihi to the community providers who go over and above their brief to help whānau sort out their housing issues across the region. 

“The relationships that Te Rūnanga a Iwi o Ngāpuhi, Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa, He Iwi Kotahi Tātou and Ki A Ora Ngātiwai have with their communities are making the real difference in identifying those most at need of assistance.” 

Te Puni Kōkiri Regional Manager, Tui Marsh says “whānau have a positive vibe returning to the home and a future focussed outlook on life. There’s a sense of pride in their home and surroundings and the health impacts are being seen in the reduced number of doctor’s visits.” 

The providers selected also had wrap-around services to offer – not just housing.Te Rūnanga a Iwi o Ngāpuhi partnered with Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi and Ki A Ora Ngātiwai who have a range of nursing and medical services and social service networks, Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa works closely with local kura, Whangaroa Health and GP’s, He Iwi Kotahi Tātou Trust partnered with Philanthropic, local business and Hauora Services.

**He oranga kei ngā whakapaipai whare mātuatua ki Te Tai Tokerau**

I te rohe o Te Tai Tokerau te Minita Whanaketanga Māori a Nanaia Mahuta e toro atu ana ki te whānau i te rangi nei ki te whakarongo ki ngā āhuatanga whai hua ki te whānau i tā rātou kaupapa whakapaipai whare mātuatua. 

Kua whakapau te Whatunga Whare Māori o Te Puni Kōkiri i te $1.025 miriona ki te whakapaipai i te 31 whare i te rohe i te tau kua pahure ake nei. Kua tutuki i te 125 ngā whakapaipai puta noa i te rohe whānui mai i te tīmatanga o te Whatunga Whare Māori i te tīmatanga o 2016. 

“Ko te pānga ki te whānau he hihiri te wairua, he hari koa hoki i te mea kāore rātou i te rongo i te kōhukihuki mai i ngā raru hauora e puta ake ana, e puta ake ana, ā, kua hīkina te āwangawanga o te noho ki ngā whare kanukanu. Kua kī mai ngā whānau nā ngā whakapaipai nei kua waihangaia he whare maroke, mahana, haumaru ake hoki, he wāhi e taea ai te hora i te manaakitanga, kua tau ai te noho a te whanau. 

“Kei te hiahia mihi au ki ngā kaiwhakarato hapori ka whakapau kaha ki te manaaki i te whānau ki te whakatika i ngā raru whare puta noa i te rohe.” 

“Ko te hononga i waenga i Te Rūnanga a Iwi o Ngapuhi, Te Rūnanga o Whāingaroa, He Iwi Kotahi Tātou me te Ki A Ora Ngātiwai ki tō rātou hapori koirā ngā rōpū kaha ki te tautohu i te hunga e tino mate tautoko ana,” te kī a te Minita. 

E kī ana te Pou Whakahaere ā-Rohe o Te Puni Kōkiri, a Tui Marsh “he harikoa ana ngā whānau i a rātou e hoki ana ki te kāinga, ā, e taea ana te kite ināianei i ngā huarahi kei mua i a rātou. He poho kereru rātou i te āhua o ō rātou whare, te whenua e karapoti ana hoki i te whare me te hekenga o ngā raru hauora he mea kitea i te hekenga o ngā haerenga ki te tākuta.” 

Ehara i te mea ko ngā whare noa iho ngā ratonga a ngā kaiwhakarato i tohua, he whānui ā rātou ratonga. I mahi tahi Te Rūnanga ā-Iwi o Ngapuhi ki Te Hau Ora o Ngapuhi, ā, he nui ngā tūmomo ratonga nēhi, tākuta, ka mutu, ngā whatunga pāpori hoki o Ki A Ora Ngātiwai, ka mahi Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa ki te taha o ngā kura ā-rohe, a Whangaroa Helath me ngā tākuta, I whai hoa tautoko a He Iwi Kotahi Trust ki Philanthropic, ngā pakihi ā-rohe me ngā Ratonga Hauora.
