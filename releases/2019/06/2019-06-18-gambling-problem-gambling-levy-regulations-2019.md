The Gambling (Problem Gambling Levy) Regulations 2019 have been confirmed by Cabinet.

The regulations will introduce new levy rates for the four levy-paying sectors and are planned to come into force on 1 July 2019. The newly confirmed levy rates (GST exclusive) are: gaming machine operators (0.78% of player expenditure); casinos (0.56% of player expenditure); NZ Lotteries Commission (0.43% of player expenditure); and New Zealand Racing Board (0.52% of player expenditure).   

Decisions made on the new levy rates come after the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health have consulted with the Gambling Commission, gambling operators, providers of services to prevent and minimise harmful gambling, and other affected groups.

The Regulatory Impact Assessment and the associated Cabinet paper will be proactively released on the Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Health’s website shortly.

The levy will be used to fund a national strategy and service delivery plan to prevent and minimise gambling harm.
