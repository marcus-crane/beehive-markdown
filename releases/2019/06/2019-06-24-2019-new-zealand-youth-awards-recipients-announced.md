The recipients of the 2019 New Zealand Youth Awards were announced by Minister for Youth Peeni Henare at a celebration event which took place on 24 June at Parliament.

“Aotearoa is incredibly lucky to have such a diverse group of young people working hard to make our country a better place. The recipients of this year’s Awards have achieved so much and contributed to their communities in many ways. I believe that recognising positive actions taken by young people is one of my most important roles as the Minister for Youth,” Peeni Henare said.

This year, there are seven Awards categories with 14 recipients as follows:

Jessica was able to raise $2,500 for Lifeline and raise awareness of the mana whenua approach to suicide prevention.
