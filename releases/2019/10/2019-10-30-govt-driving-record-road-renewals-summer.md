The Government will carry out the largest programme of state highways repairs and renewals this summer ever, Transport Minister Phil Twyford today announced.

Around 1,200 kilometres of state highway will be repaired and renewed over the 2019/20 summer season.

Phil Twyford says road maintenance expenditure flatlined under the last government while the cost of labour and materials grew by 12 per cent and traffic grew by 15 per cent.

“Our Government is now getting on with addressing the maintenance backlog caused by nine years of underinvestment. 

“Last year, NZTA delivered its biggest recorded programme of road maintenance and is on track to deliver 60 per cent more renewals compared to under the previous government – that’s around 350kms more a year.

“We’re taking a balanced approach and spending more on roads than the last government, but also more on public transport, rail, and walking and cycling infrastructure.

“Making sure our roads are up to scratch is just one part of what we’re doing to keep Kiwis safe while travelling. We’re also carrying out lifesaving upgrades over 3,300kms of state highways which will prevent 160 deaths and serious injuries every year,” Phil Twyford said.

The ‘summer season’ runs from October to March and is the best time to build and maintain roads as the warmer weather and ground temperatures are ideal for laying surfaces. The state highway renewals over the summer are expected to cost $155 million.
