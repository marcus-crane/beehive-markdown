**Feedback sought – Hagley Oval**

The Associate Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration, Poto Williams, is seeking feedback on a proposal about Hagley Oval.

The proposal was developed by Regenerate Christchurch on behalf of the Canterbury Cricket Trust. The Trust leases the land in Hagley Park, which Hagley Oval occupies, from the Christchurch City Council.

The proposal asks the Associate Minister to use her powers under section 71 of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act 2016 to make the amendments to the Christchurch District Plan to set standards for the operation and use of Hagley Oval.

The proposed changes to the rules in the District Plan would replace the need for the Canterbury Cricket Trust to make any future resource consent applications relating to the proposed standards for operation and structures.

The Trust’s current 2013 resource consent allows for four retractable lighting poles.

However, the proposed changes to the District Plan would permit six permanent floodlighting poles and structures. It also seeks other changes, including increasing the number of permitted match days compared to the resource consent.

“It is important that anyone interested in this proposal makes a written comment,” Ms Williams says.

Ms Williams acknowledges that Regenerate Christchurch notes there is a deadline of 20 December 2019 for a Christchurch bid to host “top-tier” games – such as a final of the 2021 Women’s Cricket World Cup – which require the ability to meet international broadcasting standards through the use of floodlights.

“I appreciate the need to balance making a timely decision and providing certainty, while ensuring the process remains robust and there is sufficient time for written feedback.”

In addition to the section 71 process, in order to install permanent floodlights the Canterbury Cricket Trust also requires a new lease with Christchurch City Council.

The Council is required by the Reserves Act to undertake public consultation of at least one calendar month when considering a new lease. The Council’s consultation starts tomorrow (16 October) and will remain open until Monday 18 November 2019.

**NOTES to Editor: The section 71 proposal and the Council needing to make changes to the lease agreement are two separate and independent consultation processes. Comment through one process does not mean comment on the other process.**

**Written Feedback on the section 71 Proposal**

All written comments must be received by 5.00pm, Wednesday, 20 November 2019 and will be taken into account by the Minister in deciding whether to approve the Proposal.

The Proposal can be viewed and written comments made online at:

[www.dpmc.govt.nz/hagley-oval](http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/hagley-oval)

The Proposal can also be viewed, and written comment forms are available, at Christchurch City Council service centres and libraries, and the main office of Selwyn and Waimakariri District Councils from Thursday, 17 October 2019.
