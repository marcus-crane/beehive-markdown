Minister of Health Dr David Clark and Minister of Greater Christchurch Regeneration Megan Woods have today celebrated the success of Mana Ake, which has helped more than 1500 young people in Canterbury and Kaikōura in its first year.

As of 29 April, all Year 1 to 8 children in the 219 primary and intermediate schools have access to dedicated mental health and wellbeing support in their schools through Mana Ake – Stronger for Tomorrow.

Minister Clark and Woods attended an event in Christchurch today to celebrate the one-year rollout of Mana Ake with children and the kaimahi that support them.

“In just one year, Mana Ake has supported 942 children individually, and 578 children in groups. That’s a lot of children that have been listened to and had their issues taken seriously. 

“Our tamariki have had a number of challenges in their lives, from the ongoing impact of the earthquakes which served as the initial impetus for Mana Ake, through to the attacks on March 15 this year, as well as day-to-day challenges.

“For parents to know that their children will be supported when they go to school is a fantastic comfort – and no doubt will be improving the mental health and wellbeing of many parents as well,” says David Clark.

Minister Megan Woods says it is the people involved in Mana Ake who have made it such a success. 

“The role kaimahi play to support Canterbury’s young people can’t be overstated. Our kaimahi go into schools every day to help, support and build resilience for our school children, equipping them with skills which will help them for the rest of their lives.

“It was fantastic to hear from Karaitiana Tickell, Sir John Hansen and most importantly the voices of the community at today’s event. It’s clear from their words that Mana Ake is providing a valuable service for mental health and wellbeing support which had been missing in our city for a long time before,” Megan Woods says.
