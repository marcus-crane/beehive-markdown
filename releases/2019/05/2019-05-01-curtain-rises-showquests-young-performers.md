The World of WearableArt (WOW), one of New Zealand’s most iconic creative companies, is set to discover some of the best young creative design talent from Showquest for the first time this year, Education Minister Chris Hipkins said.

Showquest, a series of special performing arts events for Years 1 to 13 students, replaced Stage Challenge last year, after the organiser of Stage Challenge and J Rock said they could no longer continue.

“Showquest has been a big success,” Chris Hipkins said.

“I have been so impressed by the feedback from the performers who really threw themselves into the occasion.

“Last year’s shows attracted big crowds, but this year’s event could be even bigger and better, with a new wearable art design category being added to the competition.

“Performing arts is an important part of the curriculum and through Showquest, young people can get hands-on experience. It also gives students the opportunity to grow their confidence and leadership skills.

“Sixty schools and about 2000 students took part in 2018 – a great achievement given preparations started slightly later in the year.

“This year, 160 schools around the country have already signed up to it, of those 76 schools have entered the wearable art design challenge,” Chris Hipkins said.

Shows start on May 7 at Forum North in Whangarei and end in Tauranga at the end of June.
