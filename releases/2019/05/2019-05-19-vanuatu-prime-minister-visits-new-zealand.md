Vanuatu’s Prime Minister Charlot Salwai will visit New Zealand from 20 to 23 May, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced today.

“New Zealand and Vanuatu have a long history of close friendship. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Salwai here and discussing further opportunities to strengthen the relationship between our countries,” Jacinda Ardern said. 

The relationship between the two countries is underpinned by the successful Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme, tourism links and shared regional interests.

New Zealand’s development programme to Vanuatu is targeted towards supporting economic development through tourism and agriculture, and working with the state to deliver equitable access to basic services.

“Prime Minister Salwai’s visit provides a good opportunity to demonstrate New Zealand’s work to improve the resilience of infrastructure, and progress conversations on regional security, labour mobility and PACER Plus,” Jacinda Ardern said.

The visit will be Prime Minister Salwai’s second official visit to New Zealand as Prime Minister. He will be accompanied by Vanuatu’s Minister of Internal Affairs Andrew Napuat.
