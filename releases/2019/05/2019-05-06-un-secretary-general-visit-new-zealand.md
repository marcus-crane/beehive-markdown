The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, will visit New Zealand from 12 to 14 May, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today.

“I am looking forward to welcoming Secretary-General Guterres to New Zealand and discussing the issues that matter most to us and our region,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“The United Nations is the forum where we collectively address the global challenges we face, including climate change and international security. This visit is an opportunity to share some of the innovative ways New Zealand is addressing these issues.

“New Zealand strongly supports the role of the United Nations in upholding the international rules-based system and ensuring all voices are able to be heard.”

Secretary-General Guterres is visiting New Zealand for the first time in his role as UN Secretary-General, having previously visited in his role as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 

The Prime Minister will meet with Secretary-General Guterres on Sunday 12 May. His programme will also include engagements in Auckland and Christchurch, including a keynote speech at the Auckland University of Technology on 13 May.

The Secretary-General’s visit is the first stop on a broader visit to the Pacific region.
