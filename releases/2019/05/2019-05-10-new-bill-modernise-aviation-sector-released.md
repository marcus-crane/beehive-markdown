Proposed law changes to enhance the aviation regulatory system are being publically released today.

The new Civil Aviation Bill will modernise New Zealand’s key pieces of aviation legislation, the Civil Aviation Act 1990 and the Airport Authorities Act 1966, announced Transport Minister Phil Twyford.

Phil Twyford said the changes touch on every part of the aviation sector – from drones to lost luggage.

“Safety is our top transport priority and the proposed laws will make our airports, and flying, safer for New Zealanders and visitors to our country.

“Measures to improve safety include a new drug and alcohol management scheme for people who work in the sector, clearer powers for aviation security officers as well as amendments which take into account new technology like drones.

“New Zealanders will be able to apply to the Disputes Tribunal over lost, delayed or damaged baggage.

“Officials from the Ministry are holding a series of meetings with airports, airlines and the wider aviation community to discuss the changes. The public are also invited to give their feedback. This will inform the development of the final legislation later this year,” Phil Twyford said.

Details on the draft Bill and how to make a submission are available on the Ministry of Transport website at: [www.transport.govt.nz](http://www.transport.govt.nz). Submissions close on 6 July.
