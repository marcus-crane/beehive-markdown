Philip Broughton and Linda Clark have been appointed to the NZ on Air board, Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Hon Kris Faafoi announced today.

“Linda Clark brings both legal and broadcasting experience to the Board, from her current role as Partner, Public Law and Dispute Resolution, with law firm Kensington Swan and with 20 years’ experience working across the media sector,” says Kris Faafoi. “She was also TVNZ’s political editor through the 1990s and hosted RNZ’s Nine to Noon programme.

“Philip Broughton brings considerable governance experience to the Board, including having been a business mentor for Te Puni Kōkiri and facilitator for the Institute of Directors governance programmes. He is also a former director and board member on a number of institutions including Education New Zealand.

“Mr Broughton’s Māori perspectives are also a valuable addition to the the Board, aligning with NZ On Air’s mandate to reflect and develop Aotearoa’s identity and culture.

Ms Clark fills a vacancy in a position previously held by Ian Taylor, who completed his term in November 2018, and Mr Broughton will replace Stuart McLauchlan who is finishing his term. 

“My thanks to out-going members Stuart McLauchlan and Ian Taylor for their contributions to the board,” says Kris Faafoi.

Mr Broughton and Ms Clark’s terms are until 31 March 2022. Current members Helen Grattan and John McCay have been reappointed.
