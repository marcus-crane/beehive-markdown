Frontline Police numbers have been boosted with today’s deployment of 77 new officers to the regions.

Police Minister Stuart Nash today congratulated the recruits of Wing 325 who graduated at a formal ceremony at the Royal New Zealand Police College.

“I am delighted at the continuing progress in the diversity of our new Police officers and this latest recruit wing is a prime example,” Mr Nash says.

“Forty-nine per cent of the new recruits are female officers. It is one of the highest proportion of female constables to graduate from a recent training wing. Thirteen per cent of the new officers are Maori, 12 per cent are Pasifika and 12 per cent are Asian.

“The youngest recruit is 19 and the eldest is 45 years old. Nineteen of the new Police officers were born overseas and at least 17 languages other than English are spoken by those who graduate today.

“There are New Zealand and provincial sports reps, former members of the Armed Forces, and others with a strong tradition of volunteering in their communities. Others have been active in the arts including one who worked on a Hobbit movie.

“I also want to pay tribute to wing patron Paula Tesoriero who has been an inspiring mentor to the new recruits.

“Since the government was formed a total of 1289 new constables have been deployed. We are working hard on the recruitment, training and deployment of new officers.

“Our objective is to make New Zealand the safest country in the world. The wellbeing of our communities, crime prevention and public safety are key priorities for the new constables who graduate today,” Mr Nash said.
