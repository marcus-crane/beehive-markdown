A Turkish national shot in the March 15 mosques terrorist attack in Christchurch has died in hospital, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed this morning.

“My heartfelt condolences go to the family and community of this man who has died overnight in Christchurch Hospital,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“This sad news will be felt across Turkey, as well as New Zealand.

“This man has been in intensive care since the attack. We have all been hoping for the best however he has now succumbed to the injuries sustained in the shooting at the Al Noor Mosque.

“I want to acknowledge all the medical staff who have cared for the 49 men women and children who were shot and wounded in the attack and taken to hospital.

“This is only the second victim to die while in hospital – the first was unable to be resuscitated on arrival on the 15th of March. This a testament to the extraordinary work put in by the medical staff at Christchurch, Burwood and Starship Hospitals in the aftermath of the shooting to save lives.
