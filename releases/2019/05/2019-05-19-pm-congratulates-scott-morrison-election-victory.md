Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has congratulated Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on his election victory.

“New Zealand and Australia have the strongest of ties and they will continue. I look forward to continuing to strengthen the relationship between our two countries in the coming years,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“I phoned Prime Minister Morrison this afternoon and offered him and Jenny my congratulations on his election victory in what was a close and hard fought election.

“Prime Minister Morrison has an affinity to New Zealand having lived and worked here. He understands us, which is very helpful to the Trans-Tasman relationship.

“I have also contacted Bill Shorten today. Bill has done a great job in unifying the Labor Party and fought a strong campaign. I wished him and Chloe the best of luck for the future,” Jacinda Ardern said.
