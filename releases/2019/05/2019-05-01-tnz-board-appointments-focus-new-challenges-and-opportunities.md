Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis has announced the appointment of Jamie Tuuta as Chair of the New Zealand Tourism Board (known as Tourism New Zealand) and Roger Sharp as Deputy Chair. 

The appointments were announced at the inaugural Qualmark 100% Pure New Zealand Experience Awards at Parliament this evening.

“The tourism environment has changed dramatically in recent years and both Jamie Tuuta and Roger Sharp possess the right skills and experience to provide expert leadership to the board,” Kelvin Davis said.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank outgoing Chair, Dame Kerry Prendergast for the dedication she has shown in guiding Tourism New Zealand to become a visionary, world-leading tourism organisation.

“A mix of significant visitor growth, changes in technology and digital media, and the Government’s upcoming Tourism Strategy mean that there are a number of challenges and opportunities for the Board.

“I am confident that the new perspectives brought to the table by both Jamie and Roger are going to be an asset for Tourism New Zealand,” Kelvin Davis said.
