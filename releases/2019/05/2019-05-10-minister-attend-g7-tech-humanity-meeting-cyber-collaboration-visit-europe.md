Hon Kris Faafoi will attend the “Tech for Humanity” meeting of G7 Digital Ministers in Paris next week, and has added a further number of cyber engagements to planned travel to support the Government’s focus on international collaboration on cyber issues.

Kris Faafoi will accompany the Prime Minister while she is in Paris championing the Christchurch Call, with the aim of adopting concrete commitments by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online, while protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and maintaining a free, open and secure internet.

Kris Faafoi is making cyber security visits in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, because, he says, ongoing co-operation is critical.

“Our vision is for an open, safe and secure cyberspace. New Zealand is committed to addressing cyber security threats and building cyber security capacity and resilience. While we are geographically isolated, this offers no protection in the cyber world.

“I will be meeting with counterparts in the UK and in Ireland to discuss global cyber security issues as no one country can tackle these alone.”

Mr Faafoi is also undertaking visits related to his Customs portfolio in the UK, and to his broadcasting, communications and digital media portfolio in the UK and Ireland.

“I want to take the opportunity to find out more on how public broadcasting is delivered in different ways. In Ireland I’m particularly interested to hear how public broadcasters are supporting local content including journalists covering stories in Irish.

“I’m also interested in the BBC’s Local News Partnership where the BBC funds journalists in regional newsrooms to source local stories and these are shared throughout the network.

“We know the New Zealand media landscape is at a precipice – so I do want to take this opportunity to look at how others are delivering strong public media throughout a time of change.”

In his capacity as Minister of Civil Defence, Mr Faafoi will also deliver New Zealand’s official statement at the Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction, organised by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, and has speaking roles in a ministerial roundtable on economics of disaster risk reduction and a working session on innovative disaster risk reductions investment modalities.
