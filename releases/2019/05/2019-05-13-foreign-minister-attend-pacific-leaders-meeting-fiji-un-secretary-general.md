Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel to Suva tomorrow with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres to attend a Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting on 15 May.

“The visit is an opportunity to shine a spotlight on issues facing our region to the UN’s top official, United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres,” Mr Peters said.

“Responding to climate change is a key focus for the Pacific. New Zealand wants to show that transformative action is possible, even by the smallest countries, through innovation and ideas.

“We want the UN Secretary-General to leave the meeting as a champion for our region, playing a constructive role in bringing knowledge, finance, and support from the international community,” Mr Peters said.

The Foreign Affairs Minister will be meeting with Mr Guterres this evening before they travel to Fiji together.

Mr Peters will be travelling from 14-16 May.
