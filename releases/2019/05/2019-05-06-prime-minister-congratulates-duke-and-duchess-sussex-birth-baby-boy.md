“On behalf of all New Zealanders I want to pass on our congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the happy news of the birth of their baby son,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. 

“The birth of a baby is such an incredibly exciting time. 

“We wish them all the best, and very much look forward to seeing them all in New Zealand somewhere down the track.

“In line with their request we have not sent a gift, but the Government is marking the birth with donations to two New Zealand child-centred charities.   

“We will be making a donation of $1000 to Little Sprouts, which gives packs of baby and children items to families in need.   

“We are also donating 10 trees to Trees for Kiwi Babies, for native tree planting events during Matariki 2019. These donations will celebrate all New Zealand babies, as well as the new Royal baby,” Jacinda Ardern said.   

**Background notes** 

Little Sprouts is a volunteer-run charity that distributes baby boxes to vulnerable families.  It has branches in Auckland, Gisborne, Wellington, Kapiti, Christchurch and Invercargill.  Each pack is designed for the needs of the particular family, which can include families with premature or unwell babies, women escaping from domestic violence, refugee families, young parents without support networks, families with an ill parent, and families living in an ongoing cycle of poverty.

Trees for Kiwi babies is part of the Trees That Count initiative to measure and encourage the planting of native trees by community groups, government agencies, schools and people in their own backyards.  The Trees for Kiwi Babies Registry is also about celebrating every Kiwi baby that will be born this year. Donations to this Tree Registry will go towards native tree planting events during Matariki 2019. They will be inviting new Kiwi parents and their 2018 babies to come along and plant a tree.
