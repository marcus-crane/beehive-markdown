Minister of Justice Andrew Little has acknowledged Hon Sir Douglas White on his retirement as President of the Law Commission. Sir Douglas served three years in the role. 

Several significant law reform projects were completed during Sir Douglas’ time at the Commission including reviews of the Evidence Act 2006, the Search and Surveillance Act 2012, and the law of contempt of court, a report on strangulation as a new offence and a ministerial briefing paper on alternative approaches to abortion law.

Sir Douglas will stay on at the Commission until 28 June 2019 in order to assist with the completion of the Commission’s work on the review of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.

“Sir Douglas White has had a distinguished career as a lawyer and Court of Appeal Judge, and I am pleased that he devoted his skills to lead the Commission for the time that he did. He has provided the Commission with able leadership during his tenure,” Andrew Little said.

Deputy President Helen McQueen will lead the Commission until a replacement for Sir Douglas can be found.  A process to find a permanent replacement will commence shortly.
