The Royal Commission into the March 15 terror attack will begin considering evidence next week following the appointment of the second and final commissioner.

Former diplomat Jacqui Caine, the former New Zealand Ambassador to Chile and most recently Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Director of Special Projects in Christchurch, will join the Commission Chair Sir William Young.

“The Government is confident that the Royal Commission now has the right people in place to carry out the important task of fully understanding what happened in the lead up to the March 15 terror attack, what could have been done to stop it and how we can keep New Zealanders safe,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.

The Commission has already been established, is scheduled to begin considering evidence from Monday and is due to report by 10 December 2019.

Ms Caine has resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to take up the role.

“This is a critical part of our ongoing response to the attack. The Commission’s findings will help to ensure such an attack never happens here again,” Jacinda Ardern said.
