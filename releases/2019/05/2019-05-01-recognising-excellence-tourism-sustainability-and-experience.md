The winners and finalists celebrated at the inaugural Qualmark 100% Pure New Zealand Experience Awards, have been congratulated by Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis, who hosted the ceremony tonight at Parliament.

The Awards recognise excellence in visitor experiences that embody sustainable tourism practices and hosting, and a commitment to *Tiaki - Care for New Zealand*, a tourism industry initiative to encourage travellers to care for people, place and culture while in New Zealand.

“Tonight’s awards are about recognising tourism operators who show a real dedication to manaakitanga and environmentally sustainable business practices,” Kelvin Davis said.

“These values are also core to our Government’s tourism strategy. We need to make sure the natural environment is protected and enhanced, that communities embrace visitors and that we’re economically better off.

“Tiaki was only launched last November, so it’s great to see so many tourism operators already embracing its principles and the need to take a wider responsibility for their people, communities and environment.”

The recipients of this year’s awards are: Camp Glenorchy - Eco Retreat; Franz Josef Glacier Guides - Glacier Heli Hike; Hanmer Springs Thermal Pools & Spa; Kaitiaki Adventures - Raft the Kaituna; Real Journeys - Doubtful Sound Overnight Cruise; Redwoods Treewalk - Redwoods Treewalk and Nightlights Experience, and; Rotorua Canopy Tours - The Ultimate Canopy Tour.

“I congratulate all the finalists and inaugural recipients of the Awards, and look forward to seeing how these excellent tourism operators continue to deliver world class experiences to our visitors,” Kelvin Davis said.
