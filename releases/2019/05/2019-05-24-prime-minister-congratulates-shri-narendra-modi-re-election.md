“New Zealand and India have a close and long-standing relationship based on our shared democratic values and Commonwealth heritage, and growing trade, tourism and education links,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.

“Our relationship is underpinned by New Zealand’s Indian community who engage across New Zealand’s business, government and civil society.

“I look forward to continuing to strengthen the relationship between our two countries in the coming years. 

“Arranging for 900 million eligible voters to be able to freely cast their vote is a considerable achievement. The successful delivery of the world’s biggest election reflects a strong commitment to democratic principles that New Zealand admires,” Jacinda Ardern said.
