Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, today met with United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, to discuss a range of global and regional climate change issues.

The Minister was pleased to show the Secretary-General some of New Zealand’s climate change work underway and meet New Zealanders making change, including youth, the private sector and Māori.

The Minister and the Secretary-General were invited to attend an event in Auckland to talk with youth leaders on climate change issues.

“Today’s meeting was a platform for robust discussion, to share concerns and ideas, and to reiterate New Zealand’s commitment to combating climate change.”

“Engaging our young people to build inter-generational climate action is paramount to combating climate change,” said James Shaw. 

“New Zealand is helping to show the world that a just transition to a low emissions economy is possible and can lead to sustainable development and inclusive growth,” Mr Guterres said.

“I welcome New Zealand’s efforts to develop domestic climate change legislation that sets a pathway for a long-term transformation in line with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C.  This is an example of the greater ambition we need if we are to keep pace in meeting the climate threat.”

In Christchurch, the Minister and Secretary-General will meet with iwi and figures from the private sector.

“New Zealand’s indigenous communities and private sector are committed to New Zealand’s low carbon transition, which is vital to us doing our part to address the climate change challenges facing the Pacific region,” said Mr Shaw.

“There is much the world can learn from indigenous approaches to managing agricultural emissions,” said the Secretary-General.

 The Secretary-General thanked New Zealand for its support for his Climate Action Summit to be held in New York this September.  The Summit will bring together world leaders from government, business and civil society to demonstrate increased ambition to tackle the climate change crisis and to showcase the many opportunities of climate action. 

“I look forward to working closely with New Zealand to launch concrete action-oriented initiatives in which the public and private sector can come together for transformational change,” Mr Guterres said.

In response Mr. Shaw said, “New Zealand recognises the urgent need for the international community to enhance action on climate change that keeps the 1.5 degree temperature limit and climate resilience within reach.

“We look forward to co-leading the Nature-Based Solutions work stream for the Climate Action Summit.”

The Secretary General’s visit to New Zealand is part of his visit to the wider Pacific region.
