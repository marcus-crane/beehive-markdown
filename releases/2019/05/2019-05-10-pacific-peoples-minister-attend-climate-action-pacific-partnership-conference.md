Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio will travel to Fiji on Sunday to attend the Climate Action Pacific Partnership Conference, which is being held on the 13 – 14 May.

“The New Zealand Government wants to work closely with the Pacific to help develop regional solutions to the effects of climate change and to amplify the region’s voice on the global stage to continue the push for ambitious action,” Aupito William Sio says.

“This is an opportunity to showcase climate action in the Pacific and support the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

“The Pacific matters deeply to New Zealand and our prosperity, wellbeing and security are intertwined, in which we have deep cultural, people-to-people, historical, and economic linkages.

“Our Pacific Island family know well the complex and growing array of challenges they face, including the impacts of climate change.

“New Zealand is embarking on a complementary path to the Pacific, developing domestic legislation and policy to drive ambitious climate change action.

“New Zealand shares the Pacific’s goal of an ambitious, effective global response to climate change and is committed to supporting the Pacific to address the impacts of climate change and take climate action,” Aupito William Sio says.
