Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced the appointment of diplomat Phillip Taula as High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.

“Mr Taula’s wide experience has provided superb preparation for New Zealand’s commitment to a fresh approach to the Pacific,” said Mr Peters.

“This marks our ambition and investment in the region. At the heart of our efforts is a focus on building deeper, more mature partnerships with Pacific Island countries, and supporting their independence and sustainable social and economic resilience.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Papua New Guinea is friendly and growing, with regular political consultations, a large development assistance programme, defence cooperation activities, and commercial and business links,” Mr Peters said.

Prior to his appointment Mr Taula was Divisional Manager of the United Nations Human Rights and Commonwealth Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Mr Taula also served a term as Deputy Permanent Representative to New Zealand’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York during the campaign for a seat and two-year membership on the Security Council where his role involved close engagement with Pacific missions and other Small Island Developing States. Mr Taula also served as Acting Head of Mission in Suva, Fiji, from 2010 to 2013.
