Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Andrew Little, acknowledges Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Porou who came to Parliament today to witness the Third Reading of the Ngā Rohe Moana o Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Porou Bill (No 2).

“This Bill has its origins in the repealed 2004 Foreshore and Seabed Act and provides a framework for customary rights recognition in the common marine and coastal area – previously referred to as the foreshore and seabed – for Ngāti Porou.”

“The Bill also recognises the Crown has a responsibility to ensure public access as well as ensure the continuation of other lawful uses of the takutai moana.”

“It provides legal mechanisms that support the expression and protection of the mana of the hapū of Ngāti Porou, while recognising the Crown’s responsibility to maintain public access and continuing use of the common marine and coastal area. The Bill passed today reflects the Crown’s honouring of the 2008 Deed.”

“Ngā hapū o Ngāti Porou were the only group to both enter into negotiations and reach a Foreshore and Seabed Deed of Agreement with the Crown under the former Act, in 2008.

“When the decision was made to review and replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act with the Takutai Moana Act 2011, the Government stated it would honour and fulfil its commitments in the 2008 Deed with Ngāti Porou.” Andrew Little said.
