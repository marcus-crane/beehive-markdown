The Government has published a prototype Infrastructure Pipeline, to show what projects will be delivered by major central government agencies over the next five years, Infrastructure Minister Shane Jones announced today.

Developing a long-term and publicly available Infrastructure Pipeline will be a key focus for the new Infrastructure Commission, Te Waihanga, which is on track to be up and running by the end of the year.

“By shining a light on the big capital projects expected over a five-year horizon, the pipeline will not only give industry much needed certainty, but also help inform the Infrastructure Commission’s thinking as it develops a 30-year strategy to reverse New Zealand’s infrastructure deficit and maximise value for money from the Government’s $42 billion capital spending plan,” Shane Jones said.

“I am all too aware of the challenge the Coalition Government inherited to modernise New Zealand’s infrastructure, and ensure our schools, hospitals, transport networks, and other major projects are world-class.

“The Government is the construction industry’s biggest client and the new Commission will play an important role in coordinating and planning New Zealand’s infrastructure investment, to improve the wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

“Creating a fulsome pipeline is also a priority identified in the recently launched draft Construction Industry Accord.

“Once fully developed, the Infrastructure Pipeline tool will help give the infrastructure market greater confidence about the timing, sequencing and scale of future credible and committed infrastructure projects, so it can gear-up capacity and capability to deliver.”

The prototype currently includes data from five capital-intensive central government agencies: The Ministries of Education and Health, the New Zealand Transport Agency, the New Zealand Defence Force and the Department of Corrections.

“This prototype will allow us to gather feedback on the pipeline’s form and function before it expands to involve all central government agencies, local government, and, in time, private sector projects.” Shane Jones said.

**Note to editors:**

The Infrastructure Pipeline Tool is available on the Treasury’s website at [www.treasury.govt.nz/infrastructure-pipeline](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/infrastructure-pipeline).

The Infrastructure Pipeline has been developed by the Treasury’s Infrastructure Transactions Unit (ITU) in the lead-up to the establishment of the Infrastructure Commission.

Data will be updated at least quarterly. The next update is planned after 30 May 2019, to incorporate any changes resulting from Budget 2019.
