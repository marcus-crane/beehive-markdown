The Government has endorsed the Let’s Get Wellington Moving indicative package to ease congestion in our capital city, Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today.

Phil Twyford said our Government is tackling the long-term issues and this 20 year plan is a step change for transport in Wellington.

“We’ll reduce congestion by integrating modern rapid transit, walking and cycling upgrades, and better public transport with the city’s motorways and roads.

“Better public transport infrastructure and more services will encourage people out of their cars – freeing up the roads for those that have to drive.

“By unlocking the Basin Reserve and making streets more pedestrian and bicycle friendly, we’ll have a more liveable city that’s safer to get around.

“LGWM will help boost growth and encourage more housing, especially along the rapid transit corridor.

“The capital’s waterfront CBD is a national treasure. It is a job rich high-productivity economic powerhouse for the region. LGWM will unleash its potential and make it a magnet for investment after years of underinvestment.

“We can’t do everything at once and my expectation is that congestion-busting projects like rapid transit will be prioritised over motorway projects.

“We know that only by taking a joined-up regional approach will we unlock Wellington’s potential. That’s why we have allowed an estimated $4 billion for other regional transport projects.

“The next step is for the Wellington City Council and regional councils to endorse and commit to funding their share of the $6.4 billion plan. The total cost of the LGWM indicative package is split 60:40 between central government and local government to reflect the wider local benefits of the package,” Phil Twyford said.

**Note to editors:**

Let’s Get Wellington Moving is a joint initiative between the Government, Wellington City Council, Greater Wellington Regional Council and the NZ Transport Agency.

The design and preferred mode of rapid transit will be determined by the business case. Unblocking the Basin Reserve At-grade changes to improve reliable access for all modes; and grade separation between north-south movements, east-west movements and any rapid transit corridors. Extra Mount Victoria Tunnel  Extra Mount Victoria Tunnel and widening Ruahine St and Wellington Rd to improve access for public transport and enable dedicated walking and cycling routes.
