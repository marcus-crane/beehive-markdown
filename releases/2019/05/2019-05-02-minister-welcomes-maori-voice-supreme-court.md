The Minister of Māori Development, the Hon Nanaia Mahuta has welcomed the appointment of the former Chief Maori Land Court Judge, Justice Joseph Williams to the Supreme Court.

“It’s a great step to have Justice Williams with his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi and Māori land law on the Supreme Court bench.

“Justice Williams will be able to look at Treaty law in a very contemporary context. He was the Chair of the Waitangi Tribunal for many years.

“In 1988, I note that when he joined Kensington Swan he established the first unit specialising in Māori issues,” said the Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

Justice William’s tribal affiliations are Ngāti Pūkenga and Te Arawa (Waitaha, Tapuika). 

“I am delighted that Justice Williams with his background in  Māori and environment law will be sitting in the country’s highest court,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
