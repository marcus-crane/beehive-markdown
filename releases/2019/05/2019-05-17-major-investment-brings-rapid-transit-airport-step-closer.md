Aucklanders are one step closer to getting rapid transit to the airport, Transport Minister Phil Twyford and Auckland Mayor Phil Goff announced today.

Auckland Transport has awarded the contract for the upgrade of the Puhinui Rail Station Interchange to the McConnell Dowell-Built Environs Joint Venture.

Phil Twyford said the Government understands Aucklanders need better transport, and any Aucklander with access to the rail network will have a fast and convenient 10 minute bus connection to the airport.

“One of the first tasks I asked the Transport Agency to take on when we came into government was rapid public transport from Puhinui station to the airport.

“It will be a bus service to begin with and in the future, it will become part of a rapid transit route connecting to Manukau and Botany with a dedicated busway or possibly light rail.

“The contract being awarded means we are another step closer to rapid transit to the airport.

“This project is another example of central and local government working together through the 10-year Auckland Transport Alignment Project to unlock Auckland’s potential,” Phil Twyford said.

Mayor Phil Goff said, “This project allows for congestion-free travel to the airport and its employment precinct for people across Auckland. It will be welcomed by workers and visitors to the city.

“The impressive new station will mark out the South-Western gateway to the city.

“It provides a modern, safe and weather protected environment to allow people easily and conveniently to transition between road and rail services.

“Together with the new interchanges we have recently opened at Otahuhu, Panmure and Manukau, this new station helps create a 21st century public transport system for our city achieving convenient, regular and quick travel around the city.

“The project will be completed within 18 months of construction, which begins this year, and is planned to be open before the APEC leaders meeting in 2021,” Phil Goff said.

Travel times from Puhinui Station to Auckland Airport will be 10 minutes in priority lanes; 22 minutes to Manukau; and 46 minutes to Britomart Station. 

The Puhinui interchange forms part the wider Southwest Gateway programme, in which the Transport Agency, Auckland Transport and Auckland Airport are working together to deliver transport projects that will improve access to the airport and its surrounding area to benefit workers, travellers, tourists and freight movements.

The total project cost is $60 million. The Government, through the NZ Transport Agency, is contributing co-investment funding for the project, with the remainder coming from Auckland Council and the Regional Fuel Tax.
