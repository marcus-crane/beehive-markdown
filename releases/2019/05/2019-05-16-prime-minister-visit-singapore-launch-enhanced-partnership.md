Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will travel to Singapore on Friday 17 May to launch the New Zealand-Singapore Enhanced Partnership and meet Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Halimah Yacob.

“We have a close and collaborative relationship based on shared history and interests. I am pleased to be visiting Singapore to launch the Enhanced Partnership alongside Prime Minister Lee and celebrate this significant achievement,” said Jacinda Ardern.

“Extending trade opportunities is a central plank of the Government’s agenda. This is one of our most long-standing economic relationships and this upgrade is very important.

The Enhanced Partnership focuses on increased cooperation across four areas: trade and economic; people-to-people, defence and security, and science, technology and innovation.

Singapore is New Zealand’s seventh largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth $5.2 billion last year. New Zealand has more free trade agreements with Singapore than any other partner

The two countries also enjoy warm people-to-people ties, including through arts and culture, education and tourism.              

“This upgrade is more than just economic, it signals strong ties across people-to-people and government as well,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“As small advanced economies, we have always shared common views on the importance of stability and prosperity in the region. I look forward to discussing this further with Prime Minister Lee and President Yacob.”

The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Minister Damien O’Connor.

This is Prime Minister Ardern’s first bilateral visit to Singapore. She last met Prime Minister Lee at the East Asia Summit that Singapore hosted in November last year.
