The Crown has apologised to Ngāti Hinerangi and signed a Deed of Settlement for historic Treaty breaches, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little announced today.

“The significant signing ceremony today at Te Ōhākī Marae in Ōkauia, Matamata, completes the end of substantive negotiations and helps build a better future for the iwi and next generations.

“The Crown unreservedly apologises to the hapū and whānau of Ngāti Hinerangi for failing to uphold its obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

“Ngati Hinerangi’s claims relate to conflict with the Crown in Tauranga. Crown acts of land purchasing left the iwi virtually landless and this contributed to economic and social marginalisation and loss of traditional tribunal structures and knowledge.

“The settlement includes:

- Total financial redress of $8.1 million
- Cultural revitalisation payment of $200,000
- Marae rebuild of $20,000
- Co-governance arrangement over the upper Waihou and Piako river catchments
- Vesting of 14 cultural redress properties which includes part of Wairere Falls (Wairere Falls Scenic Reserve) which is considered a sacred awa to Ngāti Hinerangi.

“It is not possible to fully compensate Ngāti Hinerangi for the loss and prejudice they have suffered.  We cannot build the foundations for a positive relationship and begin to move forward if we do not acknowledge what has happened in the past.

“I look forward to welcoming the Ngāti Hinerangi to Parliament to complete the process when the Bill is introduced,” said Andrew Little.
