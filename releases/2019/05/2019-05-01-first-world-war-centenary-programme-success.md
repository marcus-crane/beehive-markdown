Almost all New Zealanders engaged with the First World War Centenary Programme (WW100), according to a new report released today by Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Grant Robertson.

The WW100 Final Report includes the findings from three national surveys conducted by Colmar Brunton, on behalf of the WW100 Programme Office, in 2012, 2016 and 2018.

The surveys looked at New Zealanders’ attitudes towards, and engagement with the centenary programme, as well as their knowledge of the First World War.

They found New Zealanders’ understanding of the First World War increased over the centenary period.

“The results show 93 percent of New Zealanders aged 15 and over engaged with the five-year centenary programme in some way.

 “At a time when conflict remains a reality internationally, it’s all the more important that we reflect on the past.

“Our history can help give us the context to understand the events of today and navigate the future,” Grant Robertson said.

“The huge involvement by the general public is also testament to the work of organisations and communities everywhere who organised the more than 1,100 events and activities that were listed on the WW100 website as part of the centenary,” Grant Robertson said.

The WW100 Final Report and the reports from the three Colmar Brunton surveys are available on the WW100 website [here](https://ww100.govt.nz/final-report).
