The Associate Minister of Justice, Aupito William Sio, has today announced the appointment of five Deputy Chairpersons to the Human Rights Review Tribunal to ensure that people have greater access to justice and that their voices are heard.

“This Government has acknowledged the unacceptable backlog of cases before the Human Rights Review Tribunal that developed under the previous National Government and we have taken action by establishing the Deputy Chairperson positions to help reduce the growing backlog,” says Aupito William Sio.

“The appointment of five Deputy Chairpersons will mean the Tribunal will now have the flexibility to provide certainty and reduce waiting times for people who have claims that have not been heard for a long time.

"The law changes this Government made will enable Deputy Chairpersons to share decision-making and decision-writing duties of the Tribunal.

“All of the five appointments have extensive litigation and public law experience and collectively bring together a strong set of skills to the Tribunal.

“The combined skill sets of the Deputy Chairs, in addition to the improvements we’ve made to the operational work of the Tribunal, gives me great confidence that we can improve the experience of people using the Tribunal, and make sure that justice is not denied to them by a lack of judicial resources.

The Human Rights Review Tribunal hears claims relating to breaches of the Human Rights Act 1993, Privacy Act 1993 and the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994. Claims could relate to discrimination, sexual harassment, racial harassment, the privacy principles, and the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights.

The Tribunal is an independent judicial body which is administered by the Ministry of Justice, and is separate from the Human Rights Commission, Privacy Commissioner, and Health and Disability Commissioner.

The Tribunal’s Chairpersons are Rodger Haines QC and Martha Roche.

“Previously, the Chairpersons were required to preside at all Human Rights Review Tribunal sittings and had all the responsibility for writing decisions.

"I would like to thank Mr Haines in particular for his commitment to improving the Tribunal,” says Aupito William Sio.
