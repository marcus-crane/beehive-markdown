The Minister of Māori Development, Hon Nanaia Mahuta  today congratulated Waitohiariki Quayle who has been elected as the new Māori Bishop for Te Hui Amorangi o Te Upoko o Te Ika.

“Waitohiariki Quayle is the first Māori woman to be ordained as an Anglican Bishop and this is a significant milestone in the history of Aotearoa New Zealand. 

“This is a huge recognition for many years of her service in the Anglican Church and a positive signal for all Māori women who serve the church,” said Hon Nanaia Mahuta. 

Waitohiariki Quayle belongs to Ngāti Kahungunu ki  Wairarapa. She is also the first NZ born woman to be ordained as a Bishop, as all previous women have been from overseas.  

“I alongside the other wahine Māori members of our Government caucus acknowledge the leadership, service and experience that Bishop Quayle will bring to her new responsibilities, “ said Nanaia Mahuta.  

“No reira e te mareikura o te Haahi Mihingare, ka ruia a mātou iti ki tō rahi kia toopu ai hei rourou mōu.”
