Health Minister David Clark is asking New Zealanders to think of how they’ve benefited from or seen the work of those who freely share their time, energy, and compassion to help improve the health and wellbeing of others.

Nominations open today for the 2019 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards.

“Great work goes on every day by tens of thousands of volunteers across our health services, including hospitals, hospices and non-governmental organisations, from volunteer first responders through to cancer supporters,” David Clark says.

“Volunteering benefits patients and anyone using health services, and supports New Zealand’s wellbeing as a whole. Whether it’s helping someone get to their medical appointment, fundraising for resources to help make the patient experience more comfortable, or providing friendship for people who need it, volunteering can make such a big difference.

“Volunteering also improves equity in our health system by helping personalise services and making them easier to access.

“These people deserve our gratitude each and every day, but over the coming weeks we have the chance to offer special recognition of their generosity.

“If you know an individual or team of volunteers who deserve to be recognised, I encourage you to nominate them.

“These awards are one way we can thank people who give up their time to make life better for others, while showcasing the many great initiatives that are making a real difference,” David Clark says.

Nominations close on 29 May 2019. The Awards will be presented during National Volunteer Week, 16 – 22 June.
