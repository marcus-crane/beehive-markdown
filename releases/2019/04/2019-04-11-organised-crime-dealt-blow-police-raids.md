Police have today dealt a major blow to the Comanchero gang with the arrest of senior gang leaders and seizure of nearly four million dollars of assets.

Police Minister Stuart Nash says a clear signal has been sent by the decision to target both gang leadership and professionals who have allegedly assisted them. A lawyer and an accountant are charged with money laundering through businesses and trusts.

“Organised crime exists because of both criminal offending and what used to be known as white collar offending. Crimes related to drugs, violence, firearms, and financial transactions are linked by a desire for profit. They cause immeasurable harm.

“This is a serious organised crime group who are alleged to have made millions through the importation and distribution of illicit drugs.

“The Comanchero gang are relative newcomers here and Police have acted swiftly to strip this gang of assets and the ability to cause inevitable further harm.   

“Behind the flashy cars and lifestyle they show on social media is a trail of economic, social and physical damage in our communities. It is abhorrent to seek to profit from the importation of drugs, addiction and harm to others.

“The identification of professionals, who allegedly helped launder the gang’s profits, is concerning, and today’s operation should make the consequences clear to any others who are facilitating this type of offending.”

“Police efforts today reflect the Government’s commitment to go hard on organised crime. Our unprecedented investment supports the deployment of 720 extra Police officers to continue to disrupt, deter and dismantle organised criminal networks and reduce harm in our communities.

“The deployment of these extra staff over the coming years will help Police continue to dismantle these gangs and prevent further harm.”
