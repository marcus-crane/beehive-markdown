Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Winston Peters has welcomed law changes prohibiting certain semi-automatic weapons, magazines and parts in New Zealand, and announced that the new restrictions on these items will also extend to most exports.

“From 12 April the criteria for the export of strategic goods will change” Mr Peters said.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is responsible for New Zealand’s export control regime for weapons, is likely to decline permits for the export of prohibited semi-automatic firearms, magazines and parts except in certain limited circumstances.

“It will also no longer be permissible for weapons that are banned here to be imported for the purpose of re-export.

“MFAT will consider applications for exports by people who are permitted to possess such items under the new legislation. This includes dealers, collectors and approved cullers.

“Approval is not automatic, and applications will be considered against the assessment criteria, which include the risk that the exported item could be used in human rights abuses, undermine peace and security, or be prejudicial to New Zealand’s international relations.

“There will be transitional arrangements to align with the new legislation, including for dealers seeking to return stock to suppliers, items that are stuck at the border because they are now prohibited, personal transfers by people leaving the country, and certain items traded by existing manufacturers and suppliers.

“These changes are essential to ensure that weapons that are prohibited in New Zealand are not exported to other countries where they would pose a similar risk,” Mr Peters said.
