The Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter announced today that the Government has committed to building a separated walking and cycling path along the new highway to replace the Manawatū Gorge.

The NZ Transport Agency has confirmed the decision today at a hearing on the Notice of Requirement for the new highway.

“The community made their voice heard through a huge number of submissions and the Government has listened,” said Julie Anne Genter.

“A safe, separated path will support the growth of cycle tourism in the region and provide opportunities for both recreational and commuter cyclists.

“The separated path will be an enhancement to the Transport Agency’s original commitment to a two-metre-wide shoulder.

“There is still considerable work to do to determine what the path will look like and its precise location. The Transport Agency will progress this as quickly as we can to give the community certainty.”

“The Transport Agency’s intention is for the path to complement and expand the existing walking and cycling network within the Manawatū Gorge scenic reserve. 

“The Transport Agency will also bring forward the construction of a walking and cycling facility at the existing Ashhurst bridge to next year, and we will provide a new walking and cycling connection from the Ashhurst Bridge to the Manawatū Gorge Scenic Reserve carpark,” said Julie Anne Genter.

The Transport Agency is this week making final submissions to the panel of commissioners for the Notice of Requirement, which is seeking to designate a corridor for the highway to replace the old State Highway 3 through the Manawatū Gorge which was closed in April 2017.
