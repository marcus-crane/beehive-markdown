The Government is investing a further $2.3 million in the Great Rides, which draw visitors to our regions, boosting local economies and the tourism sector, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

Government funding of $1.3 million will create an extra 34.5 km of new cycle ways on the Hawke’s Bay Trails Great Ride, adding to the over 200 km of largely off-road flat trails.

“Getting out on the bike is a great way to experience New Zealand and the 22 Great Rides of Ngā Haerenga, New Zealand Cycle Trail showcase the best of our country, providing over one million people every year with an experience they don’t forget,” Kelvin Davis said.

“The Great Rides are particularly important to our regions. This investment will lead to a significant extension to the Hawke’s Bay Trails and we expect it to contribute to a four per cent increase in users by 2023.”

An additional $1 million has also been approved to make urgent safety repairs on the Alps 2 Ocean trail, following severe flooding on the track, and other track enhancements across seven trails.

“The cycle trails encourage international visitors and Kiwis to explore outside of the main centres and boost our local economies. We need to make sure we look after them.

“Ongoing investment to enhance and maintain the Great Rides means we’ll keep these world class trails for generations to come,” Kelvin Davis said.
