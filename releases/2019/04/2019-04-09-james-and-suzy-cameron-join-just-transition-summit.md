Filmmakers and environmental advocates James and Suzy Cameron have been confirmed as keynote speakers for the inaugural National Just Transition Summit, Minister of Energy and Resources Megan Woods has announced.

The Just Transition Summit is an opportunity to get involved in shaping New Zealand’s pathway to a low emissions future. The Summit will bring youth, Māori, workers, businesses, communities and local and central government together to kick-start a national conversation about what a just transition to a low emissions economy could look like for New Zealand.

“We have got an exciting programme for this first Just Transition Summit and I am pleased to be able to announce James and Suzy Cameron as two of our speakers,” Woods says.

“James and Suzy will be co-presenting a keynote address and join an impressive list of people with a range of backgrounds and perspectives to look at how we achieve a just transition to a low emissions economy.

“The Summit will include information on global and local responses to the emissions challenge, the role technology and innovation has to play in this work and the implications for businesses and workers, among other issues.”

James and Suzy Cameron will discuss how New Zealand can maximise the opportunities of symbolic global leadership, and ensure that it has an economy that is future-proofed for 2050 and beyond. With a particular interest in sustainable agriculture and land use they will share their perspectives on global agriculture trends and emissions reductions and where they see opportunities and challenges for New Zealand. 

“This is an incredibly important forum for mapping out how we achieve a fair and prosperous future for coming generations, and we are delighted to be joining this discussion,” James Cameron says.

“We are going to need to start planning and doing things differently in small and large ways and the sooner we start working together across society to do this, the better. We need to actively meet the economic, social and environmental challenges we face head on and in a unified way.”

The Summit is being co-hosted by the New Plymouth District Council, and Mayor Neil Holdom says Taranaki is at the forefront of the Just Transition in New Zealand.

“When we talk about a Just Transition, we’re discussing a fundamental change in the way we power our economy, not seen in New Zealand since the Think Big era of the early 1980s,” Mayor Holdom says.  

“Taranaki is the perfect region to lead from the front, given our decades of history with the energy sector and the knowledge, skills and expertise we’ve developed. It’s a good opportunity to showcase the work we’ve already got underway through our economic development strategy Tapuae Roa and the subsequent focus on retention of high value employment and wealth creation opportunities within our District.”
