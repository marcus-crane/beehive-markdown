Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi today announced the appointments of Anna Rawlings as the new Chair of the Commerce Commission, and Joseph Liava’a as an associate member.

Ms Rawlings takes over from Dr Mark Berry, who will step down after two terms at the end of May 2019.

“Anna Rawlings brings expertise and experience, having served as a member of the Commission since 2014. She has played a key role in the Commission’s Commerce and Consumer divisions and has frequently led the Commission’s work on consumer matters.

“I also want to thank Dr Berry for his considerable contribution to the Commission. He was first appointed Chair in 2009, and has consistently shared his technical expertise in the Commission’s work and demonstrated strong leadership.”

New associate member Joseph Liava’a is a past member of the Consumer New Zealand Board, and has held a number of consumer law related roles in Government and agencies, as well as serving on several community boards and panels.

“Mr Liava’a is highly respected for his consumer sector work,” Mr Faafoi says. “His wide experience working with vulnerable communities has given him in-depth insight on consumer issues, and this will be valuable for the Commission.”

Both Ms Rawlings and Mr Liava’a have been appointed for three-year terms.
