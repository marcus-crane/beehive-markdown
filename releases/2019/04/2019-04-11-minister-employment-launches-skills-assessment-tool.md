A new skills assessment tool looking at innovative ways to identify talent and bridge the gap between job seekers and employers was launched today by Employment Minister Willie Jackson.

“In a constantly evolving labour market and at a time of critical skills and talent shortages across a range of industries, finding the perfect candidate for a job can be a complex and onerous task for employers”, Willie Jackson said.

The Skills Assessment Tool is a world-first initiative launched with Trade Me Jobs, the Ministry of Social Development and Joy Business Academy. The Skills Assessment combines online job-hunting and gamified learning to simplify the process and enable employers to benchmark skills and personality attributes, while helping Job seekers to identify their strengths and define career choices.

“This Skills Assessment provides an alternative to CVs which is the current norm, and prioritises personality and skills over IQ or experience. These results allow employers to dive much deeper into a candidates core attributes, so that they can make good recruitment choices.

“I want to acknowledge the three partners, Trade Me, Ministry of Social Development and Joy Business Academy for coming together to create an innovative approach to matching employers and employees”, Willie Jackson said.
