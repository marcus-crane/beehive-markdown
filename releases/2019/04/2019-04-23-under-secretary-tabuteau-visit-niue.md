Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau will travel to Niue this week, 23 to 27 April.

Mr Tabuteau will open the new New Zealand High Commission, which replaces the building constructed around 70 years ago.  

“The new High Commission reinforces New Zealand’s continued commitment to its presence in Niue, and highlights the strength of our special and enduring relationship,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

While in Niue, Mr Tabuteau will hold talks with the Government of Niue, attend ANZAC Day commemorations, and meet regional education leaders, business representatives, and local stakeholders.

“I am looking forward to discussing with the Government of Niue a broad range of mutual interests, and further building our partnership”, Mr Tabuteau said.
