Two new funds designed to get more young women physically active through recreation and sport launch today.

Sport New Zealand is investing $1 million across the Young Women’s Activation Fund and the Innovations for Young Women Fund. Initiatives that specifically target young women aged 12 to 18 will be eligible.

The funds are a direct result of the Women and Girls in Sport and Active Recreation Strategy launched by the Government in October last year.

“The strategy recognised there were clear inequalities for women and girls when it came to participation and their wider involvement and visibility within sport and active recreation.

“I’m thrilled to see Sport New Zealand delivering on its commitments to the strategy and enabling new opportunities for young women in two of our priority areas – participation and leadership,” Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson said.

Sport New Zealand will invest $3 million in total over the next three years to support initiatives and activities that help achieve the strategy’s goals.
