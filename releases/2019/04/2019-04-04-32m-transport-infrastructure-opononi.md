A $3.2m project to rebuild the Opononi seawall and improve the resilience of State Highway 12 in Northland will be welcomed by locals, says Associate Transport Minister Shane Jones.

Minister Jones was in Opononi this morning for a dawn blessing of the work site given by kaumatua from Te Pouka and Ngati Wharara.

“Intervention is required now as shoreline erosion is affecting areas of the highway, and existing protection measures are no longer fit for purpose. This is an important route for the local community because it’s the only coastal road connection between businesses and schools in the towns of Opononi and Omapere,” Shane Jones said.

“Rock revetment works on the Opononi shoreline will present a more uniform and consistent foreshore, to help minimise the effects of scouring and erosion.

“With winter closing in, and considering the severe weather events Northland experienced last year, it’s the right time to get this work underway,” Shane Jones said.
