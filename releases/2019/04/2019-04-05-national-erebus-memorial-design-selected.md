A design that includes a walkway projecting outward to the horizon has been selected for the new National Erebus Memorial after recommendation by a Design Selection Panel, announced Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“I’m pleased to announce the design *Te Paerangi Ataata - Sky Song*, by Wellington firm Studio Pacific Architecture jointly with designer and artist Jason O’Hara and musician Warren Maxwell, has been selected,” Jacinda Ardern said.

 “The design reflects the enormity of the tragedy and provides a strong sense of connection and loss. The design has a strong narrative to engage visitors and provides a sanctuary within its walls, evoking the great emptiness experienced for those who lost their lives.

 “As the memorial is created, some 257 stainless steel snowflakes will be cut out and given to the families, connecting them to the site and providing a symbolic keepsake that can be passed on to others.  

“The design was chosen after feedback from family members of those who died, those who worked on the recovery operation and in consultation with Auckland Council.

 “My sincere thanks to everyone involved in the process to select the design; we had some fantastic submissions. Planning for the memorial’s construction can now begin with the unveiling timed for May 2020,” Jacinda Ardern said.

 Mayor Phil Goff welcomed the progress being made on building the memorial and said it was long overdue.

 “With Flight 901 having left from Auckland and many of those on board residents from our city, it is appropriate for the memorial to be built here.

 “It has been important to work with the families of the Erebus victims and wherever possible take on board their wishes.

 “The memorial in Dove-Myer Robinson Park, overlooking the Waitematā, is in a beautiful setting, which I hope will provide comfort and solace to those who lost family and friends on Erebus,” Phil Goff said. 

The design team at Studio Pacific Architecture are honoured to contribute to the making of this special place of remembrance for those who lost their lives.

 “It is a privilege for us to contribute towards a memorial experience that captures their adventurous spirit,” Studio Pacific Architecture founding director Nick Barratt-Boyes said.
