Details of His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge’s itinerary for his upcoming visit to New Zealand on 25th and 26th April have been released today by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

The Duke’s first engagements will be in Auckland on the 25th. Then, His Royal Highness and the Prime Minister will travel to Christchurch where the remainder of his programme will take place. The Duke will meet with survivors of the March 15th terror attacks and their families, as well as first responders and the wider Muslim community.

“The Duke has a close connection with New Zealand and in particular Christchurch. His visit provides the opportunity to pay tribute to those affected by the mosque terrorist attacks and show support to the local and national community,”Jacinda Ardern said.

“We welcome this visit by His Royal Highness and know it will bring comfort to those affected.”
