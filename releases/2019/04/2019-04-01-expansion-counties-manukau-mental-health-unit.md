Health Minister Dr David Clark says work will begin this month on doubling the capacity of Tiaho Mai, the acute adult inpatient mental health facility at Counties Manukau DHB.

“The expansion of Tiaho Mai is critical given the growing demand to support the mental health needs and wellbeing of people in Auckland.

“Stage Two of the project, which will double the number of beds at Tiaho Mai, had to be re-tendered after Ebert Construction went into receivership. This resulted in delays to the project and additional funding was required.

“The Government has approved an additional $10.5 million, taking the overall budget of the project up to $67.5 million.

 “Last month Counties Manukau DHB awarded the contract for the expansion of Tiaho Mai to Hawkins 2017 Ltd. Construction is expected to begin later this month, and is due to be completed in mid 2020.

“Tiaho Mai will then have the capacity to accommodate 76 patients. The new area will also include a large therapy courtyard with dedicated therapy rooms which will be part of pathway out of the unit and into the community.

“When I opened Stage One of Tiaho Mai in November, it was encouraging to see large communal spaces with open courtyards. The design of this facility is a great example of how to create purpose built facilities which make a real difference to patients and staff.

“Delivering new facilities is just part of the Government’s commitment to addressing mental health and wellbeing. We know that there are mental health challenges which affect particular communities, and that these are unjust and preventable.

“We will shortly be responding to He Ara Oranga - the report of the Government Inquiry into Mental Health and Addiction, which will put people at the centre of our approach to intervene early and support wellbeing.”
