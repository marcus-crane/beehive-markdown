Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters is travelling to Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland over the next week.

The visit is part of a renewed diplomatic effort with Nordic countries, and follows the opening of the New Zealand Embassy in Stockholm last year.

“This approach is both deliberate and targeted. New Zealand needs to be well positioned in a changing European landscape, particularly post-Brexit. It is important to maintain bonds with countries which share our values for rules-based international order, and there is much we can learn from these countries,” said Mr Peters.

Mr Peters will hold talks with Foreign Minister counterparts in each country to discuss a range of geo-political issues, areas of mutual cooperation, and trade opportunities. He will be the first New Zealand Foreign Minister to make an official visit to Iceland.

As part of his programme, the Minister will deliver speeches in Oslo and Copenhagen to international affairs institutes. The Minister will also lay a wreath at the Norwegian Memorial for the 2011 terrorist attack.

Mr Peters will be travelling from 21-28 April.
