Health Minister Dr David Clark says construction is now underway on a new endoscopy facility at Whangarei Hospital.

Design work is also progressing on a new cardiac catheter laboratory and two additional theatres. The budget for the three projects at Northland DHB is $24 million, funded out of the $750 million investment in health infrastructure in Budget 2018. 

“Improving the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders is a key priority for this Government. Increasing access to quality health services delivered in purpose built modern facilities is a key part of this,” Dr Clark says.

“These projects will make a real difference to patients and their families, as well as staff. They will address immediate capacity and service issues, and will improve some of Northland DHB’s poorer health outcomes. Improving equity and patient outcomes is important given Northland’s high health needs population.”

Argon Construction started construction on the new endoscopy facility late last month. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

“Currently the endoscopy service operates from two separate locations. The new unit will bring the service together, providing a more streamlined, cohesive service for acute and planned endoscopy procedures. The new location will also enable better access for outpatients and allow easy transfer of patients to the inpatient wards. 

“More significantly, the new service will also enable the DHB to fully implement the National Bowel Screening programme. 

“It is also encouraging to know that design work for the cardiac catheter laboratory is well underway. Construction is due to start in early 2020, with the service expected to be operational in early 2021.

“This new service will help to improve cardiac health outcomes, and ensure better equity of access for the people of Northland.

“Work is also progressing on two additional theatres which will help to meet short term capacity demands, and assist the DHB to meet acute and planned care surgeries.

“The new theatres will be built in a new building attached to the current theatre suites. The final design stage is now underway. Construction is due to start late 2019 and is expected to be completed in 12 months.”
