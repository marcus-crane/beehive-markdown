Minister for Trade and Export Growth David Parker will lead a delegation of business representatives to China next week to advance the economic relationship between China and New Zealand. 

“China-New Zealand trade continues to grow, and is now valued at over $30 billion,” David Parker said. “New Zealand’s trade relationship with China is important and I am pleased to be leading a trade delegation and supporting New Zealand businesses with interests in China.”  

The visit will build on the success of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s inaugural state visit to Beijing earlier this month. David Parker and the business delegation will spend time in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, which has a GDP the size of Australia’s and is the largest source of visitors to New Zealand, before travelling on to Beijing. 

In Beijing David Parker will attend the Belt and Road Forum, hosted by President Xi Jinping. 

“We look forward to identifying opportunities for mutually beneficial and transparent cooperation between our two countries,” David Parker said. 

He will also meet senior Chinese political and business leaders to discuss upgrading the China-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement and increasing cooperation between New Zealand and China to strengthen the rules-based trading system, including the World Trade Organization.  

David Parker leaves for China on 22 April and returns on 27 April.
