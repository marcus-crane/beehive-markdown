Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Associate Minister of Health Julie Anne Genter have congratulated PlunketLine on its  25th anniversary.

PlunketLine, which launched in 1994 as an after-hours service, now operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It took its 1 millionth call in 2009 and its 2 millionth call in 2018.

“We offer our very sincere thanks to PlunketLine for the important work it does for families across New Zealand,” Jacinda Ardern said.  

Julie Anne Genter says “I’m a new mum. My baby is now 7 1/2 months old, and I’m constantly amazed at how fast he grows and changes.  During this time, I’ve known that if my partner or I had needed its advice, PlunketLine would be there for us as it is for other New Zealand families.”

“I love the fact that 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year, PlunketLine is free to ring from any phone – mobile or landline – in New Zealand, and it’s open to anyone. It’s a simply fantastic service.

“Like the Prime Minister, I’m personally committed to continuing the Government’s work to make New Zealand the best place in the world to be a child.

“We will ensure that the very youngest citizens of Aotearoa New Zealand, and the people who care for them, are well supported. PlunketLine is part of that wraparound support.

“Happy birthday PlunketLine!  Ngā mihi nui i tō rā whānau!”
