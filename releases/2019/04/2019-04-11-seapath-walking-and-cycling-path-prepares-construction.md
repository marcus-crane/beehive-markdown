Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter says the SeaPath walking and cycling project on Auckland’s North Shore has reached a significant milestone towards construction.

The NZ Transport Agency Board has approved the business case for SeaPath, which confirms the planned route, and the project will now move into the pre-implementation and consenting stage.

“This is another big step in developing the strategic walking and cycling network for the North Shore and Auckland,” says Julie Anne Genter.

“The project will deliver on this Government’s commitment to give people more safe and active options for travelling about our city.

“More people walking and cycling is not only good for our health and the health of the environment, it also means fewer cars on the road and less congestion.”

SeaPath will run along the landward side of the northern motorway between Northcote Point and Esmonde Road, providing safe and direct connections to local communities, destinations and recreational areas on the lower North Shore.

When complete, SeaPath will form a critical link in Auckland’s strategic cycling network and connect with the planned shared path over the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

Initial consultation took place in 2016, with more than 2600 people providing feedback, and over 95% support for the walking and cycling link. Further consultation is planned for the design and consenting phases.

Pre-implementation work, including the consenting, property and design phases, is expected to take until late 2020. Construction funding is expected to be confirmed in 2021.

The Transport Agency is investing $390 million in walking and cycling in 2018/21 through the National Land Transport Programme (NLTP). This is a $96 million increase on the previous three years.

$260 million of the funding is going to cycling and walking facilities in our three main cities – Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch – where it can have the greatest impact on congestion by making it safer and easier to get around on foot and by bike.

“Together, we are creating safer, healthier, and more accessible cities where people of all ages and abilities can choose to bike every day,” says Julie Anne Genter.
