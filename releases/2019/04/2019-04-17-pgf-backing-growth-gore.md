The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) is helping young people into jobs and supporting economic growth in Southland, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones announced today.

“The Gore community has told us they wanted to showcase their local history, develop tourism opportunities, and provide more intensive support for at-risk rangatahi. We’ve heard this and are proud to come to the table to support these projects through the PGF,” Shane Jones said.

“Today’s announcements are a $1.6 million investment towards the Maruawai precinct project, which involves the redevelopment of the Hokonui Moonshine Museum and creation of the Maruawai Heritage Centre. We’ve also approved $2.1 million for the Hokonui Huanui programme to provide wrap-around support services for children and rangatahi.

“Our investment in the Maruawai precinct project will lure more visitors to Gore as they travel around the lower South Island to places such as Queenstown and Dunedin. What’s more, the Provincial Growth Fund will also prepare local young people for the jobs that these tourism opportunities will create through the Hokonui Huanui programme.

“We will also invest to support local young people to take up jobs that will be created from a growing Southland economy. Our investment in the Hokonui Huanui project will help to change the lives of rangatahi who are at risk of long-term unemployment.

“When I was in Gore a year ago I laid down the challenge for the community to come together and put forward their most promising proposals to the Provincial Growth Fund.  The investments made today are an example of the community working with us to progress their priorities.

“We are proud to support these two projects which will create a solid foundation for future growth in the Gore district,” Shane Jones said.

**Notes to editors:**

Funding from the Provincial Growth Fund is approved in principle and announced, after which contracts are negotiated. Some funding may depend on completion of business cases. Payments are made once agreed milestones are met. These are set as part of contract negotiations, and differ from project to project.
