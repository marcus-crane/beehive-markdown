Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford today officially opened 23 new state homes designed for Auckland families in the high-demand area of Birkdale.

“These 18 two-bedroom and five four-bedroom warm, dry homes on Chippendale Crescent have been designed to meet the needs of families in the area,” Phil Twyford. “They are close to a number of schools, the Beach Haven ferry to Auckland CBD, and are 4km from the Glenfield Mall.

“There is a real demand for public housing for families in need in the Birkdale, and Auckland region.

“In the wider Kaipatiki Local Board area, the demand for housing has been on the rise for a number of years. Since December 2017, the number of families or individuals waiting for a state house has nearly doubled to about 150.

“Between this redevelopment, and two others on the same street, Housing NZ has better utilised this land and transformed 12 old state homes that were no longer fit for purpose into 40 new two, three and four-bedroom homes for families in need. This redevelopment project has helped to transform Birkdale into a thriving community for Auckland families of all different sizes and backgrounds,” he said.

Auckland currently has about 140 active construction sites as part of the Auckland Housing Programme.

“I look forward to opening more new state housing around the country this year as we move towards our target of 6,400 more public housing places over the next four years.” Phil Twyford said.
