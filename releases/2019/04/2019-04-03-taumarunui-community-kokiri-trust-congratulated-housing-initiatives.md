Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta today announced an investment of up to $2.1 million into the Whānau & Community Development Investment programme for Taumarunui and Te Kuiti.

This further investment into the trust will focus on improving housing quality and addressing the need for social housing.

“There is strong evidence that Taumarunui has a pool of housing that does not meet reasonable standards and are cold, damp and prone to black mould infestation,” says Minister Mahuta.

This investment will help to repair up to 20 homes, help develop and implement a home maintenance programme and support whanau into home ownership.

Minister Mahuta congratulated the Taumarunui Community Kōkiri Trust on their continued commitment to improving housing conditions in the region.

“However this is just not about bricks and mortar as warm, safe healthy homes are a right of all whānau. It is about building futures for communities and their rangatahi.

“The Community Kōkiri Trust has been a Whānau Ora service provider since 2011 and delivers comprehensive health and social support services. They became involved in the housing repairs programme after it became apparent that whānau health issues could be blamed on the poor quality of housing they are living in.

“These initiatives will strengthen whānau and communities, not only improving housing  but also providing opportunities to learn skills, offer employment opportunities, improve health  and income, build financial capability, retain value within local communities, and work towards creating intergenerational wellbeing.

“Together we need to design and enable innovative approaches to accelerate whānau, hapū and iwi development.

“When whānau lead their own development aspirations, a platform is created where they can drive and lead other developments in their community.

“If we can support all whānau to thrive, this will create a step-change for New Zealand,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

**Kua mihia ngā kaupapa kōkiri whare o te Taumarunui Community Kōkiri Trust**

Kua pānuitia e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta te haumi o te $2.1 miriona ki te kaupapa Haumi Whakawhanaketanga o te Whānau me te Hapori mō Taumarunui, Te Kuiti hoki.

Ko te tikanga o tēnei haumi anō kia taea ai e te rūnanga te arotahi ki te whakapiki i te kounga o ngā whare me te aro ki te hiahia kia nui ake ngā whare pāpori.

“He nui te taunakitanga mō te nui o ngā whare ki Taumarunui kāore i te eke ki te paerewa e tika ana, he makariri, he māku, kua muia hoki e te pōhekaheka pango,” te kī a Minita Mahuta.

Mā tēnei haumi e āwhina te whakapaipai i te āhua 20 kāinga, te whakawhanake, te whakatinana hoki i tētahi kaupapa whakatikatika whare, otirā, te tautoko i ngā whānau e hiahia ana ki te hoko whare.

I mihia te Taumaranui Community Kōkiri Trust e Minita Mahuta me tō rātou ngākaunui tonu ki te whakapiki i te āhua o te noho whare ki taua rohe.

“Heoi anō, ehara i te mea mō te pereki me te moata noa iho, i te mea nō ngā whānau katoa te motika kia mahana, kia haumaru, kia hauora hoki ngā kāinga. Mō te hanga ao o āpōpō te take, mā ngā hapori me ā rātou rangatahi.

“Mai i te tau 2011 he kaiwhakarato Whānau Ora te Community Kōkiri Trust e whakarato ana i ngā ratonga tautoko ā-hauora, ā-pāpori whānui. I whai wāhi atu rātou ki te kaupapa whakapaipai whare i muri i te kitenga e ahu mai ana ngā take hauora a ngā whānau i te pūtaitai o ngā whare e nohoia ana e rātou.

“Mā ēnei kaupapa kōkiri e whakapakari ngā whānau, ngā hapori, ehara i te mea he whakapiki i te pai o ngā whare anake te kaupapa, engari e whakarite ana hoki i ngā huarahi hei ako pūkenga, hei tuku ara mahi, whakapiki hauora, whiwhinga pūtea, whakapakari pūkenga pūtea, pupuri uara i roto i ngā hapori ā-rohe, me te whakapau kaha ki te waihanga i te oranga ka heke iho, ka heke iho ki ngā reanga.

“Me mahi ngātahi ki te hoahoa me te whakarite āhuatanga auaha ki te whakahohoro i te whanaketanga o ngā whānau, ngā hapū me ngā iwi.

“Kia taea rā anō e ngā whānau ō rātou ake tūmanako te ārahi, kua hangaia he ara e taea ai e rātou ētahi atu whanaketanga te whakahaere, te ārahi hoki ki tō rātou hapori.

"Ina taea ana e ngā whānau te momoho, te noho ora rawa atu e tīmata i tētahi panoni nui whakaharahara mā Aotearoa, kia tōnui, kia rangatira te ao o āpōpō mō te katoa," te kī a Nanaia Mahuta.
