Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has extended New Zealand’s condolences to the Government and people of Sri Lanka following multiple bombings there on Easter Sunday.

“New Zealand condemns all acts of terrorism, and our resolve has only been strengthened by the attack on our soil on the 15th of March. To see an attack in Sri Lanka while people were in churches and at hotels is devastating.

“New Zealand rejects all forms of extremism and stands for freedom of religion and the right to worship safely. Collectively we must find the will and the answers to end such violence.’’

Ms Ardern offers New Zealand’s sympathy and support to Sri Lanka at this difficult time.
