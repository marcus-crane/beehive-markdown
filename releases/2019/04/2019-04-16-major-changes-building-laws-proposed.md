The Government’s proposals on the biggest changes to New Zealand’s building laws since the Building Act was introduced in 2004, which aim to address long-standing challenges in the building sector, have been released for public consultation today by Minister for Building and Construction Jenny Salesa.

“These proposed reforms will deliver safer and more durable buildings, a high performing building sector, and better efficiency in our regulatory system. This also delivers on the Government’s commitments under the Construction Sector Accord, [announced just two days ago on 14 April](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-and-industry-sign-construction-sector-accord), to improve building regulatory systems,” says Jenny Salesa.

“We are consulting on proposals to: improve the regulation of building products and modern methods of construction including offsite manufacturing; strengthen occupational regulation; look at how risk and liability are managed; possibly reduce the building levy; and strengthen penalties for those who don’t comply with the law.

“I expect this reform to create a building sector where people understand their responsibilities and increase the number of skilled workers; where better quality means building it right first time and people are better protected if that doesn’t happen; and where people are accountable when things go wrong.

“A thriving, productive and sustainable building sector is vitally important for New Zealand’s economic and social success. A healthy building sector will increase the wellbeing of all New Zealanders, and deliver on the Government’s plan to ensure everyone has a warm, dry home.

“Clear and robust building laws are critical to enabling the building sector to reach its full potential.

“We need input and feedback from the public as well as people across the building and construction sector to help make sure the law works effectively for everyone. I encourage everyone to have their say,” says Jenny Salesa.
