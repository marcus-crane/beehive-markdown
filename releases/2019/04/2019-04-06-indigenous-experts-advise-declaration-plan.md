Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the delegation from the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) to Aotearoa. 

Last week Nanaia Mahuta announced that New Zealand will be taking a step forward on indigenous rights by leading a process to measure New Zealand’s progress towards the aspirations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 

EMRIP members have been invited to Aotearoa to provide advice on the development of that plan.  

“This is an exciting opportunity to hear from indigenous experts about how Aotearoa can be reflected in a Declaration plan, drawn from global models. 

The EMRIP members have been invited to New Zealand by the Aotearoa Independent Monitoring Mechanism for the Declaration and the Human Rights Commission and with the agreement of the New Zealand Government. 

“There are a range of policies and strategies already in place that are relevant to the Declaration, but there is no overall plan. EMRIP’s visit will help the Crown and Māori work together to create a plan to guide the implementation of the Declaration,” said Nanaia Mahuta.  

During their visit, EMRIP members will meet with various organisations, experts and the Government. They will also hold two community hui in Auckland and Wellington.  

“We are pleased to host these indigenous experts. Aotearoa is the third country to be visited by EMRIP, and this visit will show that we are genuinely committed to developing a national plan for the Declaration that meets New Zealand’s needs and aspirations.  

“We wish them the best for their time in Aotearoa and look forward to meeting and engaging with them,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
