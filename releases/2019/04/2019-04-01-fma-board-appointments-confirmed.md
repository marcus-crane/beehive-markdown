Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Kris Faafoi today confirmed Mark Todd as the new Chairman of the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), and Chris Swasbrook as an associate member. Mr Todd takes over from Murray Jack, whose term expires at the end of April 2019.

“I want to thank Murray for his contribution to the FMA since he was first appointed as a member in 2011 and his strong and steady leadership after he became chair in 2014,” Kris Faafoi says.

“Mark’s appointment will provide the FMA with continuity as he has been on the Board for the last three years playing a key role on the Audit and Risk Committee. His experience will be highly useful for the FMA’s work across the financial sector.”

New associate member Chris Swasbrook has a strong understanding of international and New Zealand capital markets and the broader industry.

Mr Swasbrook is currently Managing Director of Elevation Capital Management Limited and a member of the NZX Listing Sub-Committee and NZ Markets Disciplinary Tribunal. His extensive experience working in capital markets has given him in-depth insight on market issues, combined with strong technical knowledge.

Mr Swasbrook will become a full member of the FMA Board from June 2019 as another member steps down. Both Mr Todd and Mr Swasbrook have been appointed for five-year terms.
