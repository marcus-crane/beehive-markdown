Five Māori scholars have been awarded the Ngārimu VC and the 28th (Māori) Battalion tertiary scholarship in recognition of their outstanding achievements, Associate Minister of Education and Ngārimu Board Chair Kelvin Davis announced today.

The undergraduate, Masters, and Doctoral scholarships commemorate Victoria Cross winner Second Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu and members of the 28th (Māori) Battalion, who served on the battlefields of Greece, Crete, North Africa, and Italy between 1941 and 1945.

"Today we honour the past, and celebrate the future. The five scholarship recipients represent the ethos of Ngārimu and the 28th (Māori) Battalion,” Kelvin Davis said.

“They are our leaders of tomorrow, possess excellence in education, as well as determination, leadership, and commitment to their communities.”

This year’s Doctoral recipient is Kahurangi Waititi (Te Whānau ā Apanui, Ngāti Porou and Ngāi Tahu) who is completing her PHD in Māori Media and Communications at Waikato University.

Brandon Manuel (Ngāti Porou, Te Arawa and Ngāti Ranginui) is this year’s Masters recipient. He is currently studying at Canterbury University towards a Masters of Education.

The three undergraduate scholarship recipients are Te Waikapoata Tamati (Te Atiawa, Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Ruanui, Ngāi Tahu and Te Whānau ā Apanui) who is studying towards a Bachelor of Dental Surgery at Otago University; Tekiteora Rolleston-Gabel (Tūhoe, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngāti Awa), who is studying towards a Bachelor of Science at Waikato University; and Tamahou Thoms ( Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Kahungunu-ki-Waiarapa and Ngāti Toarangatira) who is studying towards a Bachelor of Arts at Canterbury University.

“I congratulate them all and look forward to hearing about their future success, as has been the pathway of past recipients,” Kelvin Davis said.
