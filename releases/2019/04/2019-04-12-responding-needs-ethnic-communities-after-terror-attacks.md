The Government has announced a range of urgent measures to support ethnic communities affected by the 15 March terror attacks, says Minister for Ethnic Communities Jenny Salesa.

“The Ethnic Communities Development Fund, which supports initiatives that aim to improve New Zealand’s social cohesion and development of our ethnic communities, will receive an immediate uplift of $1 million,” says Jenny Salesa.

“The Fund is now open to new applications. It will remain open until the total amount available has been allocated. It will give affected communities the power to develop and lead their own projects alongside other Government initiatives.

“The Office of Ethnic Communities, as conduit between the Government and ethnically diverse communities, will also receive funding for additional staff to provide better on the ground culturally appropriate support to victims and families in Christchurch.

“In addition, I will co-host a series of meetings across the country with key Muslim leaders. This will be a national conversation involving Imams, Muslim women and Muslim youth. It is important for me to ensure our Muslim communities are involved and engaged in shaping the response to the terror attacks and the recovery process.

“These conversations will be complemented by a series of interfaith dialogues that will bring together leaders from different faiths to discuss how we can work collectively to support an inclusive society.

“The Office of Ethnic Communities is currently working on co-ordinating these meetings and further details, including dates, will be announced in the next few weeks.

“These measures will help us in creating a New Zealand we can all be proud of; and as a Government we are committed to providing certainty and ongoing support to ethnically diverse communities, including Muslim communities, in the wake of the attacks.”

**Notes**

The immediate addition of $1 million to the Ethnic Communities Development Fund is a one-off funding round as part of the Government’s response to the recent terror attacks in Christchurch.

While the same application criteria remain in place, priority will be given to projects that:

- respond to affected communities – particularly in Christchurch
- bring communities together to promote inclusion, safety, and community harmony
- encourage interaction between different communities
- build capability within ethnic communities

The funding round is now open. There is no closing date. It will remain open until the total amount available has been allocated. Funding is applicable to projects started on or after 15 March 2019.
