New survey research, released today, shows farmers are focused on sustainability and the impacts of climate change more than ever.

The survey, by Nielsen Research, was commissioned by the Ministry for Primary Industries through the Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change Research programme.

“These latest results show that 92 percent of farmers are focused on making their farm more environmentally sustainable, up from 78 percent in the last survey of 2009. That’s really heartening”, says Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor.

“Some of the specific actions farmers mentioned were riparian/shelter planting, waterway control, improved fertiliser management and more efficient irrigation systems. This gives us a really valuable understanding of what is front of mind for farmers.

“Slightly disheartening is that only 23 percent of farmers anticipate an increased focus on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in the next five years, so that’s something for us all to work on.’’

Minister for Climate Change James Shaw says that the results of the survey are consistent with expectations.

“The survey shows that farmers have a better understanding of what they are able to do on-farm to be more environmentally sustainable, with the exception of greenhouse gas emissions reduction – an area where we know farmers feel they need more information and advice.

“The Biological Emissions Reference Group (BERG) report told us that there are lots of solutions emerging, but that the situation varies from farm-to-farm and so solutions need to be tailored.

“That’s why we are now investing in developing that advice and integrated farm planning tools. We need to support farmers and growers to transition to sustainable land-use through planning and informed decision-making.

“Last year the government consulted on the Zero Carbon Bill, which showed the need to give certainty and direction on the pathway to a low-emissions economy. We will also soon receive the recommendations of the Interim Climate Change Committee on addressing agricultural emissions. This will help us move forward and provide the certainty that will enable rural communities to make long-term decisions,” Minister Shaw says.

Minister O’Connor says farmers face a changing climate.

“They need to prepare to cope with the intensifying weather effects of climate change and at the same time reduce their environmental footprint – that takes investment in infrastructure, and means you need to be financially viable.

“The Coalition Government is scoping the development of resources and information for farmers to fill the knowledge gap in ways to reduce emissions, working with the sector to develop practical on-farm knowledge.”

**Key statistics**

92% focus on making their farms more environmentally sustainable. Specific actions mentioned show an increase, notably riparian/shelter planting, waterway control, improved fertiliser management and more efficient irrigation systems (up from 78% in 2009).

63% of farmers express interest in further information or advice about improving resilience to climate change. Managing severe weather events such as droughts, floods, and harsh winters is most commonly mentioned.

Half of farmers think their farm and business is moderately or majorly impacted by current climate or severe weather patterns – this has not changed since 2009 (52% vs 51%). But the proportion of farmers reporting no impact at all has halved, from 19% to 10%.

59% anticipate a moderate or major impact over the next 20 years.

46% saying that clear government policy guidelines will help them take action.

27% of farmers have placed a moderate or major focus on reducing their GHG emissions in the past 5 years (compared with 31% doing so in 2009).   

46% of farmers have actively sought information about land management practices or climate change issues in the last 12 months than in 2009 (down from 62%).  

58% said financial assistance, incentives or subsidies are most likely to encourage action to make their farms more environmentally sustainable. Seeing initiatives work on other farms/businesses similar to theirs increases farmer confidence that actions will be effective.
