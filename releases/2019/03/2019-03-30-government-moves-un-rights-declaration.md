Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta announced today the Government will develop a plan of action to drive and measure Aotearoa New Zealand’s progress towards the aspirations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

“This Government is committed to leadership and building closer partnerships with Māori. The Declaration plan will identify specific actions that can make real progress on the aspirations of Māori as the tangata whenua of Aotearoa,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

Minister Mahuta said that although many Government actions on Māori development and wellbeing are consistent with the aspirations of the Declaration, there is still more that we could and should do.

“We are often seen as leaders in indigenous rights, and a Declaration plan will show how the rubber is hitting the road by bringing greater transparency to the story that we tell about our progress.”

The Declaration plan will be developed across 2019 and through engagement with Māori in the second half of the year.

As a first step, the Minister will work with her Cabinet colleagues to appoint a technical working group to help provide advice about what this partnership process should look like.

“Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to embed the partnership with Māori within the work we are leading. This is a significant step towards building and strengthening relationships between the Crown and Māori,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
