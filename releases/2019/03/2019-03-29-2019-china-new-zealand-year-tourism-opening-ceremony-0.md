Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis today welcomed the official opening of the 2019 China-New Zealand Year of Tourism.

The Year of Tourism was jointly opened with China’s Minister of Culture and Tourism Luo Shugang in a special ceremony held at Te Papa this morning.

“The 2019 China-New Zealand Year of Tourism – a milestone in the China-New Zealand relationship – is an important opportunity for our countries to strengthen cultural, economic and people-to-people ties through tourism,” said Kelvin Davis.

“It’s a chance for New Zealanders to show our manaakitanga – our unique hospitality that promotes diversity, inclusivity and warmth to visitors from all over the world.

“It is also an opportunity for all of us to learn more about China, so we can provide visitors with the best experience we can, and broaden our understanding of their deep and fascinating culture.

“New Zealand’s relationship with China is one of our most important and far-reaching, and tourism is a significant strand in our bilateral relationship. I am very pleased to welcome Minister Luo to New Zealand, and to discuss furthering our cooperation in tourism. 

“There are some great initiatives and events related to the Year of Tourism, from Te Papa’s outstanding Terracotta Warriors exhibition– the first return of the Warriors to New Zealand since the 1980s – to the upcoming *Tuku Iho* cultural visit to China, later this year. These activities will help to build understanding between our peoples and cultures.”

“I encourage all New Zealanders to take this opportunity to learn more about a country with a rich and diverse culture and history. I look forward to experiencing this for myself by visiting China during the Year of Tourism,” Kelvin Davis said.
