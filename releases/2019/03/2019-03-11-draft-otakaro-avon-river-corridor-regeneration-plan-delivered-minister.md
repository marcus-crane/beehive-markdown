Another important milestone in Christchurch’s regeneration has been achieved with the Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration receiving the draft Ōtākaro Avon River Corridor Regeneration Plan.

 

“The Ōtākaro Avon River Corridor is a special area that has been home to many people.

 

“What happens to it is an important part of the city’s regeneration and will have long term effects for future generations.

 

Developed by Regenerate Christchurch, the draft Regeneration Plan is intended to support the regeneration of the Ōtākaro Avon River Corridor, providing a vision and objectives for short, medium and long-term future land uses and opportunities for the 602-hectare area in the heart of east Christchurch.

 

“A lot of work and passion has gone into the Regeneration Plan process, from the community, Regenerate Christchurch, and many partners,” Minister Woods says.

 

“Individuals, groups and organisations have taken the time to provide feedback at various stages during the process as Regenerate Christchurch has worked to develop and refine land use options and the draft Regeneration Plan itself.”

 

As the Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration, Minister Woods has the responsibility to decide whether to approve the draft Regeneration Plan.

 

Minister Woods says the final opportunity for the public to provide written comment on the draft Regeneration Plan was during the public notification period at the end of last year.

 

“At this stage in the process and as decision maker, it is not appropriate for me to comment further on the draft Regeneration Plan.

 

“But I can assure you I take this responsibility very seriously. I want to make the best decision for Christchurch.

 

“I am seeking advice from my officials and will now take my time to carefully consider the draft Regeneration Plan, in line with the requirements of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act. These include considering the feedback provided by key partners and the community and how these views have been addressed, the public interest, and financial implications,” says Megan Woods.

Regenerate Christchurch has also prepared a proposal for the partial revocation of the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan for the Minister to consider. The Christchurch Central Recovery Plan and the draft Regeneration Plan, should it be approved, apply to the same area. The partial revocation of the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan has been proposed to avoid the potential for inconsistencies and confusion.

Regenerate Christchurch has developed the draft Regeneration Plan considering ideas and feedback from the public, surveys, technical reports and studies.

 

In October 2017, Regenerate Christchurch published 10 possible combinations of land uses for feedback. A refined shortlist of land use options then featured in the Red Zones Futures exhibition, which ran from 26 May to 30 June last year.

The public were able to provide feedback through the exhibition, and written comments on the draft Regeneration Plan from 14 November to 19 December last year.
