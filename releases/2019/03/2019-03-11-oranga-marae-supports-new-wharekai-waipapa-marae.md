Māori Development Minister, Hon. Nanaia Mahuta and the Minister of Internal Affairs and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board, the Hon Tracey Martin today congratulated Waipapa Marae in Kawhia on the opening of its new wharekai.

The new wharekai willl provide the space to feed the people that visit the Waipapa marae each year.

“I want to acknowledge Waipapa Marae for their vision, hard work and dedication to build a wharekai that meets the needs of the people, it’s a true testament to their commitment to the manaaki, the people who visit each year”, said Nanaia Mahuta.

Oranga Marae funding, jointly provided by Te Puni Kōkiri and the Lottery Grants Board is making it all possible. Te Puni Kōkiri has contributed $250,000 and the Lotter Boards Grant funding , administered by the Department of Internal Affairs has contributed $475,000 to the cost of Waipapa Marae. 

The new dining room is expected to feed twice as many people as the previous building in one sitting, with half of the number of kitchen workers required to help feed guests during important annual events such as Poukai.

”It’s great to see this initiative – the first out of the Oranga Marae fund,” said Hon Tracey Martin. “Oranga Marae is more than just investing in marae buildings. It emphasises that the wellbeing of the Marae has as much to do with the people as it does with the whare.”

“Oranga Marae invests in both the physical development as well as cultural revitalisation of the marae with people being at the very heart,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

In addition to repairing whare and capital works Oranga Marae can support marae whānau to learn about tikanga and kawa or upskill in traditional practices, such as whaikōrero or karanga.

The new wharekai has been designed to meet the wishes of the late Māori Queen, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, who wanted a ‘room with a view’ of the Kawhia Harbour.

The new design features glass window panels facing the harbour to capture the view and physically link the wharekai to the Kawhia moana.

“Ngāti Hikairo opened their new kāuta (kitchen) ahead of the formal opening of their wharekai (dining hall) today. This is a fitting tribute to the late Koro Wetere as Waipapa was his whānau marae,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

**Te tautoko a Oranga Marae ki te wharekai hou ki Waipapa**

I whakamihia te marae o Waipapa i te rangi nei e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta me te Minita Taiwhenua, he Mema Whakahere hoki o Te Puna Tahua, te Hōnore Tracey Martin ki Kāwhia, i te whakatuwheratanga o tōna wharekai hou.

He nui ake te wharekai hou kia pai ai te whāngai i te marea ka taetae mai ki Waipapa i ia tau, i ia tau.

“Me mihi rā ka tika ki te marae o Waipapa, ki te iwi nōna te wawata, nāna te ihu oneone, te ngākau nui ki te hanga wharekai e manaakitia ai ngā hiahia o te iwi, he mārama te kitea tō rātou ngākaunui ki te manaakitanga o ngā manuhiri tau atu, tau mai” tā Nanaia Mahuta.

[Nā te pūtea o Oranga Marae, he pūtea tautoko ngātahi nā Te Puni Kōkiri me te Tari Taiwhenua, tēnei wawata i tutuki ai.]() Nā Te Puni Kōkiri te $250,000 ki te kaupapa, he $475,000 te nui o te pūtea i tukuna e te Tari Taiwhenua mai i te tahua o Te Puna Pūtea, hei utu i ngā nama.

Tōna tikanga he tokomaha noa ake ngā tāngata ka whāngaihia ki roto i te wharekai hou i te wā kotahi, he huarua anō te tokomaha ake i te whare o mua, kua hauruatia hoki te tokomaha o ngā kaimahi kīhini hei whāngai i ngā manuhiri i te wā o ngā hui nui ā-tau pēnā i te Poukai.

“Anō te āhuareka o tēnei kaupapa – me kī ko te mātāmua kia puta i te tahua Oranga Marae, te kī a Tracey Martin. “Ehara i te mea he whakapau pūtea ki ngā whare noa o te marae. He mea whakaatu kei te tangata, kei te whare, te oranga o te marae.”

“Ka whakapau pūtea a Oranga Marae ki te oranga whare, oranga tikanga o te marae, ko te tangata tonu te iho, te aronga nui,” te kī a Nanaia Mahuta.

I tua atu i te whakatikatika whare, whakapai whenua ka tautoko a Oranga Marae i te whānau o te marae ki te ako tikanga, kawa, ako/whakapakari i ngā tikanga o mua rānei, pērā ki te whaikōrero, te karanga.

I hoahoatia i runga i ngā ōhākī a te Ariki Tapairu, Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu me tōna hiahia ki tētahi ‘rūma whai tirohanga’ ki Te Whanga o Kāwhia.

Ko ngā āhuatanga hoahoa hou ko ngā papa matapihi karaehe he tirohanga ki te whanga ka tāia ki te rae, e honohono ā-tinana ana i te wharekai ki te moana o Kāwhia.

“I whakatuwheratia e Ngāti Hikairo tō rātou kāuta hou i mua i te whakatuwheratanga ōkawa o tō rātou wharekai i te rangi nei. He mihi tika, he mihi rangatira ki a Koro Wetere, kua ngaro nei i te tirohanga tāngata, nōna tēnei marae, nō tōna whānau,” te kōrero a Nanaia Mahuta.
