The Minister Responsible for the NZSIS and GCSB, Andrew Little, today launched the Standing Out LGBTQI+ staff network for New Zealand’s Intelligence Community.

“Our intelligence agencies have a critical mission to ensure the safety and security of New Zealanders. A diverse workforce allows the agencies to better respond to the range of national security threats we face.

“Different experiences people bring to the table enables greater innovation, fosters creativity, and increases staff engagement within an organisation. The LGBTQI+ staff at our Intelligence Community are making a critical contribution to the mission of keeping us safe.

“Proven diversity also allows all of New Zealand’s communities to be confident that their perspectives are respected in the confidential work of the agencies.

“Support networks such as Standing Out @ NZIC help ensure the principles of diversity, inclusiveness and acceptance are embedded across the work and culture of the community. It was fabulous that we could launch this project during the Wellington Pride Festival,” says Andrew Little.

As part of the launch ceremony, the rainbow flag was hoisted next to the New Zealand flag at Pipitea House, the intelligence agencies’ headquarters in Wellington. The flag will remain flying for the remainder of the month.

The launch comes in the week of Wellington’s Pride Parade on Saturday 16 March.
