Applications to the fourth round of the Regional Culture and Heritage Fund (RCHF) are now open, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Grant Robertson announced today.  

“I am delighted some $7 million is now available to regional arts, culture and heritage organisations across Aotearoa to complete significant capital projects,” Grant Robertson said.

“Since its establishment in 2016, the fund has supported 12 projects across the country, with $21.3 million in funding allocated.  

“Cultural institutions from Stewart Island to Whakatane have benefited, including the Nelson School of Music, the Sarjeant Gallery in Whanganui and the Hawke’s Bay Opera House in Hastings.

“The fund helps ensure the continued success of regional cultural institutions, such as performing arts venues, galleries, museums and whare taonga, which are vital to the wellbeing of our communities.

“Institutions like these, which have a significant role in housing major collections and offering unique cultural experiences, are also important regional economic contributors through domestic and international tourism,” Mr Robertson said.

The RCHF is a contestable fund of last resort. To qualify, applicants are required to show they have already secured funding from local government, lotteries and/or philanthropic sources.

Applications, with genuine funding shortfalls, are invited for capital projects at public museums, galleries, whare taonga, heritage properties housing collections of importance and performing arts venues.

Applications close at **5pm on Thursday 18 April 2019** with decisions made in mid-June.

Details about the fund, including how to apply, is available on the Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage website: [mch.govt.nz/regionalcultureheritagefund](https://mch.govt.nz/regionalcultureheritagefund)
