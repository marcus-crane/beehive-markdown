Incoming Chief Justice Helen Winkelmann has been appointed as a Dame Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

Dame Helen’s honour was approved by the Queen, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

“This appointment recognises the significance of the role of Chief Justice in New Zealand society and in our constitutional arrangements,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.

The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary, and the link between the judiciary and the other branches of government,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Appointment as a GNZM is limited to 30 ordinary members. Additional appointments over this limit may be made to commemorate important Royal, State or national occasions. This is an additional appointment.

The retiring Chief Justice, Rt Hon Dame Sian Elias, was appointed as a GNZM in 1999.

The new Chief Justice’s term of appointment commences on 13 March 2019. She will be sworn in as Chief Justice on 14 March 2019.
