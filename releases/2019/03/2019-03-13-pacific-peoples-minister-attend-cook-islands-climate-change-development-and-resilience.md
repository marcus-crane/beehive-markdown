Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio, will represent New Zealand at the Cook Islands’ Climate Change Development and Resilience Round Table this week, which will be held on the 14 and 15 March.

“New Zealand supports an ambitious global response to climate change and is taking action to support adaptation in the region,” says Aupito William Sio.

“We are proud to stand alongside the Cook Islands in taking a determined stand on climate change, acknowledging our long and close relationship. 

“The two-day round table, chaired by Cook Islands Deputy Prime Minister Mark Brown, will focus on the resilience of Cook Islands’ infrastructure as the island nation adapts to the effects climate change, as well as other issues that climate change presents.

“It is an important forum to present its plans and work with a range of donors and funders to protect Cook Islands from the worst effects of climate change.

“On climate change issues, the Cook Islands has taken positive steps through its ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution and renewable energy ambitions, its direct accreditation to international climate funds and its approach to mainstreaming climate change in its domestic policies.

“New Zealand welcomes the Cook Islands’ approach which makes us natural partners on international climate change issues,” says Aupito William Sio.
