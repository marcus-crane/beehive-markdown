Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel to Malaysia tomorrow on a scheduled visit, but one that takes on special significance following the terrorist attack in Christchurch.

“New Zealand has been a close friend with Malaysia for over 60 years, with significant defence, trade, education, and Commonwealth links,” said Mr Peters.

“This visit gives us the opportunity to thank Malaysia in person for their friendship and support during this difficult period, and to express our own sorrow for their loss as well.”

In Malaysia, Mr Peters will meet with Deputy Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, Minister of Foreign Affairs Dato’ Saifuddin Abdullah, and parliamentarian Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

“Malaysia is one of New Zealand’s largest economic partners in South East Asia. Many Malaysians call New Zealand home, while others have spent time in New Zealand, especially as students,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters departs early tomorrow morning, returning Thursday 28 March.
