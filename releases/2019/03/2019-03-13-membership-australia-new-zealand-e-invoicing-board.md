**Joint statement with Hon Stuart Robert, Australian Assistant Treasurer**

The Governments of Australia and New Zealand have announced the membership of the Australia and New Zealand Electronic Invoicing Board (ANZEIB) today.

This is an important step towards implementing e-Invoicing across both countries to help businesses save time and money by allowing the direct exchange of invoices between suppliers’ and buyers’ financial systems.

The ANZEIB membership comprises:

- Ramez Katf, Chief Information Officer at the Australian Taxation Office (Australian co-Chair)
- Stewart McRobie, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Chief Financial Officer (New Zealand co-Chair)
- Elizabeth Williamson, the Australian Treasury’s Division Head of the Consumer and Corporations Policy Division
- Rina Bruinsma, the Australian Department of Finance’s First Assistant Secretary of the Public Sector Transformation Division
- Paul Helm, the New Zealand Treasury Head of Government Finance Profession and Chief Government Accountant
- Gary Baird, Chief Technology Officer, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department
- Deborah Shepherd, independent New Zealand industry representative
- Rebecca Schot-Guppy, independent Australian industry representative

The extensive knowledge and industry experience of all ANZEIB members will help contribute to the continued success of e-Invoicing. The ANZEIB will meet for the first time today.

The successful collaboration between Australia and New Zealand to progress e-Invoicing as part of the Single Economic Market agenda was highlighted in the Productivity Commissions’ joint report *‘Growing the digital economy in Australia and New Zealand: Maximising opportunities for SMEs’*.

Prime Ministers Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern announced the creation of the ANZEIB and the intention to adopt the Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL) interoperability framework in 2019 in a [joint statement](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint-statement-prime-ministers-rt-hon-jacinda-ardern-and-hon-scott-morrison-mp-auckland-22) in February.
