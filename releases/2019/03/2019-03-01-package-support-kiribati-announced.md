Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced a package of support that will improve the health and education outcomes for hundreds of people in Kiribati today, and pledged continued support to help the island nation deal with climate change.

Mr Peters made the announcements while in Tarawa with a New Zealand delegation which is visiting the Pacific to continue building partnerships in the region.

In a meeting with the Kiribati President and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, H.E Taneti Maamau, Mr Peters discussed the effects of climate change in the Pacific region and the important role of fisheries in the Kiribati economy.

“New Zealand has a strong and long-standing relationship with Kiribati and has historically close cultural links. This is a partnership that we are continuing to build on,” Mr Peters said. 

“Climate change is an existential problem for Kiribati, and New Zealand is committed to working alongside our Pacific neighbours to adapt to the changes we have seen and will continue to witness on the ground.”

Mr Peters announced a package of support for the Kiribati Institute of Technology and its nursing programme, which will create modern facilities for an additional 360 students.

He also announced a NZ$1 million contribution for the design of the South Tarawa reticulated sanitation system which will help thousands of people.

The New Zealand delegation visited a number of development projects while in Tarawa - Mr Peters officially opened the New Zealand-funded Reverse Osmosis Desalination Plant in Betio and laid a wreath at the Coastwatcher Memorial. 

Mr Peters’ visit is the first New Zealand Ministerial-level visit to Kiribati since 2016.
