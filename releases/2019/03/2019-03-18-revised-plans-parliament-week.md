Members of Parliament will gather in the House today at 2pm, and after statements of condolence led by the Prime Minister, the House will adjourn for the day.

The House will meet tomorrow at 2pm for more Ministerial statements, followed by an opportunity for other MPs to speak about what has happened.

 Then the House will adjourn until Tuesday 2 April.

 The revised plan gives MPs the flexibility to stay in their electorate.
