Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says senior representatives of the Turkish government will visit Christchurch over the next two days.

 The Vice President of Turkey, H.E Mr Fuat Oktay, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, H.E.  Mevlut Cavusoglu, are visiting Christchurch to pay their respects over the terrorist attack.

 “They will meet members of the Muslim community, take an opportunity to lay flowers and wreaths, and meet government representatives this evening”, said Mr Peters.

 “New Zealand has welcomed the Turkish Government’s messages of condolence over the large loss of innocent life,” he said.
