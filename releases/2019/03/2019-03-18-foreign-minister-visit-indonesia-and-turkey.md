Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters is travelling to Indonesia and Turkey this week.

Mr Peters is departing tonight for Jakarta to attend a High Level Dialogue on Indo-Pacific cooperation, hosted by Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi.

“While the visit to Indonesia was scheduled for some time, the importance of it now cannot be overstated,” said Mr Peters.

“First and foremost, it will be an opportunity to mark our appreciation for the sympathy and support of Indonesia and other countries in the region, and update them on how this country is responding. 

“We will also express our deepest condolences.  Many of those killed or injured in this despicable act of terrorism were originally from the region or maintain family connections.”

“Our current intention is then to travel onwards to Turkey, at the request of the Turkish Government, to attend a special ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation being held in Istanbul.

“This important event will allow New Zealand to join with our partners in standing against terrorism and speaking up for values such as understanding and religious tolerance. We are very clear that the terrorist attack in Christchurch, committed by a person who is not a New Zealander, is utterly contrary to our core beliefs,” Mr Peters said.

Mr Peters will be accompanied by the Minister for Ethnic Communities Jenny Salesa for the OIC meeting in Istanbul.
