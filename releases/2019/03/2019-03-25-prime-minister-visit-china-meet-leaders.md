Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will meet China’s leaders President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang during her first official visit to China on Monday 1 April.

“New Zealand is committed to sustaining a constructive and comprehensive relationship with China,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“China is an important and valued partner for New Zealand, and high level meetings are vital to make progress across a wide range of areas in our relationship. 

“This meeting had been planned in the weeks prior to the Christchurch mosque attacks. In light of these events, I made the decision to scale back the meetings to just one day. We’re extremely grateful for the understanding China has shown.

“I expect discussions will include a broad range of regional and global issues, including where we have common interests – protecting and promoting a rules-based international trading system, and in combatting climate change.

“During my visit I will take the opportunity to engage with members of the business community including New Zealanders doing business in China. China is a key destination for our exports and raising the profile of New Zealand as a source of high quality goods and services is paramount to our success in growing an economy that works for all New Zealanders.

“I will also officially open New Zealand’s new embassy in China. The embassy is a significant investment, and underscores the importance that successive governments have placed on the China relationship. 

“This is an important visit. New Zealand places a high priority on our relationship with China and I’m looking forward to my engagements there,” Jacinda Ardern said.
