Up to 209,200 New Zealanders will benefit from a pay boost this Monday 1 April, thanks to the Coalition Government’s decision to raise the minimum wage to $17.70, says Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Iain Lees-Galloway.

“This Government is committed to improving the wellbeing and living standards of all New Zealanders as we build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy. Kiwi workers deserve to be paid appropriately for the hard work and effort they put into their jobs,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

“This Monday, our lowest paid workers will be receiving a boost to their incomes, as the minimum wage increases by $1.20 an hour. On a 40-hour work week, this means an extra $48 a week before tax. This will make a real difference to low-income workers.”

Results of the 2017/18 Stats NZ’s Household Economic Survey showed that a third of people said their current household income was either not enough or only just enough to meet their everyday needs.

“Lifting the incomes of Kiwi workers will contribute to improved living standards and reduce poverty. Our Government has committed to increasing the minimum wage to $20 by 2021,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.

The starting-out and training wage rates also increase this Monday to $14.16 per hour, in order to remain at 80 per cent of the adult minimum wage.

To provide businesses and workers with greater certainty, the Government has indicated minimum wage rates of $18.90 to come into effect on 1 April 2020 and $20 to come into effect on 1 April 2021. These indicative rates are subject to each year’s annual review, in accordance with the statutory process, which will take into account the economic conditions at the time.
