A new employment hub in Whakatāne will help get more rangatahi earning and learning Employment Minister Willie Jackson said today at the opening of the Tū Māia Rangatahi Hub.

In August 2018, the Government announced [$1.76 million in He Poutama Rangatahi funding](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/govt-invests-further-3m-tackle-eastern-bay-plenty-youth-unemployment) for Te Puna Ora o Mataatua to support their *Whāia Te Rangatiratanga – Pathways to Independence* programme, which included the development of the Hub.

“This is one of the biggest projects supported by He Poutama Rangatahi and it’s exciting to see this Hub get off the ground and begin to deliver extra support for young people and the local community in Whakatāne,” said Willie Jackson

“The Tū Māia Rangatahi Hub will provide resources, tools and networks for rangatahi in their search for employment within a kaupapa Māori environment.

"By the end of the project, 220 rangatahi will have benefited from the individualised support provided through the Hub.

“The project will change the lives of rangatahi and support the Government’s wider efforts to reduce the number of young people not in employment, education or training.

“The Government is committed to improving the lives of young New Zealanders and is proud to support this project – it will make a real difference to the lives of rangatahi in Whakatāne and the wider area,” Willie Jackson said.
