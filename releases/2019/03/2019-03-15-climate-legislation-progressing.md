The Coalition Government is working on the final details of climate change legislation that will set New Zealand on the path to being carbon zero by 2050. 

“This is ground-breaking legislation. No New Zealand Government has ever had to pass a law that over a 30 year timeframe seeks to stop climate pollution entering the atmosphere,” said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“It’s technical and difficult legislation we are working hard to finalise. Once we lock down the remaining details we will be in a position to announce the timeframe for the Bill’s introduction. I’m very keen to see it finalised and completed by the end of this year.

“We want to try and reach a consensus so that the legislation is lasting. It needs to endure for 30 years, not just the next three. 

“In the meantime, we’ve set up an interim climate commission so we don’t waste time starting work on issues like how we meet our goal of 100% renewable electricity by 2035.

“I want to acknowledge today’s youth Climate Strike. I have said that climate change is my generation’s nuclear free moment- for them it’s literally their future. My message is simple, we hear you and we’re getting on with setting a path for carbon neutrality. Please keep bringing as many people as you can with you, because we simply won’t achieve our goals alone.”
