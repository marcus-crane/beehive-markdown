Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters and Minister of Defence Ron Mark today announced a package of support to the Solomon Islands Government ahead of the national general election on April 3.

The election will be the first since the departure of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in 2017.

“Supporting the Solomon Islands General Election is a tangible demonstration of New Zealand’s support for good governance in the Pacific and is consistent with the Government’s objectives under the Pacific Reset,” Mr Peters said.

“Our support will contribute to advancing democracy and the democratic participation of Solomon Islands citizens in their election.”

Mr Mark said New Zealand’s support would include deployment of two NH90 helicopters and associated personnel for logistical support.

“The NH90s will be used to transport electoral officials and materials to reach a growing voter population in Solomon Islands,” Mr Mark said.

New Zealand will also contribute an election observer mission and has already provided polling booths to the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission.

The package of support will be provided in conjunction with election assistance from Australia.
