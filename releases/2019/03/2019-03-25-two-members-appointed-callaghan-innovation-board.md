Research, Science and Innovation Minister Hon Dr Megan Woods today announced the appointment of Ms Angela Bull and the reappointment of Ms Frances Valintine to the board of New Zealand’s innovation agency, Callaghan Innovation.

“I would like to welcome Ms Bull to the board of Callaghan Innovation, and acknowledge Ms Valintine who will be returning to the board for a second term,” says Megan Woods.

“Research and innovation have the potential for significant impact on our economy, environment and society. Callaghan Innovation’s role is to realise that impact by supporting businesses in commercialising their science, engineering, technology and design, and in undertaking valuable research and development.

“Both Ms Valintine and Ms Bull bring a wealth of broad experience and knowledge to the board, and will provide expert advice and governance to Callaghan Innovation to support the growth of more innovative businesses, particularly as we introduce the new R&D Tax Incentive in April,” says Megan Woods. 

Ms Valintine has extensive experience in developing innovative and technology-focused businesses; she is the founder of The Mind Lab and Tech Futures Lab, both future-focused, postgraduate learning facilities committed to innovation and the future of work. In 2018, Ms Valintine was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to education and the technology sector.

Ms Angela Bull has a multi-discipline background in law, property development, and retail and change management. Ms Bull leads one of New Zealand’s largest privately held property investment groups and holds a number of director roles, including with the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) and NZ Institute of Economic Research (NZIER).

Ms Valintine and Ms Bull will serve on the board for terms of three years.
