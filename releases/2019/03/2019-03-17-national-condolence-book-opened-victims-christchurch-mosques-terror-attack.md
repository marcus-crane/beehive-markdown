Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, accompanied by the Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy and Parliament’s Speaker Trevor Mallard, have opened a national condolence book for victims of the Christchurch mosques terror attack.

“New Zealanders have been shocked and deeply saddened by Friday’s terrorist attack in Christchurch and the terrible toll it has taken on the lives of so many,” Jacinda Ardern said. 

“We have already seen a huge outpouring of love and support from across the country for those affected and for the wider Christchurch community. These actions represent the true values of New Zealanders – love and compassion. 

“The Muslim community in New Zealand have experienced the most horrendous attack on them imaginable. While it is a small action, the condolence book offers an opportunity for New Zealanders to unite and express our opposition to hate and state our commitment to the values of love and compassion,” Jacinda Ardern said.  

A condolence book at the National Library on Molesworth Street, Wellington is available for people to sign.
