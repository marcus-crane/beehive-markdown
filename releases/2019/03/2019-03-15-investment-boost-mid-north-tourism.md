The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) will invest $2.8 million to further economic growth opportunities in tourism in the Mid-North and help lift the prosperity and wellbeing of its communities, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

“The PGF is investing $1.79 million to redevelop and enhance Te Waiariki Ngawha Springs, located near Kaikohe. Over the past three years, use of the spring has increased from 22,000 visitors in 2015 to more than 40,000 in 2017 with no active marketing,” said Kelvin Davis.

“This project has the potential to further build the Mid-North’s total visitor market and provide employment for up to 30 people, while delivering benefits to the local community through enhancing an important local landmark.

“Funding of $890,000 will be provided to evaluate the potential for an innovation and enterprise park to be built on 165 hectares at Ngawha, near Kaikohe. The aim is to improve the utilisation of the region’s natural resources.

“This will be an actively managed hub that will bring together complementary activities such as manufacturing, construction, innovation, and research and development. It will support training and pathways to employment for locals.

“We’ll also invest just over $178,000 in Tē Pu o Te Wheke - The Heart of Ngāpuhi to develop a business case to establish a multi-use, leading edge community, cultural and tourism hub to revive Kaikohe’s main centre. 

“The Mid-North has massive potential and after years of neglect this Government is going to unlock it through the PGF,” Kelvin Davis said.
