The Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) is investing over $2 million in two tourism initiatives which will further enhance Whangarei as a tourist destination and support the region’s economic growth, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

“Tourism is set to continue to grow in Whangarei and it’s crucial that we invest to improve the infrastructure and encourage initiatives that cater to tourists,” Kelvin Davis said.

“The projects announced today are supported by the local community and add to the mix of existing and planned attractions in Whangarei.

“The PGF will invest $1.3 million towards the completion of a feasibility study and business case for the development of the Riverside Hotel and Entertainment Precinct. If the project goes ahead, it’s estimated that it will create upwards of 100 jobs and inject $7.75 million into the Whangarei economy each year.

“Funding of $750,000 will help build a full scale version of an operational rolling ball clock promoting Clapham’s National Clock Museum in Whangarei. A prototype built by local volunteers gained interest as a potential cultural and educational tourist attraction.

 “Our regions are a big tourism drawcard and we want them to thrive as much as our cities. Through smart investments, the PGF can help grow a more sustainable and high value tourism industry, while creating jobs and more opportunities,” Kelvin Davis said.

With today’s announcement the Provincial Growth Fund is set to invest over $101 million to support New Zealand’s tourism sector.
