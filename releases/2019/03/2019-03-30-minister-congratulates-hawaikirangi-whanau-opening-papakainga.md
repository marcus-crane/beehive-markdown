Māori Development Minister Hon Nanaia Mahuta today congratulated the Rapihana Hawaikirangi Ahu Whenua Trust on the official opening of its new papakāinga development.

Te Puni Kōkiri has invested $995,000 and the Rapihana Hawaikirangi Ahu Whenua Trust has contributed $312,836 for the project which will allow for five new homes to be situated on the trust’s ancestral land in Waiohiki, south of Napier.

“Three affordable rental properties have been constructed and tenanted to local whānau who moved into their new homes last December and two individually owned homes are yet to be built.

“I am pleased to see whānau are settling into their new homes and are taking the steps to truly make full use of their whenua.

“Papakāinga provide opportunities for whānau to live as a community according to kaupapa Māori, often with multiple generations, ensuring knowledge and whakapapa are passed on to the next generation,” said Hon Nanaia Mahuta.

Minister Mahuta congratulated the Hawaikirangi whānau on their commitment to housing initiatives that will ensure they are a proud, vibrant and prosperous community.

“The vision of the trust is that papakāinga will provide a culturally embracing environment that promotes, facilitates and enhances whānau and hapū practices and values.

“A strong and thriving cultural identity will provide a strong sense of ownership and self-determination, as well as increasing the aspirations of the community,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

                                                                 

**Ka mihia te whānau Hawaikirangi e te Minita i te whakatuwheratanga o tōna papakāinga hou** 

I mihia te Rapihana Hawaikirangi Ahu Whenua Trust e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta i te rangi nei mō te whakatuwheratanga o tōna papakāinga hou. 

Kua hoatu Te Puni Kōkiri i te $995,000, i takoha atu hoki te Rapihana Hawaikirangi Ahu Whenua Trust i te $312,836 mō te kaupapa. Nō reira e rima ngā whare hou ka hangaia ki runga i te whenua o ngā mātua tūpuna o te poari kaitiaki ki Waiohiki, kei te tonga o Ahuriri. 

“Kua oti ngā whare rīhi iti te utu nei te hanga, kua rīhi ki ngā whānau o te rohe. I nuku atu rātou ki ō rātou whare i te marama o te Hakihea kua pahure ake nei, e rua anō ngā whare ka hangaia, kua hokona kē ērā. 

“He koanga ngākau kua taunga haere ngā whānau ki roto i ō rātou whare hou, ka mutu, e whai ana rātou kia tino whakamahia tō rātou whenua. 

“He ara anō te Papakāinga mā ngā whānau kia noho ā-hapori, ka mutu, kia tino Māori nei te noho, i te nuinga o te wā he tini ngā whakatipuranga, mā reira e whakarite ai ka heke te mātauranga, te whakapapa ki ngā whakatipuranga e whai mai nei,” e ai ki a Nanaia Mahuta. 

Kāore i ārikarika te whakamiha ki te whānau Hawaikirangi me tō rātou ngākaunui kia whai i ngā kōkiringa whare kia pai ai te tū māia, te tū kaha, te tū rangatira a te hapori. 

“Ko te wawata o te poari kaitiaki ka noho te papakāinga hei taiao ahurea e hāpai, e whakahaere, e whakarei i ngā tikanga me uara o te whānau tae noa ki te hapū. 

“Mā te pakari me te momoho o te tuakiri ahurea e whakaoho te hononga o te tangata ki te whenua, otirā, tōna tino rangatiratanga, ka mutu, e whakakaha ake anō ai ngā wawata me ngā tūmanako o te hapori” te kī a Nanaia Mahuta.
