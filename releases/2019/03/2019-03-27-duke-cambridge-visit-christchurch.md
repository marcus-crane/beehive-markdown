Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has welcomed news that the Duke of Cambridge will visit New Zealand on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen to honour the victims of the Christchurch mosques terror attack.

The visit will be in late April.

“I am mindful that the trauma in Christchurch will last long after the National Remembrance Service this week,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“I’m sure all New Zealanders but especially the Muslim community of Christchurch will appreciate seeing the compassion and support, that has been so tangibly demonstrated since the attack, continue into the future.

“Prince William has a strong connection with the people of Canterbury since his visits here following the Christchurch earthquakes.

“I’m really pleased that he can make a short visit to support those affected by the attack and pay tribute to the extraordinary compassion and solidarity that New Zealanders have displayed in recent weeks.

“The visit will be another sign that this nation will always stand with those affected by the terror attacks, and the people of Christchurch,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Further details of the dates and programme will be announced in due course.
