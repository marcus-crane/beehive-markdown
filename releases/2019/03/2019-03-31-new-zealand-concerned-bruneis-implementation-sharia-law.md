Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has expressed concern at the Government of Brunei Darussalam’s intention to fully implement Sharia law.

“It is seriously regrettable that Brunei’s decision contravenes a number of international norms on human rights,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand opposes any kind of discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation. We are also deeply concerned at the use of punishments that are cruel, inhuman or degrading.

“New Zealand is a long-standing opponent of the use of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances,” Mr Peters said.
