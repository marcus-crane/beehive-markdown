Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Fletcher Tabuteau will travel to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar this week to strengthen our relationships and further our trade and economic links.                

“The Gulf is now New Zealand’s seventh largest trading partner and is an important market for New Zealand’s high value primary produce and advanced services exports. In addition, there is significant potential for investment from these countries in New Zealand’s productive industries,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

The UAE is New Zealand’s most significant relationship in the Gulf; home to 5,000 New Zealanders and a number of our leading companies.

“I will be using this visit to expand our engagement with the UAE Government and business leaders in advance of Expo2020 in Dubai.”

In Kuwait, the visit will further opportunities for growth in the trade and investment relations. Kuwaitis highly value the New Zealand Education system and increasing numbers of Kuwaiti students are now studying in New Zealand each year.

Fletcher Tabuteau’s visit will also be an opportunity to reinforce the strength of our bilateral relationship with Qatar.

“Qatar is host of the FIFA World Cup in 2022 and is an increasingly important global hub. Direct daily flights to New Zealand from Doha help to connect New Zealand to the rest of the world,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.
