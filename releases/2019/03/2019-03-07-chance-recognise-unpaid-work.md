Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter is celebrating the value of unpaid work to celebrate International Women’s Day 2019.

“This year, my partner and I have welcomed the birth of our first child. As a full time working mum, I rely on unpaid work by my partner to enable me to do my job,” says Ms Genter.  

“The caring work that has traditionally been shouldered by women needs to be recognised as productive and valuable work, and shared between all genders.

“The Government is delivering its Wellbeing Budget this year to move beyond GDP as the only measure of economic success.

“I look forward to my child growing up in a world where we have moved past gender stereotypes and where the value of unpaid work is recognised as essential to our society and economy.

“Aotearoa has always led the world for women getting a better deal. We were the first country in the world where women could vote.

“However, there is more we can do. I know women and girls in New Zealand need to see the ongoing benefits of gender equality in their own lives and with their own families.

“Tomorrow I will be travelling to the United Nations in New York to attend the Commission on the Status of Women.

“I will be proudly representing New Zealand at the UN in New York and working to ensure that New Zealand continues to lead the world in advancing women and girl’s rights,” Ms Genter said.
