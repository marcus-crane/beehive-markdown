The Minister for Maori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta will travel to Chile for four days this month following an invitation to be the keynote speaker at an indigenous women’s conference in Santiago on 14 March.

The Minister will share the experience and value of Māori economic and social development and promote links between Aotearoa and Chile on indigenous issues and collaborative opportunities.

This is an important follow up to recognition given by both countries’ leaders during President Piñera’s visit in November last year to indigenous cooperation as an important area for future bilateral collaboration.

“This is an exciting opportunity to champion New Zealand’s leadership in addressing indigenous rights and interests. I can showcase the vital leadership role that wahine play in these areas in Aotearoa.

“Close to my heart is the chance to engage with representatives of the people of Rapa Nui the Polynesian tangata whenua of Chile. I will be talking to them in Santiago. I also look forward to meeting with members of the Mapuche population, the largest indigenous population of Chile,” said Nanaia Mahuta. 

The Minister will be naming a pou whakairo in central Santiago carved by the Māori Arts and Crafts Institute and given to Chile at the time of the visiting Tuku Iho exhibition in 2015.  

“I will also be discussing with Chile our shared ambition to focus APEC economies’ attention on indigenous issues. Chile is this year’s APEC host.

“This trip is a significant opportunity to share with the Chilean government the experience in Aotearoa of the value that indigenous perspectives can bring to policy development,” said Nanaia Mahuta.  

 **He whakatairanga tā te iwi taketake titiro te whāinga ki Hire**

Ka haere te Minita Whanaketanga Māori a Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta ki Hire mō te whā rā i tēnei marama i runga i te pōhiri kia tū hei kaikōrero matua ki tētahi huinga wāhine ka tū ki Santiago ā te 14 o Poutūterangi.

Ka kauhautia ngā piki me ngā heke o te whakawhanaketanga ā-ōhanga, ā-pāpori a te Māori me ōna hua, ka whakatairangatia ngā hononga a Aotearoa ki a Hire mō te wāhi ki ngā kaupapa taketake me ngā huarahi mahi tahi hoki.

He mea nui te whaiwhai ake i te whakaaetanga a ngā rangatira o ngā whenua e rua i te whātorohanga mai a Perehana Piñera’s i te marama o Whiringa-ā-nuku 2018, arā, he wāhi nui te mahi tahi ā ngā iwi taketake ki te mahi tahi a ngā whenua e rua.  

“Kātahi te tino huarahi mā ngā kaiārahi o Aotearoa hei kōkiri i ngā kaupapa whakatikatika i ngā motika me ngā take iwi taketake. E taea ai e au te kauhau te rongopai o te mahi a ngā wāhine Māori i ēnei tūāhuatanga i Aotearoa.

“Ngākaunui ana au te kia whakahihiri ki te hunga e whakakanohi ana i ngā iwi o Rapa Nui, ngā tāngata whenua Māori o Hire. Ka kōrero tahi mātou ki Santiago. Tāria ana hoki te wā kia hui tahi atu ki te iwi Mapuche, te iwi taketake nui rawa o Hire, tā Nanaia Mahuta. 

Ka whakaingoatia e te Minita he pou whakairo kei Santiago i whakairotia e te New Zealand Māori Arts and Craft Institute, ā, ka hoatu ki te whenua o Hire i te wā o te whakakitenga i te tau 2015.  

“Ka matapakina hoki i te taha o Hire tō mātou hiahia nui kia tahuri mai i te aronga o ngā whenua APEC ki ngā take iwi taketake. Mā Hire a APEC e manaaki.

“He tino huarahi tēnei hei kauhau i te wheako o Aotearoa ki te kāwanatanga o Hire o te hua i roto i ngā tirohanga iwi taketake ki te whakawhanaketanga kaupapahere, te kī a Nanaia Mahuta.
