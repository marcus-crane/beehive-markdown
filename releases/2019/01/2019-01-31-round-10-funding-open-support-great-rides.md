Applications are open for round 10 of the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, Tourism Minister Kelvin Davis announced today.

The Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund has a budget of $2 million each year across two funding rounds to support projects that maintain and improve completed sections of the Great Rides of Ngā Haerenga – the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“The Great Rides attract over one million people every year and we need to continue to invest in these trails to maintain their world class standard,” Kelvin Davis said.

 In the previous nine funding rounds, over $8 million has been invested in projects that have included safety and signage improvements, upgrading trail surfaces and replacing bridges.

“Through these 22 exceptional trails, Kiwis and visitors are able to get a uniquely New Zealand experience that showcases some of the best parts of Aotearoa, while getting out into the regions,” Kelvin Davis said.

Applications are open to Great Rides governance organisations and close on 01 March 2019.
