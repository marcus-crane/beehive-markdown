Events on marae and lake fronts, in community centres, local museums and town squares are being held throughout the country to commemorate Waitangi Day 2019, Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Jacinda Ardern says today.

“I’m delighted the Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund has distributed $288,000 to support 46 events across the country and encourage all New Zealanders to come together to experience those taking place in their communities,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“From large-scale events attracting tens of thousands of people such as those at Hoani Waititi Marae in Auckland and the Porirua Waterfront, to smaller gatherings in areas as far flung as the Chatham Islands and to the significant commemorations at Waitangi, these events are an opportunity for us to reflect on the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“From dawn ceremonies to concerts at dusk, there will be plenty of opportunities for friends and whānau to be together.

“Explorations of te Tiriti history include heritage bus tours of the Waipā District, a Treaty trail scavenger hunt through the streets of Kaikōura, community kōrero at Tu Tama o Wahine o Taranaki in New Plymouth with marae open days, kapa haka, and dance performances featuring throughout the country.

“These community-led events, promoting national and community building, bring New Zealanders of all cultures together in a spirit of partnership to commemorate the bicultural foundation of our nation.

“They’re an opportunity for people to come together in their neighbourhoods to recognise the signing of Te Tiriti, and to celebrate the contribution all New Zealand cultures have in our society.

“I’m thrilled to see all the varied and thought-provoking events planned for Waitangi Day 2019, and encourage people to take part.

“Together we can reflect on what it means to be a New Zealander and how Te Tiriti o Waitangi underpins this,” Jacinda Ardern said.
