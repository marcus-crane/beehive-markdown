Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters announced today that New Zealand is to increase funding for economic resilience, human development and good governance in the island nation of Nauru by $8 million over three years.

“This year marks 50 years of independence for Nauru. As New Zealand is looking to reset relationships in the Pacific, it is an opportune time to reconsider our relationship with Nauru and look to deepen our long-term relevance and influence,” said Mr Peters.

Mr Peters has announced an increased indicative budget of $18.5 million over three years. 

“New Zealand’s development partnership with Nauru is focused on measures that will benefit future generations – for example, education, renewable energy, and support for the electoral system.

“New Zealand remains committed to development cooperation with Nauru that promotes regional values and aims to support development outcomes that are sustainable and broadly-based. The wellbeing and security of our Pacific neighbourhood is critical to New Zealand’s own wellbeing and future,” said Mr Peters.

New Zealand will be represented at the closing ceremony of Nauru’s 50th independence celebrations by Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Fletcher Tabuteau. Mr Tabuteau will be in Nauru 30 January – 1 February
