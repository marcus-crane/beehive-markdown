The official holiday period has ended with nine people tragically killed in crashes on New Zealand roads.

This is three people fewer than the 12 who died last holiday season.

“My thoughts are with the families, friends and communities of the nine people who have lost their lives,” said Julie Anne Genter.

“This is yet another reminder of the need to make substantial improvements to road safety in New Zealand.

“Many deaths and serious injuries on our roads are preventable. This Government is committed to reducing deaths and serious injuries through new thinking, more funding and prioritised action.

“The Government is investing $1.4 billion over three years to make urgent safety improvement across our high-risk roads. On high volume state highways New Zealanders can expect to see more improvements like life-saving median and side barriers and crash-preventing rumble strips.

“This year we will be consulting the public on a new road safety strategy and action plan to drive substantial improvements in road safety in New Zealand,” said Julie Anne Genter.
