Community groups have given a boost to the Government’s new insulation programme *Warmer Kiwi Homes,* meaning in some parts of the country low income homeowners will be able to insulate their homes for free, Minister Megan Woods has announced.

Community organisations have contributed $4.7 million to the programme, further reducing insulation costs to home owners.

“The Government has allocated funding of $142.5 million over four years for grants covering two-thirds of the cost of ceiling and underfloor insulation. So far, over 3200 homes have already been insulated under this programme. That’s thousands of families now able to enjoy warmer, healthier homes while saving on their heating bills.

“Now councils, charitable trusts, district health boards and lines trusts have come forward with $4.7 million of additional funding – this means in some areas there is minimal or no cost to homeowners.

“For example generous funding by Foundation North means eligible homeowners in Northland and South Auckland will be able to insulate their homes at no cost. Free insulation will make a huge difference to people’s ability to keep their homes warm and healthy in winter. 

“Grants are targeted towards those who need them most – homeowners with a Community Services Card, as well as people living in areas defined as having higher well-being needs.

“Too many New Zealand homes are cold and damp, leading to preventable diseases such as rheumatic fever and asthma. We can do so much better as a country than that. That’s why this Government is insulating homes, to keep people safe and healthy. It will mean less Kiwis ending up in hospital and more people able to afford to heat their homes.

“This sits alongside policies like the Families Package, the Winter Energy Payment and the Healthy Homes Guarantee which are seeing more Kiwi families able to enjoy warm, dry, healthy homes. This is all part of our Government’s plan to invest in New Zealanders and their families wellbeing,” says Megan Woods

The *Warmer Kiwi Homes* programme is part of the Government’s confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party.

Green’s Energy Spokesperson Gareth Hughes says the policy will help more families keep warm this winter while saving them money.

“Making homes healthier and cheaper to heat whilst also reducing energy demand is the kind of win-win solution that is needed to tackle climate change whilst supporting our people to thrive.  

We want to see every home in New Zealand properly insulated and this is a great start,” says Gareth Hughes.

Grants for heating appliances will be available to low-income households from July 2019.
