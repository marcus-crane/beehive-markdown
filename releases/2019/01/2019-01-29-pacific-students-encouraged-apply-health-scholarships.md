Pacific students in health or disability-related courses are being encouraged to apply for the Ministry of Health’s Pacific Health Scholarships.

“The scholarships are an important part of growing the health workforce of New Zealand, and also making sure that the health system responds effectively to the needs of Pacific people,” says Associate Minister of Health Jenny Salesa.

“The scholarships contribute to improving access to health services for Pacific people by assisting the development of the Pacific health and disability workforce.”

Over $1.4 million has been allocated for the 2019 Scholarships.

Since 2002 when the scholarships began, over 1,600 scholarships have been awarded. Medical and Dentistry students can qualify for up to $10,000 and Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health students up to $5,000. The total course fees are paid directly to the tertiary institution where the successful applicants will be studying.

Applications for this year’s Pacific Health Scholarships close on Friday, 8 February 2019 at 5pm.

More information about the scholarships and how to apply, can be found on the Ministry of Health website [here](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/populations/pacific-health/pacific-health-scholarships-2019)
