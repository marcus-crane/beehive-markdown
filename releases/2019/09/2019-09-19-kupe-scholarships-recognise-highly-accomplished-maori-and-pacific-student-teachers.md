29 Māori and Pacific student teachers have been awarded prestigious Kupe Scholarships in recognition of their high academic achievement and leadership potential, at a ceremony hosted by Associate Education Minister Kelvin Davis in Parliament today.

The Kupe Scholarship, worth over $22,000, aims to attract highly accomplished Māori and Pacific students to the teaching profession and support them to become inspiring teachers in early childhood, primary and secondary education.

“Today we’re celebrating the future role models for our Māori and Pacific learners. They have already shown high academic achievement, leadership potential, and close links with their communities - and now this scholarship will support them to make a real difference for kids in the classroom,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Our Government is committed to improving education outcomes for Maori and Pacific students, and one of the most effective ways to do that is to strengthen teaching. These scholarships help ensure a career pathway that will provide skilled Māori and Pacific teachers through quality initial teacher education and professional learning and development.

“It is continually inspiring to see these scholarships encourage Māori and Pacific students into a teaching career. I congratulate the recipients and wish them all the best for their future success as great teachers, leaders and motivators of a future generation of students,” Kelvin Davis said.

The Kupe Scholarship funds course fees and provides an allowance, and also offers mentoring support through the programme, and recruitment support after graduation.
