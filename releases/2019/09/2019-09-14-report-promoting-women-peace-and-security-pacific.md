Samoa and New Zealand have released a Report from the Women, Peace and Security Summit co-hosted by the Samoan and New Zealand governments, 22-23 August in Apia.

The Summit promoted the participation of women at all levels of peace and security governance in the Pacific.

The Summit Report includes high level takeaways and broad recommendations to promote the Women, Peace and Security agenda and the rights of women and girls, particularly in conflict and post conflict situations.

Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi emphasised the timeliness of this Summit given the new and emerging threats from violent extremism, climate change, human trafficking, and unprecedented humanitarian crises, making our efforts to implement the women, peace, and security agenda more critical now than ever.

“Our Blue Pacific region is placing high priority on the implementation of the Boe Declaration on Regional Security which looks at the expanded concept of security that allows for the linking our security agenda to the promotion of rights for women and girls, and the recognition of the key role they can play in peace and security,” Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said.

New Zealand Cabinet Minister Carmel Sepuloni represented the New Zealand government and Minister of Defence Ron Mark in co-hosting the event.

“I was impressed and encouraged by the diversity and commitment of the participants. New Zealand wants to work in partnership with Pacific Island countries to promote meaningful participation of women at all levels in Pacific security sectors, including Defence and Police forces, as well as in non-traditional security areas like climate change,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“As a region we have made some progress but we still have far to go. The Summit represents a step towards greater recognition and understanding of the challenges we face in the Pacific as well as some our successes.

“I know that the event has already inspired some practical initiatives and I am excited to see what more can be achieved through this type of collaboration,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

Approximately 150 participants represented 24 countries, including 16 Pacific Island countries. Participants came from a range of backgrounds, including political leaders, military and police personnel, civil society and youth representatives and academics.
