More roll growth classrooms are set to be built at schools in the wider Wellington region as part of a nationwide school expansion programme, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

The announcement is the sixth and final in a series releasing the country’s first ever National Education Growth Plan. The Wellington Growth Plan released today forecasts around 2,500 additional student spaces may be needed by 2030.

“The plan will help the government stay ahead of the game when it comes to responding to growth,” Chris Hipkins said.

“It represents a step change in the way the Government plans for and manages growth, ensuring the right kind of capacity is delivered in the right place at the right time.”

$27m has been set aside to build up to 40 new classrooms, providing 700 additional student places at 11 schools across the Wellington region.

“In addition to the funding for population growth, we are also investing around $14 million across two kura.

“The funding will be used to replace 4 classrooms at Te Kura-a-iwi o Whakatupuranga Rua Mano (Otaki) and will completely rebuild Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngā Mokopuna.” 

The roll growth funding is part of the $1.2bn allocated by Budget 2019 set to expand schools in areas of high growth across the country over the next ten years

Chris Hipkins announced the plans during a visit to Paraparaumu College, which is to receive 10 of the new roll growth classrooms.

“The wider Wellington region has been experiencing steady growth for some time, and Kapiti is one of those areas. We need to be prepared to respond to that growth,” Chris Hipkins said.  

“The Wellington region growth plan shows us which areas are under pressure and where we need to deliver more capacity. For the first time, it forms part of a cohesive plan for the whole country that gives certainty to schools, communities and construction companies.”

Today’s announcement includes:

- 20 roll growth classrooms;
- 8 Kura roll growth classrooms;
- 12 Special education roll growth satellite classrooms;
- Complete redevelopment of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngā Mokopuna; and
- Redevelopment of 4 classrooms at Te Kura-a-iwi o Whakatupuranga Rua Mano (Otaki).
