Police Minister Stuart Nash has offered his sympathies to the family of the man shot by Police today in Tauranga.

“It is appropriate that independent external agencies, including the IPCA and Coroner, will examine the circumstances of the death, and I will not comment on the details of today’s shooting,” Mr Nash said.

“My sympathies and condolences go out to the man’s family. I also recognise how frightening the last few hours have been for the woman and children caught up in this traumatic incident. They will receive support from Police to help them with the days, weeks and months ahead.

“It is important to also acknowledge the distressing impact this shooting will have on the officers involved. We trust Police to make the best decisions in extreme situations. Police put themselves in harm’s way in order to keep the public safe. This will stay with them.

“I encourage the officers and other Police staff to take advantage of all the support and assistance available to them to help deal with today’s events,” Mr Nash said.
