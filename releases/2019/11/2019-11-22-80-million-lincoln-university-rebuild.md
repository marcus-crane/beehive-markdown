The Government has approved $80 million to help Lincoln University rebuild its earthquake-damaged science facilities, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

“The funding will assist Lincoln’s recovery by replacing damaged buildings with teaching and research spaces that are safe, modern, flexible and future-proofed, and which are attractive to students, staff, and research and investment partners,” Chris Hipkins said.

“At the same time Lincoln will be modernising the way it teaches, undertakes research, and partners with other agencies.”

As previously approved by the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation, Crown Research Institute AgResearch will build complementary research facilities on the same site.

“The arrangement will enable greater collaboration between students, researchers and commercial partners and make the Lincoln precinct a real power-house of science and research, with an ability to tackle some of the biggest challenges and sustainability issues facing the land-based sector,” Chris Hipkins said.

“This announcement is another sign of this government’s commitment to New Zealand’s agri-tech industry.

“Together these innovations will benefit not just Lincoln and its community but the country as a whole.

“We’re providing a greater return on research and development through improving connections with industry, and an increase in the number of land-based sector graduates – something which is sorely needed.

“It will drive continued improvements to the sector’s global competitiveness.”

The funding follows a revised business case received from Lincoln in August. It will be released in stages over the next five years as various phases of the rebuilding are completed.

A Programme Governance Oversight Group, with an independent chair and senior representatives from Lincoln University and the Crown, will be set up to oversee the work and ensure strong accountability for funding.
