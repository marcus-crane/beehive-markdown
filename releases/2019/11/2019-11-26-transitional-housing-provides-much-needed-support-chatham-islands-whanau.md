A new transitional whare will go a long way in helping to ease the serious housing shortage on the Chatham Islands (Rēkohu/Wharekauri), says Minister for Māori Development Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Minister for Whānau Ora Hon Peeni Henare.

Three two-bedroom units were officially opened by Minister Henare this morning at a dawn service in Waitangi.

“I am honoured to be here with the people of Rēkohu/ Wharekauri to open this special housing project. Safe, warm and accessible housing is fundamental to our health and wellbeing,” Minister Henare says.

“Housing is a major concern for some Chatham Islanders, and some of the issues they face are unique to their environment. For example, if the whare they rent is being sold or whānau return home to the Chatham Islands there are even fewer options to rent or buy land.”

Te Puni Kōkiri has worked alongside Hā o Te Ora o Wharekauri Trust to ensure this housing project provides short-term accommodation for whānau who need it most.

Minister Mahuta commends the Trust and wider whānau for their focus on whānau wellbeing and recognising the power of the whānau and community to make decisions that improve their lives.

“Rēkohu/Wharekauri is a unique, isolated part of the country. With a population of about 600 permanent residents, whānau are sometimes exposed to extreme elements. Dry, well built homes are critical for the island’s whānau to stay healthy and well.

“Together, whānau Māori are working with the Government to help the community achieve their housing aspirations which go further than a roof over their head,” Minister Mahuta says.

Te Puni Kōkiri has invested $1.2 million into this project with Hā o Te Ora o Wharekauri Trust contributing an additional $20,000. Te Pūtahitanga o te Waipounamu – the Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency in the South Island contributed funding to furnish the homes.

Hā o Te Ora o Wharekauri Trust is a Whānau Ora provider that helps whānau achieve their wellbeing aspirations, including housing. With support from Te Puni Kōkiri Māori Housing Network this whānau drive their own community development moemoeā.

**He tautoko e tino hiahiatia ana ngā whare whakawhitinga mō te whānau o te Wharekauri** 

He āwhina nui ngā whare whakawhitinga hei hiki i te taumaha o te iti o ngā whare e wātea ana ki Rēkohu/Te Wharekauri te kī a te Minita Whanaketanga Māori Te Hōnore Nanaia Mahuta me te Minita Whānau Ora Te Hōnore Peeni Henare.

Nō te ata tonu nei i hura ōkawa ai ngā whare e toru me ōna rūma moe e rua ki ia whare.

“Nōku te hōnore kia tū ngātahi ai ki te taha o te iwi o Rēkohu/Te Wharekauri ki te whakatuwhera i tēnei kaupapa whare motuhake i tēnei rangi. He mea matua ki tō tātou hauora, oranga hoki te whare haumaru, mahana, e tareka paitia hoki," te kōrero a Minita Henare.

“He āwangawanga nui te tino kore nei o ngā whare e wātea ana mō ētahi o te iwi o Rēkohu/Te Wharekauri, e ahurei hoki ētahi o ngā raru o tō rātou taiao. Hei tauira, ki te hokona te whare e rīhi ana rātou, ka hoki mai rānei ngā whānau ki Rēkohu/Te Wharekauri, he whāiti ngā whiringa rīhi, hoko whenua rānei.

I mahi tahi ko Te Puni Kōkiri me te Hā o Te Ora o Wharekauri Trust ki te mātua whakarite ka whai wāhi mai ngā whānau e tino raru ana ki ngā whare wā-poto nei.

E rere ana ngā mihi a Minita Mahuta ki te Trust me te whānau whānui hoki i arotahi ai ki te oranga o te whānau, me tā rātou kitenga i te mana o te whānau, o te hapori hoki ki te whiriwhiri i ō rātou ake whakatau.

“He wāhi tūhāhā, ahurei hoki a Rēkohu/Te Wharekauri o tō tātou whenua. Ka kaha whiua te motu me ōna tāngata āhua ono rau e ngā āhuatanga o Tāwhirimātea, o Tangaroa. He matua ngā whare pakari, ngā whare maroke, he tika hoki te hanga kia pai ai te hauora, te ora hoki o ngā whānau kei te motu.

E mahi ngātahi ana te iwi Māori te Kāwanatanga ki te āwhina i te hapori ki te whakatutuki i ō rātou wawata, he mea nui ake tērā i te tuanui i runga ake i te upoko,“ te kī a Minita Mahuta
