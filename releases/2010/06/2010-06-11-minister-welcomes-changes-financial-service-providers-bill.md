Commerce Minister Simon Power has welcomed changes to the Financial Service Providers (Pre-Implementation Adjustments) Bill by the Commerce Select Committee.

The bill was reported back to the House today.

The primary changes recommended by the committee include:

- Focusing the financial adviser regime on those who provide personalised advice as a central part of their business.
- Simplifying the regime for advisers to wholesale clients.
- Clarifying the meaning of a number of key terms, including "financial planning".
- Changing the Qualifying Financial Entity (QFE) model to accommodate groups of entities.
- Expanding the powers of the Government and the Securities Commission to provide exemptions.
- Amendments to strengthen the Securities Commission's power to monitor and enforce the legislation.

"These changes provide greater certainty to both consumers and the financial sector.

"They offer good solutions that balance the objectives of business efficiency and consumer protection.

"Now that the adjustments have been made and the pathway to compliance announced, our focus is getting on with the implementation of this regime."

Financial service providers must be registered by December this year. Financial advisers, however, have until March 31 next year to be registered. This will allow advisers seeking approval from the Securities Commission for authorisation status to obtain the necessary approvals by 1 July next year.
