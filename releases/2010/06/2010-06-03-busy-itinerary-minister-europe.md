Defence and Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp is on his way to Singapore and Europe today for a series of international meetings in both portfolios.

Dr Mapp will attend the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore later this week.

"The Dialogue is an excellent chance for discussions about key issues with other Defence leaders in the region," he said.

From Singapore the Minister will go to France for a bilateral visit. He will then attend an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Defence Ministers meeting on Afghanistan in Brussels.

"This will be another crucial year in Afghanistan. The meeting will include a briefing from the ISAF commander, General Stanley McChrystal, on the current situation there," Dr Mapp said.

The Minister's last major meeting will be the 2010 International Square Kilometre Array Forum (ISKAF) in the Netherlands.

"ISKAF is a very exciting possibility for New Zealand. This is a meeting of the key decision-makers for the project. Our presence is an important signal of the Government's support for the joint New Zealand-Australia bid for hosting rights," the Minister said.

Dr Mapp returns to New Zealand on 19 June.
