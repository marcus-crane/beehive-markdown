Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee departs today to lead the second of six ministerial missions to the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, China.

The trade mission brings to China some of New Zealand's leading companies in the aviation sector and will visit Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai from 7-11 June 2010.

Mr Brownlee says the primary objective of the mission is to develop long-term relationships with key Chinese agencies and counterpart companies operating in the aviation sector in China.

"China is already the world's second largest air travel market, and their wider aviation industry is growing steadily.

"China is investing considerably in airport infrastructure, with 97 new airports planned by 2020 to meet future requirements.  Passenger numbers and cargo volumes across China are growing, and it is estimated the country will need an additional 2,500 aircraft by 2015, all of which will need trained pilots, signalling that demand for flight schools will continue to increase.

"This all equates to significant opportunities across the aviation sector for New Zealand businesses."

Mr Brownlee says that in addition to representing their own business interests, the strength of this delegation is in demonstrating to Chinese counterparts the value proposition offered more broadly by New Zealand business, and how competitive our services are.

Travelling with the minister are chief executives and senior representatives of Air New Zealand, ATRAX Group, Aviation New Zealand, Christchurch Engine Centre, CTC Aviation Training, Gallagher Group, Glidepath, Peet Aviation and UFL.

The mission is timed specifically around the Shanghai World Expo and presents a unique opportunity to celebrate and showcase New Zealand with important Chinese contacts.

During the mission the Minister will meet with the National Reform and Development Commission in Beijing, visit the Tianjin Technological-Economic Development Area in Tianjin province, meet with the Civil Aviation Administration of China New Era Airport Design and Research Institute, and address a KEA function in Shanghai.
