Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of three new members to the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute (MACI) board.

Ken Raureti, Robyn Bargh and Tupara Morrison have been appointed for three years from June 9.

Dr Coleman says the new appointees bring a wealth of tourism and business experience which will provide added commercial and cultural leadership to the board.

‘'MACI plays an important role in the preservation and promotion of Maori arts and crafts throughout New Zealand and providing tourism services that promote Maori culture to our domestic and international visitors".

‘'The new board members are well respected as leaders within business and Maoridom. They have the experience and know-how to help develop and strengthen MACIs commercial and cultural direction.''

‘'I'd also like to thank outgoing board members Maureen Waka and Peter Brown for their service,'' Dr Coleman says.

**Background:**

MACI was established by the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Act 1963 to encourage, foster and promote all types of Maori culture and practice and appreciation of Maori arts and crafts. Developing and maintaining tourism attractions and exhibitions in the Rotorua district is another core feature of MACI.
