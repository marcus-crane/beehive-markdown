The Government will give careful consideration to the Law Commission's report on the review of the War Pensions Act 1954, Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins said.

"This is the most comprehensive review of the approach to the provision of services to veterans undertaken since the War Pensions Act was enacted in 1954," Ms Collins said. 

"The Law Commission's report contains 170 recommendations and these will need careful consideration from the Government.

"I wish to thank the Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer for his personal commitment to this review." 

The Government has 120 working days to present its response to the House.
