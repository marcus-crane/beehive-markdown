Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong welcomes the release of the Asian workforce report by Employment Minister Hon Paula Bennett.  This is the first official report to focus on the importance and significance of the Asian workforce to New Zealand's economy.  The report will help inform Government policy making and planning on how to unleash the potential of this workforce.

The Minister endorses the effort to disaggregate the collective term ‘Asian' into North Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian and Other Asian.  "This will give rise to a better understanding of the profile, qualifications and employment status of each of these diverse groups.  This will aid educationalists and government and private sector employers in their understanding and actions," said Mrs Wong.

"The analysis of the underemployment and unemployment of this workforce comes as no surprise to me.  The report's findings endorse National-led Government policies such as the 90-day trial employment period for small business employers.  They are encouraged to put aside their perceptions of language barriers and a lack of local experience to give the Asian workforce a go.

"The high percentage of self-employment reported also compliments the Office of Ethnic Affair's business forums.  These forums highlight the international linkages and business expertise of this group and provide the platform for government agencies, non-Asian businesses and Asian businesses to connect and join forces to expand overseas for the benefit of our economy."
