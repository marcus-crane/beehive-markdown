Justice Minister Simon Power today officially opened the North Shore Public Defence Service.

The PDS was initially piloted in 2004 to provide an in-house, high-quality legal aid service through the use of salaried staff, rather than contracted lawyers.

"The expansion is part of the Government's work on ensuring that everyone, not just a privileged few, can afford access to justice," Mr Power said.

"As well as providing a high-quality service, the PDS also provides training and supervision for junior lawyers, encourages competition, and offers a benchmark for the cost of the service."

The North Shore PDS was funded out of Budget 2009, which provided $5.3 million for it to be rolled out across all of Auckland's courts.

"The North Shore PDS will undertake a maximum caseload of 33 per cent of the total number of assigned cases at the court which, based on current volumes, would equate to 670 cases a year."

Dame Margaret Bazley said in her report into the legal aid system that she saw the PDS playing an increasingly important role in the delivery of legal aid services, and recommended it be expanded into Hamilton, Wellington, and Christchurch.

"The Government agrees with that. We see the PDS playing an essential role in providing a high-quality legal aid service for those who use it and the taxpayers who pay for it."

The PDS is part of the Government's legal aid reforms, which include a new quality assurance framework for legal aid lawyers, improvements to the duty lawyer and preferred lawyer policies, ensuring consistent standards for community law centres, streamlining processes for assessing low-cost criminal cases, and bringing the functions of the Legal Services Agency into the Ministry of Justice.
