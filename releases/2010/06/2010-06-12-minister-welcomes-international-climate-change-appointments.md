International Climate Change Negotiations Minister Tim Groser today applauded the election of New Zealand's Climate Change Ambassador, Adrian Macey, to the position of Vice-Chair of the Kyoto Protocol Negotiations process.

"This is an impressive achievement for Dr Macey and for New Zealand. I congratulate Dr Macey on this election," Minister Groser said.

"His election as Vice-Chair is an honour that reflects the esteem in which Dr Macey is held internationally. It also shows that New Zealand is a highly regarded, constructive player in the international climate change negotiations."

Macey has been Climate Change Ambassador since the position was established in 2006. His term as Kyoto Protocol Vice-Chair will be for the remainder of 2010. The election was by consensus of the 191 parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at a meeting in Bonn, Germany yesterday.

At the same time, Minister Groser welcomed the appointment of New Zealand's new Climate Change Ambassador, Joanne Tyndall. 

"Ms Tyndall will bring significant expertise and negotiating experience to this role," Mr Groser said.

"Her background in senior management is complemented by considerable experience in international negotiations, including as part of the New Zealand negotiating team to the GATT Uruguay Round."

The Climate Change Ambassador's primary role is to lead New Zealand's international climate change negotiations.  Negotiations are currently underway to secure a comprehensive global agreement as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

Ms Tyndall will take up the role from her previous position as member of the senior management team at the Ministry of Culture and Heritage. She has previously worked as Chief Executive of New Zealand on Air, and had been posted to Geneva with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
