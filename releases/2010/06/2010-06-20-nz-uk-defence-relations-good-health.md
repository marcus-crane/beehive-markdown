Defence Minister Wayne Mapp held a formal bilateral meeting with new British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox at the Ministry of Defence in London late last week. 

"It was an excellent meeting. The two countries share many interests," Dr Mapp said. "To have such a meeting so early in the term of the new British Government is a clear indicator of the strength of the bilateral Defence relationship."

The pair met as Dr Mapp concluded a visit to the UK after attending the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and a NATO/ISAF Defence Ministers meeting in Brussels.

"Our discussion of Afghanistan was an invaluable follow-up to the more formal meetings held in Brussels. The British Government has been in office for only a month but Dr Fox has already visited Afghanistan and brings a fresh perspective to the table.

"Within the Asia-Pacific region, as two of the partners in the long-standing Five Power Defence Arrangements, we have a mutual interest in ensuring that the agreement remains a contributor to regional stability. This relationship is a vital element of the region's security framework," Dr Mapp said. 

"Dr Fox indicated that Britain would be looking to strengthen the engagement of Britain within the Asia-Pacific.

"He was also very interested in our process for the ongoing New Zealand Defence Review. A similar review is about to take place in the UK.

"We have got in early and laid the foundations of an even stronger and more productive Defence relationship. I look forward to our future meetings," he said.
