New Zealand television celebrates a special milestone today with the 50th anniversary of the first television broadcast.

‘'The industry has served viewers well for half-a-century and we've been treated to some great television, characters and legendary presenters over the years. With rapid technological changes, the next 50 years are shaping to break new ground for television,'' says Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

 ‘'Television has taken a quantum leap forward since the first transmission streamed out of Auckland 50 years ago. It was limited to Auckland and to only two hours a week on Monday nights.

‘'There was no money for new programmes, so in addition to test patterns, Auckland viewers enjoyed clips from old National Film Unit newsreels and whatever free content the then New Zealand Broadcasting Service could beg, borrow or steal.

‘'Today we can watch high definition, colour programmes across multiple channels, both free-to-air and pay, 24 hours a day and pre-record all our favourite programmes at the push of a button.

‘'Just as television has changed dramatically in the last 50 years, digital convergence between the internet, telecommunications and broadcasting mean that changes are likely to be even more speedy and profound over the next 50 years.''
