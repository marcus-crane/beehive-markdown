State Services Minister Tony Ryall has today announced the final decisions on the changes to a small number of government agencies to drive improved sector performance.

"Ministers have agreed on the details for the new agencies formed out of the public sector changes that were announced in March.  The merged ministry in the science, research and technology sector will be called the Ministry of Science and Innovation" Mr Ryall says.

"To ensure that there is an independent process for allocating research funds, the Science Minister will establish one or more boards to make these independent funding allocation decisions."

"Archives New Zealand and the National Library will merge with the Department of Internal Affairs, with legislative change to ensure the Chief Archivist's independence and to continue a National Library, the role of the National Librarian, and the status of the Alexander Turnbull Library.  Archives and the National Library will be moving more of their collections on-line with DIA support."

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority are implementing the changes announced in March and are on track for amalgamation on 1 July 2010.

It is expected that once the transitions are complete they will yield savings in the order of $25 million or greater over the period to 2013/14.  One-off costs of transition are estimated at $12.3 million (almost all in 2010/11), with ongoing savings of approximately $8 million per annum.
