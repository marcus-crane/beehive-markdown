Renewable electricity generation remained high at 73 per cent of total electricity generation in the March 2010 quarter, Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee says.

The March quarter data is recorded in the latest edition of the New Zealand Energy Quarterly published by the Ministry of Economic Development today.

"High renewable electricity generation levels continue," Mr Brownlee says.

"This quarter the new 132 Megawatt Nga Awa Purua geothermal power station in the central North Island came online, contributing further renewable generation capacity to New Zealand's electricity system."

Other highlights in this quarter's New Zealand Energy Quarterly include:

- coal production returning to normal levels
- a 16 per cent increase in the production of petroleum products following a capacity upgrade at the Marsden Point refinery
- a decrease in petrol and diesel demand

The New Zealand Energy Quarterly presents quarterly statistics on the supply of major fuels, electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions, and prices to the end of March 2010.

The New Zealand Energy Quarterly is part of a suite of energy publications produced by the Ministry of Economic Development. It is free to download or subscribe to by going to [www.med.govt.nz/energy/nzeq](http://www.med.govt.nz/energy/nzeq)
