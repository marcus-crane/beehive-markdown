A review of pharmacy recalls will start next week and be completed within a month, Health Minister Tony Ryall announced today.

"There have been a number of recalls of medicines from pharmacists' shelves recently.  These recalls are an important part of ensuring the public have access to safe and effective medicines as medicines that don't measure up are recalled" said Mr Ryall.

"Pharmacists have asked whether the processes, contracting and compensation arrangements for medicine recalls are adequate.  I believe the issue could benefit from closer scrutiny."

The Ministry of Health will undertake the review which will include seeking input from appropriate people in the sector. The Director General of Health will advise the Government in a month's time.

An external advisor will be appointed to assist with the review.

The review will start immediately after Queen's Birthday Weekend on Tuesday 8 June.
