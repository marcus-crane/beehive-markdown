Prime Minister John Key has announced that China's Vice President Xi Jinping will visit New Zealand from 17-19 June.

"The visit offers an excellent opportunity for us to discuss a range of issues of importance to both countries," says Mr Key.

"The significant growth of trade under the China-New Zealand FTA will be a particular focus.

"The Vice President's visit is further evidence of the strength of the economic and political connections between China and New Zealand."

Vice President Xi's visit will include meetings with the Prime Minister, the Governor-General and the Speaker.

The Vice President will also make a keynote speech to a business luncheon and attend an official dinner hosted by the Prime Minister.

A large delegation of senior Chinese business leaders will also visit New Zealand to coincide with the Vice President's visit. They will participate in a major trade seminar organised by the New Zealand China Trade Association.
