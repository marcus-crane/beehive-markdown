A Bill allowing Police staff to serve as members of local authorities was introduced to the House today by Police Minister Judith Collins.

The Policing (Involvement in Local Authority Elections) Amendment Bill seeks to remove restrictions within the Policing Act 2008 which prevent Police staff serving on local authorities.

Under the Act members of Police wanting to stand for local authorities must be placed on special leave during the campaign period, and required to resign from Police if they are elected.

"The current legislation is undemocratic in excluding Police staff from serving their communities in local government," Ms Collins said.

"This Bill will ensure that Police employees are not treated any differently to other state servants who are not prevented by legislation from standing for election and serving on local authorities.

"Police are respected members of their communities. Allowing Police to serve in local government can only build on the strong relationships between Police and community groups, and further contribute to the safety and well-being of those communities."

Police internal policies would be reviewed and updated to ensure any actual or perceived conflict of interest was managed appropriately.

Removing restrictions on Police from holding office was a pledge by National at the 2008 general election.

Ms Collins hopes for cross-party support for the legislation to ensure it is passed in time for the upcoming local government elections.
