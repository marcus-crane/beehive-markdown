Education Minister Anne Tolley has met with China's Minister of Education Yuan Guiren and Vice Minister Hao Ping in Beijing to discuss closer educational ties between New Zealand and China.

"The meeting was extremely positive," said Mrs Tolley.

"We discussed the importance of developing our strategic partnership across three areas - high level research links, vocational training links and growing the teaching of Chinese language and culture in New Zealand schools.

"It augurs well for enhanced education cooperation between our countries in the future and I have invited both Ministers to visit New Zealand to further progress the relationship."

Mrs Tolley also oversaw the China-New Zealand 7th Joint Working Group meeting on education and training while in Beijing.

"Officials will be working on the potential opportunities that arose during this meeting in the weeks and months ahead."

The Group discussed a range of priority areas to develop the education relationship between NZ and China, in particular around higher education and vocational schooling education, as well as ways to support Chinese language in New Zealand.
