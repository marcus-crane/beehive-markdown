Customs Minister Maurice Williamson met with his Australian counterpart Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor in Melbourne today.

"It was an extremely positive meeting and we discussed a number of topics, including streamlining trans-Tasman travel, trans-Tasman trade and engagement in the Pacific," Mr Williamson says.

"The Customs agencies in New Zealand and Australia are making good progress towards our joint goal of streamlining trans-Tasman travel. Initiatives already underway and planned will ultimately make travel simpler," he says.

"We both agreed there had been good uptake of the SmartGate automated passenger processing system on both sides of the Tasman, making border processes easier for passengers."

"New Zealand and Australia have recently carried out a study to track the time it takes cargo crossing the Tasman to be cleared in and out of each country.  The draft findings highlight both customs administrations have efficient clearance processes by international standards," Mr Williamson says.

Mr Williamson and Mr O'Connor also discussed the important contribution both countries make to security and stability in the Pacific.

"New Zealand and Australia both have expertise to contribute and we recognise the need to pool our resources and work together, along with other Pacific countries, to achieve the best outcome in the region," Mr Williamson says.

"Both governments are committed to co-operating and achieving a secure and prosperous region."
