A new Multi-Agency Centre in Counties-Manukau represents the commitment of the Government and community to providing support, care and justice to the victims of child abuse, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Speaking at the opening of the new centre, a joint initiative between Police, Child, Youth and Family, and the Counties-Manukau District Health Board, Ms Collins said all children had the right to grow up free from abuse and violence.

"Sadly, for too many children in this country, home is not a loving, supportive or even a safe place," Ms Collins said.

"When a child's life is marred by the horror of abuse or violence, that child must have somewhere to go, and someone they can turn to for help. That child must be assured of a caring, compassionate, speedy and professional response.

"This innovative facility will help meet the needs of victims by providing a safe and supportive environment where child victims can interact with a team of Police, Child Youth and Family and health professionals."

The centre will also investigate sexual assault against adults and will assess and co-ordinate the need for intervention with the families of these victims. It will allow one-stop access to specialised medical, forensic and psychological services, and enable investigations to be more easily co-ordinated and carried out.

It will also provide a vital link from these agencies back to the many community groups who provide ongoing support to the victims.

"This centre represents the commitment of the Government and this community to better deal with abuse," Ms Collins said.

"It represents our promise to our children and other victims of abuse that we will stand by them, we will protect them and we will bring justice for them."
