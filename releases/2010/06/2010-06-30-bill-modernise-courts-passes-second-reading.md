Justice Minister Simon Power has welcomed the second reading of a bill that enables greater use of video links in courts.

Mr Power told Parliament last night that the changes made by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee strengthened the bill.

"Most of the amendments were minor or technical in nature, but the more significant changes will facilitate the culture change that is needed to ensure greater use of video links in courts.

"In particular, in criminal procedural matters, the judicial officer or registrar will be required to consider whether a participant should appear by video link as long as the technology is available.

"I'm confident the safeguards in this bill will ensure that no defendant will lose their right to participate in and receive a fair trial.

"Before the bill was introduced, it was reviewed by the Attorney-General and Crown Law, and the advice shows it complies with the right to a fair trial in the Bill of Rights Act.

"We should not be afraid to use what is now well-established technology to simplify and speed up the criminal justice system."

The Courts (Remote Participation) Bill:

- Sets out criteria for decisions on the use of video links to protect the fair trial rights of defendants and the interests of other participants.
- Provides a presumption in favour of the use of video links in criminal procedural matters (those where no evidence is being presented).
- Allows video links to be used in criminal substantive matters (those where evidence is being presented with the approval of a judge). In these cases the judge must consider the defendant's ability to comprehend the proceedings, participate in the defence, consult and instruct counsel privately, access relevant evidence, and examine witnesses for the prosecution.
- Allows video links to be used in civil matters at the discretion of the judicial officer or registrar.

About $2 million is being made available in the coming financial year to fund the installation of video-link facilities.

The Ministry of Justice anticipates that by 2014, some of New Zealand's busiest courts could each see up to 2,000 remand prisoner appearances by video link every year.
