Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Phil Heatley today met with Fisheries Ministers and officials from Kiribati, Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu to discuss formalising closer cooperation on fisheries management and development in the Pacific.

"Today's meeting has reinforced the strength of our fisheries relationship.  We are committed to greater cooperation, and we share a common desire for fisheries to be an important driver of sustainable economic growth in the Pacific," said Mr McCully.

"There was support from Ministers for New Zealand's decision to place a greater focus on assisting Pacific island countries to secure and generate greater economic benefits from sustainably-managed fisheries.

"Ministers also agreed that a priority area for development assistance will be increasing employment opportunities in the fisheries sector through greater training opportunities for crew and observers."

Mr Heatley says Ministers also agreed to develop an arrangement on fisheries cooperation among the five countries.

"The arrangement will include a commitment by New Zealand to increase its support in a number of areas, including advancing employment opportunities, strengthening fisheries institutions, and tackling illegal fishing.

"The arrangement will reflect the shared commitment to greater cooperation on a broad range of fisheries issues.  It should provide a useful benchmark for reviewing progress on a regular basis, and will provide an umbrella framework for access discussions.

"Fisheries are a critical resource for economic development in all Pacific Island countries. We are in this together and we are investing for the long term."
