All convicted offenders will pay $50 towards new entitlements and services for victims of serious crime from Thursday.

The compulsory payment is introduced by the Sentencing (Offender Levy) Amendment Act 2009.

Justice Minister Simon Power says the offender levy is part of the Government's drive to put victims of crime at the centre of the justice system.

"Addressing the negative impact of crime on victims is a priority for this Government, and the offender levy will go a long way to addressing the financial and emotional costs that fall on them.

"Victims of crime have been neglected for too long. This move will ensure offenders contribute to addressing the harm they cause."

The $50 levy will be imposed automatically on all convicted offenders at sentencing - regardless of the crime they commit. It will be collected after reparation and before fines, and will be in addition to any sentence or court order. 

It is estimated it will collect $13.6 million over the first four years, and this will be used to fund eight additional entitlements and services for victims of serious crime:

- An enhanced homicide support service which will provide four paid homicide support co-ordinators to work with Victim Support's volunteer network. This will be rolled out from Thursday.
- An increase in the discretionary grant for families of homicide victims which are suffering financial difficulties, from $1,500 to $5,000. This was implemented last November.
- A court service for victims of sexual violence which will give them access to a trained adviser who understands the dynamics of sexual violence cases and victims' needs. This will be implemented from Thursday.
- A grant of $250 towards the expenses incurred as a result of sexual violence, such as replacing items of clothing collected for forensic evidence. This came into effect last January.
- Increases in travel, accommodation and childcare assistance for victims attending court proceedings, from $1,000 to $3,000, and Parole Board hearings, from $500 to $1,500. This was implemented last November.
- A High Court attendance grant of $124 per person per day for up to five adult members of a homicide victim's family. This was implemented in January.
- A funeral grant of up to $4,500 to families of homicide victims, on top of the $5,500 available through ACC. This was implemented last November.
- New information resources, including a DVD, pamphlets and a redesigned victims' website [www.victimsinfo.govt.nz](http://www.victimsinfo.govt.nz/), which will give victims of crime access to simple and accurate information about the criminal justice system, including an outline of the court process and support services available. This material will be distributed from Thursday.

"I'm confident these entitlements and services will make a real difference to the victims of crime.

"I don't pretend we can take away the pain of victims' loss or injury, but we can help smooth the way.

"I'm particularly pleased that every convicted offender will provide funding for these new services. 

"It's important they contribute to addressing the harm their behaviour causes victims."
