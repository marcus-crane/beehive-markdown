Over 4,400 hectares of land have been officially added to Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The new additions consist of areas at Okarito Lagoon, Three Mile Lagoon on the coast south of Okarito, Alpine Lake and further land at Omoeroa Bluff, Waikukupa and Gillespies Beach.

"Westland Tai Poutini National Park features some of New Zealand's most breath-taking scenery and the new areas enhance its integrity.

"It's fantastic that these new parcels of land can be added to the park in the year it celebrates its 50th anniversary," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The additions include wetlands, lake beds, river margins and forests that are home to our native flora and wildlife.

"All have high conservation values and are worthy of the protection status enjoyed by the surrounding land.

"The Government is dedicated to enhancing and protecting the natural values in our national parks for the benefit of all New Zealanders."

The New Zealand Conservation Authority had recommended the areas be added to the park over the past few years. The changes were officially gazetted today.
