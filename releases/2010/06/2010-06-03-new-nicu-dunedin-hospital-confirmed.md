Dunedin Hospital is to get a new Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

Health Minister Tony Ryall has confirmed the new NICU, as part of a $24.4 million development of the Southern DHB's Dunedin facilities.

Other developments will see the acute mental health unit moving to Wakari Hospital, and a long-overdue upgrade of the main telephone switchboard and standby generators.

"The new Government inherited a lot of problems here in Dunedin, including important building needs that had been neglected for years."

"The new NICU will include 19 cots. The current unit is over-worked. At any one time, up to 21 babies are being cared for in a unit that NICU design standards indicate should accommodate three babies."

"Families don't enjoy the privacy of other NICUs, and there is a very limited ability for parents to stay with their babies."

"The new acute mental health facilities at Wakari Hospital will fix a long-standing problem. According to the Ministry of Health, Dunedin's Ward 1A is the highest priority mental health unit for replacement in the country. "

The total funding package is being invested in:

- NICU plus enabling project $5.3 million
- Wakari developments $15.2 million
- Infrastructure projects at Dunedin $3.9

"The Southern DHB is faced with significant financial challenges. The Government expects the DHB to focus strongly on reducing administrative costs and overhead to support frontline services," Mr Ryall says.
