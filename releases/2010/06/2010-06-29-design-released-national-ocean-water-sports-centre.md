The design for a new National Ocean Water Sports Centre at Takapuna was released today by Sports Minister Murray McCully, and North Shore City Mayor Andrew Williams.

The $8 million centre for sailing, triathlon and ocean kayaking is part of the major expansion of New Zealand's high performance sport facilities announced by Prime Minister John Key on Friday. 

The Government and North Shore City Council have each committed $3 million to the $8 million centre, with the balance to be raised by the sporting sector. North Shore City's contribution is subject to approval from the Auckland Transitional Authority.

"The Ocean Water Sports Centre will be a valuable adjunct to the Millennium Institute, now the National Training Centre for High Performance Sport," Mr McCully said.

"It brings together Yachting New Zealand's high performance programmes into a single hub at a purpose-built facility on the edge of Takapuna beach.

"Athletes will receive specialist training in their discipline on the beach, while having ready access to the near-by National Training Centre's world-class fitness training, sports medicine, and sports science work.

"The Ocean Water Sports Centre will also be an outstanding venue for hosting major international yachting events, complete with media and corporate hospitality facilities," Mr McCully said.

"Securing the National Ocean Water Sports Centre for the North Shore is wonderful news and places Takapuna on the international water sports map," Mr Williams said.

"Coupled with the expansion of the Millennium Institute, it will make the North Shore known internationally as the headquarters of elite high performance water sports. The potential spin offs for growth and tourism are enormous.

"The centre will provide an ideal vantage point during national and international regattas, and swimming, kayaking, and triathlon events at Takapuna beach and in the Hauraki Gulf."
