The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, has written to Telecom Chief Executive Paul Reynolds to lay out the government's expectations around the 111 emergency calling system.

This year the 111 system, which is operated by Telecom as part of its Telecommunications Services Obligation (TSO) with the Crown, has experienced a number of partial outages.

As well as advice from Telecom and officials from the Ministry of Economic Development, the Minister has received two independent reports on the outages.  The reports and advice have identified a number of issues with 111, including:

- Unclear governance arrangements
- Infrastructure issues
- Arrangements that have not kept pace with mobile phone technology.

"I have today written to Telecom requesting that the company works closely and with urgency with the government towards developing a comprehensive agreement with government that:

- Clearly sets out roles for Telecom, the Government and other industry players
- Includes an agreed asset management plan for 111 facilities, including underlying infrastructure like the PSTN and TASS,
- Has a comprehensive set of performance measures,
- Includes business continuity plans for managing situations when 111 operations do not perform as expected; and
- Agrees to proactive, independent audits to regularly monitor Telecom's compliance with the agreement.

"The telecommunications industry structure has evolved quickly in recent times and while Telecom remains the core infrastructural player, there is a need for 111 governance arrangements that reflect the evolving shape of the industry," says Mr Joyce. 

"I will be working closely with industry to ensure these arrangements are made.

"It is essential that New Zealanders have confidence in their emergency calling system and the recent spate of ongoing outages has been undermining that confidence.

"Telecom has been moving to address immediate infrastructural concerns.  I am asking them now to work swiftly with government and the rest of the industry to ensure 111 remains robust system in the future."
