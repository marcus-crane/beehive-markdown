A further $5.738 million is being injected into critical social services under the Government's Community Response Fund. 

"This means 131 community organisations get added support to provide social services to communities," says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

This is round three of the fund, established last year to help NGOs meet critical demand while under financial pressure from an economic recession.

Community organisations apply for funding under two criteria: financial crisis and increased demand, including innovative ways to meet increased demand. 

Round Three has seen increased applications with innovative solutions.

"This shows organisations are thinking smarter about how to respond to increasingly complex needs of their communities," says Ms Bennett.

"We're seeing greater collaboration and more sharing of back office functions among providers who continue to improve as a result, " says Ms Bennett.

"The Community Response Fund is changing the ways services are delivered, as well as ensuring groups providing vital community services continue to meet increased demand," Ms Bennett said.

To date, the Community Response Fund has provided $25 million to 479 organisations across the country.

Applications for Round Four of the Community Response Fund opened in February and will close in July.
