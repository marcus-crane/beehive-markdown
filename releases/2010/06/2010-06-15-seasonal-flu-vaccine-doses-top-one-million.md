One million New Zealanders have had a flu vaccination this year - a new record.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "This is the biggest number of people vaccinated against the flu ever - last year 960,000 doses were distributed during the whole season."

"While last year's pandemic was mild for most, it was severe for some and over 1000 people were hospitalised," Mr Ryall says.

"District health boards, doctors, practice nurses and public health units have done a great job to help so many New Zealanders be protected against seasonal and pandemic swine flu this year."

"We have also extended the time during which eligible people can get a free vaccine this year beyond June 30, and I urge people to take up this offer while vaccine stocks last."  

Eligible people are those at greatest risk of complications from pandemic Influenza, including women who are pregnant, children under five, severely overweight people and those with underlying medical conditions.

The number of consultations for influenza-like illness has been increasing, particularly over the past two weeks. There have been 18 confirmed cases of swine flu this year to date, including one admitted to ICU.

Many general practices are seeing more young children who are unwell.
