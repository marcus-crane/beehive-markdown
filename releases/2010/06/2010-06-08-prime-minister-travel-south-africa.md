Prime Minister John Key will travel to South Africa on June 19 to support the All Whites World Cup football campaign, undertake business meetings and open the New Zealand High Commission premises in Pretoria.

Mr Key will leave New Zealand on June 19 and attend the All Whites vs Italy World Cup pool match in Nelspruit on June 20.

While in South Africa Mr Key will also meet leading South African business figures and open the New Zealand High Commission.

"As All Whites Patron for the 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign, I'm proud to have the opportunity to support the All Whites in South Africa," Mr Key says.

"The team's qualification for the World Cup finals captured the imagination of New Zealanders and the whole country is right behind the team as it embarks on this fantastic mission in South Africa.

"I've been fortunate to have met Ricki Herbert and the guys several times now and they are great ambassadors for our country. I know I speak for all New Zealanders when I wish them all the best for their World Cup matches."

The visit is also an opportunity to strengthen ties with South Africa through the opening of New Zealand's new High Commission premises in Pretoria.

"New Zealand has very strong and positive connections with South Africa, not least through sport, and the World Cup is a wonderful chance for South Africa to showcase itself as a nation and build on those ties," Mr Key says.

Mr Key will also meet with business leaders in South Africa before returning to New Zealand on June 22. The visit will be the first Prime Ministerial visit to South Africa since 2002.
