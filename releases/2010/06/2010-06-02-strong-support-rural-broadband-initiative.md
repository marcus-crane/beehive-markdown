The Government has received 39 expressions of interest in the first stage of the Rural Broadband Initiative tender process. 

"The response to the Government's Rural Broadband Initiative is very pleasing - in number and breadth," said Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce. 

"Interest has come from infrastructure companies from New Zealand and abroad, and includes nine substantial expressions of interest covering the entire country.

"The responses have generated numerous options for the deployment of fast broadband to rural communities and schools. Ministry of Economic Development officials will be considering these over the next couple of months before the release of the Request for Proposals in August."

The Request for Proposals will outline the scope of infrastructure to be funded in the first year, minimum standards and clear evaluation criteria.

The rural broadband initiative will see, within six years:

- 93% of rural schools will receive fibre, enabling speeds of at least 100Mbps, with the remaining 7% to achieve speeds of at least 10Mbps.
- Over 80% of rural households will have access to broadband with speeds of at least 5Mbps, with the remainder to achieve speeds of at least 1Mbps.
