Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia has told a Maori Affairs Select Committee today that she is delighted at the momentum being generated around Whanau Ora.

Mrs Turia told the committee that she had seen the enthusiasm first hand when she spoke at 12 Whanau Ora hui last month for groups interested in delivering Whanau Ora.

"There has been an enthusiastic response from iwi who are responding to their natural interest and responsibility in taking care of their own.

"The feedback I have been receiving is that already groups are collaborating and working together to understand how to best work with a Whanau Ora approach."

This morning the select committee also heard Te Puni Kokiri Chief Executive Leith Comer describe the leverage that the Whanau Ora funding would influence across Government; and the potential for the approach to influence multiple appropriations across the sector.  

Mrs Turia concluded that she is heartened by the significant interest that Whanau Ora has already attracted in its first few months of implementation.

"Whanau Ora represents a significant investment by a Government which has never been so bold. It is a great sign for the future of whanau."
