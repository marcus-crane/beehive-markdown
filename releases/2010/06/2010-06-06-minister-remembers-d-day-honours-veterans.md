Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins has today honoured the veterans of D-Day on the 66th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, France.

The Normandy landings marked the beginning of the Allied invasion of German-occupied Europe.

"The selfless contribution of New Zealand service personnel to the Normandy invasion helped pave the way for Allied victory in Europe," Ms Collins said.

"We cannot forget the sacrifices made by those Kiwis involved in the D-Day landings of World War Two. Today we pay tribute to their service, and remember those who did not return."

The invasion force comprised mainly of American, British and Canadian troops, although many New Zealanders serving in the Royal Navy, the Merchant Navy and the Royal Air Force helped in the transport of troops to France and the provision of air support to the landing forces. 

The New Zealand Merchant Navy ships *Monowai,* used as an assault landing ship, and *Aorangi*, used as a depot ship and casualty clearing station, were also part of the D-day fleet.
