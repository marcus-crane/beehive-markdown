Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee and Chilean Minister of Energy Dr Ricardo Raineri Bernain met in Wellington today and affirmed the growing importance of the energy relationship between New Zealand and Chile.

"The Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (P4) has provided a strong framework on which to build linkages between New Zealand and Chile in the energy sector," Mr Brownlee said.

Dr Raineri arrived in New Zealand immediately following the 9th APEC Energy Ministerial meeting in Japan.  Both Ministers agreed that APEC provided a valuable framework for energy cooperation.

"New Zealand and Chile are geographically similar, with common potential for the development of renewable energies," Mr Brownlee said.

Sectors of mutual interest include geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass, biofuels, and marine energy.

"We have agreed to build on existing agreements and arrangements to promote strengthened energy linkages, including between relevant government agencies, research and science institutes, universities and businesses," Mr Brownlee said.
