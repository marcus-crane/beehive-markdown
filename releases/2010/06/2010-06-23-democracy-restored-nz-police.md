Democracy has been restored for the New Zealand Police following the passing of a Bill allowing Police staff to serve in local government, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

The Policing (Involvement in Local Authority) Amendment Bill, which was passed by Parliament today, removes restrictions within the Policing Act 2008 which prevented Police staff serving on local authorities.

Previously, Police wanting to stand for local authorities had to be placed on special leave during the campaign, and were required to resign from Police if they were elected.

"The previous legislation excluded Police staff from serving their communities in local government. I am delighted to say that democracy has been restored," Ms Collins said.

"The Government is committed to supporting our Police and their rights as private citizens. This change will ensure that Police staff are not treated any differently to other State servants who are not prevented by legislation from standing for election and serving on local authorities."

Ms Collins said the Bill had been passed in time for this year's local government elections.

"The Bill gives certainty to those Police staff who intend to stand for the elections later this year and it will give them time to plan their campaigns.

"Police are respected members of their communities. Allowing Police to serve in local government can only build on the strong relationships between Police and community groups."

Police internal policies would be reviewed and updated to ensure any actual or perceived conflicts of interest were managed appropriately.

Removing restrictions on Police from holding office was a pledge by National at the 2008 general election.
