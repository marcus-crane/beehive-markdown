Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne has labelled the decision of the Kapiti Coast District Council to continue water fluoridation for central Waikanae, Paraparaumu and Raumati as "courageous" in the face of an aggressive and personally threatening campaign from the anti-fluoride lobby. 

"I personally thank the councillors who voted in support of the continued fluoridation of water supplies in what is an extremely emotive issue," said Mr Dunne, "I also congratulate Mayor Jenny Rowan for not using her casting vote to penalise members of her community who are most at-risk of suffering from poorer oral health."

"Voting for the retention of water fluoridation can be a thankless position in the face of often ill-informed and aggressive opposition."

"I am appalled, although not surprised, by the reported tactics of anti-fluoride campaigners. In the same vein, the messages I have received from them in the wake of the Far North's decision to discontinue water fluoridation have focused more on personal abuse than the facts."

"Water fluoridation is the most effective public health measure to protect our teeth, and is especially important for children and those most disadvantaged."

"The Council's decision supports the efforts by the Hutt Valley District Health Board to improve the oral health of children in the Kapiti region.  Prevention of tooth decay, through water fluoridation, is not only better but cheaper than any cure."

Studies suggest that it costs around 30 times more to treat a case of tooth decay than to prevent it through fluoridation.  

"I encourage the citizens of Paekakariki and Otaki to lobby the Kapiti Coast District Council to consider extending fluoridation to their areas also. It makes no sense for communities to suffer from poor oral health standards when they can have access to a safe and cost-effective health measure such as water fluoridation," said Mr Dunne.
