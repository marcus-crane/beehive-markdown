Families of homicide victims will receive additional support from Thursday as part of a package of initiatives to help victims of crime, Justice Minister Simon Power said today.

The package will be funded by the $50 offender levy, which is to be paid by all convicted offenders from Thursday.

"The need for further support for families of homicide victims has been raised a number of times by organisations with close relationships with these victims," Mr Power said.

"Addressing the negative impact of crime on victims is a priority for this Government, and these initiatives go a long way to addressing the financial and emotional costs that fall on them."

From Thursday, the homicide support service provided by Victim Support volunteers will receive funding for four regional homicide support co-ordinators and training for 100 volunteer support workers nationwide.

Mr Power said the enhanced service will provide practical and emotional support to families - from the discovery of the homicide, through the court process, and beyond - and will ensure they have a central point of contact during their interaction with the justice sector, and a reliable ongoing source of support and advice.

The service is one of four initiatives for families of homicide victims announced late last year, three of which are already in operation:

- A grant of up to $4,500 to help pay for a family member's funeral, on top of the $5,500 they can claim from ACC. This was implemented in November.
- A High Court attendance grant, which supports up to five adult family members of a homicide victim to attend High Court proceedings at a rate of $124 per day, per person. This was implemented in January.
- An increase in the discretionary grant for families of homicide victims suffering financial difficulties, from $1,500 per family to a maximum of $5,000. The eligibility criteria have also been expanded. This was implemented in November.

Mr Power said it was anticipated 60 to 65 families per year will benefit from these initiatives.
