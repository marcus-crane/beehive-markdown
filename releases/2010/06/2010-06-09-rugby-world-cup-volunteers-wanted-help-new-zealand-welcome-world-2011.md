Recruitment is about to start for the 5,000 plus volunteers needed to host the thousands of international and local visitors who will enjoy Rugby World Cup 2011 (RWC 2011) when the Tournament kicks off in September next year.

Prime Minister John Key today launched the RWC 2011 Volunteer Programme at the Petone Rugby Club in Wellington.

"RWC 2011 is a priceless opportunity to showcase New Zealand to the world and our volunteers will play a big part in making sure we as a country put our best foot forward.

"Their role is important as they will be the friendly, welcoming face of the Tournament."

Tournament Organiser Rugby New Zealand 2011 (RNZ 2011) will next week begin a nationwide roadshow to recruit volunteers to work in a variety of roles both within stadia and outside in towns and cities across New Zealand.

"We want visitors to leave with the very best memories of their time here so it is important we find the right volunteers as they will be a powerful advertisement for New Zealand," said Mr Key.

Michael Jones, one of the New Zealand's greatest rugby stars - a member of the RWC 1987 winning New Zealand team and former coach of Manu Samoa - was today unveiled as the face of the Volunteer Programme.

Mr Jones said he accepted the role because he wants to encourage New Zealanders to see for themselves the value of volunteering, and that the experience inspires many to carry on volunteering in the community.

Volunteers have been a critical ingredient in the success of many major sporting events in recent decades including previous Rugby World Cups and the Olympics.

Public forums to explain the Volunteer Programme will begin in Dunedin on June 14 and end in Tauranga on July 14. All potential volunteers are strongly advised to attend a forum to learn more about what will be required of RWC 2011 Volunteers.
