The Government has agreed to adopt the Health Select Committee's recommendations on the Human Assisted Reproductive Technology (Storage) Amendment Bill.

The bill clarifies that the law on the 10-year storage limit for human gametes (eggs and sperm), and embryos starts from November 2004, the date of the original act, or from when storage began, whichever is latest.

"This means that gametes and embryos stored before 2004 can be stored until 2014, as the law is not applied retrospectively," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"If fertility clinics have clients who wish to extend storage beyond 2014, they will require approval from the ethics committee before the 10-year storage limit is up.

"This amendment was necessary after the Government received legal advice that fertility clinics acting in good faith may have unknowingly breached the storage limit because the law was not clear."

After listening to submissions, the select committee has proposed some changes, which the Government has adopted, including:

- A six-month ‘grace period' after the storage period expires for fertility clinics to discard gametes and embryos.
- Clarifying that any storage period outside New Zealand is included in calculating the 10-year storage limit on gametes, and embryos in New Zealand.

"Making the rules as clear as possible is important because in-vitro-fertilisation (IVF) has been used in New Zealand since 1983 and now sees about 900 IVF-babies born each year."

The Government's intention is to pass the bill into law before the end of the year.
