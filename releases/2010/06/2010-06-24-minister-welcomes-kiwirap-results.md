Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed new safety ratings for New Zealand state highways, saying they provide important information for drivers, road controlling authorities and the government.

The new KiwiRAP Star Ratings, developed by the AA and the NZ Transport Agency, provide an assessment of the relative levels of safety built in to our state highways. 

One star roads have the lowest safety rating and five star roads the highest. KiwiRAP provides star ratings for 89 percent of New Zealand's state highway network, covering 10,002kms of rural highways with speed limits of 80km/h or more.

KiwiRAP also shows that 28 percent of all vehicle kilometres travelled by our vehicles occurs on our four star roads, 40 percent on our three star roads, and 33 percent on our two star roads.

Mr Joyce says he hoped drivers would use the ratings to educate themselves about the relative safety of the roads they use and adjust their driving accordingly. 

"Improving the safety of New Zealand's roads and encouraging safer driving are key parts of the government's Safer Journeys strategy.

"The government is taking heed of these results and working hard to improve our roads, but we all need to take responsibility for road safety by being aware of conditions adjusting our driving and our speeds accordingly. KiwiRAP can help drivers make the right choices to stay safe on our roads."

Mr Joyce says a major step in improving highway safety was being progressed through the work on Roads of National Significance, including retrofitting safety improvements and running separate carriageways through our busiest rural highways.
