Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Michael Tolhurst as the Registrar of Private Investigators and Security Guards. 

Mr Tolhurst has been appointed for a term of three years.   

"Mr Tolhurst's broad legal experience will be useful in this role, and I am confident he has the skills to contribute significantly to the work of the registrar," Mr Power said.

Mr Tolhurst will replace Gary Harrison after 14 years of dedicated service.

The Registrar of Private Investigators and Security Guards is established under Section 5 of the Private Investigators and Security Guards Act 1974.

The registrar is responsible for the licensing and discipline of private investigators and security guards.  

Under changes to the Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Bill, the registrar's functions will be performed by a new Private Security Personnel Licensing Authority. 

The bill is expected to be in force by 1 December this year.

**Background:**

Mr Tolhurst was a member of the police for 10 years and, in 1984, completed an LLB at Auckland University.   He began his legal career with Langley Twigg in Napier before joining Simpson Grierson in Auckland.  He began practising on his own account in 1990, and specialises in property, estate, debt collection, employment and family law at his firm, Citylaw.
