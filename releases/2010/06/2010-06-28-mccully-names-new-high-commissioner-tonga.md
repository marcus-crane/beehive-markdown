New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Tonga will be career diplomat Jonathan Austin, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"New Zealand enjoys a strong and friendly relationship with Tonga, with strong ties at a personal level complemented by frequent political dialogue," Mr McCully said.

"Tonga's King and Government are committed to implementing major constitutional and political reform in advance of elections later this year.  It is a significant time in Tonga's history, and an important time for key partners such as New Zealand to be ready to assist in the transition to a new model of democratic and more accountable government.

"New Zealand support for Tonga includes a significant development assistance partnership, which recently increased to $16 million per year.  Assistance is targeted at the key areas of lifting economic performance, improving education, and strengthening governance," Mr McCully said. 

Dr Austin is currently Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Minister.  He has previously served as Deputy Special Coordinator of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, and has been posted to South Africa, East Timor, and Tonga. 

Dr Austin takes up his position in August, replacing Christine Bogle, who returns to Wellington.
