Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today invited submissions on the Commerce Commission's reconsidered final report on mobile termination access services.

Following a request by the Minister to reconsider its initial final report of 22 February 2010, the Commerce Commission this morning delivered its reconsidered final report on mobile termination access services.  It recommended that the termination of voice calls and text messages on New Zealand's mobile networks be regulated.

Under the Telecommunications Act, the Minister may accept, reject, or require the Commerce Commission to reconsider the recommendations.

Before making his decision on the Commission's recommendations, the Minister is inviting written submissions:

- on any matters raised in the report that were not, and could not have been, raised in previous submissions to the Commission; and
- on any relevant information that is not addressed in the Commission's report.

"I would like to thank the Commission for its hard work in preparing its report," says Mr Joyce.

"I will make a decision upon consideration of the report, submissions, and advice from officials.  It is my intention to do this in a timely manner."                        

Copies of the report can be downloaded from the [Commerce Commission website](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/).

Submissions should be sent to [mtas@med.govt.nz](mailto:mtas@med.govt.nz) by **5.00pm on Tuesday, 29 June 2010**. Cross-submissions should be sent to the same address by **5.00pm on Tuesday, 6 July 2010**.  Further information on the submission process is available at [www.med.govt.nz/mtas](http://www.med.govt.nz/mtas).

**Background**

Mobile termination access services are services provided by mobile network operators to other telecommunications providers to terminate voice calls and SMS text messages on their mobile network.  Mobile termination is the most significant cost input into the provision of services allowing end-users to call mobile phones.
