The government has shown its continued support for major events with Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee today announcing a significant contribution to New Zealand's hosting of the 2012 Triathlon ITU World Championships Series grand final. 

It was revealed this afternoon that Auckland will host the final event in 2012's eight-race world championships series, which has recently been reformatted by the International Triathlon Union to showcase and profile the sport in major international cities. 

"Up to $900,000 has been awarded from the Major Events Development Fund to enable Triathlon New Zealand to host and deliver the grand final in October 2012, and an associated test event which will be held in late 2011 or early 2012 in Auckland," Mr Brownlee said.  

Triathlon is the fastest growing sport in New Zealand and local triathletes regularly show well at international events.  Around 4,500 triathletes and supporters are expected to come to New Zealand for the grand final and Triathlon New Zealand's feasibility study estimates the event will have an economic impact of about $30.9 million. 

In addition to hosting the elite men's and women's grand final, Triathlon New Zealand will host up to seven other triathlon events across a four-to-five day period.  A sporting festival will also be developed around these events with the event hub at Auckland's Queens Wharf.

"As an outdoor event, the Triathlon World Championships Series grand final will provide excellent opportunities to showcase New Zealand to international audiences," Mr Brownlee said.  

**Ongoing support for major events**

Over the last 12 months the government has provided funding for a number of major events, including the 2012 Volvo Ocean Race stopover, American Express Queenstown Winter Festival 2010, 2010 New Zealand International Arts Festival and the 2013 UCI BMX World Championships. 

"Providing support for these major events helps strengthen and increase capability across our events industry and provides opportunities to showcase New Zealand as a major event's host, visitor destination and place to do business. 

"The government is committed to working with New Zealand's major events sector to help attract, deliver and grow selected high quality major events in New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.
