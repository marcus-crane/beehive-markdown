Measures introduced into Parliament today will enable the establishment of secondary-tertiary programmes and improve other areas of education legislation, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

The Education Amendment Bill (No 2) highlights the Government's commitment to the Youth Guarantee by allowing students to participate full-time in a secondary-tertiary programme while still enrolled at school.

"This provision will ensure students will be able to begin studying at the planned Trades Academies in 2011," says Mrs Tolley.

"Trades Academies will motivate and keep young people engaged in learning and training by giving them more options for study. The Academies will give students a head start in training for industry-related qualifications and a pathway to employment." 

The Bill also proposes changes to licensing standards for limited attendance centres, amendments to the law affecting private schools, minor changes to school enrolment schemes and amendments to refund provisions for international students.

"We are removing unnecessary red tape for crèches at gyms and shopping malls," says Mrs Tolley.

"Currently they need to be licensed as an early childhood education provider, but the Bill will remove this compliance burden as parents expect these short-term childcare centres to provide a baby-sitting service rather than an education. They will, however, have to meet legislative requirements to ensure the safety and welfare of children."

The Bill proposes amending refund provisions for international students studying at Private Training Establishments (PTEs). It will mean an increase to the maximum amount a PTE can retain when providing a refund to international students who withdraw from a course or change provider. This will remove the incentive for students to change provider while ensuring that PTEs which invest in overseas recruitment aren't penalised.

In response to the Law Commission's 2009 report, *Private Schools and the Law,* the Bill will amend the law affecting private schools to ensure minimum standards for premises, equipment and standard of tuition, and to ensure that all private schools are correctly registered. There will also be a "fit and proper person" test for prospective private school managers, to ensure the safety of students.

The Bill also amends enrolment scheme priorities for schools. This will allow schools to offer places to out of zone students, via the ballot process, to enable them to give some priority to students with a historical family connection to the school.
