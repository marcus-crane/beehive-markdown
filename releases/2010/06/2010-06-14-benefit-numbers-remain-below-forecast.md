The number of New Zealanders receiving a benefit increased slightly over the month of May by 0.6 percent, but overall numbers remain below forecast.

"With seasonal work winding up, we expected to see a slight increase in Unemployment Benefit figures, but it is much lower and has occurred later than it did last year," says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

All benefit types have increased by 1,887 in total.

An extra 729 people have gone onto a Sickness Benefit, 342 more people on the DPB and 391 more on an Unemployment Benefit.

Despite the increase 7,121 New Zealanders went off a benefit in May because they found work.

"I am heartened to see that 2,121 Maori and 440 Pacific Islanders left the benefit because they got a job last month," says Ms Bennett.

There are currently 329,349 people on benefits and the Unemployment Benefit makes up 60,106 of that number.

Work and Income is still getting strong support from employers offering work to beneficiaries with 4,583 new jobs listed at Work and Income last month.

Department of Labour's Jobs Online index also shows continued growth in skilled positions advertised online - up 8.2 percent in the three months to May.
