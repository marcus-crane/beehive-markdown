The number of prison incidents involving razor blades has more than halved since a clampdown on razor blades came into effect in May last year, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

Figures from the Department of Corrections show that in the 12 months since the new razor blade policy was implemented on 11 May 2009, the number of razor blade incidents dropped 61 percent on the year before.

"In the 12 months before the policy was put in place there were 26 incidents recorded by Corrections where a blade had been used as a weapon. In the past 12 months this has dropped to just 10 incidents," Ms Collins said.

"Further to this, there has been a 45 percent decrease in the number of incidents where a blade has been used by prisoners to harm themselves.

"I am very, very pleased with this result. This common-sense policy has dramatically reduced the number of razor blade incidents and has made our prisons safer for Corrections staff and prisoners alike."

Ms Collins asked Corrections to review its policy last year after becoming aware of the high number of injuries arising from all prisoners being able to possess blades. At least two prisoners had died from razor blade injuries in New Zealand prisons.

Under the new policy, prisoners in high security, youth, at-risk and remand units are no longer permitted to keep razor blades.

Instead they are issued with a safety razor on request, which they will be permitted to keep for a maximum of one hour. The razors are then collected, checked and disposed of.
