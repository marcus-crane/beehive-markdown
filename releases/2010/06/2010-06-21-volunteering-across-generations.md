One of the greatest examples of intergenerational volunteering in New Zealand occurs on the marae, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia.

"The marae is where whanau, hapu and iwi strengthen connections across generations, where people come to learn about their past and how they contribute to the future and where everyone has a role to play whether it is passing on their knowledge or caring for visitors."

This week is Voluntary Awareness Week and the theme is Volunteering across the generations.  More than 1.2 million New Zealanders give their time for voluntary work, contributing more than $3.3 billion worth of free labour to New Zealand communities.

"I would like to acknowledge the amazing contribution so many people already make, and to encourage other New Zealanders to offer what time they can to help their communities." 

"There is nothing more inspiring than a community working together for a common goal," says Mrs Turia.

 "As well as contributing to building a strong and healthy community, volunteering can also break down social barriers.  "There is so much we can do to make another life better. 

"It could be helping a main carer by spending some time with a person with disabilities - taking them to the park or a movie. Such small actions can be of huge value. "

The Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector has commissioned Nielsen Media Research to collect data every quarter on giving and volunteering.

Data collected during the December quarter 2009 showed that:

- people aged 10-19 years were most likely to volunteer for environmental causes
- for people aged 20-29 years, preschool is the most likely area for them to volunteer in
- people aged 30-49 years were most likely to volunteer in primary and secondary education
- sports volunteers were most likely to be aged 40-49 years. Sports clubs are the most likely type of community organisation for men to volunteer for
- people aged 60 years and older were most likely to volunteer in social and health services.
