Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming renowned tobacco industry ‘whistleblower' Dr Jeff Wigand to New Zealand to appear before the Maori Affairs Select Committee.

Dr Wigand publicly exposed the secret goings-on within the tobacco industry on America's *60 Minutes* programme in 1996 and his story was portrayed in the 1999 movie *The Insider*.

He is now visiting New Zealand to deliver expert advice to the Maori Affairs Select Committee on its inquiry into the tobacco industry and the consequences of tobacco use for Maori.

 "This is an amazing opportunity for New Zealanders to hear-first hand about the tactics Dr Wigand believes the tobacco industry uses and to explore whether those things happen here. 

"It will be especially interesting to hear his views on whether New Zealand tobacco companies are targeting Maori populations."

"Almost a quarter of Maori deaths are attributed to smoking," says Mrs Turia.

After working for the US tobacco industry in the 1990s, Dr Wigand publicly revealed that chemicals were added to cigarettes to increase nicotine delivery leading to addiction.

Dr Wigand will be speaking at the Maori Affairs Select Committee on 23 June.
