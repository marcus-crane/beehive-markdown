Associate Energy and Resources Minister Pansy Wong paid tribute to Gas Industry Company (GIC) Chief Executive, Christine Southey, whose resignation was announced today.  "I would like to personally thank Christine for her leadership of GIC over the past five years. 

"I have been pleased with the progress made with the GIC work programme under Christine's leadership since I assumed Ministerial responsibility for GIC in 2009.  A large number of workstreams have been completed, with new initiatives implemented over this time - including the appointment of the gas Rulings Panel to support the implementation of the switching and downstream reconciliation rules, regulations becoming live for gas critical contingencies, the introduction of single, free disputes resolution service for consumers and the establishment of benchmarks for retail contracts. 

"These achievements give GIC a good foundation to tackle future challenges.

"I wish Christine well with her future endeavours" Minister Wong said.
