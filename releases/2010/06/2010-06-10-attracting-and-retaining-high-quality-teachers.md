Education Minister Anne Tolley has released a discussion document after receiving an independent report on how to attract, train and retain high quality teachers.

"I appointed the Workforce Advisory Group to give me independent, expert advice on the future of the teaching workforce," says Mrs Tolley.

"We want to raise the status and professionalism of teaching in New Zealand. The Government is committed to lifting achievement in all our schools, and the quality of our teaching workforce is vital to the success of every student, and to important initiatives such as National Standards and the Youth Guarantee."

The Advisory Group has produced a report, *A Vision for the Teaching Profession,* which identifies key issues facing the sector alongside recommendations of how improvements could be made.

These focus on teacher training, leadership within the profession, and career pathways for excellent teachers.

"I now want to engage the wider education community on the Group's proposals," says Mrs Tolley.

"We want to hear the views of teachers currently in training or in the workforce, from school principals and boards of trustees, from professional bodies and from parents.

"This is a wonderful opportunity to have an open discussion about how we can attract and train the very best teachers, and make sure they stay in the profession. Our goal is to ensure every teacher is an excellent teacher.

"The Ministry will analyse the feedback and prepare a report for me. I'll then consider its findings before making any decisions."

A copy of the report and the discussion paper are being sent to all schools in New Zealand.
