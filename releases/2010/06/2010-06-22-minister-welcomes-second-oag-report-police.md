Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the findings of the second monitoring report of the Auditor-General into the response of Police to the recommendations of the 2007 Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct.

The report assesses the effectiveness of the Police's work programme in responding to the Commission's findings.

"The report shows that Police have continued to make progress in addressing many of the concerns highlighted by the Commission of Inquiry," Ms Collins said.

"It finds that Police have fully implemented seven of the inquiry's 47 recommendations and made progress on the remaining 40.

"The report notes that the implementation of the Police response is at a critical point, and that without concerted effort there is a risk progress will stall.

"It is essential that Police do not lessen their commitment to change.

"I am confident that Police can make the changes identified. It will continue to require continued strong leadership and clear expectations to every member of Police.

"I look forward to further progress as Police implement new measures that enhance professionalism and accountability throughout the organisation."

The 2007 Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct criticised the historical conduct of some Police officers and their associates.

The Commission's findings included 60 recommendations. Most were for the New Zealand Police, but some were for the Police Complaints Authority and the State Services Commission.

The Government invited the Auditor General to monitor the Police's response to the Commission's recommendations for 10 years. The report released today is the second of what is expected to be four reports.
