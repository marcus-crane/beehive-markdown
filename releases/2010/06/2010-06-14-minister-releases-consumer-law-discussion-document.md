Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy today released the 'Consumer Law Reform' discussion document - the result of work the Ministry of Consumer Affairs has undertaken over the past year to review and rationalise consumer law in New Zealand.

"Upon becoming Minister in 2008 I formulated key priorities and goals for the Consumer Affairs portfolio through to the next election.  It was during my first planning session with Ministry officials that I first introduced the idea of 'One Law-One Door'," Mrs Roy said.

"'One Law' refers to the goal of principles-based consumer-supplier legislation, while 'One Door' aims to provide a single portal consumers can use to seek advice and assistance when consumer transactions go awry.  
"The discussion document released today is the result of the 'One Law' review, which uses the Government's commitment to regulatory responsibility as a guidepost and forms part of the Government's Regulatory Reform Agenda.

"Strong and relevant consumer legislation is an important contributor to consumer confidence and participation in the marketplace, and helps create a competitive environment where reputable businesses can operate with protection from the inappropriate conduct of competitors.

"Effective consumer law helps foster and nurture a competitive business environment in which both consumers and business can engage with trust and confidence, enabling them to contribute to a productive and innovative economy.  I invite and welcome comment from both consumers and industry on the issues raised in this document," Mrs Roy said.
