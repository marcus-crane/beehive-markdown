New Zealand's youth justice system was a great example of how inspirational people can help turn around the lives of young offenders, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

Speaking at the opening of the Auckland Regional Youth Aid Officers Conference, Ms Collins told participants that the measure of their success was the number of young offenders that didn't show up in Police crime statistics later in life.

"Police Youth Aid is a frontline service which has the potential to influence the course of their lives," Ms Collins said

"Many of the young people you deal with will not have had the benefit of someone they can turn to for guidance and advice, who can introduce them to ideas and opportunities and who can show them how to work hard and make good things happen.

"It is sobering to think that you might be only one of a handful of inspirational people these young people meet during their lives that can make a positive difference.

"The Government is behind you, we support you and we really do appreciate the difficult but important work you do."

Ms Collins said lowering the rates of youth offending, keeping young people out of institutions and giving them opportunities were priorities for the Government.

"We understand that our young people are the future of this country, and the quality of that future depends upon the care, the confidence and the leadership we give them today."

Changes to the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act would provide wider sentencing options for holding young offenders to account while focusing on the underlying causes behind their offending. 

Programmes to target young unemployed people would give them work skills, further training or help get them a foot in the door.

"Young people with skills, good jobs and career prospects are much more likely to stay out of trouble than those that don't."
