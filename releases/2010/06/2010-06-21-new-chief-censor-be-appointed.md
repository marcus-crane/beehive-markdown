Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has acknowledged the contribution of Chief Censor Bill Hastings, who will be taking up a new role as a District Court Judge and Chair of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal.

"I want to thank Bill Hastings for 12 years of service leading the Office of Film and Literature Classification. This is a demanding and important role.

"Mr Hastings has encouraged debate and raised awareness of censorship law in New Zealand."

The Department of Internal Affairs will now begin the recruitment process for a new Chief Censor, which is expected to take between six and nine months to complete.

The Chief Censor is a statutory appointment made on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs, in consultation with the Ministers of Justice and Women's Affairs.

Until then the Deputy Chief Censor Nicola McCully will exercise all the powers of the Chief Censor.
