Prime Minister John Key will visit the Republic of Korea, China and Viet Nam in July to further cement New Zealand's strong relations with the Asia region.

Mr Key's visit to the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam will be his first as Prime Minister.  It will be his second visit to China as Prime Minster.

"Asia is clearly becoming increasingly important to New Zealand," says Mr Key.

"Strengthening our relationships with the region is a key priority for the Government and this visit will further underline our already warm relationships with these three countries."

While in the Republic of Korea, Mr Key will hold a summit meeting with President Lee Myung-bak to discuss the current free trade negotiations, security on the Korean Peninsula and Korea's preparations to host the G20 Summit in November.

This year also marks the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War and to commemorate this Mr Key will visit the War Memorial in Yongsan, Seoul for a wreathlaying ceremony in tribute to New Zealanders who lost their lives in the conflict.

Mr Key will visit Beijing for formal discussions with China's leaders and will also visit the New Zealand Expo Pavilion in Shanghai to mark New Zealand's "National Day" on July 9. 

"The Shanghai Expo is a prime opportunity to grow markets for New Zealand goods and services in China, and to capitalise on New Zealand's unique position as the first developed country with an FTA with China," Mr Key says.

In Viet Nam Mr Key will meet with, among others, the Prime Minister, President and senior Communist Party representatives. 

Mr Key will host a dinner to commemorate the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Viet Nam, and meet with New Zealand business people and their Vietnamese counterparts.

Mr Key will visit the Republic of Korea from July 4 - 7, China from July 7 - 10 and Viet Nam from July 10 - 12.
