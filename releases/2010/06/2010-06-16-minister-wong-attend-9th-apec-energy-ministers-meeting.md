Associate Minister of Energy and Resources Pansy Wong will leave today to represent the New Zealand Government at the 9th APEC Energy Ministers' Meeting in Fukui City, Japan.

The theme of the meeting is *Low Carbon Paths to Energy Security - Cooperative Energy Solutions for a Sustainable APEC*.  It will be divided into three sessions on energy security, energy efficiency, and low-emission energy.

 "The importance of the APEC Energy Ministers' Meeting lies in the fact that the region accounts for around 60 percent of the world's energy demand, it is a net energy importer, and this demand is rising," Mrs Wong says.

"This 9th meeting will focus on energy security, energy trade and investment, enhancement of the Peer Review on Energy Efficiency mechanism, efficient use of fossil energies, new and renewable energies, and biofuels." 

"I look forward to hearing my APEC counterparts' views on these matters," she says.

The Minister will return to New Zealand on Monday 21 June 2010.
