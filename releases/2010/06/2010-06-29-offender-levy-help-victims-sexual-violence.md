Victims of sexual violence will receive additional assistance from Thursday as part of a package of initiatives to help the victims of crime.

The initiatives will be funded by the $50 offender levy, which is to be paid by all convicted offenders from Thursday.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the initiatives were part of the Government's drive to put victims of crime at the centre of the justice system.

"It's well known that participation in the criminal justice system is a painful and traumatic process for many victims of sexual violence.

"Because of that experience, many victims withdraw from proceedings or avoid the criminal justice system altogether.  We must do our best to avoid that."

From Thursday, victims of sexual violence will be offered enhanced support in courts through a new service.

"The sexual violence court support service will give victims of sexual violence access to a trained and experienced victim adviser who understands the dynamics of sexual violence and the needs of victims of sex offences," Mr Power said.

The service will consist of 18 specialist advisers based in courts across the country. It will be introduced gradually, with the first six operating out of courts in Manukau, Auckland, and Whangarei. It will be fully implemented by the middle of 2012, with an evaluation after two years.

"In order to offer victims continuity of care throughout the social, health, and criminal justice sectors, the service will work in close partnership with other agencies and organisations offering support and services to victims of sexual violence."

In January, a discretionary grant of up to $250 was introduced to help meet the cost of one-off expenses incurred as a result of sexual violence, such as replacing items of clothing collected for forensic evidence.  Victim Support administers the scheme, which has been allocated $500,000 per year.
