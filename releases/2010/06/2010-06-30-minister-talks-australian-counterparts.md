Police and Corrections Minister Judith Collins will discuss issues of common interest with her Australian counterparts at meetings in Canberra this week.

Ms Collins will attend the Corrective Services Ministers' Conference tomorrow (Thursday 1 July) and the meeting of the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management - Police (MCPEMP) on Friday.

The Corrective Services Ministers' Conference (CSMC) brings together all Australian State, Territory, and New Zealand Ministers responsible for correctional services.

The Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management - Police promotes a co-ordinated response to law enforcement issues and to maximise the use of Police resources. New Zealand has been a member for a number of years.

"New Zealand and Australian law enforcement agencies enjoy a long and close relationship and work together on a range of issues, to the benefit of both countries," Ms Collins said.

"These meetings will be a valuable opportunity to focus on law enforcement issues faced by governments on both sides of the Tasman and discuss developments in management of offenders."

Ms Collins will return to Wellington on Friday 2 July.
