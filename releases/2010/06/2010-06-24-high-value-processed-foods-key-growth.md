Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee has urged an audience of 600 members of the food production and processing sector to take advantage of the government's $21 million funding for a nationwide network of research and testing facilities.

"The four food product development labs, in Manukau, Hamilton, Palmerston North and Christchurch, will give local businesses open access to pilot scale facilities so they can take an idea from the laboratory to commercial production in a quicker, cheaper and easier manner than ever before," Mr Brownlee told delegates at the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology Conference in Auckland.

He said meeting the government's economic goals required an increase in the number and scale of local businesses that can compete in global markets and generate well paid jobs for New Zealanders.

"While the food and beverage sector remains the linchpin of the economy, generating half our export earnings and employing one in five workers, the processed foods sector is small by comparison.

"At a value of $2.1 billion the processed foods sector is worth only nine per cent of the food and beverage sector as a whole, despite growing at 18 per cent a year for the past decade.

"Of the 1,840 food manufacturing companies in New Zealand, half employ more than five but less than 100 people.  This means quick and effective research and development costs too much for many firms, which is why the government has committed $21 million over the next five years to establish a network of food innovation centres.

"We want to see local companies accelerate product development, develop foreign markets and maintain an in-market presence, to the benefit of all New Zealanders," Mr Brownlee said.
