Victims of serious crime will have access to more information about the justice system from Thursday, as part of a package of initiatives to help victims of crime, Justice Minister Simon Power said.

The package will be funded by the $50 offender levy, which is to be paid by all convicted offenders from Thursday.

Information will be available by way of a DVD, informational pamphlets and a redesigned victims' website [www.victimsinfo.govt.nz](http://www.victimsinfo.govt.nz/)

"Victims of serious crime need to have access to simple and accurate information about the criminal justice system," Mr Power said.

"At the moment, there is limited information about the justice system that is aimed at victims.

"We are aware that victims can find criminal court processes bewildering and may be unsure of how they fit in.

"Being informed about the process can improve victims' experiences."

The DVD explains the criminal court process, what victims can expect from the criminal court process, and where they fit within the justice system.

Three supporting booklets provide further information on support services available to victims, with two of them containing specific information for victims of sexual violence and people affected by homicide.

All resources were developed in consultation with the Police, Corrections, the Parole Board, Victim Support, and non-government agencies.
