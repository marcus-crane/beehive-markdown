Sheep and beef cattle are now covered by a code of animal welfare like that already in place for deer and dairy cattle.

Agriculture Minister, David Carter, has issued the Animal Welfare (Sheep & Beef Cattle) Code of Welfare 2010 which sets down minimum standards for the farming of sheep and beef cattle.

"Like the codes of welfare in place for dairy cattle and deer, this covers all areas of stock management including food and water, shade and shelter, pre-transport selection and health," says Mr Carter.

"The code encourages all those involved in the farming of sheep and beef cattle to adopt the highest standards of animal handling and care. 

"As with all codes of animal welfare, it provides guidelines that should leave farmers in no doubt about the standards of welfare they should meet," Mr Carter says.
