Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the announcement today by Energy Hedge on progress in setting up a more liquid electricity hedge market. 

A liquid hedge market is an important part of the government's package of electricity reforms, which aim to promote more competition in the electricity market.  A hedge market is particularly important to enable new retailers, including lines businesses, and new generators, to enter the market. 

The Minister wrote to the major generator-retailers earlier this year requesting that they set up a liquid electricity hedge market with the following characteristics:

- Standardised tradable contracts
- A clearing house (or houses) to act as a counter-party to all trades
- Low barriers to participation and low transaction costs
- Market makers (offering buy and sell prices with a maximum spread) to provide liquidity.

"Today's announcement by Energy Hedge, which is owned by the five main generator-retailers, is a major step in meeting these objectives. 

"There is still some work to be done in getting all five generator-retailers acting as market-makers, but Energy Hedge has advised that this is expected to be achieved within the next month or thereabouts.

"I am also particularly pleased that an independent user group will be set up later this month to ensure that further development of market products and options meets market requirements and the government's objectives regarding liquidity and open access.

"I will continue to monitor progress closely, and require on-going reports from the generator-retailers on developments," Mr Brownlee said.

The government will also review the hedge market in June next year to ensure it has sufficient liquidity.  If not, the new Electricity Authority, and the Minister, will have strong powers to impose requirements on industry participants to ensure it does.
