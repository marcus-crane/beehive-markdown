A prison capacity crisis has been averted, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said at the opening of New Zealand's first container cell unit today.

The 60-bed Rimutaka Prison unit was built in half the time of traditional prison cells and at $5,585,894, cost around 30 percent less. The unit will be used to test whether similar units can be constructed at other prisons around New Zealand.

Ms Collins said that when the unit was commissioned in August 2009, New Zealand was "staring down the barrel of a very serious crisis in our prisons".

"We were forecast to run out of baseline beds within months thanks to an irresponsible lack of planning by the previous government," Ms Collins said.

"The traditional increase in prisoner numbers over winter would have left us with a capacity crisis the likes of which we have not seen before.

"The forecasts have proven to be correct. At unlock on Monday the number of prisoners behind bars in our prisons and Police cells reached an all-time high of 8706.

"When the crisis was signalled last year, we took immediate steps to ensure there were enough beds to cope with the prisoners being sent from the courts.

"I am delighted to say that with increased use of double bunking and the opening of this container cell block today, which have together added almost 800 new prison beds, the capacity crisis has been averted."

The container unit project provided jobs for around 120 people. The construction of any future container units will provide employment skills training for prisoners.

The unit is surrounded by a four metre high fence topped with razor wire, and each of the units has a high pitched roof to thwart escape attempts.

Entry to the unit is via a secure staffed control room where staff have full visibility of the entire facility.

The cells are comparable in size to other cells in prisons around the country.

Ms Collins said "this unit represents new thinking at Corrections, and a willingness to look at innovative solutions to difficult problems."
