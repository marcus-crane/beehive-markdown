Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today received the final report following the Department of Labour-led review of the adventure tourism industry.

The review was announced in September last year by Prime Minister John Key.

"The Department has worked with a host of other ministries and agencies to formulate a comprehensive report on the current safety practices of adventure tourism operators and where improvements could be made," Ms Wilkinson says.

"I intend to consider the findings of the report before taking any recommendations to Cabinet for discussion.

"I expect the Government will be in a position to release the full report and announce its decisions within the next month."
