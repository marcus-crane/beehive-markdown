Education Minister Anne Tolley has confirmed a site has been purchased for a new primary school at Waikanae, near Wellington.

"This is good news for Waikanae, and shows the Government is focused on supporting the needs of students and lifting achievement," says Mrs Tolley.

The three-hectare site, close to David Street on the northern edge of the town, will accommodate a school for up to 400 students and an early childhood centre.

Funding for construction will come from the $349.3 million in new operating and capital funding over four years for school property, which was announced as part of Budget 2010. The site has been purchased for $3 million through Budget 2009 funding.

"The community has been growing steadily for many years and it is expected to keep growing, so a new school will become a priority," says Mrs Tolley.

"We need to plan for the future and buying a site now is an important first step."

Spare capacity in existing schools will cater for current demand for places, while roll-growth estimates show a new school will be needed by 2013.

"I'd like to acknowledge the part played by Otaki MP Nathan Guy in this process.

"He has been a great advocate for a new school in the area, and this announcement reflects all the hard work he has done on behalf of the community.

"Once built, this new school will be an important community asset, serving generations of young people on the Kapiti coast."
