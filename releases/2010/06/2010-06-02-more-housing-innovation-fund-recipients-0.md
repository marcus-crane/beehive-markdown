Six projects will receive $7.85 million in government funding in the latest round of approvals from the Housing Innovation Fund, Housing Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

Mr Heatley says two of the projects will provide affordable family home ownership in Queenstown and affordable rental accommodation in Nelson.

The Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust has been awarded $1.00 million from the Housing Innovation Fund for an $8.80 million project to provide 20 new properties in Queenstown for affordable home ownership. 

The Nelson Tasman Housing Trust has been awarded $1.30 million for a $2.61 million project to provide nine new properties in Nelson for rental to low- to moderate-income people.

Mr Heatley says the other four projects will benefit Māori directly with 44 new properties for Māori to be built in Northland, Tauranga and Whakatāne.

Te Rūnanga o Te Rarawa was awarded $1.55 million from the Housing Innovation Fund for a $2.30 million project to establish an extended whānau living environment of eight dwellings for low- to middle-income whānau, on general land in Ahipara, Northland.

Mangatawa-Papamoa Blocks Incorporated was awarded $2.17 million for a $5.38 million project to build 10 two-bedroom units for kaumātua housing on Māori freehold land in Tauranga.

Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Awa was awarded $1.03 million for a $5.89 million project to build 10 two-bedroom units for kaumātua housing and five three-bedroom houses for home ownership on Māori freehold land in Whakatāne.

Ngāti Hine Health Trust was awarded $800,000 for a $1.60 million project to build 11 new properties for kaumātua housing and home ownership in Moerewa, Northland.

"Of the $20 million allocated for the 2009/10 Housing Innovation Fund, the Government set aside $5 million for Māori Demonstration Partnerships to support innovative housing solutions such as these for Māori."

Mr Heatley says providing affordable housing is a priority for the Government, but it cannot tackle this issue on its own.

"The aim of the Housing Innovation Fund is to encourage partnerships and innovation within the housing sector. These projects demonstrate the success of this approach with $7.85 million coming from the Government and $18.73 million being funded by the private sector."

The Housing Innovation Fund for 2009/2010 has now supported 16 projects that will result in 169 houses throughout New Zealand for families and individuals in need.

**Background for editors**

The Housing Innovation Fund was set up to foster collaboration between government and community organisations in order to provide more housing for New Zealanders on low incomes or with special housing needs.

Budget 2009 set aside $20 million for the fund. Of this, $15 million was available under a general fund, while up to $5 million was made available for Māori Demonstration Partnerships to support innovative housing solutions for Māori.
