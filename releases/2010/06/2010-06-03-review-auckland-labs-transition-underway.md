Two independent reviewers have been appointed to review last year's transition of community laboratory services in Auckland from Diagnostic Medlab (DML) to Labtests.

The Government announced last October it would hold an independent review once the transition process was complete and 'the dust had settled.'

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "The purpose of the review is to ensure that the health service can learn from the Auckland region's experience during the labs contract transition, and help with decision making in the future."

"The review will focus on the processes followed to secure the transition of services from one provider to the other, and any matters that may have contributed to the transition problems."

The independent reviewers will be Waikato DHB Chair Graeme Milne and Associate Professor Jens Mueller of the Waikato University Management School.

The report is due to be delivered to the Minister by 30 September 2010.
