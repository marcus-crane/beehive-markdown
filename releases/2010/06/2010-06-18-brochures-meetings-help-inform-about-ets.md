The Government is providing brochures and holding meetings to help inform New Zealanders about the emissions trading scheme, Climate Change Minister Nick Smith says.

"The ETS is complex but is the right response to ensuring New Zealand does its fair share on curbing greenhouse emissions and addressing climate change," Dr Smith said.

"To ensure the public receives good information, the Government is providing brochures for households, businesses and farmers. I am also speaking at public meetings to provide an insight on how the ETS works, its effect on households, farms and businesses and how it will curb emissions.

"There has been a huge focus on costs associated with the ETS but I would like New Zealanders to understand the opportunities from new energy technologies, from planting trees and from insulating their homes.

"The purpose of the ETS is not to increase costs but help drive the change that our country needs to make to curb the growth in our emissions and to adapt to a carbon-constrained world.

"I am already encouraged by the change in behaviour that is happening due to the ETS. The bulk of new electricity generation in the last 10 years has been from coal, gas and diesel. However, since the passing of the ETS into law, more than 80% of new consents lodged have been for renewable generation in hydro, wind, geothermal and marine.

"I am also encouraged by the sharp switch in confidence in forestry which saw deforestation end in 2008 and optimistic projections of new forest plantings in the future.  These are the behaviours the ETS hopes to achieve."

Since May Dr Smith has addressed meetings about the ETS in Oxford, Rangiora, Palmerston North, Botany, Pukekohe, Clevedon, Waitangi, Hamilton, Mystery Creek,  Oamaru, Johnsonville, Wellington,  Nelson, Otorohanga, and Te Aroha.

"I have been encouraged by the 15 meetings I have held to date and I have found New Zealanders want to know more about how the scheme works, understand why it is better to make a modest start to address climate change now, and how they can become more energy efficient.

"Advertisements will be published over the next two weeks in the country's main newspapers informing the public about the scheme and enabling access to additional information, brochures, the Ministry for the Environment's website and invitations to public meetings."
