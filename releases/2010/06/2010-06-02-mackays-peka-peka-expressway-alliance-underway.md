Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the establishment of an engineering and construction alliance for the MacKays to Peka Peka section of the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance.

He says the purpose of the Alliance is to ensure all parties with an interest in the project are working together from the start to achieve the best results.

"The establishment of a roading alliance to design and construct the expressway will allow the NZ Transport Agency to overlap project phases and get on with delivering the project much faster. 

"Experience on other projects has shown that the alliance approach allows for the delivery of major projects with greater speed and innovation."

The Alliance comprises Beca Planning and Infrastructure, Fletcher Construction, the Higgins Group and the NZ Transport Agency.

The Wellington to Levin Corridor is one of seven initial Roads of National Significance which means it is a priority for investment over the next ten years.

"The completion of the new road will bring real gains through improving economic growth and productivity for Wellington through more efficient movement of people and freight between Wellington (particularly the main industrial area of Seaview / Gracefield, Wellington CBD, Wellington airport and Centreport, and Kapiti Coast) and the whole lower North Island," says Mr Joyce.

"The confirmation today of the alliance is an important step towards getting the Expressway designed and built so that these benefits can be realised.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities."
