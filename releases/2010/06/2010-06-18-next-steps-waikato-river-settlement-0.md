Environment Minister Nick Smith today signed the Environmental Accord between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui as part of the Waikato River Settlement.

"This Accord is setting in place the mechanics of making the settlement work and to build the long-term relationships to ensure effective management of the river for the future," Dr Smith said.  
   
Dr Smith also advised that the Waikato River Independent Scoping Study, being undertaken by NIWA and due to have been completed by June, had been delayed and this would put back the implementation of the Waikato River Authority by a couple of months.

"I am disappointed by this delay but I'm confident in working with the Guardians Establishment Committee and Waikato-Tainui that this will not weaken the strong Treaty relationship built with Waikato-Tainui. We've agreed to extend the Guardians role to cover the delay and will next month be finalising the appointments to the Waikato River Authority.

"Cleaning up the river in partnership with Waikato-Tainui is at the core of the settlement. The river's problems are decades in the making, so it is important to get the scoping study right - even if it takes slightly longer than anticipated.

"The Accord and scoping study are nationally significant because they will guide the most comprehensive environmental restoration programme in New Zealand history between the Crown and iwi to restore the health and wellbeing of an asset important to all New Zealanders."
