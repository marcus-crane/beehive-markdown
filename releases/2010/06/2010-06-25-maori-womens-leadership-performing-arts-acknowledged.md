Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong hosts today's He Wāhine Pūmanawa at the Lincoln Green Conference Centre in Henderson.  For 17 years since 1993, this annual event organised by the Ministry of Women's Affairs has celebrated the achievements of Māori women as tangata whenua.

This year's event acknowledges, for the first time, the huge contribution Māori women have made to kapa haka and other performing arts.

Mrs Wong says Māori women have been instrumental in the renaissance in Māori arts and culture.  "Māori women are everywhere in kapa haka competition.  They are involved as coaches, leaders, performers and judges. And they work hard behind the scenes too, as composers, tutors, administrators and committee members.

"The effort and hard work they put into kapa haka, while at the same time juggling busy work and home lives, is outstanding.  Their positive role modelling, discipline, dedication and their strong leadership skills set a fine example for our rangatahi.

"Through the continuing involvement of these strong women, I am confident that kapa haka and our other unique performing arts will continue to flourish.

"I look forward to seeing some of these women at the Tāmaki Makaurau Senior Kapa Haka Regionals in early July, where they will compete for a place at the 2011 Te Matatini National Festival.  This is the premier Māori cultural performing arts festival and the world's largest celebration of Māori performing arts."
