The Government has provided $12.6 million in new Budget funding over the next four years to develop a Government Digital Archive, the Minister Responsible for Archives New Zealand and the National Library Nathan Guy says.

"This significant cash injection will provide a secure system to store, preserve and give access to important public records.

"This funding shows how seriously the Government values the work of Archives New Zealand and the National Library. This endorses the digitisation work already underway by both departments.

"The investment is crucial to preserve valuable government information and make it widely available to the public online. We need to keep up with technology and promote open and transparent government.

"Without this initiative, we run the risk of information becoming obsolete and unusable, and Archives New Zealand would struggle to meet its important statutory commitments.

"The new Digital Archive will be created by extending the National Library's National Digital Heritage Archive system so that it can be used by Archives New Zealand and other agencies.

"This is a major investment to ensure that government records are available now and in the future.

"The budget allocated includes $9.7 million for Archives New Zealand and $2.9 million for the National Library over four years," Mr Guy says.
