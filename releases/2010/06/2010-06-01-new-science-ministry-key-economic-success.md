A new Ministry of Science and Innovation is set to play a key role in boosting New Zealand's economic growth.

"The new Ministry will lead a robust science and innovation system that will improve our economic performance," Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp said today.

"Last year we started the biggest overhaul of the science system in 20 years.

"This is the next step in the Government's reforms of the science system. It signals the Government's commitment to unlocking the huge potential science has to lift our economy and our whole society," he said.

The new Ministry will replace the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology. It will manage science funding, advise the Government on New Zealand's science system, and drive knowledge transfer from the science sector to business and other research users.

"This is an important part of the Government's Science and Innovation programme.  It will ensure that investment is going to the right areas, enable more strategic funding decisions to be made, and simplify the system so that researchers can focus on their work instead of funding applications," the Minister said.

Dr Mapp said that the Government is also ensuring that research funding decisions will be independent.

"New legislation will require the Minister to appoint boards that will make independent funding decisions based on published criteria. The Minister will not be able to direct decisions on individual research proposals.

"Research funding has to be transparent and fair. The new system provides a balance that will ensure investment goes to areas of Government priority, while allowing for independent decisions," he said.

The new Ministry will be established once the necessary legislation has been passed.
