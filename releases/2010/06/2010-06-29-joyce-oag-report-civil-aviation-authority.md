Transport Minister Steven Joyce says he will hold the Civil Aviation Authority to the recommendations contained in a report released today by the Office of the Auditor-General.

It is the fourth report from the Auditor-General relating to the Civil Aviation Authority since 1997. 

Today's report criticises the CAA for inadequate progress with earlier recommendations and makes 14 recommendations designed to strengthen certification and surveillance.

Mr Joyce this afternoon met with CAA's Board chairman as well as the Director of Civil Aviation. 

"I have made it clear that the government expects to see swift implementation of the report's recommendations and that continuing to not act on these reports is not an option.

"I have asked to receive a detailed work programme from the CAA, which will include completion dates and a detailed monitoring regime.  I expect quarterly updates from the Board and the Ministry of Transport on the implementation of the Auditor-General's recommendations and will not hesitate to act if my expectations are not met."

Earlier this month three new members were appointed to the Board of the CAA.

Mr Joyce says he believes the new Board members have an excellent mix of skills and experience that will help enable the Board to drive the necessary change at the CAA.

"I want to stress that while these reports are critical of some of the CAA's management processes, it does not express concern about the safety of New Zealand's aviation system," says Mr Joyce.
