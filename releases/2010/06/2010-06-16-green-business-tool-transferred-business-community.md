Commerce Minister Simon Power has transferred the Government's Envirostep scheme to the environmental certification company Telarc SAI Ltd.

Envirostep is a free, online self-assessment tool designed to help businesses understand, improve and communicate their environmental performance.

On completing the assessment questionnaire, users receive an instant report containing their score, profile, and recommendations for improvement. They can also upload their recommendations into an action plan.

Since the scheme's launch in July last year it has attracted more than 850 registered users.

"It has always been the Government's intention to transfer Envirostep to the business community," Mr Power said.

"Envirostep has proven to be a popular scheme, but the Government can take it only so far. The business community now needs to take it to the next stage, and independent certification is key to its wider recognition and uptake."

Telarc SAI, as a major player in the certification of environmental management systems is well placed to deliver Envirostep and administer a national certification programme."
