Prime Minister John Key has congratulated the All Whites after their stunning result in drawing 1-1 with Italy this morning in the World Cup match in Nelspruit, South Africa.

In South Africa to watch the game, Mr Key said: "The All Whites showed all the courage and character we know they possess to score what is New Zealand's best result yet in world football.

"In drawing with one of the world's top teams, the All Whites have surprised everybody and stunned the footballing world.  The team can take great pride in their result.

"I have personally congratulated coach Ricki Herbert, captain Ryan Nelsen and the team.  I am sure all New Zealanders will join with me in saying how proud we are of the All Whites.

"I wish the team all the best for their next game against Paraguay on Friday."

Mr Key arrives back in New Zealand tomorrow night.
