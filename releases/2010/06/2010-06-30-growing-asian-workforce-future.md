New research shows a growing and highly qualified Asian workforce, will make up 15 percent of New Zealand's total labour force by 2026.

"The Asian workforce is emerging as an important part of New Zealand's changing labour market," says Employment Minister Paula Bennett. 

New Zealand's Asian population more than doubled between 1996 and 2006.

"This report describes an Asian population that is highly qualified, youthful and entrepreneurial," says Ms Bennett.

According to the report, half of working age Asians are between 15 and 34 years old, likely to be university educated and working professionally.

"It's important for employers to note changes within the workforce like this growing pool of talent within New Zealand," says Ms Bennett.

"The report also tells us degree-qualified Asians are three times more likely to be working as clerks as the national average, suggesting many are actually over qualified for the job they're in," says Ms Bennett.

The 2006 census showed that Asians comprised the fourth largest major group of ethnicities in New Zealand after European, Maori and Other.

"Asian people will certainly form a critical and skilled part of our future workforce, adding to the diversity in our workplaces," says Ms Bennett.

"Employers need to be ready to respond and capitalise on this situation," says Ms Bennett.
