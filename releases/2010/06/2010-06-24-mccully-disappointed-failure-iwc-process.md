Foreign Minister Murray McCully today expressed his disappointment that the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Agadir, Morocco, failed to agree on a diplomatic solution.

"We always knew the chances of reaching agreement in Agadir over the future of whaling were slim," Mr McCully said.

"However New Zealand went to Morocco determined to play a constructive role  in discussions that we saw as crucial to both the on-going operation of the IWC, and to achieving our objective of securing agreement to end whaling in the Southern Ocean at the earliest possible time.

"Therefore it is disappointing, but not entirely surprising, that two days of face-to-face negotiations failed to produce a consensus outcome.

"New Zealand is supportive of the suggestion that there should now be a year-long pause in the IWC process. It is crucial that efforts to reach a diplomatic solution are not completely abandoned.  

"New Zealand's key objective during these negotiations has been the elimination of whaling in the Southern Ocean. While the IWC process will not deliver that outcome this year, we will continue to use all means available to achieve our objective.

"In light of the failure of the talks in Morocco to deliver a positive outcome, we will now give consideration to lodging proceedings in the International Court of Justice. I anticipate a decision on that question will be made quite soon," Mr McCully said.
