A snapshot of Maori health from the mid to the late 2000's is presented in *Tatau Kahukura: Maori Health Chart Book 2nd edition 2010,* released today by Associate Minister of Health Tariana Turia.

Mrs Turia says the chart book's comprehensive review of Maori health data will be useful for funders and providers in developing policy and services and allocating resources.

"For the wider community, the easy-to-use statistical information will help promote better understanding of Maori health," says Mrs Turia.

"The data are useful for policymakers and service planners when they identify priority areas and assess the progress towards improving tangata whenua health outcomes."

Like the first edition, the chart book 2010 presents key indicators relating to the socio-economic determinants of health (such as education and income), risk and protective factors for health, health status, and the use of health services.

"Improving tangata whenua health outcomes is one of the Government's priorities, as outlined in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000.  Providing better, sooner, more convenient primary health care is also a key vehicle in achieving better health outcomes for tangata whenua," says Mrs Turia.
