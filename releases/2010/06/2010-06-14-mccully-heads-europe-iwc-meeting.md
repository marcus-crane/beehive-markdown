Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves for Europe for consultations with the European Union (EU) and meetings in Madrid, Brusssels, and London before attending the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in Morocco.

The EU consultations are hosted by Spain, as current holder of the rotating Presidency.  While in Madrid, Mr McCully will hold talks with representatives of the European Council, the European Commission, and Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos.

"New Zealand's regular consultations with the EU are of great value. A range of issues will be discussed, including our relations with the EU after the Lisbon Treaty, and areas of mutual concern, such as Afghanistan and Fiji."

Mr McCully will make a brief stop in Brussels to address a meeting of New Zealand's ambassadors and representatives of other government agencies in Europe, before travelling on to London where he will call on members of the new coalition government, including Foreign Secretary William Hague.

"The relationship with the UK is one of New Zealand's most treasured. I look forward to discussing how our governments can work together to further enhance our close relationship," said Mr McCully.

Mr McCully then heads to Agadir, Morocco, for the final days of the IWC meeting.

"The main focus of Agadir will be on trying to conclude the diplomatic process that has been underway for the past two years.

"The Chairs' Proposal will be the subject of vigorous debate. As it stands, it is unacceptable to New Zealand. We want to see a significant improvement on the status quo, with an end to whaling in the Southern Ocean at the earliest achievable date.

"The outcome is by no means certain, but New Zealand has committed to seeing the process through," Mr McCully said.
