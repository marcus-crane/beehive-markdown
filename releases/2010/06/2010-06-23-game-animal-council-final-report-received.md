Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today received the final report outlining the recommended process for establishing a new Game Animal Council.

The creation of the Council was recommended in 2007 and is a feature of the National-led Government's Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, who are working closely with the Minister on hunting issues.

The report, written by the Establishment Committee, proposes the process by which the Council could be created, its responsibilities and how it could function.

"The recommendations in this report have been widely anticipated and will be of significant interest to hunters around the country.

"I expect the Government will be in a position to announce its formal response by September."
