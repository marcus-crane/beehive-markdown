Education Minister Anne Tolley today launched the Greater Christchurch Schools Network website, which will enable schools throughout the region to connect with each other and collaborate more effectively online.

The website, launched by the Minister at Burnside High School, will enable schools to share resources, collaborate on online projects, access a range of services and participate in professional development opportunities.

"This network has all the ingredients for long-term success," says Mrs Tolley.

"It has the participation of primary, intermediate and secondary schools, significant support and enthusiasm at school leadership level, as well as links with tertiary education and the business community. This will ensure that students are continuously connected as they progress through the schooling system and into employment.

"It's a great example of what can be achieved when the whole community works together to harness ultra-fast broadband for the good of its young people."

The Greater Christchurch Schools Network currently involves more than 90 of the schools in the region, and was established with funding from Christchurch Development Corporation, Enable Networks and Core Education.

"As part of Budget 2010 Government announced that $48.3 million will be invested in building ultra-fast broadband under the School Network Upgrade Project and to extend the National Education Network trial," says Mrs Tolley.

"I can confirm that this new Budget funding will allow subsidised internal network upgrades for around 40 additional schools in the wider Canterbury region this year, as part of the School Network Upgrade Project."

This initiative has so far upgraded the electrical and data cabling infrastructure in 473 state and state-integrated schools around the country to enable them to use ultra-fast broadband.

26 Christchurch schools are set to join an extended trial of a National Education Network next month, with more to be confirmed shortly. The trial will provide online content and services via a dedicated private network for up to 200 schools on open-access fibre. Budget 2010 allows funding for a further 300 schools to participate in the trial extension.
