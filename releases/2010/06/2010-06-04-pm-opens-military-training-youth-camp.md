Unemployed young New Zealanders looking for direction and discipline will have the opportunity to challenge themselves at the brand-new Hobsonville Limited Service Volunteer (LSV) course, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Launched today, the LSV course is the first for the upper North Island, and is aimed primarily at unemployed New Zealanders aged between 18 and 25.

"The focus on discipline, motivation, respect and self-confidence means these young people come out of the course with the skills to obtain jobs and the focus to build more positive lives for themselves," says Mr Key.

The LSV courses have been running for 17 years with the express purpose of preparing young people for work.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the success stories coming out of the LSV programme prompted the Government to expand its capacity, funding an additional 1250 places as part of the Youth Opportunities package released last August.

"We're investing $19.1 million of new funding into LSV courses, putting more than 1900 young people through the course each year."

Before the addition of the Hobsonville course, 720 LSV places were available at the Burnham military base. An additional course started in Wellington in May.

The LSV programme is a joint initiative between the Ministry of Social Development and the Defence Force.

Both Work and Income and the Defence Force work with local employers to match LSV graduates with jobs on completion of the course.
