State Owned Enterprises Minister Simon Power today released a set of financial performance measures which SOEs will be expected to include in their Statements of Corporate Intent from 2010/11. 

"The National-led Government has made a commitment to improve the transparency and accountability of the SOEs," Mr Power said.

"These companies represent a $25 billion investment on behalf of the taxpayer, and shareholding ministers have a duty to ensure that this investment delivers an appropriate return.

"As such, shareholding ministers asked officials to develop a suite of financial performance measures to provide more information about each SOE's performance. 

"Following consultation with the SOEs, 11 measures have been agreed, and I expect these to be included in each company's Statement of Corporate Intent from 2010/11.

"This is another step towards providing taxpayers with the tools to assess how their investment in this portfolio is performing."

The financial performance measures cover shareholder returns, profitability and efficiency, and leverage and solvency.  A full copy is attached.
