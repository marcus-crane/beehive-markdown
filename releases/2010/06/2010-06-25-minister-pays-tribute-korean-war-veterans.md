The Minister of Veterans' Affairs, Judith Collins, today paid tribute to the veterans of the Korean War which started 60 years ago today.

On 25 June 1950, troops from North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations Security Council asked its members to assist South Korea. 

New Zealand was one of the first countries to respond to that request, and the Korean War became New Zealand's first major military commitment since the Second World War.

The Government initially provided two frigates, followed by a volunteer force of 1,000 men known as Kayforce. 

"The Kiwis showed courage in the face of constant danger, both on land and at sea, during this cold and bloody war," said Ms Collins.  "Today I honour their service, and pay tribute to the 45 Kiwis who lost their lives in Korea."

Over the course of the war more than 4,700 New Zealanders served as a part of Kayforce. Another 1,350 New Zealanders were deployed to Korea with the Royal New Zealand Navy.

"We honour those New Zealanders lost in battle. We also remember the two New Zealanders taken prisoner of war and held in northern North Korea until the signing of the Armistice," Ms Collins said.

"Their legacy has been 60 years of friendship between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. Our two countries have a bond which, although forged during a time of conflict, nonetheless continues to grow in the pursuit of peace."
