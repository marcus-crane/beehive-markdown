Agriculture Minister David Carter is calling on Fonterra's farmer-shareholders to exercise their vote on the proposed capital restructure of the company. 

"The Government's goal is to promote a vibrant and innovative dairy sector by ensuring that the market for farmers' milk is contestable and that open entry and exit is maintained," says Mr Carter.  

This means that suppliers must be able to buy and sell Fonterra shares in a timely manner and at a fair and reasonable price so they can freely supply the processor of their choice, or change land use.  

 "The Government also shares and supports Fonterra's objective of changing its capital structure to make its capital base more sustainable and robust and to secure new capital for growth," Mr Carter says.

 "But the decision on Fonterra's new capital structure sits squarely with its shareholders who have until 30 June to vote.

 "All New Zealanders have a vested interest in the success of our dairy industry because it is a significant contributor to the economy, accounting for almost 30 percent of the value of total merchandise exports.

 "The Government aims to ensure that the industry operates efficiently and can secure the capital necessary to contribute to New Zealand's economic growth.

 "If Fonterra's shareholders approve the current proposal, and pending Fonterra's final design decisions, the Government in consultation with all dairy industry stakeholders will determine how the current regulatory regime should be modified.

 "This would allow Fonterra's capital structure changes to proceed while ensuring that the Government's contestability objectives are met on a continuing basis," Mr Carter says.
