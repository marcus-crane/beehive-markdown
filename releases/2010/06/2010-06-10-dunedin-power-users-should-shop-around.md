Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee is encouraging consumers to shop around for the best power deals, after Contact Energy's announcement of electricity price increases in Dunedin.

"Consumers in Dunedin should check out the PowerSwitch website - [www.powerswitch.org.nz](http://www.powerswitch.org.nz/) - and work out the best company for their needs.

"Often quite substantial savings can be made by switching power suppliers. Two new companies have recently entered the Dunedin market offering very competitive prices," Mr Brownlee said.

He also pointed to increased insulation and the use of clean-heat devices like heat pumps as ways consumers could get more "bang for their buck" from power bills.

"A properly insulated home means electricity is far more efficiently used, and using a heat pump on a timer means real savings can be made," Mr Brownlee said.

The government provides grants of up to $1,800 for houses built before 2000 that require ceiling and under floor insulation or a clean heating device, regardless of income.  Consumers should go to [www.energywise.govt.nz](http://www.energywise.govt.nz/) for more information.

Mr Brownlee said the Electricity Industry Bill, currently before Parliament, would constrain future electricity price increases, and smooth out the very steep price path which was a legacy of the Labour-led government.

"No government can promise to lower power prices.  What we can do is make the market works much better for consumers, and that is what the government's reforms aim to do," Mr Brownlee said.
