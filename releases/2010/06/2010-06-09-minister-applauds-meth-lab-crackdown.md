A six-month Police drugs operation which culminated in raids on three suspected Christchurch clan labs will put a major dent in the local methamphetamine supply, Police Minister Judith Collins said.

Police this morning terminated Operation Granite which involved executing 15 warrants at addresses around Christchurch. As a result, 11 people have been arrested and will be facing drugs or firearms charges.

Ms Collins inspected one of the properties in central Christchurch today. A firearm, $20,000 - $30,000 in cash and a large quantity of methamphetamine was seized during the operation which involved Special Tactics Group and Armed Offenders Squad staff.

"The labs raided today appeared to be part of a large, commercial methamphetamine operation. Shutting them down will be a major blow to the criminal syndicates who manufacture this evil drug and sell it in this community," Ms Collins said.

"Thanks to the good work of Police there will be a lot less methamphetamine available on the streets of Christchurch. Today is a black day for the manufacturers and the dealers who create so much misery in this community.

"Today's operation sends a strong message to drug manufacturers all over the country: Police are coming after you, they're coming after your illegal businesses and they're coming after the profits of your crimes."

The Government has made tackling methamphetamine a priority, and introduced a raft of new laws to give Police the upper hand against the drug barons.

This includes new powers to detect and seize the profits that gangs and organised crime obtain illegally.
