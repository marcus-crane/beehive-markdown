The Crown signed Terms of Negotiation with Ngāti Korokī Kahukura and Ngāti Hauā at Pōhara marae near Pūtāruru yesterday in a further step towards settling historical Treaty claims in the Waikato region, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

Ngāti Korokī Kahukura and Ngāti Hauā are groups with close links to Waikato-Tainui Raukawa and Hauraki iwi.  The raupatu claims of Ngāti Korokī Kahukura and Ngāti Hauā were settled under the Waikato Raupatu Settlement Act 1995.  The terms of negotiation set out the rules of engagement for a comprehensive settlement of their remaining claims in the Waikato area.

"There is significant and exciting progress underway in the Waikato and Tauranga areas right now", Mr Finlayson said.  "We hope this signing will encourage other groups in these regions to work with the Crown and with each other towards achieving their settlement milestones."

The government has a goal of settling all historic claims by 2014.

Since June 2009, the Crown has signed seven Terms of Negotiation, eleven Agreements in Principle and six Deeds of Settlement throughout New Zealand, representing an increase in the pace of settlements.

Ngāti Korokī Kahukura and Ngāti Hauā have interests in the eastern Waikato area, near Tauranga.  The Crown recently recognised the Taumata Wiiwii Trust's mandate to negotiate the remaining historical Treaty claims of Ngāti Korokī Kahukura and Ngāti Hauā, but the two groups are now likely to proceed on separate timeframes to deeds of settlement.
