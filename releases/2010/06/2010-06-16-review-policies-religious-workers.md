Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced a review of the policy settings relating to religious workers.

 

‘'I recognise that religious leaders are important to the spiritual wellbeing of many New Zealanders. That is why I have asked the Department of Labour to review the current policies to see if they are appropriate, while ensuring the integrity of the immigration system is maintained,'' Dr Coleman says.

 

"Many religious leaders are only granted temporary work permits, so we have various religious communities asking whether their leaders can stay here for longer.''

 

Religious workers make up a small proportion of Immigration New Zealand's case load. Around 10 religious workers are granted residence each year.  The New Zealand Residence Programme allows for 45,000 - 50,000 migrants annually. About 300 religious workers are granted work permits (out of 177,361 temporary work permits issued annually).

 

"We are encouraging those who have a view on immigration policies for religious workers to have their say," Dr Coleman says.

 

Copies of the consultation document were sent late last month to religious communities and people who have expressed an interest in the review.

The deadline to provide written feedback to the Department of Labour on the document has been extended from July 10 to July 16.
