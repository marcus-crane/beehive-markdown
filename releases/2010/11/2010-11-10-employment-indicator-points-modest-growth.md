The latest Leading Indicator of Employment is forecasting modest employment growth over the coming quarters, says Hon Kate Wilkinson.

The quarterly Leading Indicator of Employment uses a broad range of information to give advance notice of turning points in the labour market.

"This indicator forecasts employment will grow between 0.5% and 1% per quarter over the next three quarters", says Ms Wilkinson.

"This is in line with other economic data and shows that the labour market recovery is now well underway," says Ms Wilkinson.

The LIoE continued to increase during the September 2010 quarter and has now recorded five quarters of positive change since September 2009.

The Leading Indicator of Employment is issued quarterly, following the Household Labour Force Survey.

A range of data is used to inform the indicator, including the ANZ Commodity Price Index and the Stock Market Index.
