Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today invited applications for access to radio spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band, which will assist deployment of wireless broadband services in regional New Zealand.

He says delivery of improved broadband services to rural New Zealand is a priority for the government.

"Wireless broadband services are an important part of the mix in some of our regions, where fixed broadband infrastructure can be less economic to deploy."

Parties interested in providing wireless broadband services can apply for access to the managed spectrum park in the 2.5 GHz band, on a first-come-first served basis.  The band is likely to be of interest to smaller industry players, local and regional councils, and iwi.

The government is also considering relaxing acquisition caps in adjacent bands as it considers tenders for the Rural Broadband Initiative.

Mr Joyce says it's evident that some communities want to purchase their wireless broadband from local businesses. 

"Having the open access fibre back-bone being deployed through the Government's Rural Broadband Initiative makes it more feasible for the managed spectrum park to be used by these businesses.

"The government will consider relaxing acquisition caps on spectrum management rights in the adjacent 2.3 and 2.5/2.6 GHz bands, as part of assessing the tenders received in the Rural Broadband Initiative.  This will allow consideration of a broader range of approaches to rural broadband deployments."

Enquiries about the managed spectrum park should be sent to [radiospectrum@med.govt.nz](mailto:radiospectrum@med.govt.nz). 

The Ministry of Economic Development will shortly commence an evaluation process of Rural Broadband Initiative tenders.

 

**Background**

This is the second round for applications to the 2.5 GHz band managed spectrum park.  A first round of applications opened in March 2009, with the round closing in September 2009.  Eighty licences were subsequently awarded on a provisional basis to four organisations.  More information about the MSP can be found at [http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/policy-and-planning/current-projects/radiocommunications/managed-spectrum-parks](http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/policy-and-planning/current-projects/radiocommunications/managed-spectrum-parks)

In 2007, acquisition caps of 40 MHz were applied to bidders in the auction for 2.3 and 2.5/2.6 GHz management rights.  This configuration allowed paired (FDD) and unpaired (TDD) applications, for instance based on LTE or WiMAX technologies.  The power to waive or amend the cap exists in the current management right deeds.
