Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu and Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman today welcomed the swearing in of 16 members of the new Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) in Auckland.

The IPT commences work on Monday, 29 November and will decide all immigration, deportation, refugee and protection appeals in New Zealand.

Established under the Immigration Act 2009, the IPT replaces the current immigration-related appeal bodies and creates a single, ‘one-stop-shop' tribunal to consider all grounds for appeal in one place.

‘'The IPT will enhance the public's perception of the tribunal as a body independent of government decision making and immigration policy,'' says Mrs te Heuheu.

Previously, immigration appeals were heard by four separate appeal bodies, three of which were administered by the Department of Labour: the Removal Review Authority (RRA), the Residence Review Board (RRB), the Refugee Status Appeals Authority (RSAA), and the Deportation Review Tribunal (DRT).  The IPT will now be administered by the Ministry of Justice.

‘'The new tribunal will streamline the immigration and appeal process as there is now one body to hear all grounds for appeal,'' says Dr Coleman.

‘'The 16 members appointed bring a high level of expertise and experience in immigration law and the tribunal will play a vital role in New Zealand fulfilling its international obligations.''

The IPT will be chaired by Judge Bill Hastings.

- **Sharelle Aitchison** LLM BA - currently a part-time member of the RSAA. Ms Aitchison has practised in the areas of refugee, human rights, and criminal law in New Zealand and overseas.
