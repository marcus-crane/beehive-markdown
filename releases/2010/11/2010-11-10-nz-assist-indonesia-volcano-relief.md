New Zealand has committed $500,000 in emergency funding to support humanitarian relief efforts following the eruption of Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The scale of this disaster is rapidly worsening. The latest Government of Indonesia information confirms 141 deaths, 453 seriously injured and 279,702 people living in temporary sites across the four affected districts.

 "New Zealand is contributing $300,000 to the response effort of Sleman Regency, the district government of one of the most affected areas. The contribution will be used to assist with the provision of shelter and essential items for those most affected by the disaster.

"In addition, New Zealand has also made available $200,000 to the International Red Cross for their ongoing relief efforts for both the Mount Merapi eruption and the Mentawai tsunami," said Mr McCully.

New Zealand provided $450,000 to relief efforts, led by NGO SurfAid International, immediately following the Mentawai Tsunami on 25 October.

"Over a short period of time, Indonesia has experienced two significant natural disasters. New Zealand wants to play its part in responding to these emergencies," said Mr McCully.

New Zealand's humanitarian assistance is additional to the $17.7 million annual aid programme with Indonesia.
