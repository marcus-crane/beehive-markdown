Wayne Mapp is travelling to the United States this week for top-level talks in both his portfolio areas of Defence and Research, Science and Technology.

“As the Wellington Declaration makes clear, New Zealand and the US have a close relationship. This visit is an opportunity to build and expand that relationship in both defence and science,” Dr Mapp said today.

“I will be meeting Defence Secretary Robert Gates in Washington and look forward to discussions on the range of international defence and security issues in which we have a mutual interest,” he said.

On the way to Washington the Minister will visit the US Pacific Command in Honolulu and hold talks with Admiral Robert Willard, the Commander.

“Admiral Willard has military responsibility for the Asia-Pacific and Pacific Ocean regions. His command manages most of the defence exercises and exchanges in which we could participate in future,” the Minister said.

Dr Mapp will also call on senior officials at the United Nations in New York, where he will discuss peacekeeping issues and developments in the Asia-Pacific region.

His programme includes a range of meetings with leaders of the US science system.

“In particular I will be meeting Dr John Holdren and Dr Subra Suresh in Washington. Dr Holdren is the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, part of the Executive Office of the President. He advises the President on the effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs.

“Dr Suresh is the newly nominated director for the National Science Foundation, which supports basic research in the US.

“These meetings will deepen the relationships between our major science agencies,” Dr Mapp said.

“Overall, the visit is an early opportunity to advance the practical bilateral co-operation and enhanced dialogue called for in the Wellington Declaration.”
