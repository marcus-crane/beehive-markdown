Taxpayer funded, interest free loans will no longer be available to drunk or dangerous drivers, Acting Minister for Social Development Judith Collins said today.

"The current policy on this is very clear. Anyone who loses their licence due to a driving offence should not expect to be given taxpayer money to apply for a temporary one," Ms Collins said.

Previously, some disqualified drivers who had applied to the courts for a temporary licence have received a loan from Work and Income to meet costs.

"There may be exceptional circumstances where this assistance will be granted, but approval will now have to be given by the Head of Work and Income," Ms Collins said.

"Driving is a privilege not a right. If you lose your licence because you have broken the law, be prepared to take the bus."

Meantime, Ms Collins has asked Work and Income officials to check if the agency is helping pay impoundment fees for vehicles that have been confiscated.
