Justice Minister Simon Power today officially opened the Papakura-Pukekohe Public Defence Service. 

The PDS provides an in-house legal aid service, through the use of salaried staff rather than contracted lawyers.

“The opening of this PDS branch is significant because it marks the completion of the PDS rollout to the Auckland region,” Mr Power said.

“The PDS has gone from strength to strength since it was trialled in 2004, and has benefits including encouraging competition, offering a benchmark for the cost of legal representation, and providing training for junior lawyers.”

The PDS is expected to be rolled out to Wellington, Lower Hutt, and Porirua courts early next year, and to Hamilton and Christchurch by the middle of the year.

Mr Power said the PDS has an important role to play in the new legal aid system that the Government is developing following Dame Margaret Bazley’s report last November.
