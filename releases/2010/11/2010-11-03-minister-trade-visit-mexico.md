Minister of Trade Tim Groser is to lead a delegation of New Zealand businesses interested in exploring trade and investment opportunities in Mexico.

"Mexico is New Zealand's biggest export market in Latin America - and there is significant potential for growth," said Mr Groser. "We are working hard to open doors for New Zealand businesses in this important market."

New Zealand exports to Mexico were worth NZ$360 million in the year to June 2010.

"There are exciting opportunities for New Zealand specialised manufacturing businesses to invest in Mexico," said Mr Groser. 

Mr Groser will host, and deliver the keynote address to a business event to be attended by Mexican Trade Minister, Bruno Ferrari, and Mexican business leaders.    

"I will be meeting with Mexican Trade Minister Ferrari, to promote closer economic links between New Zealand and Mexico," said Mr Groser.  Mr Groser will also meet Mexico's Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Energy and Environment. 

In his role as Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, Mr Groser will also attend a high level meeting of key Ministers, seeking to prepare the ground for the major UN climate change conference to be held in Cancun in December.

"New Zealand is playing an active role in these negotiations and is working closely with Mexico in the lead up to the climate change summit," said Mr Groser.
