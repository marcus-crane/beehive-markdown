Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced his approval for Environment Canterbury Commissioners to place a moratorium on new water takes from the Waiau River and its tributaries. 

"This 10 month moratorium on granting new water takes on the Waiau is to give a window of opportunity to develop a long term sustainable plan for water in North Canterbury," Dr Smith said. "It parallels the moratorium placed on the Hurunui in July that also expires on 1 October 2011.

"The Environment Canterbury Commissioners have asked me to use the special moratorium process of the Environment Canterbury Act for a second time.  Following consultation with Cabinet and Caucus, I have approved their proposal. Commissioners will make the final decision on the moratorium at their council meeting tomorrow.

"The Waiau River is strategically important in the wider debate over Canterbury's water in that it has a large block of high flow water suitable for storage that is not allocated.  I don't believe the default mechanism of first-come, first-served is the optimal way in which to determine the use of this resource.

"I will be asking the Hurunui-Waiau Zone Committee to have strong input into determining the best use of this water for the benefit of their community and Canterbury.

"This moratorium allows the Committee time and space to consider an integrated solution for both the Hurunui and Waiau Rivers catchments.  It provides an opportunity for a collaborative local approach to develop a balanced and comprehensive plan that will impact upon the future of the Waiau-Hurunui Catchment for generations to come.

"Access to freshwater is New Zealand's key economic advantage and we need to get more strategic to ensure we use it to our best advantage.  Irrigation in Canterbury needs to occur in a planned and sustainable way and this use of the special powers under the Environment Canterbury Act (2010) to create a moratorium reinforces that."
