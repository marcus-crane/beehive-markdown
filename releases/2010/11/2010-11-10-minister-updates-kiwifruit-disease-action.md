Biosecurity Minister David Carter says tests have now confirmed that the kiwifruit vine disease Psa is on three orchards in the Te Puke area, and a further two orchards have been placed in quarantine pending a likely positive identification.

Mr Carter today visited the Bay of Plenty where he met with kiwifruit industry representatives and growers, visited an orchard and viewed testing facilities at Plant & Food Research.

"Growers are obviously very worried about the situation but they are appreciative of the efforts of MAF BiosecurityNZ and ZESPRI and understand the need to gain more information before key decisions can be made."

Mr Carter says MAF will begin a copper spray programme on infected orchards tomorrow in a bid to reduce the spread of the bacteria. 

"20 properties out of 75 that have made contact about possible symptoms are currently being investigated by MAF.  While the preferred option of dealing with Psa is eradication, this decision can only be made once the spread of the disease is determined.

"We hope to know this by Friday afternoon.

"It is still too early to say how Psa arrived in New Zealand, or how long it has been here.  The disease appears to attack under certain climatic conditions and may have always been here.

"At this stage, no trade restrictions have been placed on New Zealand kiwifruit but Australia and the United States have placed restrictions on the importation of kiwifruit plant material.

"The discovery of Psa is being treated very seriously and an additional 20 MAF contractors and 20 ZESPRI staff will be assisting from tomorrow with the investigation of properties with symptoms."

Mr Carter says daily updates will be released on the situation.
