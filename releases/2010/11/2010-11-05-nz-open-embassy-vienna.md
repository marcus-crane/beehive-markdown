New Zealand is to open a full Embassy in Vienna, Austria, in January 2011, Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced. 

New Zealand already has a Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Vienna, which will now be co-located with the Embassy.

"New Zealand and Austria share many common values and have a good record of cooperation on international issues," Minister McCully says.

"The Embassy in Vienna will help to consolidate New Zealand's diplomatic footprint in Europe.  Vienna is an important gateway into Central and Eastern Europe and it is the home of many significant international organisations. 

"A key focus of the Embassy will be to develop trade and economic links with Austria and its neighbouring region."

Career diplomat Philip Griffiths will take up the position of Ambassador to Austria in January 2011. Mr Griffiths will also hold the position as New Zealand's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna.
