Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia today announced the three Te Apa Mareikura Award recipients and two John McLeod Scholarship recipients.

Hori Barsdell, Phillip Tane, Matiu Julian, Pirihia Roberts and Harata Te-Amo Simeon have been acknowledged for their exceptional academic and community achievements in Maori health.

"These wonderful recipients have made an indelible mark in shaping the nature of the communities around them.

"I am told they are all multi-talented and multi-skilled and understand the collaboration and cooperation that is needed to create health and wellbeing in our communities," says Mrs Turia.

The two John McLeod Scholarships are named after the late Dr John McLeod who was renown, nationally and internationally for his work in public health and his significant contribution toward improving Maori health status.

These scholarships are awarded annually to applicants to the Hauora Maori scholarship programme and given to individuals who have achieved outstanding academic success in Maori health. 

This year's John McLeod scholars are Phillip Tane (Ngapuhi, Ngati Maniapoto) who is studying at the University of Auckland and Hori Barsdell (Ngati Awa, Te Whakatohea, Ngai Te Rangi and Te Arawa) who is studying at the university of Otago.

Te Apa Mareikura Awards have recently been established under the Hauora Maori programme to acknowledge four prominent Maori community leaders - Rongo Wirepa, Anne Delamare, Denis Simpson and Bill Katene for their contribution to the improvement of Maori health.

This year's Te Apa Mareikura Awards go to Palmerston North based, Matiu Julian (Te Ati Haunui a Paparangi, Nga Ruahine) Whanganui based Pirihia Roberts (Te Arawa, Nga Ruahine, Te Ati Haunui a Paparangi) and Whakatane based Harata Te Amo-Simeon (Ngai Tuhoe, Ngati Rongomaiwahine, Ngati Awa).

All recipients have demonstrated competencies in community health, strong connections to and involvement with the community, proven leadership ability, effective community networks and academic performance that contributed to future Maori health gains.
