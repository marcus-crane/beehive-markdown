Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Tamaki has been selected to receive a funding boost to increase participation in early childhood education.

Tamaki joins the intensive community-led projects which are already underway in Waitakere and Northland, as part of a $91.8 million plan announced in Budget 2010 to provide 3500 extra ECE places.

"In some parts of Tamaki, nearly 40% of children miss out on ECE," says Mrs Tolley.

"We need to do more to attract these families to ECE and ensure they have high-quality services, to provide the best possible start in life for our young New Zealanders.

"The Government is increasing its investment in ECE to $1.3 billion in the coming year, but while the cost to the taxpayer has trebled in the last five years, participation has increased by less than one per cent.

"That's why we are focused on increasing opportunities for the children who are currently missing out."

The new community project involves building new services and funding supported playgroups, street side playgroups and play days in local communities, and supporting education and care arrangements in the home to attract families into ECE.

The Tamaki project, which will begin in the new year, will support the Government's Tamaki transformation programme. This set a number of goals for Tamaki, including increasing the achievement of young people in the area. 

"Community involvement is crucial to the success of these projects, and the Tamaki transformation work will provide a platform to make a real difference in a key growth area of Auckland."

The Ministry will continue to work with community groups to establish the best targeted support for Tamaki families.

The location of the two remaining participation projects will be announced in the next few months.
