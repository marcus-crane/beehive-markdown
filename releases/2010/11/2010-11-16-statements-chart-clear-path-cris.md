Statements of core purpose for Crown research institutes released today set out a clear and explicit role for each one, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp.

"The eight CRIs are a cornerstone of the science that underpins New Zealand's economic and environmental wellbeing. They have a key role in our science and innovation system.

"The statements of core purpose show how CRIs will deliver greater value to New Zealand, and help achieve our national science priorities.

"These statements provide an enduring role for each CRI. They explain the strategic purpose of each CRI, the outcomes from their work, and how they will collaborate with other research institutions for the benefit of all New Zealanders," he said.

The statements of core purpose recognise CRIs' different stakeholders and the research end-users they serve.  Each CRI worked closely with its key industry and government stakeholders and research partners to develop its statement.

Statements of core purpose were recommended in the report of the CRI Taskforce, endorsed by the Government in March this year.  CRIs will use the statements of core purpose to underpin their business strategies.  CRIs' new strategies are set to be in place by July 2011.

"I look forward to working with CRIs as they use these statements to chart their strategy," Dr Mapp said.
