Removing retail tobacco displays and tightening up tobacco controls have been announced by Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia today.

"Tobacco casts a long shadow of death and disease that has touched almost every household in New Zealand," says Mrs Turia.

"This Government is serious about reducing the threat to the lives of New Zealanders and this is another strong step in realising this commitment."

The Cabinet decisions, confirmed last week and announced today, outlines a package of increased control measures focused on the retail environment and include:

- Prohibiting any visible display of tobacco products for sale
- Tighter legislation regarding the display of trading names for tobacco outlets
- Enabling Smoke-free Enforcement Officers to issue instant infringement fines to those selling tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18.
- Clarifying that any contracts and agreements covering trade rebates and discounts for selling tobacco which are inconsistent with the Smokefree Environments Act are legally void.

These changes are to be brought in by amendment to the Smokefree Environments Act and subsequent regulations.

The Government will also monitor progress on Australia's proposal to legislate for plain packaging of tobacco products by 2012 and explore the option of New Zealand making similar moves in alignment with Australia.

Mrs Turia says today's announcements will meet a number of the recommendations outlined in the Maori Affairs Select Committee Report on tobacco.

"I am absolutely committed to reducing tobacco related harms and the massive health inequalities that smoking brings," says Mrs Turia. 

"There is still so much to be done, but I'm more confident than ever that we can reach the goal of New Zealand being a nation free of tobacco."
