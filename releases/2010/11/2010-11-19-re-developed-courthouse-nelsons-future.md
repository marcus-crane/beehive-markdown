Nelson's re-developed courthouse was opened today by Courts Minister Hon Georgina te Heuheu.

Mrs te Heuheu said that improving access to justice is a priority for the Government, and the provision of modern court facilities is a key part of that.

The re-developed courthouse had been designed to meet the needs of the Nelson community well into the future.

"The building has undergone a spectacular transformation, and includes five courtrooms - two designed for jury trials with jury retirement rooms, and one family courtroom - two mediation/hearing rooms and 10 interview rooms," Mrs te Heuheu said. 

"There are also new cells and a dedicated space for security officers.

"The large glass areas to the public street are symbolic of the transparency of our court system, and the building has a distinct civic character. 

"The additional facilities will make a great difference, both in terms of the service we provide to court users and the environment in which court staff work."

One of the greatest benefits of the building is that it allows the Disputes and Tenancy Tribunals to operate under the same roof as the combined District and High Court and Nelson Collections Unit.

Mrs te Heuheu said she was delighted efforts had been made to preserve the building's history.  A foundation stone laid in the site more than 150 years ago has been incorporated into the re-design.

"As well, to mark the 150th anniversary since the laying of the foundation stone for the original courthouse, a time capsule has been placed in one of the walls of the foyer.  This capsule contains a variety of historical treasures such as coins, old copies of the Nelson Mail newspaper, copies of the 1974 and 2009 Nelson phone books, and court forms", Mrs te Heuheu said.

The city has had a court since 1842, and the Nelson Courthouse was also used as a polling station during the General Election that saw New Zealand women cast their vote for the first time.
