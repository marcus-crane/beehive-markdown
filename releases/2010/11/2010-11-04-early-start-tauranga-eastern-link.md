Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed news today that construction on the Tauranga Eastern Link will start later this month - more than six months ahead of schedule.

The Tauranga Eastern Link was identified as a Road of National Significance as it will be a key driver of productivity and growth in the Bay of Plenty and Tauranga - one of New Zealand's fastest growing areas.

Mr Joyce says the benefits of the new road will be huge for the Bay of Plenty and very significant for the whole country.

"It's great to see such solid progress and to know that the very significant benefits of this project will now be felt even earlier.

"It is estimated that on average 200 to 250 people will be working on the project at any given time over the next five years, with more jobs expected to be created or retained in support industries and the wider regional economy.

"In the longer term, the new road will boost productivity, improve access to the Port of Tauranga and greatly enhance safety."

It's estimated that the new road will shave up to 24 minutes off travel time for a return journey between Paengaroa and Te Maunga.

"As well as shortening the journey for motorists and reducing transport costs for business,  greater efficiencies and access to the Port of Tauranga will help increase the volume of exports and in turn the growth of the region," says Mr Joyce.

"It will also bring significant safety gains on State highway 2 between Tauranga and Paengaroa, which is ranked second worst in the country per kilometre for fatal and serious injury crashes by the KiwiRap programme."

The road is estimated to cost a total of $455 million in today's dollars
