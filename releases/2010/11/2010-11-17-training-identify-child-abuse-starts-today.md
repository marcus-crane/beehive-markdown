Teachers and health workers will get training to recognise and respond to child abuse in a nationwide initiative announced by Acting Social Development Minister Judith Collins today.

"Too often it becomes clear after a child has been beaten, abused or even killed, that someone knew there was a problem, but didn't step in," says Ms Collins.

Between June 2009 and June 2010 Child, Youth and Family received 124,921 reports of concern about children, of which 55,494 required further action.

"Children are vulnerable to abuse and often from the very people who should be caring for them, so others have to know how to protect children," says Ms Collins. 

Child, Youth and Family and child protection trainers 'Child Matters' are jointly delivering the series of free workshops to professionals who work with children.

"New Zealand sees too many cases like the deaths of the Kahui twins, which can be prevented if people know how to identify problems and act," says Ms Collins.

The workshops starting today will run until March next year, reaching more than 20 towns around the country and training 800 people.
