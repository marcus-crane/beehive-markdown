New regulations that take effect today requiring significant water takes to be metered are essential for New Zealand to better manage freshwater, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

"We can't manage what we don't measure," Dr Smith said. "We know that over the past decade we have doubled the amount of water that can be legally taken from our rivers, lakes and aquifers to 450 million cubic metres per week. That is 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools every minute. We also know we are reaching resource limits in significant areas.  We need to know how much water is actually taken and when if we are to properly manage New Zealand's hugely valuable freshwater resource."

The Resource Management (Measurement and Reporting of Water Takes) Regulations 2010 take effect today and require all new water takes of more than 5 litres a second to be metered. Existing takes of more than 20 litres a second must be metered within two years (10 November 2012), those more than 10 litres a second must be metered with four years (10 November 2014) and all takes more than 5 litres a second within six years (10 November 2016).

"These regulations will hugely improve the information we have on water takes.  We currently measure only 31% of allocated water. These regulations will increase this to 92% in 2012, 96% in 2014 and 98% in 2016," Dr Smith said.

"The regulations will affect 11,000 water take consents. Water meters range in cost from $2800 to $9600 depending on their size with an estimated total cost of $40 million. This cost is well justified noting that water contributes more than $5 billion a year to New Zealand's economy and only a small gain in efficiency of use will offset the cost of metering.

"These pragmatic regulations do not apply to small water takes less than 5 litres per second that make up 39% of consents but only 2% of the volume of water taken. Requiring small takes such as households and stock water to be metered could not be justified nationally.

"The Government is providing $90,000 to Irrigation New Zealand to develop guidance about water meters, verification and installation to irrigators so as to ensure the smooth implementation of these new regulations.  We also want irrigators to be well informed as to how to use this information to improve the efficiency of water use.

"These new regulations on water metering are part of a broader programme to improve New Zealand's freshwater management.  This has included major investments in lake and river clean-ups, toughened penalties and stronger enforcement of resource consents, doubling funding for the New Zealand Landcare Trust, addressing Environment Canterbury's problems and progressing the work of the Land and Water Forum. This Government recognises how important water will be to New Zealand's future economic and environmental well being."
