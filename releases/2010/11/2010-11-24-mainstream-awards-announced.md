Employers in the state sector have been recognised for going the extra mile for staff with significant disabilities.

Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia presented the Mainstream Awards at a ceremony in Wellington today.

Newlands College was named the 2010 Employer of the Year in recognition of their success in providing high quality supported employment.

Poly-Emp, an Employment and Advisory Services, was named Placement Specialist of the Year the award pays tribute to the training that has been provided to participants which has made the difference in their career development.

In its 11th year, the awards acknowledge employers who have a record in creating successful job placements for disabled people in the state sector.

Mrs Turia says Mainstream is an ideal stepping stone for supporting people with significant disabilities to get a job and has helped more than 200 people to find work.

"What's really fantastic about these awards is that staff nominate their employers for the awards.

"I am told that Newlands College stood out because of their focus and commitment to providing job opportunities for people with disabilities," says Mrs Turia.

"By providing meaningful employment they are also demonstrating to their students that having a disability is not a barrier to finding employment."

The Mainstream Employment Programme provides a package of subsidies, training, and other support to help people with significant disabilities get work in the state service.
