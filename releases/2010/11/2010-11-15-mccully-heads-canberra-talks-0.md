Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Canberra this afternoon to hold bi-annual talks with his Australian counterpart, Kevin Rudd.

"New Zealand and Australia continue to achieve a great deal together, both internationally and bilaterally," Mr McCully said.

"These talks are an opportunity to discuss the foreign policy agenda in depth, and to set our shared goals for our trans-Tasman relationship."

"We already work very closely and collaboratively on a number of fronts, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Our discussions in Canberra will cover regional and global issues, and how we can further improve cooperation with our partners, including in the Pacific Islands Forum."

The last formal talks between Australian and New Zealand foreign ministers were held in February 2010.
