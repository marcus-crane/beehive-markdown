New Zealand Commerce Minister Simon Power and Australian Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury today announced cross-appointments between the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the New Zealand Commerce Commission.

The cross-appointments are one of the key outcomes under the Single Economic Market Outcomes Framework announced by the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers in August last year.

Mr Power said the appointments will support convergence in the way the two regulators approach similar issues under competition and consumer laws.

"This will lead to more efficient and effective processes, and reduce business compliance costs for those operating on both sides of the Tasman."

Mr Bradbury said: "This is a significant step that will further enhance the cooperation and coordination between these regulators and will improve the alignment and administration of competition and consumer laws between our countries."

Commerce Commission chair Dr Mark Berry has been appointed as an associate member of the ACCC and will be in a position to participate in all matters brought before the ACCC.  At an operational level, he will bring valuable expertise to it. 

ACCC member Dr Jill Walker will join the Commerce Commission as an associate member and will participate in matters relating to the Commerce and Fair Trading Acts.  She will be involved in particular issues that have a trans-Tasman dimension such as merger clearance work involving trans-Tasman market developments. 

The two are expected to carry out most of their work from their respective countries but may cross the Tasman from time to time.  They have been appointed for three-year terms from 1 December 2010 to 30 November 2013.

There will be an internal assessment near the end of the cross-appointment period to assess the arrangement and see if there is any need for enhancements or amendments.  It is envisaged that the term of any future appointments will coincide with the member's appointment to their home agency.
