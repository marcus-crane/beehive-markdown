Biosecurity Minister David Carter is reassuring kiwifruit growers that the Government is treating a newly discovered vine infection on a North Island kiwifruit orchard very seriously, and is making all necessary resources available.

"Swift action is underway to confirm whether the vine infection is Psa, a bacterial kiwifruit vine disease.  MAF Biosecurity New Zealand is working closely with ZESPRI, Plant & Food Research and New Zealand Kiwifruit Growers Inc.

"We are confident that robust testing will quickly determine the next steps.

"This potential risk to our kiwifruit industry is being taken seriously.  While the strain of the disease is not yet known, all necessary precautions have been put in place on the orchard to avoid the disease spreading. 

"It is imperative that a considered and responsible approach to this potential threat is taken by all primary sector stakeholders while the kiwifruit industry and Government works out exactly what we are dealing with," says Mr Carter.
