A national campaign to promote the switch to digital television was launched today by Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

The Going Digital campaign provides a website, www.goingdigital.co.nz and a free-phone helpline, 0800 838 800, so people can get the information and advice they need about switching to digital TV.

The Government announced in September that New Zealand will make the switch, region by region, to digital television by November 2013, beginning with Hawke’s Bay and the West Coast in September 2012.

“Over the coming months, Going Digital will be working with local communities to ensure viewers know where to turn for advice,’’ Dr Coleman says.

“71 per cent of New Zealand households are already watching digital television through either Freeview, Sky or TelstraClear. Going Digital will ensure people know about the change, and that advice and practical support is available for those who need it.”

The Going Digital campaign will encourage people to visit the website where they can find detailed information about when they will switch and what digital services and channels they can receive.

Households that have Freeview, Sky or TelstraClear, are already set for digital switchover. Other viewers do not need to buy a new television to make the switch, but may need to buy a set-top box and possibly a new aerial or satellite dish depending on what equipment they currently have and where they live.

‘’In just under three years New Zealand will have completed the transition to digital television and today’s launch is the start of high profile campaign to ensure that transition goes as smoothly as possible,’’ Dr Coleman says.
