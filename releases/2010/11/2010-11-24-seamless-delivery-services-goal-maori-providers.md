Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia today launched the Whanau Ora Integrated Services Delivery Report, a study that looked into how Maori health providers deliver integrated services across health and other sectors.

"The findings of this study provide useful information as the implementation of the Government's Whanau Ora initiative gets into full swing," says Mrs Turia.

"The strong links that Maori providers have with communities put them in a unique position to respond directly to their needs and realities."

Providers who participated in the study are strongly committed to improving the health and well-being of whanau."

Mrs Turia says the providers know the importance of delivering clinically sound and culturally competent services.

"Compromising one for another is not an option. Safe and effective clinical and cultural standards must be evident in an integrated and whānau-centred organisation," says Mrs Turia.

"This study shows that these Maori providers meet those needs in comprehensive and integrated ways."

The study, commissioned by the Ministry of Health, identifies key features of integrated service delivery through case studies of six Maori health providers - He Oranga Pounamu (Christchurch), Ngati Porou Hauora (Te Puia Springs), Ora Toa Health Services (Porirua), Raukura Hauora o Tainui (Waikato), Te Oranganui Iwi Health Authority (Whanganui) and Tui Ora Ltd (Taranaki).
