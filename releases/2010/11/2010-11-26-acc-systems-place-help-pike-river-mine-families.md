ACC is prepared to do all it can to assist the families of the 29 Pike River Mine workers, ACC Minister Nick Smith says. 

"The tragedy at Pike River Mine is expected to be the biggest claim for a workplace accident in the history of the ACC scheme," Dr Smith said. "A tragedy of this sort is exactly why we have a comprehensive no-fault accident compensation scheme and why New Zealanders make a contribution towards it. No one should have to go through drawn-out litigation for entitlements after such a traumatic event. 

"All families of the Pike River workers are eligible for financial support from ACC which can include survivor and funeral grants and loss of income compensation.

"ACC is well prepared for a major event such as this where there are multiple claims. It is able to lodge claims based on basic information, does not require specific forms, and will not be awaiting any inquiry to get support to the families.

"ACC has already deployed a senior staff member to Greymouth to assist the families and help ACC staff in the town. It has put together information packs for the families that have been made available. ACC will also be working closely with Work and Income and Victim Support to ensure families receive the support they need. 

"I want to assure the families of the Pike River workers that ACC will provide every assistance at this difficult time and provide the certainty and support they need."
