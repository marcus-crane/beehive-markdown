Science and technology ties between New Zealand and France have been reinforced with the re-signing of the Dumont d'Urville programme, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp.

The Dumont d'Urville programme funds New Zealand and French researchers' travel between the two countries to work on projects in mutually important areas.

"Research collaboration between France and New Zealand is flourishing," the Minister said at the re-signing ceremony.

"This arrangement is of real value to both countries. It has made a very positive contribution to building research collaborations, particularly in nano-science and biotechnology.

"For example, the programme has led to New Zealand and French researchers making a breakthrough in agricultural greenhouse gas research," Dr Mapp said.

"The original five-year arrangement was signed in 2005.  It has been very successful and both countries have now recommitted to the relationship indefinitely.

"By making a further commitment to this scheme, the two Governments will ensure scientific knowledge in important fields is shared between our two countries," he said. 

The arrangement was re-signed in Wellington yesterday by Acting Chief Executive of the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology Lesley Middleton and French Ambassador Francis Etienne.

**About the programme**

The Dumont d'Urville programme is managed in New Zealand by the Royal Society of New Zealand. It is open to all French and New Zealand researchers, with funding provided by the French and New Zealand Governments.

The 2010-11 priority research fields for the programme are:

- food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology
- renewable energy and energy efficiency
- biodiversity
- nano-science.

The programme is named in honour of the French explorer Dumont d'Urville, who made several expeditions to New Zealand in the 1820s and 1830s to map parts of the New Zealand coastline.
