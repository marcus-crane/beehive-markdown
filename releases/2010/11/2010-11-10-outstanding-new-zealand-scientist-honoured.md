Professor Warren Tate of the University of Otago is this year's winner of the Rutherford Medal.

Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp announced the award and the winners of the Government's new Rutherford Discovery Fellowships at the Royal Society Research Honours dinner in Christchurch tonight.

"Professor Tate is one of New Zealand's most outstanding scientists. He is highly respected worldwide for his groundbreaking discoveries in cell biology.

"The breadth of his research is especially impressive. His commitment to solving critical medical problems has led to breakthrough research in HIV, Alzheimer's and chronic fatigue.

 "He has also made major contributions outside the laboratory, in teaching, training and to national and international science policy," Dr Mapp said.

The Rutherford Medal honours a researcher for a lifetime of outstanding contributions to science and technology in New Zealand - both in research and in the promotion of public awareness and understanding of science.

The Rutherford Discovery Fellowships were created by the Government this year to provide more support to New Zealand researchers early in their career.

The Minister said that the Fellowships support excellence across all areas of research.

"These are the types of talented and enthusiastic people that are central to the success of our science and innovation system.

"We need to keep our best and brightest minds in New Zealand, or attract them back from overseas.

"This is why the Fellowships provide support of up to $200,000 a year for five years, making them competitive with overseas schemes.  They will allow these outstanding researchers to prove themselves," he said.

In the first four years the Government will invest more than $24 million into the Fellowships.  By the 2015/2016 financial year more than $9 million a year will fund about 50 Fellows at any one time.

Rutherford Medal winner Professor Tate receives $100,000 from the Government.
