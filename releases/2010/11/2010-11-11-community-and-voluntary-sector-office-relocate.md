Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia has announced that the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector will operate from the Department of Internal Affairs from 1 February next year.

The decision was made following a review by the State Services Commission.

A report last year from the Association of Non-Governmental Organisations of Aotearoa recommended that the government review the location of the Office of the Community and Voluntary Sector.

"I believe it is important that the sector has a clear point of contact in government at national and local levels with which it can develop relationships and work together.

"The move will simplify access to government for the relevant community groups and means they deal with one department not two, with a single work programme," says Mrs Turia.

Minister for Internal Affairs Nathan Guy is welcoming the move.

"Internal Affairs is a strong performing department which has the government's confidence to take on more roles and functions. One of the department's main goals is to build stronger communities and this move will build on that."

From 2011/12 funding associated with the Department's activities that is not the responsibility of the Community and Voluntary Sector Minister will also be transferred from Vote Community and Voluntary Sector to Vote Internal Affairs.
