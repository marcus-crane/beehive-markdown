Associate Minister of Justice Nathan Guy says he is pleased the Real Estate Agents Authority has reduced its levy on agents after consultation with the industry and public.

"The Real Estate Agents Authority has managed to reduce the proposed levy to $690 a year. It was clear from feedback that the original figure was too high, particularly given the slow housing market facing most agents.

"I'm keen to see the REAA make further improvements in their efficiency and operation, particularly in how complaints are processed and dealt with.

"I intend to work with the REAA and other interested groups to find ways of achieving this, and I do not rule out legislative changes in the future if necessary.

"At the same time we must ensure that consumers are protected, which is why the REAA was created - to raise standards in the industry and give consumers confidence.

"Buying a house is the biggest purchase most people will ever make in their lives and it's important that consumers have protection and redress if something goes wrong."
