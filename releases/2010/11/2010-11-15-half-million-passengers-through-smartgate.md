SmartGate, the automated passenger clearance system at Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch Airports, will process its 500,000th passenger today.

Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says this figure shows just how successful SmartGate has been, and how rapidly New Zealander's have taken to this new technology.

The SmartGate system has now been installed for New Zealand and Australian ePassport holders from any destination arriving at Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch International Airports. It will begin operating at Auckland Airport for departures processing next month.

"The number of passengers using SmartGate is increasing as passengers become more aware of the system and more e-Passports are issued. Last week, over 17,000 passengers successfully used SmartGate," Mr Williamson says.

"Passengers will be able to benefit from the same SmartGate experience when it's introduced for departing passengers commencing in Auckland on 1 December and progressively rolled out in 2011".

"The availability of SmartGate for departures is a first and we are working closely with our colleagues across the Tasman on departures," he says.

SmartGate on departures provides an opportunity for integration with SmartGate at Australian arrivals. This could mean that passengers would complete the Australian arrival process on departure from New Zealand and then present themselves to SmartGate in Australia.

SmartGate departures will be available for all eligible travellers to any destination.

SmartGate uses face recognition biometric technology and the information stored in the microchip inside ePassports to perform the identity check that is usually conducted by a Customs officer.
