Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Hon Tariana Turia today announced the recipients of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships for 2011.

“The Churchill Fellows will enrich New Zealand by applying lessons learned from their global counterparts,” says Mrs Turia.

“Our communities will benefit from the diverse international knowledge these Fellows will bring home.”

For 2011, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has awarded $74,000 to 15 people. The average grant is $5000.

Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of travel costs and can spend between three weeks and three months overseas.

Since the Trust was formed in 1965, more than 700 New Zealanders have had the opportunity to conduct valuable research across a diverse range of fields.

The 2011 Fellows include:

- Kaye Vessey, who will travel to the United Kingdom to research ‘home share’ programmes which involve trained hosts opening their homes to older people.
- Mason Tolerton, who will travel to Canada to research the ‘Raven Aboriginal Youth Employment Programme’ and its relevance to Maori youth in New Zealand.
- Libby Robins, who will visit prisons in the United States and Scotland to investigate different ways of working with female prisoners and their infants in order to promote attachment and reduce re-offending.

Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts also operate in the United Kingdom and Australia.
