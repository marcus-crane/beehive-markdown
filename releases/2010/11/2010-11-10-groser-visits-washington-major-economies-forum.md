Tim Groser, Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, is to visit Washington following the conclusion of this week's APEC meetings in Japan to attend a meeting of the Major Economies Forum (MEF) as a special guest. 

The MEF is a grouping of the 17 largest emitting countries. The invitation was extended following Mr Groser's chairing role at the recent climate change ministerial meeting in Mexico City.  At that meeting Mr Groser led discussions on one of the key outstanding difficulties. While technical in nature, the issue goes to the heart of the negotiations. That is, how should individual countries' pledges to reduce their emissions be recorded and how will the international community monitor progress.  

"New Zealand has a constructive position in terms of our domestic policy and we are making a contribution through the Global Research Alliance which seeks to reduce emissions from agriculture.  In Washington I will be looking to help build consensus on this key aspect of the negotiations."

Mr Groser will return to New Zealand on 21 November.
