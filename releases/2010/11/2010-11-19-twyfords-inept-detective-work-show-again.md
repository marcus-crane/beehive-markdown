Phil Twyford's detective work has once again shown him to be inept in his efforts to paint the new Auckland Council as a failure, Minister of Local Government Rodney Hide said today. 

"Mr Twyford's allegation that the savings of $48 million were ‘plucked out of the air' is a total fabrication," Mr Hide said.  
"The savings were set out in detail to the Auditor-General who, based on this information, issued the Auckland Transition Agency with a full and unqualified audit. 

"The $48 million includes: the reduction in on costs, other than direct personal costs - office space, supplies, IT needs; elimination of duplicated services; financing costs savings due to new AA investment rating; procurement efficiencies, and more.

"On top of this, economists Taylor Duggan Berry have identified additional potential annual savings from the transition of $175 million - realised over the medium term and dependent on the actions of the new council," Mr Hide said.
