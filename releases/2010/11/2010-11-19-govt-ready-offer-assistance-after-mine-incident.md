The Government stands ready to offer whatever assistance it can as events unfold at Pike River mine on the West Coast, says the Minister of Energy and Resources, Gerry Brownlee.

"Details of the incident are sketchy at this stage, but I intend to travel to the West Coast tonight with Kate Wilkinson, the Minister of Labour and Conservation," Mr Brownlee says. "The Prime Minister is also being kept informed about events as they unfold.

"The Government stands ready to offer whatever help and resources are required.  Various agencies, including Police, Fire, Ambulance and hospitals, are already involved.  The West Coast mine rescue team has been activated.

"It is important that the rescue authorities are given the space to do their jobs properly. 

"The thoughts of the Government are with the miners, their families, and the rescue personnel dealing with this developing situation."
