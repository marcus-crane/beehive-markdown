State Owned Enterprises Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Chris Moller as chair of Meridian Energy.

Mr Moller was appointed to the Meridian board as a director in May last year. His appointment as chair is effective from 1 January next year to 31 October 2013.

"Mr Moller brings strong governance skills, aligned with extensive senior executive experience to the board,” Mr Power said.

“I look forward to the contribution he will make to Meridian as it further develops its strategy over the coming years."

Mr Moller will replace Wayne Boyd who is retiring on 1 January.

Mr Power thanked Mr Boyd for his work on the board since being appointed as chair in July 2005.

“Under Mr Boyd’s leadership Meridian has returned almost $2 billion in dividends to the Government. He can be proud of his record of achievement in this important role.”
