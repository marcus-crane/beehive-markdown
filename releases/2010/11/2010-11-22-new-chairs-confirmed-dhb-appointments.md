The Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced the appointed members of the 20 District Health Boards, including 10 new chairs and several people serving on more than one board.

Mr Ryall says, "Vacancies have come up because of statutory term limits, retirements and bereavement.  In addition, we are taking this opportunity to refresh the leadership and skill mix on the boards.

"Eight chairs are continuing in their roles, and another 12 boards have new chairs including some cross-appointments.

"In Auckland, Dr Lester Levy continues as chair of Waitemata DHB and will also chair the Auckland DHB. In Wellington, public health physician Dr Virginia Hope will chair the Capital and Coast and the Hutt Valley DHBs.

"These cross-appointments signal a push for greater regional collaboration in the planning and delivery of health services. The overlaps between each of these Auckland and Wellington region DHBs are clear.

"Waitemata pays Auckland DHB a quarter of its budget each year for services. In the Wellington region, Capital and Coast provides 40 per cent of Hutt Valley's elective surgery each year. Each board needs the other to be successful.

"A number of DHBs have members on more than one board. Both the MidCentral chair Phil Sunderland and the Whanganui chair Kate Joblin have been reappointed and will deputise for each other. Existing Canterbury member Peter Ballantyne will become deputy chair of both Canterbury and West Coast."

"Five boards will be chaired by elected members (Whanganui, Hawkes Bay, Capital Coast, Nelson and South Canterbury) who were re-elected to their boards at the October elections. Half the boards have deputy chairs who were also elected in October.

34 of the positions announced are existing DHB members. Six are new.
