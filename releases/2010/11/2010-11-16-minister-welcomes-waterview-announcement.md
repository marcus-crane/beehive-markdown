Transport Minister Steven Joyce says good progress is being made on Auckland's Waterview Connection - part of the Western Ring Route Road of National Significance.

The NZ Transport Agency has today announced a shortlist of two consortia for the construction of the Waterview Connection - a key part of the Western Ring Route Road of National Significance.

Mr Joyce says this is an important milestone for the project and he is excited by the calibre of the remaining two bids.

"Both short-listed parties have plans to deliver a fully operational road within the targeted timeframe which means, after decades of debate and congestion, Aucklanders and the economy will finally feel the benefits of a motorway network that should have been completed decades ago."

Mr Joyce says the completion of the Waterview Connection, and the entire Western Ring Route, is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

"It will also contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore.

"I am expecting the Western Ring Route to be delivered on budget and on time, with construction starting in late 2011 and finishing in the 2015/16 financial year."

The Waterview Connection is part of one of the seven Roads of National Significance the government has singled out as essential routes that require priority treatment. It is the last link to complete the Western Ring Route, linking Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore while bypassing State highway 1 and the Auckland Harbour Bridge.
