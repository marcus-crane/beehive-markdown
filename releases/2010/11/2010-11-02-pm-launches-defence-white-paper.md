Prime Minister John Key today launched the Defence White Paper, the first comprehensive defence review in 13 years.

"This delivers on a promise we made prior to the 2008 election and provides a framework for reform, particularly how we can get the best value for money from our defence budget," says Mr Key.

"The White Paper looks at global security, the challenges New Zealand is likely to face, and what resources and capabilities our defence forces need.

"It is vital that we have a blueprint of the strategic and defence challenges for New Zealand over the next 25 years."

The White Paper has an emphasis on value for money, as well as strategy and policy.

"Defence is expensive, so we need to get the most out of our defence budget. We want to move resources to the frontline where possible."

To this end, the New Zealand Defence Force is undertaking a comprehensive redistribution and investment programme.

"Our defence forces are serving us proudly overseas yet face significant challenges and risks in difficult conditions.

"That is why we want to make sure they are appropriately trained and equipped to undertake the tasks required of them.

"This White Paper provides the framework for a strong and effective defence force in the years ahead."
