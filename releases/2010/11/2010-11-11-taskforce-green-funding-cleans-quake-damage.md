Canterbury will get a touch of the green thumb with $96,000 of Enhanced Taskforce Green funding to help restore earthquake affected areas.

"The clean up in the city centre is well underway and now it's time to start restoring the region's natural assets," says Minister Kate Wilkinson

The Waimakariri District Council is the first to get a project underway, with a clean up of Waiuku beach reserve.

"The Waikuku beach reserve needs a lot of restoration work as the summer season approaches and families return to the beach," says Ms Wilkinson.

ETG funding will subsidise the wages of five staff and a supervisor for this project as part of the government's commitment to the Canterbury recovery.

"We are working with all local councils to identify other potential Enhanced Taskforce Green projects around the region," says Ms Wilkinson.

"Recovery Assistance Centres continue to operate throughout the region, offering advice and support for those affected by the earthquake," says Ms Wilkinson.
