Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today turned the first sod at a redevelopment site in Tamaki, marking the beginning of construction on a $13 million project to build 40 new state homes.

The redevelopment in Kings Rd, Panmure is part of the Tamaki Transformation Programme, an urban regeneration initiative encompassing the east Auckland suburbs of Panmure, Point England and Glen Innes.

"The redevelopment plans for Kings Rd involve replacing 15 old and rundown bedsit units with 40 modern units within four individual two and three storey buildings," says Mr Heatley.

"The new units will be lighter, warmer and bigger and have two bedrooms. They are specifically designed for older people, with ground floor units suitable for people with disabilities.

"Through good design the number of units on the site will be more than doubled so that more people in need can enjoy the benefits of good quality affordable housing," Mr Heatley said.  

"This new development makes the best possible use of the available land. We need to be wise about how we tackle redevelopment opportunities to ensure that we get the best value for our resources. Clever design here means the number of homes have been increased from 15 to 40 and they will be much bigger - it's a win-win," says Mr Heatley.

The redevelopment in Kings Road is expected to be completed by November 2011.

As part of his visit to Tamaki today, Mr Heatley also visited a Housing New Zealand tenant whose house was recently modernised.

"Many of the state homes in Tamaki are over 60 years old and in need of an upgrade to make them warmer and drier. Through the Tamaki Transformation Programme, Housing New Zealand are modernising 120 homes in the area over a three year period," he said.

"This means the tenants will live in insulated homes with decent bathrooms and kitchens. We know that good quality, affordable housing is linked to better health, educational performance, wealth and personal security, and strengthens communities and neighbourhoods."
