Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg signed a Protocol amending the existing Working Holiday Scheme between New Zealand and the Czech Republic at a meeting yesterday in Prague.

The changes will raise the maximum age from 30 to 35, and will ease employment and study restrictions for working holidaymakers in both countries. 

Currently, working holiday visa holders can only study for three-months during their stay. Under these changes, study entitlements will be increased from three to six months.  In addition, the restriction on the length of time that participants can spend with each employer - currently set at a maximum of three months - has been removed.

Since it was established in 2004, the Working Holiday Scheme has been so popular with young Czechs that the maximum number of applicants each year has already been increased from 1,000 to 1,200.

"Working Holiday Schemes encourage mutual interest, and help promote important links between our countries," says Mr McCully.

The changes are expected to come into effect in mid 2011 once both countries have completed the necessary domestic procedures.
