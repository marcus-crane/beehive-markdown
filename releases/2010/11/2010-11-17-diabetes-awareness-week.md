Everyone has a role to play in helping to reduce diabetes in New Zealand, says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

More than 210,000 New Zealanders have diabetes and Mrs Turia is hoping Diabetes Awareness Week will help people to better understand the disease, how it can be prevented and managed if diagnosed.

"A healthy diet and regular exercise can help not only reduce the risk of getting the disease but also help those who suffer from it to manage the symptoms better.

"It is also incredibly important that we take a whole-of-family approach towards diabetes" said Mrs Turia.  "The support of other family members in helping to maintain a healthy lifestyle is a critical step in diabetes management".

"Diabetes is a major and growing health problem in New Zealand and can lead to organ damage if left undiagnosed.

"We know that some people are living with this disease undiagnosed and I would urge anyone who suspects they have this disease to talk to their doctor." says Mrs Turia.

"I know first hand the challenges of living with diabetes and can not emphasize enough how vital it is to have whanau support to call on.  It's all about having the right attitude - and the awareness to make the changes we need to take care of our health.

"And that's why I welcome Diabetes Awareness Week as an opportunity to raise our understanding about what we can all do to support those living with diabetes."
