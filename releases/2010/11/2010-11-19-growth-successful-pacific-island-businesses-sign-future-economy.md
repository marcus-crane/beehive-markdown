The growing number of successful Pacific Island businesses was a sign of the future make up of the New Zealand economy, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu said at the 25th anniversary of the Pacific Business Trust in Manukau tonight.

"The entrepreneurial spirit is burning brightly among Pacific Island peoples and I am delighted to help recognise and celebrate their success tonight.

"New Zealanders everywhere will be impressed and encouraged by the success of Pacific entrepreneurs and business owners who are providing much needed jobs and prosperity to families and communities across the country."

Mrs te Heuheu presented one of eight awards announced at the 2010 Manukau Institute of Technology Pacific Business Awards, which included:

In addition, the inaugural "Pacific Navigators Achievement Award" was awarded to Stan Wolfgramm in recognition of his role as a Pacific ‘trail blazer' who has paved the way for future generations.

"These entrepreneurs and business owners thoroughly deserve their awards and we must help encourage and develop more of them," Mrs te Heuheu said.

 

"New Zealand needs our Pacific businesses to continue to grow and succeed and I'm confident this wonderful trend will continue, despite the slow recovery of the economy."

The Pacific Business Trust was set up in 1985 to improve employment opportunities for Pacific people in New Zealand. Over time its focus has shifted to assisting Pacific communities with their business and entrepreneurial aspirations.

Today the Pacific Business Trust has become an established provider of economic development services for Pacific people. The Trust uses a variety of business programmes and measures to both improve training and employment opportunities for Pacific people, and to assist them with their business goals.

"This is an exciting time for Pacific people in New Zealand and I am proud to be part of it," the Minister said.
