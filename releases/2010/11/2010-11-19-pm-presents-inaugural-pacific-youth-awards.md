Three high-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders have become the inaugural winners of the Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards.

Around 100 applications for the three awards were received after Prime Minister John Key launched the initiative in August.

"I'm delighted so many nominations were received," says Mr Key.

"There is a wealth of talent and potential among New Zealand's young people and it's great to see Pacific communities encouraging them to realise their dreams."  

The award winners are:

- University of Auckland Leadership Award - J'aime Laurenson, 24, Central Auckland
- Weta Workshop Creativity Award - Samuelu Tevita Siilata, 24, Manukau
- Cogita Software Inspiration Award - Tammy Kingi, 22, Mangere Bridge

Mr Key says it is vital that New Zealand's burgeoning Pacific population plays a part in ensuring the country's future success.

"These awards were created to highlight the achievements of outstanding young people. The three winners have excelled across a number of disciplines, and these awards will help provide a platform for further achievement and leadership.

"If we want this country to continue to be successful on the world stage, it is critical we capitalise on the expertise of all New Zealanders. As these awards show, the Pacific communities of New Zealand are home to talented and determined young people with great leadership potential," says Mr Key.
