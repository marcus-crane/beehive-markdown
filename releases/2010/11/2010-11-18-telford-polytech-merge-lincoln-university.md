Cabinet has accepted a proposal that will see Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic merge as of 1 January 2011.

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce says the merger will create one larger institution with a stronger base to support education, research, and knowledge transfers across the land-based sector.

"I expect the merger will improve the speed, reach, and effectiveness of knowledge transfer from research to on-farm practice.

"The land-based sector is very important for New Zealand and becoming more so. Having a specialist research and teaching institution, combining the best of Lincoln and Telford, will provide a stronger knowledge base as we look to build our export-led recovery.

"Lincoln is a strong institution dedicated to supporting the land-based sectors, and the merger with Telford should strengthen educational provision in terms of scale, reach, and relationships with the sectors it serves.

"I would like to thank all the staff of both institutions for their support of the proposal. Their input will continue to be vital in the coming months as the merged institution takes shape." 

Following Cabinet's recommendation, the Governor General's agreement is required to disestablish Telford Polytechnic. The two institutions will be merged, effective from 1 January 2011. Lincoln is required to regularly report to the Minister on the progress of the merger over the next two years.

**Background:**

The Minister for Tertiary Education will now ask the Governor General to formally disestablish Telford Rural Polytechnic and incorporate it in Lincoln University.

This is expected to occur by later this month and will be effective from 1 January 2011.

Lincoln and Telford are both specialist providers of tertiary education for the land-based sectors.  Lincoln is a teaching and research university based in Canterbury with an international reputation in land-based learning and research outcomes. 

Telford is a specialist land-based polytechnic, recognised for its practical approach to tertiary education supporting the rural sector.  Telford is based at its campus in South Otago, near Balclutha.

The aim of the merger is to create one institution with a strong base to support education, research, and knowledge transfers across the land-based sector.

Under the merger, Lincoln will continue to offer land-based training, but with an aim of stair casing those students towards further, higher-level study.
