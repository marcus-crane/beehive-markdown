Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today launched a campaign aimed at reducing serious injuries and deaths on farms from quad bike accidents.

"Every year on average five people die and 850 are injured on farms riding quad bikes," Ms Wilkinson says.

"This campaign will promote four basic safety steps that can prevent injuries."

The steps are:

- Wear a helmet
- Ensure riders are trained/experienced
- Don't let children ride adult quad bikes (over 90cc)
- Choose the right vehicle for the job - pay close attention to what your quad bike owner's manual says about carrying passengers, and the maximum towing and carrying limits.

Farmers who don't follow these safety steps risk penalties under the Health and Safety in Employment Act if someone working on their farm is seriously injured or killed. 

"Quad bikes are often referred to as all terrain vehicles or ATVs. But they can't go everywhere and do everything," Ms Wilkinson says.

"Riders need to respect their limits and follow the safety instructions in their owner's manual."

The campaign is supported by ACC, Federated Farmers and the Motor Industry Association, which represents quad bike manufacturers.

Over the next few months the Department of Labour will promote the four basic safety steps in rural communities. It will also publish revised safety guidelines for farm quad bikes.

From April 2011 the campaign will broaden to also include enforcement. Inspectors will be focusing on farms and where people are working with quad bikes in a dangerous way inspectors are likely to take action.

"The long term goal is for no one to be injured working on farm quad bikes," Ms Wilkinson says.
