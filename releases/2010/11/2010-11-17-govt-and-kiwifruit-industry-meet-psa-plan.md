Confirmation this morning that Psa disease has spread outside of the Te Puke area is a blow and shows how fast-changing the situation is, says Biosecurity Minister David Carter.

"It is important to note that the positive test results from the Napier/Hastings areas, Edgecumbe and Whakatane does not mean the disease is spreading wildly. Rather it could indicate that it may have been here for some time in a mild form."

As planned, Mr Carter is meeting with representatives of the kiwifruit industry later today to discuss a co-ordinated response package to fight the disease.

"As we have said all along, the Government is fully committed to working with industry on this issue and today's meeting is crucial to formulating a solid path of action," says Mr Carter.
