Community groups will receive over eight million dollars through the Community Response Fund says Acting Social Development Minister Judith Collins.

Total assistance from this fund has so far reached $33.6 million, with 170 community groups benefitting from the fourth round of funding announced today.

"This funding pool was created to help community groups get through difficult financial times and continue providing services to Kiwis," says Ms Collins.

"This latest round of funding will a go along way to helping critical services meet the needs of their communities," says Ms Collins.

Innovation was a strong feature of round four of the fund with 19% of successful applicants receiving grants under the innovation criteria. 

This includes the Citizens Advice Bureau's Integrated National Database; an interactive website with real time advice and information about regional services. 

"It‘s great to see community groups stepping up and showing us new ways to tackle local social issues," says Ms Collins.

"Organisations need to be able to change with the changing needs of their communities," says Ms Collins.
