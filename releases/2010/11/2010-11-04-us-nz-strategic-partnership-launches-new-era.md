United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Foreign Minister Murray McCully today launched a Declaration establishing a new Strategic Partnership between New Zealand and the US.

The Wellington Declaration asserts the establishment of "the framework of a new United States - New Zealand strategic partnership to shape future practical cooperation and political dialogue."

The Strategic Partnership has two main elements.

First, it commits New Zealand and the US to working more closely together on practical projects in the Pacific, with a focus on challenges such as renewable energy, and natural disaster readiness and response.

The second aspect of the Strategic Partnership is focused on regular high level political dialogue. Ministerial level meetings will be held regularly, and political military talks will take place at officials level annually.

 "We'll also make sure that our subject experts meet regularly - there's no point in working in isolation on issues like climate change, or non-proliferation and disarmament."

High level officials talks will also be held between New Zealand, the US and Australia, with a focus on Pacific regional priorities.

Mr McCully says the launching of the Declaration is "highly symbolic."

"It turns a new page in the relationship and establishes a framework for close cooperation across a whole range of fields of shared interest."
