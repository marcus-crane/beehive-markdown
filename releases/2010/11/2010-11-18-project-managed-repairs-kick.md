Earthquake recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee today visited the first of Fletcher Construction's regional project management hubs in Halswell, Christchurch, marking the beginning of work to repair homes damaged by the September 4 quake.

"It became apparent to me, and the Earthquake Commission, in the early days following the quake that the scale of the required repairs warranted a coordinated project management approach that would ensure cost containment, quality and a smooth flow of materials into Canterbury," Mr Brownlee said.

"It's a great tribute to the EQC and Fletcher Construction that this work has started so soon after such a major event."

Mr Brownlee also visited the home of Halswell resident Richard Bendall, whose house damage is the first to be repaired under the project management scheme, which is coordinating and managing building repairs valued at approximately $10,000 up to $100,000 plus GST on behalf of the Earthquake Commission.

"Fletchers will be managing the repair of about 60,000 homes in Canterbury from 15 hub offices across the region, so their task is a mammoth one," Mr Brownlee said.

"But work is now underway and I'm sure that will come as great news to many Cantabrians.

"Each hub office will manage a particular area, with temporary builder's sheds providing a base for teams of contractors working on repairs.  In Halswell's case there will be five such sheds, so residents here and across Canterbury will soon see a very visible presence of the work being done," Mr Brownlee said.

The Minister also took the opportunity to remind Canterbury residents that only 15 days remain to lodge damage claims with the Earthquake Commission.

"There are still houses for which no claim has been lodged in areas of known damage.

"Even if you think you came through the quake with only minor disruption or your damage appears superficial and you don't wish to make a fuss, please lodge a claim before the December 4 deadline.

"There is no need to wait till the last minute because of ongoing aftershocks or for any other reason," Mr Brownlee said.
