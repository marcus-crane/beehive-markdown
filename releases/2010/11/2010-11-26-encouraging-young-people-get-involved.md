Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett is challenging councils to reach out to local young people through the Youth Development Partnership Fund.

"I also want to encourage young people to step out of their shells, look beyond  Facebook and TV and take part in their communities," says Ms Bennett.

The Youth Development Partnership Fund finances councils to develop education, training and employment projects with input from local youth.

Applications for round seven of the fund will be open until 18 March 2011, with $1 million to seed community-based projects around the country.

"These projects are an important part of developing youth community leadership and celebrating young people's achievements," says Ms Bennett.

"Councils have a real the opportunity to create local projects which engage local youth," says Ms Bennett.

"Young people know what works for them, Government and councils just have to listen, learn and do," says Ms Bennett.
