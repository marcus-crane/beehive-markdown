New data suggests New Zealand could be getting better economic value out of its freshwater, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

Dr Smith today released the findings of a Ministry for the Environment report on freshwater allocation consents at the Hawke’s Bay Water Symposium. The Water Allocation Data 2009-10 report finds most regions use less than 50% of the water allowed to be taken under resource consent. Southland (74%) and Canterbury (57%) have the highest percentages of actual use.

“Some businesses may be missing out on having access to water as, on paper at least, the resource is fully allocated,” Dr Smith said. “This report reinforces the usefulness of measuring our water take so we can manage it to get the best value possible out of it, while protecting the environmental values of our lakes and rivers.

“New water measuring and reporting regulations that came into force on 10 November will help us do just that, and are a significant step forward. This data is important as it fills a gap in our knowledge so we have better information to assist water management.

“The fact that allocated water has doubled in the last decade illustrates the increased importance of water but also the growth in pressure on this natural resource.”

Most consents granted are for irrigation (75%), public water (9%), industry (9%) and stock supply (6%). The total amount of water allocated by resource consent per year is about three times the volume of Lake Taupo per year. Peak usage in summer is sufficient to fill 30 Olympic-sized swimming pools every minute.

“Water is generally plentiful in New Zealand, but not always in the right place at the right time. That’s why we need to carefully manage our freshwater resource so that we look after the environment in areas where there is growing scarcity, while maximising our economic opportunities,” Dr Smith said.

“An important part of the Government’s economic reform programme is improving the management of our water. The Government is looking forward to the public response to proposals of the Land and Water Forum which recommends more than 50 changes to improve the systems for managing water quality and allocation.”

**Attached: Question and Answers**

**Why has the Ministry for the Environment produced this indicator update?**

The Ministry’s national environmental reporting programme reports regularly on all key parts of our environment (eg biodiversity, oceans, land and freshwater) and some of the human activities which put pressure on our environment. Given the broad spectrum of environmental issues, the Ministry for the Environment works with reporting partners (eg other government departments and regional councils) to report on the state of the environment.

This indicator update is based on a report produced by Aqualinc Research Limited. Information on the amount of freshwater allocated from rivers, lakes, and groundwater aquifers were drawn from resource consents issued by regional councils. The environmental indicator for freshwater demand is total consumptive volume, where water is not returned to source.

The indicator was last updated in 2007. This updated report presents the current size, source and uses of allocated fresh water and an historical comparison since 1999. The report also makes estimates on the actual water used by regions.

**How is freshwater allocated in New Zealand?**

Regional councils are responsible for granting resource consents in New Zealand. These consents are generally required before surface water (water from rivers, lakes and streams) or groundwater may be removed for irrigation, drinking water supply, industrial and manufacturing works and other activities. Smaller volumes of water, such as home or some stock drinking water supply, are allocated through permitted activity rules under many councils’ regional plans and don’t require resource consents.

The consent process, which is generally set up through regional plans, is also known as ‘the allocation of freshwater’. It can determine both the maximum volume of water that may be taken, and the maximum rate at which water may be taken.

**Why is reporting on freshwater demand useful?**

Reporting on freshwater demand provides an indication of the size, source and uses of allocated water in New Zealand, at its current state and how it has changed over time. This presents a national and regional picture of allocation across New Zealand, and helps us understand where there may be issues, for example, relating to allocation pressure. This strengthens the evidence base for making policy.

**How accurate is our data on allocation in New Zealand?**

This report provides the most up to date information we have on how water is allocated in New Zealand.

The data has been aggregated into a national dataset and sent to regional councils for checking. The contractor worked with the councils to ensure the data is as accurate as possible. Recommendations have come out of this report to improve the accuracy of allocation data in the future.

**How does New Zealand’s water allocation compare internationally?**

Compared internationally, New Zealand has an abundance of freshwater. It is ranked 12th out of 193 countries on a per capita basis for the size of its renewable freshwater resource. Within New Zealand, allocated water comprises less than 5% of the renewable freshwater resource.

However, not all of the renewable resource is actually available to be used – much of it needs to be retained in the rivers, lakes and aquifers to maintain the various values of these water bodies (such as ecological, recreational and cultural values). Furthermore, water is not always in the right place at the right time for users. A large proportion of New Zealand’s annual rainfall occurs in winter when demand is relatively low.

**How many consents are there in New Zealand?**

In 2010 there were more than 20,500 resource consents for taking fresh water, compared to almost 20,000 in 2006.

**Where do the consents take water from?**

Around two thirds of consents are for water from groundwater sources, and just less than one third from surface water (river and streams). However, although there are fewer numbers of consents for surface water the actual volume of water allocated is four times higher than from groundwater sources.

**What is the water used for?**

Consents are allocated to the following general uses: irrigation (75% of the number of consents), public water (9%), industry (9%) and stock supply (6%).

Irrigation and hydro generation account for the majority of consumptive (water not returned to source) weekly allocations with 46% and 41% respectively.

All of the volume for the hydro generation is for one take in Southland, the Manapouri hydro generation take, which discharges to sea.

Excluding this hydro generation take, irrigation use then accounts for 78% of the weekly consumptive allocation, with drinking water accounting for 8%, industry 11% and stock watering 3%.

**Why is the Manapouri hydro take considered consumptive when other hydro takes aren’t?**

Most hydro generation is non-consumptive (i.e. the water is returned to the source for other users). There are some special case hydro generation consents where water is abstracted from one catchment and discharged to another. As the consented water is being exported out of the first catchment, it is a consumptive use for the catchment. However, on a national scale the water is still available for use, so it is considered a non-consumptive consent in this report.

The Manapouri hydro take was considered consumptive because it discharges all the water to sea. This water then becomes unavailable for other fresh water users.

**How much water is allocated in New Zealand?**

The total annual allocated consumptive volume is 27 billion cubic meters per year (Bm3/year). This is equivalent to almost half the volume of Lake Taupo. When non-consumptive consents are also included, this goes up to 193 Bm3/year, this is more than three times the volume of Lake Taupo.

**When is most water taken?**

Peak water demand occurs during summer in New Zealand when many consents are for irrigation. The total weekly allocated volume (757 Mm3/week) in New Zealand is sufficient to fill up 30 Olympic-sized swimming pools every minute.

**How does the allocated water compare regionally across New Zealand?**

The regions of Canterbury, Southland and Otago account for 86% of the total weekly allocated volume in New Zealand.

Excluding the hydro generation take in Southland, the weekly allocation for Canterbury and Otago equate to 56% and 20% respectively, of total other national consumptive allocation. The main water use in these areas is for irrigation.

**How much land is irrigated by consented takes in New Zealand?**

The total area of land irrigated by consented takes in 2010 was more than 1 million hectares. This is approximately 4% of the total land area of New Zealand, and about one tenth of the pastoral land cover area.

This has increased since 2006, where the total area of land irrigated by consented takes was more than 970,000 hectares.

**How is peak allocation demand changing over time?**

Weekly allocation has nearly doubled since 1999 (excluding the Southland hydro take) and in the last four years there has been an increase of 10%.

Over the longer term, Canterbury has had the largest change in allocated volume, with an increase of 98.2 Mm3/week (65% increase) between 1999 and 2010. In more recent years (2006–2010), the largest increase in allocated volume was again in Canterbury with a difference of 25 Mm3/week (11% increase) and the highest percentage increases have occurred in Horizons (51%) and Northland (41%).

**How much water is actually used in New Zealand?**

This report estimates that the actual water used compared to the maximum consented volume in New Zealand is 65%. It is estimated that most regions use less than 50% of the consented water, indicating that allocable resources are being under-used in these regions. However, higher percentages of actual water use were found in Gisborne (192%), Southland (74%) and Canterbury (57%).

On the basis that allocations have been sustainably set, this highlights that there are opportunities for more efficient use of allocated water in New Zealand.

 **Why is Gisborne’s water use apparently so high?**

This figure appears higher than the consented allocation because the water meter for the municipal consent measures a combined intake from a dam and a stream for the city water supply. The intake from the dam is consented, but Gisborne District Council staff consider they have an existing use right for the intake from the stream. Using this meter reading however gives a higher actual water use than the consented volume, but does not mean the consent limit is being breached by the take from the dam.

Using this meter reading gives a higher actual water use than the consented volume, but does not mean the consent limit is being breached by the take from the dam.

**What is being done to address issues of effective water allocation?**

There are ever increasing demands on New Zealand’s water. This precious resource needs to be effectively managed to protect all values of freshwater, including ecological, cultural, recreational, as well as ensuring adequate supply for drinking water, agriculture and industry.

The Land and Water Forum was asked by the Minister to make recommendations to address these issues, including effective mechanisms for the allocation of water across New Zealand. The Forum is engaging publicly around New Zealand on its report and recommendations between now and early 2011.
