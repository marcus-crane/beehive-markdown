The 2009 Tobacco Use Survey released today shows that the overall prevalence of smoking is continuing to decline but exposure to second-hand smoke is still a significant issue for some households, says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

"It's great to see the fall in the overall level of smoking with 78% of New Zealanders aged 15-64 years not smoking."

"While the results are fantastic news, the exposure of whanau and children to second hand smoke in homes and cars is something that we need to eliminate.

"We've made great progress in many areas but in the very place where our children are most vulnerable, we are still exposing them to serious harm.

"I urge every household, every whanau, to help protect our young ones. Make your home and your car smokefree, it can save the lives of those you love," says Mrs Turia.

The survey revealed that 1 in every 16 non-smokers (6.4%) were found to have been exposed to second-hand smoke in their homes in the week leading up to the survey, with an equivalent level of exposure among those traveling in cars during the same period.

The figures remained highest among Maori non-smokers, who were found to be 1.7 times more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at home and twice as likely to be exposed in cars, during the week prior to completing the survey.

Minister Turia is urging New Zealanders to help change these statistics.

"Secondhand smoke is deadly.  It causes premature death and disease in children and adults. For our children, it increases the risk for cot death, chest infections, ear problems, and severe asthma and in adults it leads to lung cancer, heart disease and increased risk of stroke.
