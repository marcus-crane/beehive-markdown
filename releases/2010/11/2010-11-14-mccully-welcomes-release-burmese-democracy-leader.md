Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the release from house arrest of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

"Aung San Suu Kyi has long been a beacon of hope for the Burmese people and a focal point for their desire for a democratic nation. Her release from years of detention is long overdue," Mr McCully said.

"We trust that she will now be free from restrictions on movement or association.

"New Zealand and the rest of the international community will be watching her situation closely in the weeks ahead."
