Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples today launched the Māori artwork that will feature on official Rugby World Cup 2011 merchandise next year.

Dr Sharples unveiled a collection of 11 designs created by six young Māori artists, five of which are from Ngā Aho Inc, the collective of Māori professional designers.

Around 90 people, including the artists and representatives from Rugby World Cup Limited, Ngā Aho Inc and Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Toa Rangatira, attended today's launch of the Rugby World Cup Māori Art Programme at Takapūwahiā Marae, Porirua.

"The Rugby World Cup is not just about the rugby," says Dr Sharples. "It's also about the economic and commercial benefits to our country and our people, and that's the kaupapa of today's celebrations."

The artwork came about through a set of relationships between Te Puni Kōkiri, Rugby World Cup Limited, Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira and Ngā Aho Incorporated. Dr Sharples says this model shows that indigenous people and commercial entities can work together to produce authentic and exclusive indigenous product.

"Māori development is about improving economic conditions for Māori," says Dr Sharples. "From this project there will be financial benefits to descendents of Ngāti Toa Rangatira, benefits to young Māori designers and also to Māori rugby."

"And for the average rugby punter who comes to our shores next year, they will be able to walk away with a piece of clothing, or maybe a rugby ball, knowing that they have purchased an authentic, indigenous piece of Aotearoa New Zealand."

Dr Sharples acknowledged Ngāti Toa Rangatira and the haka, Ka Mate. He thanked the iwi for ‘their gift to the nation, and to the world'.

One of the designs is a contemporary interpretation of the haka ‘Ka Mate'. It was developed by a young woman who is a direct descendent of the composer of Ka Mate, Te Rauparaha.

The remaining designs are based on key values. The values of aroha (love), toa (strength), wairua (the spirit of life), ihi wehi and wana (the raw and powerful energy of mankind).

Mr Sharples acknowledged Rugby World Cup Limited, describing their vision "combining Māori art with official merchandise" as "commendable".

"I am pleased that there is commercial space for Māori to occupy and I encourage the commercial and business sector to learn from this project and to not shy away from engaging with our people on commercial terms."
