A bill to transfer the functions of the Chief Registrar of Electors to the new Electoral Commission was introduced to Parliament today by Justice Minister Simon Power.

The Electoral (Administration) Amendment Bill (No. 2) implements the second and final stage of the Government's consolidation of electoral agencies. 

The first stage was completed on 1 October when the new Electoral Commission took over the functions of the Chief Electoral Officer and the old Electoral Commission.

"This bill will see the new Electoral Commission become a one-stop shop for all electoral matters on 1 October 2012," Mr Power said.

"The restructure was done in two stages to ensure limited disruption and to minimise risks to the administration of the 2011 general election."

The bill will also amend the Electoral Act 1993 to give effect to three recommendations made by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee following their inquiry into the 2008 general election. 

The bill will allow:

- An elector's immigration status to be checked at the time their enrolment application is processed, rather than after they are enrolled.
- Information on applicants for new and renewed New Zealand passports to be provided to a Registrar of Electors for enrolment purposes.
- Paper enrolment records to be destroyed after being safely stored electronically.

"These changes will help make enrolments processes more efficient, as well as maintaining public confidence in the integrity of our elections."

In addition, the bill will amend the Electoral Act to give electors the choice to re-enrol and update their details online, without having to complete and sign a written form.

Enabling online re-enrolment is the first step in a process that will eventually allow voters to use the Internet to enrol. 

"Taking advantage of the Internet will make it as simple as possible for people to participate in elections."
