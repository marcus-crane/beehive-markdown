Mr Peter Marshall has been appointed as the Commissioner of Police, Police Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Mr Marshall has been the Commissioner of Police, Royal Solomon Islands Police Force since May 2008. He was seconded from the New Zealand Police to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force in February 2007.

Mr Marshall has held a wide range of command and operational positions in the New Zealand Police.

He has successfully led large, sensitive operations which involved national security issues and liaison with representatives from foreign governments and government agencies in New Zealand.

The Governor-General made the appointment on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Mr Marshall has been appointed for a three-year term which commences on 3 April 2011, following the retirement of Howard Broad, the Commissioner of Police.

“Mr Marshall is a very experienced and respected Police officer who brings 38 years’ policing experience to this extremely important position,” Ms Collins said.

“I am confident that he will uphold the values of integrity, courage, energy and public safety that make our Police the finest in the world.

“The Prime Minister and I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him all the best in his new position. I look forward to working with him.”
