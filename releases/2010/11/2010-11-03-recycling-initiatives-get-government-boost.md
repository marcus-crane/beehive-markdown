Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today announced grants for three recycling projects from Waikato, Raglan and Kaitaia at the Community Recycling Network Hui in Wellington.

"Environment Waikato, in partnership with Hamilton City Council and the Matamata-Piako District Council, will receive $159,000 over two years from the Government's Waste Minimisation Fund," Dr Smith said. "Working with Inghams Enterprises they will investigate the use of pyrolysis technology to convert problem waste into useful products like biochar and reduce methane emissions from waste going to landfill.

"Beyond completion of the two-year pilot, pyrolysis will be part of the processing of Waikato waste converting 32,000 tonnes a year. Pyrolysis technology uses heat, without oxygen, to break-down organic waste. Introducing it into the Waikato will not only reduce the amount of organic waste going to landfill, it will also turn unusable waste material into products that can be used to improve productivity on farms.     

"Xtreme Waste will use a $21,740 grant to investigate diverting the Raglan and the Waingaroa region's organic waste and processing it into high quality compost at the Raglan recycling centre. The compost will be sold and used to enrich local gardens.

"Xtreme Waste will consult with local businesses, event organisers, marae and members of the public, to investigate the best way for the community to collect their organic waste.  This project is a great example of a local organisation working with its community. 

"The Community Business and Environment Centre from Kaitaia will receive $30,000 to investigate and trial the use of seven Northland marae as recycling drop off points.  CBEC will also conduct seminars and produce a guide for local communities and councils about the trial.

"CBEC will provide recycling facilities for people living in remote Northland regions, as many people in these areas don't have access to recycling services and as a result either burn or bury their waste, including waste that can be recycled.  For this to change recycling services need to be made available for them to use.

"The grants I am announcing today are great examples of organisations collaborating with their communities to develop ideas that will benefit the environment by reducing waste and recycling."
