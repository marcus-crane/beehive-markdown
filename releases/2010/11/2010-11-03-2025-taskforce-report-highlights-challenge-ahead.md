Minister for Regulatory Reform Rodney Hide today welcomed the release of the 2025 Taskforce's second report, which highlights the challenge ahead if New Zealand is to succeed in catching Australia by 2025.

"The report clearly shows that more is needed if we are to close the income gap with Australia by 2025, and reverse the flow of New Zealanders leaving to work across the ditch," Mr Hide said.

"However, it also shows that if we are confident and ambitious enough, we can close the gap.

"This means grasping the nettle on the hard issues of too much Government spending, too much regulation, and not enough competition and innovation in social services.

"It was pleasing to see the Taskforce recognise the importance of ACT's Regulatory Responsibility Bill and Taxpayer Rights Bill as possible solutions to these issues.

"The Taskforce, with its clear, robust thinking, and determination to hold us to account on our commitment to restore New Zealand to its rightful place at the top of the OECD, has laid out the challenge before us. 

"I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report; they have given us much to discuss as we look to the future of New Zealand's economy," Mr Hide said.
