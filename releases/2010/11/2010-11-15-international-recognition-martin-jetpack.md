New Zealand invention the Martin Jetpack is one of Time magazine's 50 Best Inventions of 2010, published in the latest issue.

Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp says the Martin Jetpack has captured the imagination.

"I congratulate Glenn Martin, the inventor. His work puts New Zealand innovation in the international spotlight.

"Glenn's breakthrough approach to the use of ultra-high efficient fans and vector control means that he has solved a problem that has beaten everyone else.

"There is no doubt that there will be a wide range of practical applications for the technology he has developed," Dr Mapp said. 

"The Government is committed to supporting New Zealand innovation, which is the key to lifting our economic growth. Expanding our economic base by developing high quality, high-tech products for export will be a key part of that future.

"This appearance in one of the world's most famous magazines raises the profile of both the jetpack and New Zealanders' ability to bring great ideas through to market development stage," he said.

The Martin Jetpack is the first invention listed on the cover of the magazine's 22 November issue and is described as the "most anticipated" invention of the year.

The jetpack is in the final stages of research and development. It is intended to be the world's first practical jetpack.

"Glenn has spent 30 years working on this. To have developed it to the point where it is this close to being on the market is an outstanding achievement," Dr Mapp said.
