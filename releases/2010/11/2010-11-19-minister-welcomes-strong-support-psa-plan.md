Biosecurity Minister David Carter has tonight welcomed strong support from kiwifruit growers for a government/industry plan to fight Psa disease.

The Government is committing $25 million in a dollar-for-dollar partnership with the kiwifruit industry to fund an aggressive containment strategy to battle Psa.

"I am pleased that the overwhelming majority of growers have voted in support of the proposal," says Mr Carter.

"This gives the green light to an aggressive management plan to tackle the disease.  It is the best example of government and industry working together to reduce the long-term financial impact on a very important primary sector industry.

"I wish to acknowledge the kiwifruit industry's proactive and well-managed approach in dealing with this serious issue," says Mr Carter.
