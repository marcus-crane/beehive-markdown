Education Minister Anne Tolley says the latest Education Review Office report on the implementation of National Standards shows that primary and intermediate schools are making excellent progress.

"The latest ERO evaluation, covering Term 3, is extremely encouraging," says Mrs Tolley.

"Children and their parents are already seeing the benefits of National Standards and plain-language reporting, and I acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of principals and teachers."

The ERO report shows that 93 per cent of schools are well-prepared or had preparation under way to implement the Standards, up from 80 per cent in the last report covering Terms 1 and 2.

Schools which are well-prepared have increased from 19 per cent to 34 per cent, while there has been a decrease from 20 per cent to 7 per cent of schools not yet prepared.

The report also shows that school leaders, teachers and trustees have a greater understanding of the Standards, compared to earlier in the year.

"The Ministry will continue to provide support and professional development to schools and trustees as we concentrate on lifting the reading, writing and maths skills of our young New Zealanders," says Mrs Tolley.

"We're still in the first year of a three-year implementation, but already great gains have been made. The Sector Advisory Group will consider this report as part of its ongoing work to address any issues and concerns." 

The ERO evaluation is based on information gathered from 80 schools during Term 3, 2010. The schools involved represent a range of deciles and locations.
