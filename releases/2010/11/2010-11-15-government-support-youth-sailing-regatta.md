Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee today announced the government, through its Major Events Development Fund, is investing $150,000 in the Optimist World Championships to be hosted in Napier in 2011.

Optimist sailing is a youth sport, catering for sailors aged 15 and under and is one of the world's biggest dinghy sailing classes.

The World Championships, known as the OptiWorlds, is an annual event and is expected to attract 250 international competitors and 170 officials to New Zealand from over 50 countries.

"As a youth event taking place over the Christmas and New Year period, it is likely to attract a significant number of international visitors, providing economic benefits to the Hawkes Bay region and beyond in the period immediately following the 2011 Rugby World Cup," Mr Brownlee said.

"It also presents an opportunity for the region to promote its tourism and business strengths, and raise awareness of Napier's capabilities as an events destination.

"Sailing is a high-profile sport in New Zealand with a history of success at the international level.  These Championships will provide an opportunity for New Zealanders to watch a world class sporting event right on our doorstep."

The government's investment will support the delivery of the event, including a focus on broadcast distribution to maximise New Zealand's international exposure through the event.

The regatta will be organised by the New Zealand International Optimist Dinghy Association.  OptiWorlds organising committee chairman Peter Dawson said receiving government support was recognition of the significant economic impact the regatta's visitors would bring to the Hawkes Bay and the country. 

"The government backing also gives us huge credibility as we move into the second phase of our fundraising, seeking corporate sponsorships," Mr Dawson said.

"After the hugely successful World Rowing Championships and next year's Rugby World Cup, the OptiWorlds will continue the international exposure and benefits that come from hosting world class events," Mr Brownlee said. 

Hawkes Bay Members of Parliament Chris Tremain and Craig Foss paid tribute to local dinghy sailing enthusiasts Chris Devine and Adrian Mannering, who championed the successful bid.

"This is a great opportunity for Hawkes Bay to showcase itself to the world," Mr Tremain said.

"Our economy will see direct and indirect gains from this fantastic investment into Hawkes Bay Wine Country," Mr Foss said.
