Hon Kate Wilkinson says figures out today show a 45.6% increase in jobs advertised online since the June 2009 recessionary slump. 

"Steady growth in job vacancies shows this Government's economic programme has helped restore business confidence," says Ms Wilkinson.

The number of advertised skilled jobs increased by 3% in the three months to October 2010, while the total number increased by 3.2%.

Wellington (up 36.3%) and Auckland (up 42%) have had the strongest regional growth in skilled job vacancies for the year to October 2010.

Christchurch had the strongest growth in skilled job vacancies over the past three months (up 6.1%).

This has been driven largely by increased vacancies in construction and engineering as the post quake clean up hits full gear.

In the three months to October IT (up 8.8%) and accounting, human resources, legal and administration (up 3.7%) had the strongest growth.

While at 4.5%, technicians and trades workers had the largest growth across all skilled occupational groups during the same period.

The *Jobs Online* indicator provides information on labour market demand by measuring data from online job advertisers, Trade Me Jobs and SEEK.
