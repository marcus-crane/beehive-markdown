The approval of funds to build the Ngaruawahia section of the Waikato Expressway is an important step towards completing the Road of National Significance, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

The NZ Transport Agency Board has confirmed the $169 million required to fund the Ngaruawahia section.

Mr Joyce says construction of the 10 kilometre section will create up to 300 local jobs directly, with many more downstream.

"Construction will get underway later next year, meaning three sections of the Waikato Expressway will be underway next year - Te Rapa, Rangiriri and Ngaruawahia."

Mr Joyce says the Waikato Expressway is a priority for investment because of the economic and safety benefits it will bring.

"When complete, this section of SH1 will reduce traffic congestion and improve safety within Taupiri and Ngaruawahia.

"Pre-election National committed to having the Waikato Expressway completed within ten years of National taking office.  It remains a big challenge we're committed to this goal in government and we're a further step closer today.

"The funding confirmed today is an important step towards getting the Expressway designed and built so that these benefits can be realised.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities," says Mr Joyce.
