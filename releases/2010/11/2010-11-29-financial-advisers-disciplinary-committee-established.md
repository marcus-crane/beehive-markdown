Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the establishment of a committee to conduct disciplinary proceedings arising out of complaints against authorised financial advisers.

“The aim of the Financial Advisers Act is to build confidence in the professionalism and integrity of financial advisers,” Mr Power said.

“A key part of that is making financial advisers accountable for the advice they give.”

The new regime does not come fully into force until 1 July next year, but advisers who become authorised before then will be subject to all their obligations from the date they become authorised.

The Disciplinary Committee will be chaired by the Commissioner for Financial Advisers, David Mayhew. He will be joined by committee members Tracey Berry, Simon Hassan, Peter Houghton, and Sir Bruce Robertson.

Mr Power said another recent step in the implementation of the new financial services regime has been the finalisation of exemptions from the Financial Service Providers Act.

“These exemptions address a number of technical issues with the legislation and will help minimise compliance costs.”

One key exemption is for ‘sole adviser practices’ – those financial advisers working through their own closely-held company. They will have to register on the new Financial Service Providers Register in their own name, but they will not have to register their company as well, minimising registration fees. Membership of an approved consumer dispute resolution scheme is still compulsory for the company.

Further information on registration for sole adviser practices can be found on the Financial Service Providers Register website [www.fspr.govt.nz](http://www.fspr.govt.nz)

Mr Power also reminded all financial service providers, including many issuers and trustees, that they must be registered and belong to a dispute resolution scheme by 1 December.

Meanwhile, financial advisers who are working under a qualifying financial entity or whose qualifying financial entity is still awaiting approval have until 31 March next year to register.

“The new regime is an important part of the Government’s work to rebuild investor confidence in our financial markets, and financial advisers need to play their part in that.”

The Securities Commission has also recommended that advisers wishing to apply for authorisation aim for the 31 March date, in order to ensure there is sufficient time for their application to be processed before the Act comes fully into force on 1 July.

More information about the new regime and how to register can be found at www.fspr.govt.nz, or by calling the Companies Office on 0508 FSPR INFO (0508 377 746).
