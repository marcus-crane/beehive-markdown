Tonight's inauguration ceremony for the new Auckland Council marks the beginning of a new era in Local Government - and a new beginning for Auckland, Minister of Local Government Hon Rodney Hide said today. 

"From today, Aucklanders will have one Mayor; one Council; one united voice.  A new Auckland that residents can be proud of," Mr Hide said. 

"In recognition of this new beginning it is only fitting that we consider all that has been achieved for Aucklanders, and the benefits they will now enjoy.

"All Auckland ratepayers can be pleased at the new Auckland Council rates projection of 3.9 percent for 2011/2012.  This is 2.1 percent lower than the 6.0 percent weighted average increase projected by the old councils and is good news in the current economic climate.  The new council will have an AA credit rating and a single council-wide insurance programme will save an estimated $1m.

"From today, Aucklanders will also enjoy lower fees and charges.  Fees have generally been standardised to the lowest level across the region for building inspections and other fees.  For example, the hourly call-out fee for a building inspection of $178 will be reduced to $110.  More than 850 forms have been streamlined to around 100 which are available online.

"Under the old councils there were 60 different categories of dog licence.  This has now been halved and fees have been cut to the lowest previous level (excluding Franklin).  For example: fees in the most common registration category, which ranged from $70-$100 across Auckland, will now be $70.

"Lower charges also extend to water.  The price of reticulated drinking water now delivered by Watercare across metropolitan Auckland will drop an average 20 percent from July 1 2011. 

"The new council will offer better advisory services.  The pre-lodgement service for building and resource consents - previously available only at Auckland City Council - is being rolled out region-wide.  There will be a major projects team to coordinate projects of regional significance.  
"The amalgamation of Auckland's libraries creates the largest group in Australasia, giving Aucklanders access to around 3.5 million items - including books, CDs, DVDs, online information and databases.   Aucklanders will be able to use their library cards at any of the 55 libraries and four mobile libraries in the region. 

"The new Council has been streamlined to ensure the most efficient use of ratepayers' funds.  From today, there is a 13 percent staffing reduction - saving ratepayers $66.5m in annual salaries.  By the end of the transition period - July 1 2012 - this will increase to 16 percent, or a $91 million annual saving.  Roughly half of the reduction has been by natural attrition, minimising the burden of redundancy payments.  Total redundancy payments are estimated to be approximately $20m.

"A strong emphasis was put on customer service in the new streamlined organisational structure.  Training and induction processes have concentrated on ensuring staff are ready to serve. 

"An independent board has been established to advise on significant matters for Maori.  It has nine members who represent mana whenua (iwi directly associated with the area) and matawaka (non-mana whenua) of the Auckland region.  It will be independent of the council and will appoint up to two people as members to sit on Auckland Council committees that deal with the management and stewardship of natural and physical resources.

"With the agreement of the new Mayor and his council, two further advisory panels will advise on the most appropriate ways to engage with Pacific and ethnic people.  They will identify and communicate to the council the interests and preferences of their people regarding the council's strategies, policies, plans and bylaws; and any other matters they consider to be of interest to their communities.

"Given these achievements, Auckland is now set up to be the world-class city and economic powerhouse that New Zealand wants it to be. 

"The Government has done its part.  Now it's over to the new Mayor Len Brown, and his team, to take control and build a brighter future for Auckland," Mr Hide said.
