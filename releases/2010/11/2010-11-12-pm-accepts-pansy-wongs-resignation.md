Prime Minister John Key today accepted the resignation of Pansy Wong as a Minister.

"I was informed today that Mrs Wong had used her Parliamentary travel entitlement to pay for parts of her husband's travel in China in late 2008, where he conducted private business," Mr Key says.

"On the face of it, this is a breach of travel entitlement rules and Mrs Wong has been unable to assure me it is a one-off breach.

"I expect high standards from my Ministers, and I believe that Mrs Wong has taken the appropriate step in resigning.

"It is important that MPs and Ministers treat taxpayer money with the utmost respect.

"I am advised that the Speaker of the House has commissioned an investigation by Parliamentary Service into both this travel claim and previous use of the international travel rebate by Mrs Wong.

"I am not going to pre-judge the outcome of this investigation.

"I am extremely disappointed to lose a Minister who has been an effective and hard-working representative for the ethnic community and New Zealand," Mr Key says.

Georgina te Heuheu will be the Acting Minister for the Ethnic Affairs and Women's Affairs portfolios.
