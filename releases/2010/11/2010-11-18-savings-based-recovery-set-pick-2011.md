A sustainable economic recovery is underway and will pick up momentum next year as the Government continues to roll out its economic plan, Finance Minister Bill English says.

"The economy is growing, unemployment is dropping and our exports are increasing. About 40,000 more people are in jobs than this time last year," Mr English said in a speech to a Cullen Employment Law Firm breakfast.

"And all of this is happening as we rebalance our economy on to a more sustainable footing - away from borrowing and consumption, towards saving, investment and exports.

"This trend towards increased household saving creates a strong platform for faster economic growth in the medium and longer term. That is the only way we can create the jobs, higher incomes and the better living standards Kiwis deserve.

"However it means the recovery will not be driven by sectors like retail and housing, leading to a flatter domestic economy in the short term.

"That trend, alongside a weaker global outlook, is likely to flow into a lower growth forecast for the year to March 2011 in the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update next month, before a rebound in the following year.

"Combined with the fiscal impacts of the Canterbury earthquake, it will mean slightly higher deficits in the short term before improvements show through.

"This reinforces the need for sensible financial management and ongoing discipline in Government spending if we are to get back to surplus by 2016. We still have a significant medium term challenge to achieve that.

"Over the past two years, we've moved nearly $4 billion of spending into frontline public services such as health, education and law and order, and all major departments will face significant change over the next four years, as we lift productivity growth in the public sector."

Mr English said the Government's first Investment Statement, which will be published with the half-year update, would help ensure discipline was applied equally to the Government's operating and capital spending.

"The Crown is the largest single investor in a capital constrained economy. It is therefore vital that the Crown invests its capital efficiently.

"The Investment Statement will clearly set out the Crown's assets and liabilities, identify emerging issues and state how the Government plans to manage its large and growing investment in taxpayers' assets.

"We believe this level of transparent information - in a regular publication - will allow the public to demand a much greater level of accountability from the Government and lead to significantly better decision-making across the public sector," Mr English said.
