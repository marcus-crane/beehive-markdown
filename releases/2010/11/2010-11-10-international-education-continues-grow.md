The number of international students enrolled to study in New Zealand is continuing to increase, says Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce.

Latest enrolment figures show an increase of nearly 5% for the first eight months of this year, compared to last year (from 78,905 to 82,577).

"International education contributes at least $2.1 billion to our economy and supports about 32,000 jobs, so it is pleasing to see the sector continue to grow despite strong competition from Australia and other countries," says Mr Joyce.

"The fact that international students choose to live and study here is a testament to New Zealand's education system.

"The government is keen to work with providers to further improve the quality and scale of New Zealand's international education sector."

International students currently make up around 13% of the student roll in New Zealand universities, compared to an average of more than 20% in Australian universities.

Mr Joyce says there is great potential for international education to contribute more than it does already to New Zealand's economic and social growth over the next fifteen years and beyond.

"The government is excited by the possibilities stemming from growth in this area - that's why continued and sustainable growth of the sector is an important part of our economic growth strategy."
