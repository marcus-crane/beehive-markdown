Prime Minister John Key will leave this week to attend the 18th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2010 Leaders' meeting to be held November 13-14 in Yokohama, Japan.

Mr Key will join Leaders from the group of 21 economies in Yokohama, where they will discuss the region's economic and growth prospects and ways to make APEC's vision of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) a reality.

He will also visit Tokyo between November 10-12 to strengthen tourism and investment links and to promote the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

"APEC supports closer trade and economic relationships in the region and makes it easier for members to trade with and invest in each other's economies. These include initiatives that will make it easier, cheaper and faster for New Zealand businesses to operate in the region," Mr Key says.

"Immediately following the G20 Summit in Seoul, APEC will also be an important opportunity for leaders from the Asia-Pacific region to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening regional growth and supporting the multilateral trading system."

APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Trade Minister Tim Groser will also attend Ministers' meetings as part of APEC Leaders' week, to be held 10-14 November.
