New Zealand streets are safer with the addition of 384 extra frontline Police officers deployed since December 2008, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

A cornerstone of the Government's law and order policy was to ensure there were 300 more officers on the frontline in Counties-Manukau by December 2010 than there was in December 2008, and an additional 300 around the rest of the country by December 2011.

"Last month the 300th new officer started work in Counties-Manukau, fulfilling our pledge to the people of that district," Ms Collins said.

"We are on track to fulfilling our promise to the rest of the country by the end of next year. As of 30 October, 84 of the extra 300 officers had been recruited and deployed.

"Increasing the numbers of frontline Police will not only put more officers into neighbourhoods, but, crucially, will enable Police to try new strategies to prevent crime."

Due to low Police attrition during the recession, 11 of the 12 Police districts exceeded their staff levels in June 2009. The numbers are returning to the funded level and there will be 600 extra Police by December 2011.
