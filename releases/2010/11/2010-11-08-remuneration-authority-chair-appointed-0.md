Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today announced the appointment of John Errington as the new Chair of the Remuneration Authority.

The Authority is responsible for setting the rates for pay and allowances for MPs, Ministers, the Judiciary, as well as local authority members.

Mr Errington, who is currently a serving member of the Authority, has been appointed until 30 June 2012.

Ms Wilkinson says Mr Errington brings valuable experience to the role, in his capacity as a current member of the Authority, and as a former partner and practice leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

"Mr Errington has extensive experience in pay fixing processes, and I wish him well in leading this small, but important team.

"I would also like to thank Michael Wintringham, whose term as Chair expired in August, for his service to the Authority."
