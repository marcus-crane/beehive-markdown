Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the five Crown appointees to the Waikato River Authority to enable it to take up its statutory functions with Waikato River iwi representatives from 25 November.

"I am pleased to announce that John Luxton will co-chair the Waikato River Authority and the appointments of Environment Waikato Chairman Peter Buckley, Waipa District Mayor Alan Livingston, forest manager Sally Strang, and resource management consultant Jenni Vernon," Dr Smith said. "These Crown appointees will be joined by Tukoroirangi Morgan of Waikato-Tainui and four iwi appointees to co-govern the Waikato River from Maniapoto, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ruakawa and Te Arawa.

"The Waikato River is an important river for all New Zealanders, but has particular cultural significance for local Māori. The Government and Māori will work together through the Waikato River Authority to restore New Zealand's largest river.

"We are now on the path to realising the vision for a healthy and better managed Waikato River. The Crown and iwi will work together through the Authority to monitor and guide the implementation of the vision and strategy.

"It has been a long and challenging journey to bring together the new authority. In 2008 the newly elected National-led Government had real concerns about the proposal inherited from Labour that involved five new authorities - the Guardians of the Waikato River, the Waikato River Statutory Board, the Waikato River Co-management Authority, the Waipa River Statutory Framework and the Waikato River Cleanup Trust. We believe the single authority in partnership with iwi offers the best prospect of effectively and efficiently governing the Waikato River in the future.   

"I particularly wish to acknowledge the goodwill of Tukoroirangi Morgan and Waikato-Tainui on the constructive way in which we have been able to re-design the structures into a simpler and more effective authority. I also want to acknowledge the Guardians Establishment Committee and the five river iwi for the work they put in to enable a smooth transition to the new Authority.

"There is huge work ahead for the new Authority in progressing the vision and strategy to enable the cleanup of the Waikato River to which the Government has committed $210 million over the next 30 years. The challenge is of such a scale that significant regional and private resources will also be required. The next step will be in releasing the scoping study commissioned from NIWA on the steps required to restore the river.

"The Waikato River Authority is a significant reform done in partnership with iwi of the governance of New Zealand's largest river. The challenge ahead will be in translating the enormous goodwill built up with sound science to making real improvements in the Waikato River."
