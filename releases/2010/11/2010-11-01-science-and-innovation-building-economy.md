High-quality science and research expertise is now within reach for more Kiwi businesses, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp.

Applications for the new Technology Transfer Voucher opened today. The voucher programme is a new initiative worth $20 million over four years to create better connections between business and the science community.

"Businesses need to outsmart their competitors to be successful. One of the best ways that they can gain a competitive edge is through research and development.

"The smart application of science and technology will accelerate business growth. The voucher programme creates a tool to enhance the necessary connections between the science and business sectors," he said.

"Science and innovation build a clear pathway to economic growth that will benefit all New Zealanders. They will bring greater productivity, more jobs and higher export revenues."

The Technology Transfer Voucher programme was announced as a new research and development (R&D) initiative in the May Budget. The vouchers enable businesses to access research services and expertise for a specific R&D project.

The programme, run by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, will provide a business with 50 per cent funding to redeem with one of the six research organisations.

The scheme will be introduced in phases. During the first phase, which runs until 30 June 2011, access to the voucher is limited to businesses in the high-value manufacturing and services sector.

Based on the success of the first phase, the programme may then expand to include more sectors and research organisations.

Businesses will be able to apply for a voucher from the Foundation from today. For more information, or to apply for a voucher go to: [www.technzvoucher.co.nz](http://www.technzvoucher.co.nz/).   

**Technology Transfer Vouchers: how they work**

In the May 2010 Budget, new funding of $20 million over the next four years was announced to set up Technology Transfer Vouchers, starting with $5 million available in 2010.

The objective of the voucher programme is to bring more technology and knowledge from the science sector to the business community.

Vouchers will provide a business with 50 per cent of funding required to access research services and expertise from accredited R&D partners for a specific project. Businesses will have to pay the other half.

Voucher values can range from a minimum of $100,000 to a maximum of $1 million (GST exclusive). It is expected the majority of vouchers awarded will be between $100,000 and $200,000.

Vouchers will be awarded to businesses with limited or no in-house R&D capability, and with well-defined problems or ideas that will benefit from the R&D expertise and services in a research organisation.

The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology is administering the new voucher programme. The Foundation will assess applications and award vouchers to suitable businesses.

The scheme will be introduced in phases. During the first phase, which runs until 30 June 2011, access to the voucher is limited to businesses in the high-value manufacturing and services sector.

Based on the success of the first phase, the programme may then expand to include more sectors and research organisations.

Businesses with a Technology Transfer Voucher will be able to redeem these with one of six accredited R&D partners, to tap into knowledge and expertise in the science sector.

The accredited R&D partners are:

- The University of Auckland
- Industrial Research Limited
- The University of Canterbury
- Auckland University of Technology
- The University of Otago
- The Wellington Institute of Technology.
