The Australian and New Zealand Governments have reaffirmed their commitment to working closely together on climate change.

Australia's Minister for Climate Change Greg Combet and New Zealand's Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith met yesterday in Sydney.

"Climate change is a hugely challenging global issue that requires international cooperation," the Ministers said.

"We agreed that both countries benefit by sharing of knowledge and experience on the complex issue of finding least cost ways of reducing emissions.

"New Zealand benefited from Australian expertise in designing features of its Emissions Trading Scheme. Australia will benefit from New Zealand's experience in introducing its Emissions Trading Scheme earlier this year."

Mr Combet said: "The Australian Government is strongly supporting clean energy development, the promotion of energy efficiency in households and industry, and working towards the introduction of a carbon price into our economy. I am keen to learn from New Zealand about their experiences in these areas."

Dr Smith said: "An important underlying principle is ensuring that investment decisions on both sides of the Tasman are made on the basis of good business sense and incorporate a clear carbon price signal."

"New Zealand and Australia have enjoyed a very constructive working relationship on climate change and yesterday's meeting has reaffirmed this ongoing commitment between our two governments," the Ministers said.
