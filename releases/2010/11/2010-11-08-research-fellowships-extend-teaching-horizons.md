Twenty-three primary and secondary teachers have been awarded New Zealand Science, Mathematics and Technology Teacher Fellowships for 2011.

Announcing the fellowships today, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp said that the fellowships build teachers' skills and support high-quality research by working on projects all around New Zealand.

"These fellowships bring national benefits. Teachers refresh their knowledge of research practice and return to the classroom invigorated. Pupils are the direct beneficiaries of that new energy.

"The teachers are hosted by Crown research institutes, universities, government departments and other organisations. These organisations benefit from the impressive research that is done."

The Fellowships are funded by the Government and administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.  They allow teachers to take six months out from their schools to improve their teaching by working in host organisations on projects related to science, maths or technology.

Research topics in 2011 include:

- the role of a gene in schizophrenia
- a cost-effective electronic waste recycling system for rural communities
- how thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial best practices can be aligned to the delivery of New Zealand's school curriculum
- how new technologies are making public transport systems more efficient and effective.

"Good research is the cornerstone of our economic growth.  In the coming years many of these projects will be part of a real contribution to business success in the science sector," Dr Mapp said.
