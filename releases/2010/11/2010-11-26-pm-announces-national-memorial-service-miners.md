Prime Minister John Key has announced the date for a national memorial service for the 29 men who lost their lives in the Pike River Mine.

After discussion with the Grey District Council, it has been agreed the Pike River Official Remembrance Service will be held in Greymouth next Thursday, 2 December.

"This is a chance for New Zealanders to gather together to remember and mourn the men who tragically lost their lives in one of the nation's worst disasters," says Mr Key.

The service will be at the Omoto Racecourse at a time yet to be confirmed.
