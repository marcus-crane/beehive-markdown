Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins today joined veterans and NZDF representatives at the National War Memorial in Wellington to commemorate the 92nd anniversary of the end of the First World War. 

The Memorial Service marked at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month when the Allies signed an Armistice with Germany in 1918 to end hostilities after more than four years of war.

"The Armistice brought to a close a bitter and brutal conflict in which New Zealand came of age as a nation," Ms Collins said.

"Our small country made an enormous contribution. More than 100,000 New Zealanders served overseas at a time when our population was around 1 million.

"When the final Armistice was signed between the Allies and Germany, New Zealand had lost 18,166 men and a further 50,000 had been wounded during the war. This was a conflict that reached into every community, every home and every family in New Zealand.

"Today, we remember those men and women who sailed from these shores to fight battles half a world away in the pursuit of peace and freedom. We honour their courage and vow that the memory of their sacrifice will live on.

"Especially in our thoughts today are the men and women of our armed forces who are on peacekeeping operations and United Nations missions around the world."
