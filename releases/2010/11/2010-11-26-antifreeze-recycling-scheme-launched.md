Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced in Dunedin a new initiative to recycle used antifreeze thanks to a Government grant of $180,000 from the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“This recycling initiative is about preventing used antifreeze ending up in our water ways causing environmental harm as well as sensible recycling so as to save natural resources,” Dr Smith said.

“Local business Beta Antifreeze will use the funding to establish a recycling facility at Dunedin’s Green Island Landfill to collect and recycle used automotive coolant and contaminated glycol from industry and individual users.

“Beta Antifreeze has a specifically designed recycle machine to recover the glycol from used antifreeze. This can then be used in the production of new coolant ready to be used for automotive and industrial processes. The company expects to process 32,000 litres of used anti freeze in Otago in the first year. It plans to expand the programme throughout New Zealand over the next few years where there is huge potential given that 2.5 million litres of antifreeze is imported each year.

The 180,000 grant is over three years and contributes to the total project cost of $550,000. The balance of funding comes from Beta Antifreeze as well as in-kind contribution from Dunedin City Council of $30,000.

“It is entirely appropriate that Dunedin is leading this national work on making antifreeze recycling viable give the region’s cold climate, high usage, and strong environmental credentials,” Dr Smith said.

“This grant reflects the Government’s Waste Strategy with a strong emphasis on those waste streams that cause the most harm and the focus on initiating new economically viable recycling businesses. It is a practical application of the Government’s Bluegreen approach.”
