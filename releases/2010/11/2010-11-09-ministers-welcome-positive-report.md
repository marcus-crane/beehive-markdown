Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy and Minister of Community and Voluntary Sector Tariana Turia have welcomed the Auditor-General's report on lottery and community grants, tabled today in Parliament.

"The Department of Internal Affairs has been found to have highly effective systems and processes in grants funding," says Mr Guy.

"The Office of the Auditor-General praised the Department's administration of Lottery Grants and the Community Organisation Grants Scheme as being consistent with good practice.

"The Government needs assurance that grants are administered properly because both communities and individuals rely heavily on grant funding to meet their needs," says Mr Guy.

Mrs Turia says the audit confirms that a replacement grants administration system is required. 

"Work to replace the Department's electronic grants system has begun and this new process will address many of the existing system's limitations.

"Grant funding plays an important role in building strong and sustainable communities, hapu, and iwi," says Mrs Turia.

"In 2009/10, approximately $115 million in community grant funding was approved for the two grant schemes. It is a great assurance to know that this funding is being properly accounted for.

"The Department is continually working to make its grant administration more effective for users and ultimately better grant systems will mean better relationships with the community sector."
