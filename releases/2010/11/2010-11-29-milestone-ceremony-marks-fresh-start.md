Social Development Minister Paula Bennett joined families and staff today at a graduation ceremony for young offenders.

“The young men who came here after committing serious offences have been challenged to take responsibility and make a fresh start,” says Ms Bennett.

“They will face challenges and temptations but I’m backing them because I believe if they work hard, they can turn their lives around,” says Ms Bennett.

Youth offenders spend two months on an intensive residential programme know as Military Activity Camp (MAC).

It is an intensive, structured programme combining education, mentoring and drug and alcohol treatment with daily physical challenges.

Supervision orders will continue during the community phase of the programme and individual transition plans reinforce what they learnt on camp and help them settle back in to the community.

“Speaking with these young men this morning I can see they have taken on board lessons in self-discipline, respect and responsibility,” says Ms Bennett.

“It is my hope that these lessons will go with them when they return to their communities and help will be there should they need it,” says Ms Bennett.

“It is early days, but these young men have made the most of the MAC experience and are on track to reach their full potential,” says Ms Bennett.
