The Auckland Council's first Auckland spatial plan will help to ensure that New Zealand has a city which can provide a key link to the global economy, Local Government Minister Rodney Hide and Environment Minister Nick Smith said today.

"Auckland is the engine room of New Zealand's economy.  A prosperous Auckland ensures economic growth for the rest of the country, and makes a significant contribution to the Government's economic growth, social, environmental and infrastructure objectives," Mr Hide said.

"Internationally, cities are increasingly driving national economic growth and competing globally for skilled workers, international and innovative companies, and high value economic activities.  Auckland is predicted to take up to 60 percent of New Zealand's population growth over the next 30 years and will provide New Zealand with a significant economic opportunity. 

"One of the most important roles of the Auckland Council will be to articulate the 20-30 year vision for Auckland through the spatial plan.

"When Cabinet met on Monday, a number of decisions were made about how central government will engage with the Auckland Council in the development of the first spatial plan. I have written to Mayor Len Brown to communicate those decisions," Mr Hide said. 

Dr Smith said: "Cabinet agreed the spatial plan is the key vehicle for developing an integrated approach to managing Auckland's urban growth. 

"The Government is looking forward to working with the Auckland Council to ensure the spatial plan is properly integrated into broader decision making.  Submissions on a Ministry for the Environment discussion document outlining proposals to reform the urban and infrastructure planning system, including proposals relating to spatial planning provisions, close on 17 December.

A number of government agencies, including the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry for the Environment, will be working with the Auckland Council as it develops its first spatial plan.

"The spatial plan will illustrate how Auckland will develop in the future. It will show where and when growth will occur in transport, housing, energy, water, recreation, education and health infrastructure and services," Dr Smith said.

"Aucklanders will be looking to see that the spatial plan sets out their aspirations for their city - all those that are affordable and feasible - and which supports efficient and effective resource allocation.  It will provide guidance to improve Auckland's built environment, and ensure infrastructure is delivered in the right place at the right time."

The Ministers said: "We look forward to discussing the spatial plan at an Auckland central government-local government forum in the New Year."
