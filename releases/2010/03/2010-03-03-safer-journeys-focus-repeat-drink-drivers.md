The government is looking to significantly reduce the impact of drink drivers with Cabinet set to consider a range of measures to crack down on those breaking the law, particularly repeat offenders.

The changes will be one of the first outcomes of the new 10 year road safety strategy which was released today.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says alcohol is a factor in almost one in three fatal crashes and current policies are not having a big enough impact.

"It's clear that we still have a sizeable drink driving problem in New Zealand.  If we can get it under control, we'll see a dramatic reduction in the overall road toll."

In 2008, alcohol and drugs contributed to 31 percent of fatal crashes and 21 percent of serious injury crashes. These crashes resulted in 119 deaths, 582 serious injuries and 1,726 minor injuries. It is estimated that the social cost of crashes where alcohol/drugs were a factor was $841 million in 2008.

Mr Joyce says the Cabinet has not yet reached a final decision about whether or not to reduce the current adult drink drive limit from 0.08 to 0.05.

"This is a very finely balanced argument and we need to ensure that New Zealanders understand the difference between 0.05 and 0.08 and what impact a change would have on the road toll.

"Most New Zealanders, when asked, agree that the drink drive limit should be at a level of alcohol consumption that equates to a 0.05 limit.  However, when you ask them whether the current 0.08 limit should be lowered to 0.05, they are split on the issue.

"I've said all along that road safety measures only work if they have the broad support of road users - and we'd want to be sure New Zealanders understand the benefits of a change and support it before proceeding," says Mr Joyce.

In April the Minister will take to Cabinet a package of measures designed to combat drink driving, particularly repeat offending.

Actions in the April package are:

- Compulsory alcohol interlocks and a zero drink drive limit for recidivist drink drivers
- A zero drink drive limit for drivers under 20
- Review the traffic offences and penalties for repeat offenders and drink driving causing death and serious injury
- **Either** lowering the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from BAC 0.08 to 0.05, **or** conducting New Zealand specific  research on the level of risk posed by drivers with a BAC between 0.05 and 0.08.

Legislation will be in place by the end of 2010.
