Up to 200 young New Zealanders will be able to spend a year in Israel following the signing of a reciprocal Working Holiday Scheme, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"This arrangement will enable young New Zealanders and Israelis aged between 18 and 30 to stay longer in our respective countries, and to work and study as an incidental part of their visit," Mr McCully said.

"The agreement will help deepen our tourism and education links, and over time contribute to growth in our bilateral commercial, trade and investment links.

"Israel is already our largest tourist market in the Middle East, and it is an affluent economy that will present opportunities for New Zealand," Mr McCully said.

The arrangement was signed in Jerusalem overnight, while Mr McCully is currently visiting as part of a broader trip to the Middle East.  The Working Holiday Scheme will be implemented once each country has completed necessary domestic processes.
