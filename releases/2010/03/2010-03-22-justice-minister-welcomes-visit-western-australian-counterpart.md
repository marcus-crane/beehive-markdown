Justice Minister Simon Power today welcomed Western Australia's Attorney General, and Minister for Corrective Services to Wellington.

Christian Porter, who is one of the youngest members of the WA Parliament, is visiting New Zealand this week.

"The purpose of his trip is to look at some of the new and innovative approaches being taken by the New Zealand Government in the areas of law and order," Mr Power said.

"This is an opportunity for like-minded governments from similar jurisdictions to share our experiences."

In Western Australia the Attorney-General is responsible for justice policy, court operations, and aboriginal affairs.

Mr Porter will spend his week meeting Ministers and officials, as well as visiting prisons, the Supreme Court, the Rangatahi Court on the Manurewa Marae, and attending a Family Violence Court in Manukau. 

Mr Power will also host a dinner in Mr Porter's honour tomorrow evening.

"I hope the opportunity to see how we do things in New Zealand will help Mr Porter in his role."
