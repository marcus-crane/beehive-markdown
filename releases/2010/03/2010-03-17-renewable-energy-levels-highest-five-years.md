Renewable generation accounted for 73 per cent of electricity generation in New Zealand in 2009, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today. 

This was the highest level of renewable generation since 2004 and was just one of the highlights from the New Zealand Energy Quarterly, published by the Ministry of Economic Development today. 

"The high levels of renewable generation were primarily due to well-stocked hydro lakes and increased geothermal and wind generation," Mr Brownlee said. 

"The increase in renewable generation, at the expense of thermal generation resulted in 2009 recording the lowest electricity generation emissions since 2002, and down 23 per cent on 2008."

For the December quarter, electricity emissions dropped as much as 21 per cent over the previous quarter in line with seasonal variations.

The New Zealand Energy Quarterly also recorded production from the Kupe oil and gas field for the first time.  This field will supply natural gas directly into Vector's transmission grid, will collect LPG for supply to the New Zealand market and export oil from Port Taranaki.  

The New Zealand Energy Quarterly presents quarterly statistics on the supply of major fuels, electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions, and prices to the end of December 2009.
