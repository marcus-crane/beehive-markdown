Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy and Minister of Disability Issues Tariana Turia today welcomed the announcement from Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins that a student with special needs has been selected to join the official New Zealand contingent to Gallipoli for this year's ANZAC Day commemorations.

"Cruze Kapa is a student at the Hagley Community College satellite of the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre in Christchurch.  He was awarded a place with the contingent for his videoed New Zealand Sign Language speech about the impact of war on a family.  We congratulate him and commend his efforts," the Ministers said.

"Gallipoli showed the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity.  That spirit is exemplified by those young people with disabilities, who overcome adversity every day," Mrs Roy said.

"This is a unique opportunity for young people to, not only attend the ANZAC commemorations in Gallipoli but, accompany Prime Minister John Key and his contingent," Mrs Turia said.

"Our long connection with Gallipoli is a key part of what makes us New Zealanders.  No student should miss this opportunity to visit, what has become, a mecca for so many Kiwis on their OEs.

"We are delighted to see that a deaf student will have a chance to join the ranks of New Zealanders throughout history who have travelled to pay their respects at ANZAC Cove.  It is these students turn to carry the ANZAC spirit to the next generation, just as it has been done for the past 95 years," the Ministers said.
