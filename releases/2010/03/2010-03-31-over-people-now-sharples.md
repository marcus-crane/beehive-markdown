Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples is urging tangata whenua and all New Zealanders to have their say on what should replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act.

"Today's release of the Governnment's discussion document takes us one step closer to repealing the current Act and restoring customary rights," said Dr Sharples.

"The current law does not reflect the rights of tangata whenua, according to the Ministerial review panel, the United Nations and many New Zealanders. Now is the time for all New Zealanders to tell the Government what they think should happen.

"The document outlines the Government's preference, and a number of other proposals. As Minister, I am confident there are options which will assist tangata whenua to make submissions in support of their rights," he said.

"This consultation process offers all New Zealanders an opportunity to demonstrate that they can look at the big picture, and come up with proposals that respect the rights and interests of all New Zealanders.

"We do not have long, so I urge people to look at the discussion document and make their submisisons before the closing date of Friday April 30th."
