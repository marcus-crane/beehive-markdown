The Hutt Valley Teen Parent Programme is a wonderful example of women empowering women to better themselves, says Minister Tariana Turia.

This morning the Minister visited the teen parent unit at Heretaunga College to celebrate International Women's Day with students.

The teen parenting unit is a five day a week school where parents under 18 can continue their education and learn more about parenting.

Attached to the unit is an early childhood centre and a daily bus helps get the young parents and their children to and from the school with students coming from as far as Wainuiomata.

"This programme is helping to develop some very proud and confident young mothers who are determined to better their future and their children's future."

"Working alongside them is a very supportive team of professional women passing on their wisdom and guidance," said Minister Turia.

"This programme is a wonderful example of women of all ages including the young women's whanau sharing their knowledge alongside our future generations."

"The girls here have every opportunity to do whatever they want with their lives and this programme has provided them with choices and a chance to continue their education."

"There is nothing more inspiring than seeing a mother and her baby thriving in a healthy and supportive environment; creating the foundation for success in many spheres - academically, socially, physically and spiritually."
