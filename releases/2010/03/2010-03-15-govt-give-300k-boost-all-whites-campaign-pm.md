The Government is giving the All Whites' FIFA World Cup finals campaign a $300,000 boost, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

The cash injection will help New Zealand Football capitalise on the All Whites' second-ever trip to the finals, and assist in the promotion of football domestically.

"The FIFA World Cup finals are a massive event," says Mr Key.

"The All Whites' campaign provides a tremendous opportunity to ramp up interest and enthusiasm for football here, while also promoting New Zealand on a huge world stage.

"The Government's funding will also help New Zealand Football identify talented 17- and 18-year-olds and train them in coaching and leadership skills. They will then help run a series of football festival days through clubs and schools to promote football to young Kiwis."

Mr Key says New Zealand Football will be able to use some of the funding to hire a temporary media manager to help the team cope with the massive worldwide media interest in the FIFA World Cup.

"In addition, New Zealand Football's website will be revamped to become the All Whites' homepage, ensuring all New Zealanders will be able to receive the latest news on the team's South African campaign," says Mr Key.
