Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has welcomed the report.

"The report deals with many of the issues I have been discussing within the sector. It identifies a number of areas for change and reform," he said.

"Science and innovation are key drivers of economic growth.The CRIs are a cornerstone of that science, and at the heart of innovation. We need to ensure that we get the best from them.

"This report will be a vital tool in putting science right at the front of our economic growth. Its recommendations will be carefully considered in the coming weeks," he said.

Dr Mapp thanked the taskforce for their valuable work. "They brought extensive experience and expertise to examining the CRIs. They have done an excellent job. Their work will have an important role in how the Government energises the science sector. It will guide how we address the priorities set out in last year's discussion document and how we encourage business to invest in innovation," he said.
