Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced that he has referred Contact Energy's proposal for a geothermal power station in the Tauhara steam field near Taupo to an independent Board of Inquiry. 

"I have reviewed Contact Energy's application and the recommendations from the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and have decided to direct the application - the first submitted directly to the Government's new EPA - to an independent Board of Inquiry for consideration," Dr Smith said.

"A board of inquiry, chaired by an Environment Court Judge, is the most appropriate way to deal with this nationally significant geothermal power station proposal. At 240MW the Tauhara II geothermal station would be able to provide power to all homes in a region the size of greater Wellington.

"Changes the Government made to streamline the Resource Management Act last year mean Contact Energy's application was able to be made directly to the EPA and did not require call in from a regional or territorial authority. It means a decision on this application must be made within nine months of public notification. Appeal rights are also limited as the Government's objective is to do these major projects once and do them properly without years of litigation."

The members of the Board of Inquiry that will decide on the proposed Tauhara II Geothermal Development Project are: Environment Judge Gordon Whiting (chairman), Dr Patrick Browne (geothermal science expert), Brian White (geothermal engineering expert), Glenice Paine (Tikanga Maori expert) and Jenni Vernon (RMA expert with local knowledge).

"The board members have the right mix of skills to hear this application and I am confident this process will result in a robust and timely decision," Dr Smith said.

 "This Government is keen to encourage development of renewable energy, reversing the declining trend of the last decade. Changes to the RMA and the establishment of the EPA are part of that strategy as well as advancing a National Policy Statement on Renewable Electricity to facilitate viable developments."
