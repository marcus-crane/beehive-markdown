A sensitive combination of the historic and modern have been incorporated into Timaru's new courthouse, which was today opened by Courts Minister, Georgina te Heuheu QSO.

Speaking at the opening, Minister te Heuheu said the new courthouse was "a stunning marriage between the old and new".

"The splendour of the original Timaru Courthouse, which was built in 1877, has not only been retained but has also been skilfully enhanced by the contemporary architecture."

Minister te Heuheu said as Timaru's community had gown, so too had the demands on its civic structures.

"The new structure features enhanced courtrooms, mediation rooms, custodial and interview rooms, and administrative and public spaces that serve the demands of a 21st century courthouse."

The courthouse also featured enhanced security facilities.

Minister te Heuheu said she was pleased to be able to open the new courthouse which is a building Timaru can be proud of, and one she believes will continue to stand the test of time.

"Modern, fully functioning courts are at the heart of our justice system.  The opening of this courthouse today reflects the National Government's desire to deliver safer, secure communities for all New Zealanders."
