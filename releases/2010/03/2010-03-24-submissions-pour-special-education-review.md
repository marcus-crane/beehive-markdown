Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy was today pleased to announce that the Ministry of Education has received more than 1,500 submissions on the Government's Review of Special Education to date, with further submissions still arriving.

"Submissions closed on March 19.  A wide range of feedback has been provided by parents, whanau and caregivers, people working in the education sector, special education sector and in the disability and health fields.  Submissions have also been received from students," Mrs Roy said.

"I am very pleased with the response, and am now holding public consultation hearings in order to gain more in-depth feedback from those submitters who have asked to present directly to me.  The first of these was held in Wellington on March 22.  Subsequent hearings will take place in Christchurch on April 12, and in Auckland on April 16.

"I have also been working with an advisory panel, which I have appointed to assist me with the Review.  This panel includes individuals with experience in special education - economist Dr Roderick Deane as Chair; principal Dr Brian Hinchco; parent representative Heather Lear; disability advocate Paul Gibson; and academic Dr Jill Bevan-Brown.

"The Ministry is currently collating the submissions, which will inform the Review.  By August the Government will have decided what changes need to be made to Special Education.  A summary of the submissions will also be made available at this time.

"I would like to sincerely thank everyone who took the time to give feedback on the Review of Special Education Discussion Document, and for sharing their experiences and ideas," Mrs Roy said.
