Commerce Minister Simon Power has welcomed the first reading of the Securities Trustees and Statutory Supervisors Bill.

The bill requires corporate trustees and statutory supervisors which supervise certain financial investments to be licensed. It also allows the Securities Commission to oversee how trustees and statutory supervisors act in situations where investors' interests may be a risk.

The bill is intended to protect investors' interests, and enhance market confidence by:

- Requiring trustees and statutory supervisors to be capable.
- Requiring them to perform their functions effectively.
- Enabling the Securities Commission to hold them accountable for any failure to act according to the expected standards.

It will be an offence to act as a trustee or statutory supervisor without a licence.

The new regime will apply to trustees of debt securities, unit trustees, and statutory supervisors of certain collective investment schemes and retirement villages.

Retirement village statutory supervisors have been included in the regime in recognition of the similar role they play to trustees of investment products in monitoring the financial position of the retirement village.

"I am confident that the licensing regime established by the bill will ensure that trustees are competent, effectively act in investors' interests, and have the necessary processes in place to ensure they effectively supervise the entities they are responsible for," Mr Power says.

"These changes are part of the Government's comprehensive reform agenda in the financial arena, which also includes work around financial advisors, moratoria regulation, auditors and the Government's action plan for responding to the Capital Market Development Taskforce report.

"We need to rebuild mum and dad investor trust in capital markets, which has been severely dented by finance company failures and the global recession, and this bill is an important part of that."

The Securities Commission will administer the regime, granting licensing applications and receiving mandatory reports from licensed trustees and statutory supervisors. The commission will have increased powers to require information from trustees and to direct them to act in emergency situations.

Mr Power said the commission's new powers to oversee how trustees and statutory supervisors acted in situations where investors' interests were at risk was a particularly important change.

"The fact that the bill gives the commission the power to monitor the actions of trustees in these situations should provide an added level of protection for investors, as should the commission's power under the bill to direct trustees or directly intervene if the trustee is not taking adequate steps or urgent action is required."

The bill improves the accountability of trustees and statutory supervisors. The commission will be able to seek pecuniary penalties and compensation orders on behalf of investors against trustees and statutory supervisors which have breached their obligations.

Mr Power noted the importance of these measures to improve accountability to investors.

"Making provision for compensation orders in the bill goes a long way towards ensuring that if a trustee does act negligently, investors will obtain proper redress".

The bill also creates offences for failing to comply with the commission's directions, including directions to provide information about the trustee or statutory supervisor, or about the issuer. Maximum penalties for these offences will range from $100,000 to $200,000.

"In light of recent events there is a legitimate question as to whether some or all superannuation and KiwiSaver trustees should be included within the licensing regime established by the bill.

"I welcome select committee consideration of this issue."
