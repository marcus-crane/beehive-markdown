An increased focus on frontline services at the Ministry of Education will enhance support for teachers, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"The Government has asked the Ministry to focus more on regional support for schools and early childhood education services," says Mrs Tolley.

"That means making sure teachers have the support they need and we are committed to continuing to provide that.

"Trevor Mallard's comments have no basis in fact and can be seen only as typical Labour Party scaremongering.

"This is another shameful attempt by Mr Mallard to jump on any passing bandwagon or protest bus and mislead teachers, parents and the public.

 "This Government is determined to lift achievement levels in our schools, and more frontline services will help the Ministry achieve that goal."
