Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that New Zealand is to be part of an OECD international review of evaluation and assessment in schools.

"New Zealand is internationally recognised for our innovative policies and approaches to education and this will give us the opportunity to showcase our strengths," says Mrs Tolley.

"An OECD team will visit later in the year to analyse our systems, including National Standards which have just been introduced in primary and intermediate schools.

"The information gathered from New Zealand, and the eight other countries being visited, will be brought together in an OECD report which will share policy innovation with other nations on how to lift student achievement.

"The implementation of National Standards is unique to New Zealand and has gained interest from many other countries. The OECD review will allow us to examine how our evaluation and assessment policies can be even more effective in raising student achievement, and how the Standards can contribute to that.

"The OECD review will also assist the work of the recently-appointed Independent Advisory Group on National Standards, whose terms of reference I am releasing today.

"The Advisory Group will give me free and frank advice on the implementation of National Standards in what is a bedding-in year. This is in addition to the three-year monitoring and evaluation programme being run by the Ministry.

"We are determined to give every child the opportunity to succeed and any necessary changes will be made. It's vital that we get National Standards right to benefit all young New Zealanders."
