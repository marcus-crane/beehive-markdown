The consultation period for a discussion document on enhancing victims' rights is drawing to a close.

The document, entitled: *"A Focus on Victims of Crime: A Review of Victims' Rights",* was released last December by Justice Minister Simon Power as part of work the Government is doing to put victims at the heart of the justice system.

"This document is an important step in raising issues around the role of victims in the justice system and addressing their needs.

"I encourage people and organisations with an interest in victims of crime to consider the issues discussed in this document and make a submission." 

Once consultation closes on 31 March, the Ministry of Justice will analyse all submissions and provide proposals to the Government for consideration. 

A Victims' Rights Amendment Bill is likely to be introduced in early 2011, amending the Victims' Rights Act 2002.
