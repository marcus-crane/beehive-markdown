A state highway classification system to guide future investment and management of the network is being developed, Transport Minister Steven Joyce has announced.

"The development of the classification system will involve categorising state highways based on the volume of traffic they carry and the function they perform - whether that's the movement of freight, everyday travel or tourism," says Mr Joyce.

"This will help ensure that our planned state highway investment and operational activities are aligned to helping routes better perform their function help improve safety and support economic growth and productivity, all within the funding allocation set out in the GPS."

Work on the classification system is being led by the NZ Transport Agency with input from the Ministry of Transport.

International best practice is being utilised to develop the classification system, alongside work undertaken in New Zealand including the 2007 National State Highway Strategy and initial work to identify key freight and tourism routes.

"Officials are currently working on developing draft criteria to determine categories within the classification system.  Key stakeholders will be involved once a draft of this classification has been completed with the final highway categories determined after receiving their input."

Once the classification system is developed levels of service will be agreed for the different highway categories considering their function, form and the area they travel through.
