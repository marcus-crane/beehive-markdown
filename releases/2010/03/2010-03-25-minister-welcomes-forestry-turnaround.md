New data released today shows New Zealand has reversed the trend of deforestation and re-started tree planting, Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith says.

"New Zealand lost a net area of 30,500 hectares in the years from 2005-2008 while last year there was a small gain of 500 hectares," Dr Smith said. "I am encouraged that the survey of forest intentions is indicating net growth of 4700 hectares this year, 5700 hectares in 2011 and 7700 hectares in 2012.

"This turnaround has been driven by both reduced deforestation and new planting. This trend is positive and shows confidence is coming back into the forest sector."

The 2009 Deforestation Intensions Survey was commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and undertaken by Dr Bruce Manley of Canterbury University.

"The report is very clear that New Zealand would be losing significant forest area without the ETS legislation," Dr Smith said. "The survey indicates deforestation rates would be more than three times higher or about 8000 hectares per year as compared to 2300 hectares per year.

"The Government has gone to considerable effort in it's moderation of the ETS to more than half the cost for consumers and industry, but to retain the full price signals to the forest sector, and this latest data on forest intentions is showing the positive results from this policy."

"This turnaround is good news for the forest sector and the environment. Every new hectare of forest absorbs in time more than 800 tonnes of CO2 as well as assisting with soil retention. The Government will be working with the forest sector on enhancing the environmental benefits from forestry."
