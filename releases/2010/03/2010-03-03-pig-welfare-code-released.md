Agriculture Minister David Carter is inviting public discussion on a draft code of welfare for pigs released for consultation today.

"I am aware of the level of concern over the issue of pig welfare and this draft code is an opportunity for any person or organisation to have their say.

"Last year I asked the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC) to review the code with urgency and I am pleased a draft is now out for consultation."

Mr Carter thanked NAWAC for the priority given to the review of the code.
