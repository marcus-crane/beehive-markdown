The Ministry of Education will look at reshaping its role, size and focus in the next stage of its ongoing change programme says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"The Ministry, which has a departmental operating budget of $441 million in 2009/10, has to identify $25 million by 2012/13 as a result of savings offered up by the line by line review leading in to Budget 2009, and increasing cost pressures," says Mrs Tolley.

"As part of this process, which began in May of last year, Government has asked the Ministry to focus more on frontline regional support for schools and ECE services, with less National Office bureaucracy. This will mean staff can concentrate on relationships at a local level, to help schools and education providers lift student achievement.

"It will also continue the drive to be more effective and efficient in the delivery of core services such as property, payroll and ICT.

"The Ministry will take a good, hard look at how it can deliver the best and cost efficient use of resources. It's expected that staff will be bolstered in areas of high priority, while there will be staff reductions in areas of lower priority.

"Savings will be reinvested in delivering better frontline services to ensure our education system supports every child in achieving their potential."
