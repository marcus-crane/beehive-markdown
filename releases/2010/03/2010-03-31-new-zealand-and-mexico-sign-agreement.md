Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee and Mexico's Secretary of Energy Georgina Kessels have signed a cooperation arrangement in Cancun, Mexico to facilitate bilateral collaboration in the field of renewable energy.

The Arrangement on Cooperation in the Field of New and Renewable Energy between the Secretariat of Energy of Mexico and the Ministry of Economic Development of New Zealand formalises cooperative institutional relationships that will encourage development of renewable energy and promote good bilateral relations.

"The types of initiatives that may be pursued under the arrangement include closer cooperation between New Zealand and Mexican research organisations and businesses, and educational exchanges between energy and climate change researchers between our countries," Mr Brownlee said.

"The focus will be on improving renewable energy knowledge and expertise, so that both our countries can benefit and encourage renewable energy development."

The arrangement is a non-binding memorandum of understanding that has been negotiated between Mexico's Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Economic Development, in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The agreement could lead to New Zealand clean energy companies expanding their sales in Mexico.

Mr Brownlee has been attending the International Energy Forum in Cancun, Mexico.  The International Energy Forum is the world's largest gathering of Energy Ministers, with countries participating in the forum accounting for more than 90 per cent of global oil and gas supply and demand.
