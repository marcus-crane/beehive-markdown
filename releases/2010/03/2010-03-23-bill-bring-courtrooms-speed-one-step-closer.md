A bill which would mean greater use of audio visual links in courtrooms passed its first reading in Parliament this afternoon.

The Courts (Remote Participation) Bill is the first piece of legislation introduced by the Government to modernise and simplify the criminal court procedure.

"Greater use of video links will improve court efficiency, increase safety and security, increase access to justice, and improve the quality of evidence heard in our courtrooms," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"Witnesses can already appear by video link.  This bill means counsel and defendants, and even judges and juries, could appear by video link.

"The bill allows the court to decide when it's appropriate to use audio visual links. I'm not at the point where I want to see defendants sentenced via audio visual link, but for procedural matters I see no good reason why the technology can't be routinely used."

Audio visual links are already commonplace in countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The bill has been referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee for report back to Parliament by 31 May 2010.

**Background information**

The Courts (Remote Participation) Bill is an overarching piece of legislation that applies to every enactment that is part of New Zealand law.  The bill:

- Sets out criteria for consideration in decisions on the use of video links.
- Allows a judicial officer or registrar to require any participant to appear by video link in a criminal procedural matter, provided the criteria are satisfied.
- Allows for the use of video links in criminal substantive matters (ie, those where evidence is being presented), on the application of any party or on the judicial officer's own motion, where the judicial officer considers that the criteria would be satisfied.
- Allows for the use of video links in civil matters, where the parties consent or (where there is disagreement between the parties) on the application of any participant or the judicial officer's own motion.

The ordinary rules of court procedure (with any necessary modifications) apply to any proceeding in which a participant is appearing by video link.

This legislation will mean that greater use can be made of video link facilities as these are installed in courts around New Zealand.
