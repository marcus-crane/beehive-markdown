Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the reappointment of Dr Robin Pratt as Chair of the Testing Laboratory Registration Council.

Dr Pratt's second term of three years starts on May 1.

"I am pleased Dr Pratt has accepted this reappointment," Mr Power said.

"He has successfully presided over the restructuring of the organisation, while maintaining a zero fee increase.

"The council continues to benefit from his skills and knowledge, and I'm confident he will capably lead it as it as it faces structural changes proposed through the Standards and Accreditation Bill."
