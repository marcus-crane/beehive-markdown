The increasingly desperate behaviour of Labour's education spokesman was criticised by parents attending community meetings on National Standards in Auckland last night, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"Parents came along to meetings in Onehunga and Panmure wanting more information on National Standards, but instead had to listen to Trevor Mallard trying to score political points," says Mrs Tolley.

"Afterwards parents complained that Mr Mallard had wasted their valuable time, and had not allowed them to ask questions about the Standards.

"He also appeared to be taping the meetings, which shows he is losing the plot in his attempt to undermine our children and what is a hugely popular approach to lifting achievement for all New Zealand students.

"It is these kinds of negative antics which led the public to vote Labour out of office. New Zealanders want their elected representatives to focus on the issues, such as addressing the 150,000 children who are failing in our school system.

"National Standards will enable us to do this by identifying the students who are struggling in reading, writing and maths and getting them the support they need to make progress. They will also ensure that parents receive plain-language reports twice a year on their child's progress, and receive advice on how they can help."  

Mrs Tolley stayed behind after last night's meetings to speak to parents, teachers and principals who had not been able to have their views heard.

"If Trevor Mallard had put as much effort into lifting achievement when he was Minister as he does into trying to undermine National Standards, then perhaps one in five children would not be leaving school without the skills they need in literacy and numeracy.

"Labour had nine years to do something about this but failed miserably. They should now be getting on board with National Standards to help our children, instead of upsetting parents and teachers."
