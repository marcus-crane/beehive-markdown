It's time for the NZEI to get off the protest bus and get on board with National Standards to support children, parents and teachers says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"The vast majority of the 2000 schools involved are quietly getting on with the task of implementing National Standards in a calm and professional manner," says Mrs Tolley.

"One in five of our children are leaving school without the reading, writing and maths skills they need to succeed and they deserve our help right now.

"We know there is huge support among parents for the plain language reporting on their child's progress that National Standards will deliver twice a year.

"This is a bedding-in year and I have appointed an independent technical advisory group which will give me free and frank advice on the implementation of the Standards. In addition to this, the Ministry has put a three year monitoring and evaluation programme in place.

"So any changes that need to be made will be made.

"The NZEI was involved in developing the Standards, and over 11,000 parents and representatives from the education sector were involved in consultation last year.

"The release of a poll which surveyed only 149 parents of primary-age children shows how desperate and out of touch the NZEI is.

"It speaks volumes that a recent Nielsen poll which showed at least 73 per cent support for National Standards among a much larger sample of parents was described as ‘misleading' by the union.

"National Standards are already in place, there will be no trial, and the union knows this.

"Union members are now saying it's time the NZEI moved on from last year's arguments, and focused on helping teachers implement the Standards to benefit all of our children."
