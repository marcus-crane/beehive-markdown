Transport Minister Steven Joyce today met with representatives from the taxi industry to discuss a report from officials recommending that security cameras are made mandatory in all taxis operating in our major towns and cities.

Today's discussion follows a meeting last month in the wake of the death of taxi driver Hiren Mohini in Auckland at the end of January.

Mr Mohini's death was the second of an on-duty taxi driver in 14 months. There were a number of serious assaults in the same period and have been a number of reported incidents since.

"While there are a number of issues to be considered all parties agree that many taxi drivers no longer enjoy safe working environments - particularly at night and particularly in our main centres," says Mr Joyce.

"While I do not want to pre-empt discussions with my Cabinet colleagues, it seems that mandating for taxi cameras in our largest centres would bring the greatest benefits and would be widely supported by the industry.

"The costs of installing and operating the cameras would be met by industry."

Mr Joyce says government cannot justify paying for security for people working in one industry, but not in others. 

The Minister will take proposals to Cabinet in May.

"In the mean time, I urge all taxi companies to reassess their safety measures and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of their drivers, particularly those driving late at night," says Mr Joyce.
