Levin's new courthouse was described as a "triumph of modern architecture" when it was officially opened today by the Prime Minister, Hon John Key.  Speaking at the opening, Courts Minister, Hon Georgina te Heuheu QSO said that "despite having undergone various additions and alterations over the years, the old building simply became too small for today's needs".

"Security concerns arose due to insufficient public areas, courtroom space and secure areas for staff and the judiciary," said Mrs te Heuheu.

The new courthouse consists of two modern and spacious courtrooms, with the main courtroom capable of accommodating jury trials.  The building is fitted with advanced security systems and witness and interview rooms are secure. 

The latest technology for video conferencing and evidence recording has been installed, which Minister te Heuheu says "will improve efficiency and increase access to justice". 

As Levin's community has grown, so too have the pressures on its civic structures.

"Today's opening of the new courthouse is, therefore, quite timely," Mrs te Heuheu said.  

Minister te Heuheu paid tribute to Levin's original courthouse, which has been donated by the Ministry to the Horowhenua District Council.  It had since been lifted from the original site and moved to a permanent resting place in the local Rose Gardens.

Minister te Heuheu said she was particularly pleased to have the Prime Minister on hand today to help open the new courthouse.   

"This courthouse is a building Levin can be proud of, and one I believe will continue to stand the test of time."
