**Āwhinatia ngā kura kia ekengia ngā taumata mātauranga**

Kei te tonoa ngā akoranga rumaki Māori, ngā kaiako me ngā tumuaki kura, tae atu ki ngā whānau, ki te whakamātau, ki te whakatika i te tauira o ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori kua tukuna atu ināianei kia tirohia.

"Kei te hiahia te Kāwanatanga kia tere te kōkiri whakamua o ngā tamariki rumaki Māori, kia matatau rātou ki te kōrero pukapuka, ki te tuhi kōrero, ki te pāngarau; a, mā ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori nei e taea," hei tā te Minita Awhina mō ngā Take Mātauranga, ta Tākuta Pita Sharples.

"Mā te matatau o te tamaiti ki te kōrero pukapuka, ki te pāngarau hoki e rekareka ai ia ki te kura, e hihiko ai te hinengaro, kia pai ai te ako, kia maha ake ai ngā huarahi ki mua i a ia ina mutu te kura," hei tāna anō.

"Kua mahia e ngā pūkenga reo matatini, pāngarau hoki te tauria o ngā whanaketanga rumaki Māori nei, kia mārama ai ngā pae hei eke mā ngā tamariki. Mā ngā whakahokinga kōrero a ngā kura, ngā kaiako, ngā whānau hoki e tōtika ai ngā whanaketanga.

"He rerekē ngā akoranga rumaki Māori i ngā akoranga auraki; he tauhou ake, he whāinga kē, he tikanga kē," tana kī. "He rerekē *Te Marautanga o Aotearoa* hōu kei te whakatinanatia. Ehara i te mea, mā te huri noa iho i te reo ki te reo Māori, e pai ai ngā whanaketanga auraki mō ngā akoranga rumaki Māori."

"Mā te whiriwhiri kōrero me ngā kura rātou ko ō rātou whānau e kotahi ai te whakaaro, he tika enei whanaketanga hei arahi i a tātou ko ā tātou tamariki, mokopuna ki ngā taumata e tika ana mō ngā tamariki katoa."

"Kua tono etahi kura me ō rātou whānau ki te wānanga i ngā whanaketanga rumaki Māori, atu i te marama o Poutūterangi ki te Haratua. Waihoki rā, ka karanga Te Tāhūhū o te Mātauranga kia hui tahi me ngā kura me ō rātou whānau ki te kōrero mō ngā whanaketanga, ā, ka tukuna hoki ngā tāpaetanga kōrero ki te Tāhūhū, ki tōna paetukutuku rānei ki [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/)

Ka oti te tā i ngā whanaketanga rumaki Māori a te marama o Whiringa-ā-nuku. 

**Nga Whanaketanga Rumaki Maori released for consultation.**

Teachers, principals and whanau have been asked to help contribute to new draft National Standards for Māori-medium education programmes, says Associate Education Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

"The government wants to lift student achievement, particularly in numeracy and literacy, and Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori will play a vital role," said Dr Sharples.

"Students need good literacy and numeracy skills to enjoy school, to stay engaged in learning, to leave school with good options, and to succeed in the workforce," he said.

"Draft Ngā Whanaketanga Rumaki Māori were developed by Māori-medium Te Reo Matatini and Pāngarau leaders, and establish clear expectations of progress and achievement. Feedback from schools will enable fine-tuning of the standards.

"The Maori-medium education sector is very different to the English medium sector, and simply translating English standards into Maori will not work. Information gathering will help us ensure the Whanaketanga are set at the right levels and that teachers and principals are well prepared to work with them," Mr Sharples said.

"With the Māori-medium Curriculum *Te Marautanga o Aotearoa* due to be implemented in 2011, this is also a good time for us to work with parents, families, whānau, teachers, principals, and school trustees to ensure the Whanaketanga align to *Te Marautanga*," he said.

"Some schools have sought in-depth workshops on the draft standards. From March to May, the Ministry will also meet with education groups, parents, families and whānau around the country. People will be able to send submissions to the Ministry, or have their say online at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/)," he said.

The standards will be finalised for publication in October 2010.
