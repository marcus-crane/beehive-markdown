Prime Minister John Key has agreed to become Patron of the All Whites for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Campaign.

The offer was extended to Mr Key by the Chairman of New Zealand Football, Frank van Hattum and CEO Michael Glading.

Mr Key says, "Like all New Zealanders, I am enormously proud of what the All Whites have achieved in qualifying for the World Cup.

"It is an honour to be asked to be Patron and I have accepted with pleasure.

"Ricki Herbert and the team have inspired and motivated a whole new generation of footballers and this will pay big dividends for the future of the game in New Zealand."

New Zealand Football Chairman Frank van Hattum says, "New Zealand Football is thrilled to have this support from the Prime Minister.

"This is an exciting time for the players, the public and the game in this country. The groundswell of support from everyday New Zealanders has been amazing and for it now to extend publicly to the highest level of government is huge. 

"The Prime Minister loves his sport and his support is a tremendous boost to our campaign and to growing the sport in New Zealand.''
