Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today launched the Big 6 series of guides to help employers with some of the most common problems they encounter in running a business.

Speaking to Enterprise North Canterbury in Rangiora, Ms Wilkinson said small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been asking for easy-to-read, accessible material to aid them with employment issues for a long time.

"The Department of Labour identified the big areas SMEs said they would like more help with: health and safety, hiring new employees, pay, holidays and leave, performance management and ending employment relationships.

"We have now created checklists aimed at helping employers navigate their way through these areas.

"These are all critical business issues. Getting them right at the start saves problems later on and allows business owners to concentrate on what they do well - employing people and contributing to the economy.

"About 97% of New Zealand businesses employ fewer than 20 staff and usually do not have the specialist in-house human resource or legal services that their larger counterparts do.

"Having easily accessible information that helps them respond to whatever issues arise will make life that much easier."

The Big 6 is available at [www.dol.govt.nz/big6](http://www.dol.govt.nz/big6). The Department of Labour will regularly update its content, ensuring that employers have access to the latest information.
