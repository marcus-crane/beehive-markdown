Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman has put his support behind an evaluation of the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme, which shows significant and increasing gains in productivity in the horticulture and viticulture sectors.

The report, covering the period 2007 to 2009, was released today by the Department of Labour.

It shows productivity gains reported in the scheme's second season together with improvements in harvest quality.

Other findings include:

- Employers in the horticulture and viticulture sectors have greater access to a reliable, stable, seasonal workforce.
- Pacific workers and three Pacific states have benefited economically from participation in the RSE policy along with skill development for workers.

Dr Coleman said the scheme was clearly delivering but also improving over time.

"The Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme is making a positive contribution to a sustainable labour supply in industries which have had many problems securing a consistent workforce in the past.

"We hope stories of apples rotting on the ground for lack of pickers are now a thing of the past."

Dr Coleman said despite the scheme's success it was important to recognise it as very much a "New Zealanders first" policy. 

"The aim is to top up the available domestic workforce, not replace it, and the evaluation report shows that is happening," Dr Coleman said.

The economic downturn has seen more suitable and available local workers looking for employment in the horticulture and viticulture sectors.  As a result, the maximum numbers of Recognised Seasonal Employer workers that can be employed, and the periods of time they can be employed, have been reduced.
