Statements from opposition politicians claiming that the government plans to cut SuperGold Card public transport services is silly political scaremongering, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

"We have made it clear all along that the government is totally committed to the SuperGold Card, including the transport concession as it stands.

"The government will not be introducing any co-payments or any other way of changing those concessions.

"However, we do need to look at ways to control the cost of the scheme as our population ages.

"Areas the government is looking to address include a reduction in subsidy levels for transport operators, reducing the administration costs associated with the scheme and potentially capping the amount of subsidy provided to operators for high-cost, high-use services.

"These possible moves will not affect the gold card entitlements that superannuitants receive.  Any statements to the contrary are scaremongering and wrong.

"As I said yesterday, questions have to be asked as to whether we should be paying $2 million to the operators of the Waiheke Ferry for services they would be largely providing anyway.

"It would be fiscally irresponsible not to test whether the current subsidies provided to operators are greater than what is required to maintain the current concessions.

"The government is committed to controlling costs and supporting frontline services and the SuperGold Card transport concession is no different," says Mr Joyce.
