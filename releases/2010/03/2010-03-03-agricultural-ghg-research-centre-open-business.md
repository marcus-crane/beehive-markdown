Agriculture Minister David Carter, together with Prime Minister John Key, today officially opened the Government's Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre in Palmerston North.

"Today marks a new era for agricultural emissions research - an era of collaboration and results-driven innovation," says Mr Carter.

"This centre will support New Zealand in taking a significant leap forward in meeting the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while increasing productivity.

"New Zealand must meet its international commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and it must support farmers and growers to achieve this through new technologies.

"It is critical that the sector has access to effective and affordable technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions but doesn't compromise our agricultural productivity or efficiency.

"The centre will support the development of exactly these technologies, and is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to responding sensibly to climate change and encouraging science and innovation."

Mr Carter congratulated the centre host, AgResearch and its partners for their efforts in realising the Government's objectives in greenhouse gas research and innovation.

"As a country we have the need, we have the expertise and now we have the channel through which we will meet our commitments and lead the world in pastoral livestock research."

The centre was announced by Mr Carter in June last year. The partners running it with AgResearch are the Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium (PGgRc), DairyNZ, Lincoln and Massey Universities, and Crown Research Institutes Landcare Research, NIWA, Plant and Food Research and Scion.

The centre will receive $5 million of direct government funding each year for the next 10 years.
