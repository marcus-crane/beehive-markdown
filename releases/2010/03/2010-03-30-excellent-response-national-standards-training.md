Education Minister Anne Tolley says schools have rushed to sign up for professional development workshops to support the implementation of National Standards.

"So far 81 per cent of schools have registered for, or participated in the first round of workshops," says Mrs Tolley.

"This is an excellent response and shows the vast majority of schools are getting on with the job of implementing the Standards. 4695 principals and teachers, representing 1759 schools, will attend the first round of training, allowing them to lead the implementation in their own schools.

"Teachers asked for support in implementing National Standards and the Government made $26 million in funding available for this. I'm delighted so many principals and teachers have signed up, especially as the workshops are optional.

"Schools are asking for more workshops on the Standards, and the Ministry will be providing a further round of professional development from Term Two. We expect that at least 7000 principals and teachers will be provided with in-depth training this year.

"Teachers are providing valuable feedback at the workshops, and they will continue to do this through the three year monitoring and evaluation programme, as we strive to lift achievement levels for all New Zealand children."
