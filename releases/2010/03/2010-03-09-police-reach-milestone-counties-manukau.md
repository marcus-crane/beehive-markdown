Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the 200th additional Police officer to Counties-Manukau, and said that extra Police in the district were having a positive impact on crime.

Ms Collins and Prime Minister John Key visited Counties-Manukau Police District Headquarters in South Auckland to mark the milestone and to meet the district's newest Police officers.

The Government has committed 300 additional frontline staff to Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010. The recent graduation of Wing 260 from the Royal New Zealand Police College has seen the number of additional officers deployed in Counties-Manukau rise to 206.

The 200th new officer is Yvette Wiig. Originally from Hawke's Bay, Constable Wiig joined the Police after studying at Massey University. A keen rugby development coach, she will be stationed at Howick.

"I would like to welcome Constable Wiig and graduates of Wing 260 to Counties-Manukau. They will be part of a highly visible, highly trained and highly motivated Police service that is pushing back the influence of criminals in this district," Ms Collins said.

"Nothing deters criminals like plenty of Police on the beat. Increasing the numbers of frontline Police in Counties-Manukau has not only put more officers into neighbourhoods, but it has enabled Police to try new strategies to reduce crime.

"A number of new initiatives, such as Public Safety Teams and Major Crime Teams, were launched late last year and I'm advised that the impact on crime was immediate.

"Early reports suggest that levels of reported crime in Counties-Manukau have dropped in recent months."

As well as the officers in Counties-Manukau, an additional 300 extra frontline officers will be deployed around the rest of the country by the end of 2011.
