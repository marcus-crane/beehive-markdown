The Minister of Local Government, Rodney Hide, has welcomed the release today of the Local Government Commission's decisions on Auckland local board numbers, wards and boundaries.

 "The Commission Chair, Sue Piper, and members Gwen Bull and Grant Kirby had a very difficult job in balancing the different views expressed to them in submissions. They have done a remarkable job over the compressed timeframe that was required under the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009.

 "The Commission is independent of the government, and the results of its consideration show the efforts the Commission made to accommodate the strong views expressed over the consulation period.

 "I am pleased that the Commision has decided to increase the number of Local Boards from 19 in their draft determination to the 21 that have been announced today. This is now within the 20 - 30 range that was provided for under the Act.

 "As Minister I will advise the Governor-General to make Orders in Council to give effect to the decisions."
