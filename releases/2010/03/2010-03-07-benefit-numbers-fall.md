**The number of people**  
**receiving the Unemployment Benefit has dropped by 4,224 over the last**  
**month.**

"That's the single biggest  
drop in the Unemployment Benefit since the recession began," says Social  
Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The number of people on all  
types of benefits has dropped by 10,816 over the same  
period.

Over half of that total  
number, relates to young people on benefits.

"It's really pleasing to see  
5,595 young people came off a benefit in just the last month," says Ms  
Bennett.

"Young people have been among  
the hardest hit by the recession and initiatives like Job Ops and Community Max  
have proven vital in keeping young New Zealanders in work," says Ms  
Bennett.

3,636 position had been  
filled through Job Ops by the end of February, with 2,927 positions filled  
through Community Max

Work and Income has continued  
its work-first approach, using work brokers and its specialised recruitment  
service Job Connect to match people with jobs.

In the last week of February,  
38% of those who came into Work and Income didn't end up needing a benefit.

More than 5000 new job  
vacancies were listed at Work and Income in February, as work brokers continue  
to engage with employers and actively identify  
opportunities.

 "While this is early days  
and the effects of the recession are still being felt; there is light at the end  
of the tunnel," says Ms Bennett.

Regionally the biggest drop  
in Unemployment Benefit numbers was in the East Coast (20%), Auckland (16%) and  
Bay of Plenty (11%).

Good availability of seasonal  
work in areas like Gisborne, Bay of Plenty, Otago and Hawke's Bay is expected to  
remain strong through to April.
