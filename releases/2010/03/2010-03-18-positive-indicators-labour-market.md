Demand for skilled workers is steadily increasing according to latest figures says Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

The Department of Labour's Jobs Online, which monitors job advertisements on the Internet, showed advertisements for skilled jobs increased by 4.6% over the last three months.

The total number of job vacancies advertised increased by 6.6% in the same period.

"This shows employment prospects in the economy are improving but we still have a long way to go; we're not out of the woods yet," says Ms Bennett.

Skilled vacancies have increased most in the service sector particularly in jobs associated with hospitality, IT and marketing.

Jobs Online - along with other economic indicators show firms are still taking a cautious approach to employment and investment and this is likely to show measured increases in employment in the short to medium term.

"We are still expecting unemployment to peak this year, as people's circumstances change and job seekers re-enter the marketplace for a varitey of reasons," says Ms Bennett.

Jobs Online was launched in December 2009 and collates data from New Zealand's leading online advertisers Trade Me jobs, Herald jobs and Seek.
