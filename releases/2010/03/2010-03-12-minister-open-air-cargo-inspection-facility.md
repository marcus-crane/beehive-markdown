A new Air Cargo Inspection Facility at Auckland Airport will be officially opened this afternoon by Customs Minister Maurice Williamson.

"This new facility will enable the delivery of faster examination services as it consolidates Customs' presence at the airport from several locations into one.

"Last year Customs carried out 377 interceptions of drugs and prescription medicines through air cargo inspections. 

"Today marks the enhancement of New Zealand's capacity to prevent illegal goods crossing our border while gaining greater efficiencies in processing both export and import cargo."

This year Customs celebrates its 170th anniversary of protecting New Zealand's border.
