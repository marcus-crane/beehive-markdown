Nine new appointments and seven reappointments across 11 State Owned Enterprises have been announced today by State Owned Enterprises Minister Simon Power.

At KiwiRail, Wellington company director John Spencer has been appointed as chair from 1 July 2010 to replace Rt Hon Jim Bolger.

"Mr Bolger has been a strong leader for KiwiRail since its inception in October 2008, and I thank him for his dedicated service over that time," Mr Power said.

John Spencer has a wealth of commercial governance experience, including successfully leading the merger of Asure and AgriQuality in 2007.  He has also made a valuable contribution to the SOE portfolio as deputy chair of Solid Energy since May 2006. 

"I'm confident Mr Spencer will guide KiwiRail successfully through the challenges ahead."

Mr Spencer will retire from his role at Solid Energy on 30 April to allow him to focus on KiwiRail. 

The other new directors are Dianne Kidd on AsureQuality, John Dell and Rukumoana Schaafhausen on Genesis, Traci Houpapa on Landcorp, Mary Devine on Meridian, Prue Flacks on Mighty River Power, David Willis on NZ Post, and David Patterson on Solid Energy.

"The new directors have a broad range of commercial experience across all sectors of the community, and the economy, and will bring a fresh perspective to the portfolio.

"I'm particularly pleased this round of appointments includes a number of first-time directors, female directors, and directors with strong links to iwi.

"This highlights the National-led Government's ability to attract some of New Zealand's most experienced governance professionals to serve on SOE boards, as well as developing new talent." 

Mr Power thanked the retiring board members for their contributions, and wished them well in their future endeavours.

Full details of the changes, which will take effect between 1 May and 1 July 2010, are detailed below.
