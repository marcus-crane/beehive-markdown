Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has today departed for Mexico to attend the 12th International Energy Forum. 

The International Energy Forum is the world's largest gathering of Energy Ministers, with countries participating in the forum accounting for more than 90 per cent of global oil and gas supply and demand.

The IEF Ministerial is an informal, high-level gathering of Ministers that brings energy producing and consuming countries together to participate in dialogue on global energy matters and to exchange information.  The goal of the meeting is to build confidence around issues such as energy security and develop a better understanding of the underlying energy issues affecting the world.

The International Energy Business Forum will also be meeting in Mexico.  It was established as an associated event to enable Ministers to interact with the chief executives of leading energy companies.

**About the International Energy Forum**

In addition to the International Energy Agency, of which New Zealand is one of 28 member countries, and OPEC countries, transit states and key energy players such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa participate in the forum.

Through the forum and its associated events, Ministers, their officials, energy industry executives, and other experts engage in a dialogue of increasing importance to global energy security.

The International Energy Forum and the global energy dialogue are promoted by a permanent Secretariat of international staff based in the Diplomatic Quarter of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
