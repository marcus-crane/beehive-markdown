New Zealand will make an initial $1 million contribution to help relief and recovery efforts in Fiji following Cyclone Tomas, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Discussions are underway on how New Zealand's contribution can be best used to assist the response in Fiji - this could include a contribution to the Red Cross; the purchase of food and materials, and support for the local response.

"A RNZAF Hercules arrived in Suva this morning carrying humanitarian supplies, including tarpaulins, water containers, and water purification tablets.

"Once the cargo has been off-loaded, the Hercules will undertake aerial reconnaissance of the affected areas, and is also likely to deliver supplies to Labasa.

"New Zealand is continuing to work closely with our partners under FRANZ - the joint France, Australia and New Zealand disaster relief agreement - on assisting Fiji, and the clearer assessments of damage that we are expecting today will further inform the New Zealand and broader FRANZ response," Mr McCully said.
