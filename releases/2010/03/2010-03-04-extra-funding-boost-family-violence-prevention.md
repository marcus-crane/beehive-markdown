Today's announcement of the successful recipients of the Family Violence Whanau Ora Fund is another step towards keeping our whanau safe, strong and free from violence, says Minister Tariana Turia.

The $2 million fund enables existing social service providers to deliver more targeted services to assist in the wellbeing of Maori and Pacific communities.

"This funding will enable the providers to focus on resolving issues of serious family violence at a whanau level, recognising that working holistically and positively with all family members can effect real change," said Minister Turia.

"We were looking for organisations that can build on the strengths of whanau/aiga/families so they can be involved in their own solutions."

The Minister said today's visit to the Pacific Islands Safety and Prevention Project in West Auckland was an opportunity to see first hand how one of the successful providers are working with their community.

"I saw an organisation that builds pride, resilience and personal responsibility, things that I hope all providers would aspire to."

"They are a humble organisation with a huge heart and I am very pleased they are one of the successful recipients."

The Pacific Islands Safety and Prevention Project provide social services for Pasifika families including raising awareness about family violence and injury prevention education.

Minister Turia was particularly pleased with the calibre of social service providers who applied for funding.

Of the 88 applications received, 27 were successful.  Fifteen will have three year contracts while the remaining twelve will receive a one year contract with the possibility of an extension.
