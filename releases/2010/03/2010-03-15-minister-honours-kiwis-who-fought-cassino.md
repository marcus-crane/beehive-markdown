Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins today paid tribute to the Kiwi troops who fought at the third battle of Monte Cassino, which began 66 years ago today.

Ms Collins said that while the battle was a victory for the Allies, it was one of the most costly of the Second World War in New Zealand lives.

During the period 15-26 March 1944 the New Zealand Division suffered nearly 1,400 casualties, including 343 killed in action. Monte Cassino finally fell on 17 May 1944 when the German Army retreated from its positions at the bombed-out monastery.

"The battle was described as four days and four nights of absolute hell as the New Zealanders advanced through the town under a hail of small arms and mortar fire from a determined German defence," Ms Collins said.

"It is difficult for anyone who was not there to comprehend the brutality of this conflict, or the courage of those who won back this strategic stronghold inch by inch.

"The battle was one of the most costly of the war for New Zealand, and has left a legacy of pride at the feats of the New Zealand troops, and bitterness at the claims of tactical errors that cost so many Allied lives.

"We should remember and honour those who served in this battle, whose efforts and sacrifices made such a great contribution to the security and way of life we enjoy today."
