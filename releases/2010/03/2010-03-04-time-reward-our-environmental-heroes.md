Environment Minister Nick Smith is calling for nominations for the 2010 Green Ribbon Awards which honour New Zealand's environmental champions.

"The Green Ribbon Awards acknowledge the outstanding contributions that many New Zealanders make in caring for our environment," Dr Smith said.

"Nominations are open to all individuals, businesses, community organisations, media and public sector initiatives which demonstrate visible results from their commitment to the environment.

"This year marks the 20th year of these awards and they have been refreshed with a stronger focus on practical environmental initiatives that will make a positive difference to the New Zealand environment. There are six categories covering different environmental challenges from land to sea and six categories for different contributions from individuals to large organisations."

The 12 categories this year are:

- Protecting our biodiversity
- Reducing our carbon emissions
- Caring for our water
- Managing our waste
- Improving our air quality
- Protecting our coasts and oceans
- Community action for the environment: Young people
- Community action for the environment: Volunteers and not-for-profit organisations
- Environment in the media
- Small businesses making a difference
- Environmentally responsible large organisations
- Public sector stepping up

"It takes initiative, commitment and dedication to tackle environmental issues.  The Green Ribbon Awards recognise the incredible efforts being undertaken at all levels across the country to address some of the environmental challenges and opportunities that New Zealand faces."

Nominations close on 16 April 2010 with winners announced on 3 June 2010. For more information visit [www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/withyou)  or email [green.ribbon@mfe.govt.nz](mailto:green.ribbon@mfe.govt.nz)
