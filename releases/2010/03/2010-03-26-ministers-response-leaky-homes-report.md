Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has released a Treasury briefing in response to a report commissioned by the North Shore City Council titled 'Contribution to Government Revenue of Leaky Buildings Repairs'.

The North Shore City Council report claims the government will benefit to the tune of over $2 billion from the repair of leaky homes. Mr Williamson strongly disagrees with this conclusion.

"Treasury officials provided advice to the government in December on the impact of repairing leaky homes on GST," Mr Williamson says.

This advice states "expenditure on repairing leaky homes is likely to have no impact on overall GST receipts.  GST is a broad based tax and the money the government, councils and homeowners spend on repairing leaky homes would otherwise be spent on other goods and services elsewhere in the economy.  These goods and services would also be subject to GST so there is unlikely to be any net increase in GST."

Mr Williamson says the same argument applies to other taxes such as personal income tax and company tax.  Any effect would be marginal at best, as the leaky home repairs would crowd out other building and construction work (and other economic activity) that would otherwise have taken place.

Mr Williamson says there is a process underway and the government will report back on that process in due course.
