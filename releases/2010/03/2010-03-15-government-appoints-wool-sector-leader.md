Agriculture Minister David Carter has appointed Dr Murray Horn to lead work towards forming a single body for the New Zealand wool industry.

"The Government is serious about uniting the wool sector and moving it forward. Securing a person of Dr Horn's calibre gives me confidence that progress can be made quickly," says Mr Carter.

Dr Horn has held senior executive roles with the ANZ Banking Group, including as chief executive of ANZ's New Zealand operations, and is a former Treasury Secretary. He is currently on the Board of Telecom and chair of the National Health Board.

Mr Carter says Dr Horn will act as an independent convenor and will be facilitating a meeting of wool sector organisations to begin the process of forming a single voice for the industry.

"I urge all the players to engage constructively in this process. It is a vital step in ensuring the future of the strong wool sector," says Mr Carter.

Dr Horn's appointment follows the release of the Wool Taskforce report *Restoring Profitability to the Strong Wool Sector* to a group of wool sector leaders last month. The report recommended a ‘single voice' be formed to act on behalf of the industry.
