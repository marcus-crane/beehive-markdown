New Zealand Embassy staff in Tokyo met with anti-whaling protestor Peter Bethune last night, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Consular officials are providing updates on Mr Bethune's situation to his wife as they become available. Embassy staff report he is well and continues to be in good spirits," Mr McCully said.

"Mr Bethune has been arrested and charged with trespass. He has legal representation and was due to meet his lawyer last night.

"Consular staff will continue to monitor Mr Bethune's welfare while he is in custody," Mr McCully said.

Sharyn Bethune has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to let media know that she wishes to make no further comment, and asks that her privacy be respected.
