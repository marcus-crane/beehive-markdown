The new Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) for the cranes industry is a great example of Government and industry working together on health and safety, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

"Cranes are often central to the work on building sites and it's important the inherent risks associated with their use are accounted for.

"The Cranes Association has put a lot of effort into developing this code and the Department of Labour has facilitated that expertise. 

"The more that Government, industry, employers and employees work together on health and safety issues the more likely it is that our workforce will go home safe each night.

"Codes of practice make the duties of owners and managers clear and protect workers from unsafe work practices. I want to extend my thanks to those involved in developing this code."

The code features several new developments, including:

- o unit standards for training in the industry,
- o truck loader cranes being brought into the ambit of the code, and
- o the requirements around design verification being clarified and detailed.

The code is available on the Department of Labour website at [http://www.osh.govt.nz/order/catalogue/10.shtml](http://www.osh.govt.nz/order/catalogue/10.shtml).
