Transport Minister Steven Joyce says from next month the aviation security charge paid by out-bound airlines will be reduced by $5 per passenger.

The international security charge will decrease from $15.00 to $10.00 per departing international traveller, while the charge for domestic travellers will drop slightly from $4.66 to $4.35 (including GST).

This is due to significant excess surpluses that have accumulated from the collection of this charge since it was last increased in 2007.  By the end of this month, the excess surplus is expected to be $35 million from international security charges and $6.5 million from domestic charges.

Mr Joyce says this level of surplus is an unfair imposition on airlines and the travelling public and is outside the regulatory guidelines for government fees.

"It's not very often that a government can reduce a charge of this kind, so I'm pleased to have the opportunity with aviation security charges and I hope and expect that airlines will pass most of it on to their passengers.

"These charges are in place to ensure the security of passengers.  While some level of surplus is reasonable, the current over-recovery is much too high. I don't think it's right that travellers pay more than is necessary to keep security measures in place.

"If in the future we need to further strengthen aviation screening, charges may at some point need to increase again.  However, the reduction in charges will still leave a scheduled reserve of $7.5 million in place to meet any unexpected costs in the short term," says Mr Joyce.

A number of factors have led to the high surplus including higher than expected increases in passenger numbers, new airlines entering the aviation market and below-budget expenditure levels.

 "I have full confidence in the service the Aviation Security Service provides, but I want to be assured there are robust measures in place so future over- recovery of charges does not occur," says Mr Joyce.

"For this reason I have also asked officials to do further work examining the efficiency and reasonableness of the costs underlying the passenger security charges and report back to me by the end of the year.

"In addition, the Aviation Security Service has recently completed an operations efficiency review which will shortly be released to industry and feedback on it from its aviation industry partners will be welcomed.

"These changes are not about reducing the level of security at our airports but about ensuring the amount passengers pay is in line with the cost of providing screening and other security services at our airports," says Mr Joyce.

The new charges will take effect from 1 April.
