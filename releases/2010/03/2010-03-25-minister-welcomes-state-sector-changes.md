Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the proposed integration of the National Library and Archives New Zealand into the Department of Internal Affairs.

"As the responsible Minister for all three agencies I believe they share natural synergies. These organisations have a common focus on using digital technology and making government information widely accessible to citizens through the internet.

"Pooling expertise and resources while sharing back office costs will continue to enhance front line services for the public.

"The major roles and functions of the National Library and Archives New Zealand will not change and these important cultural institutions will continue to be trusted and preserved for future generations.

"The independence and integrity of the Chief Archivist, National Librarian and Chief Librarian will be preserved. As the responsible Minister I will continue to receive independent advice from the Archives Council, the Guardians of the Alexander Turnbull Library and the Library Information and Advisory Commission.

"The day after integration occurs, services and functions for the public will be the same as they were the day before.

"I want to acknowledge the staff who have continued to be very professional while this review has progressed," said Mr Guy.

Implementation plans will now be worked on by the relevant Chief Executives.
