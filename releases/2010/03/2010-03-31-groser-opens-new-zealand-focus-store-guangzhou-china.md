Trade Minister Tim Groser today officially opened New Zealand Focus - the first of two New Zealand branded retail stores in Guangzhou, China.

"New Zealand Focus provides a gateway for China consumers to experience a wide range of premium products from New Zealand.

"It will help strengthen and grow trade between China and New Zealand, giving a further boost to trade between the two countries which has seen rapid growth since the Free Trade Agreement took effect in October 2008."

The opening of the Guangzhou New Zealand Focus store follows the success of the New Zealand Focus centre in Hong Kong which New Zealand Trade and Enterprise opened in late 2005.

Located in Tianhe District in Guangzhou, New Zealand Focus has a wide array of New Zealand food and beverage and skin care goods on offer, many of which are new to the China market.

The store is wholly owned and operated by New Zealand Products (HK) Ltd, a Hong Kong registered company which also operates the retail area at the New Zealand Focus centre in Hong Kong.

Mr Groser says that the opening of the Guangzhou store by New Zealand Products sends a strong signal that the private sector sees real value in the New Zealand brand and that it is attractive to Chinese consumers.

"It is very encouraging to see that what began as a government-funded initiative in Hong Kong has now been picked up by a private company. This is great for the New Zealand brand, and great for New Zealand retail products," Mr Groser says.
