Foreign Minister Murray McCully signed a new Air Services Agreement between New Zealand and Turkey during his visit to Ankara today.

"The agreement provides for Turkish and New Zealand airlines to code share on each others services, and on the services of airlines from other countries," Mr McCully said.

"Turkey is a popular destination for New Zealanders. As well as being home to Gallipoli, Turkey is an attractive tourist destination, has a strong economy, and also provides an important alternative gateway to Europe.

"Creating the opportunity for improved air links can only be to the benefit of our two countries.

"An understanding was also reached on encouraging cooperation between the aviation industries of each side in areas such as training, maintenance and airport operations.

"This new agreement will provide a sound basis for developing civil aviation links between our two countries as the relationship grows," Mr McCully said.

Turkish Airlines and Air New Zealand are both members of the Star Alliance. The air services agreement offers an opportunity to expand networks through code share arrangements, should the airlines make the commercial decision to do so.

Under the agreement, New Zealand airlines can serve any point in Turkey, via any intermediate point, and beyond to any other point. Turkish airlines have reciprocal rights.
