Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says Labour is clumsy in opposition and suprisingly unclear about how multiple Ministerial roles work.

"In Parliament today, Labour MPs asked why I, as Associate Minister of Corrections, was not consulted about the three strikes policy.

"The reality is that I was given briefings, I saw Cabinet papers and attended Cabinet meetings as Minister of Maori Affairs," said Dr Sharples.

"In that capacity I have a very close relationship with Dr Sharples as Associate Minister of Corrections and with Dr Sharples the Co-leader of the Maori Party," he said.

"I can address government policy, on behalf of Maori, in a number of Ministerial capacities, and I'm quite happy to sit down and explain to Labour how it works."
