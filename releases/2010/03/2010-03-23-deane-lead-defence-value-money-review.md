The Government's review aimed at providing better value for future Defence spending will be led by former Telecom Chief Executive Dr Roderick Deane, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

The Value For Money review was signalled by Dr Mapp earlier this month. Completion of the Defence White Paper has been delayed until the end of September to accommodate the review.

Dr Mapp said the Value For Money review will examine cost pressures within the Defence Force. It will identify efficiencies, and options to improve cost effectiveness and sustainability.

"The Defence Force is facing significant cost pressures in the coming years. The Government is determined to shift expenditure from the back office to the front line to ensure that Defence remains sustainable over time.

"Dr Deane's wide-ranging experience in the public and private sectors makes him an excellent candidate to lead this exercise," he said.
