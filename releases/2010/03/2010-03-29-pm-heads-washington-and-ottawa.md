Prime Minister John Key leaves for the US next week for the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington (12/13 April).

One objective of this Summit is to focus attention at the highest levels of government on the threat of nuclear terrorism.

"The Nuclear Security Summit is part of the vision laid out by President Obama in Prague to work towards a world free of nuclear weapons.

"This process has been given added impetus with the agreement of a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between Russia and the US in the past few days.

"The START is a positive step forward for nuclear disarmament efforts and sends a strong signal for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in May."

My Key also plans to use the opportunity to have a number of bi-lateral meetings with some of the leaders of 46 countries invited to the Summit.

Mr Key spends two days in Washington before flying to Ottawa for a bilateral visit with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

This is expected to focus on building on the already strong relationships between the two countries.

He will also meet with key Cabinet members and business leaders.

Mr Key returns to New Zealand on 18 April.
