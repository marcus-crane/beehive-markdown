A bill to empower the 2011 referendum on the Mixed Member Proportional Representation (MMP) voting system was introduced to Parliament today by Justice Minister Simon Power.

This bill will legislate for the format of the referendum announced last month, including:

- The questions to be asked of voters. The referendum will ask two questions. First, whether they wish to retain the present MMP voting system, and secondly, what alternative voting system they would prefer out of First-Past-the-Post, Preferential Vote, Single Transferable Vote and Supplementary Member, regardless of how they voted in the first question.
- The conduct of the referendum, including rules around advertising.
- A review of MMP to be held by the new Electoral Commission if more than 50 percent of voters opt to retain MMP. The review will seek public opinion on MMP and report to the Minister of Justice on whether any changes to the MMP voting system are necessary or desirable.

Mr Power said that if a majority of voters opts for a change to the voting system, the Government will hold a second binding referendum in conjunction with the 2014 election, asking voters to choose between MMP and the most preferred alternative.

"I'm pleased this bill has been introduced because it honours the Government's pre-election promise to hold a referendum.

"The public has elected five Government's under MMP and it's timely we re-assess how the voting system is working.

"Once the bill passes its first reading, it will be referred to a newly established special select committee, which will also consider the forthcoming bill implementing electoral finance reforms.

"It's appropriate we set up this committee to focus on these two constitutionally significant bills.

"I welcome robust public discussion during the select committee process."
