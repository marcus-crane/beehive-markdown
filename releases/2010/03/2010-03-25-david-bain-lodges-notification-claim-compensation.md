The Minister of Justice, Simon Power, has this afternoon received a letter from the lawyers for David Bain formally notifying him of a claim for compensation for ‘wrongful conviction and imprisonment.'

Mr Bain was convicted in 1995 of murdering five members of his family in Dunedin. In 2007 the Privy Council quashed his convictions on the grounds of a substantial miscarriage of justice and ordered a retrial. In June 2009 he was found not guilty at a retrial.

"There is a process now to work through and I will not be making any further comment at this time," Mr Power said.
