Local Government Minister Hon Rodney Hide, welcomes the release today by the Auckland Transition Agency of the Discussion Document: Council Controlled Organisations (CCOs) of Auckland Council.

He says that CCOs will strongly support local government transparency and accountability in Auckland. "I am particularly pleased to see that the ATA has recommended that CCOs must take account of the views expressed by local boards as a requirement of the SOI approved by the Auckland Council.

"The Council's Governance and Monitoring Unit will monitor CCOs performance. The role of the Governance and Monitoring unit is similar to that of Central Government's Crown Ownership and Monitoring Unit. This will ensure that CCOs are publicly accountable and transparent in their work," says Rodney Hide.

He says the document sets out the structure of the proposed Auckland Council CCOs that were approved in principle by Cabinet last year. The discussion document also describes the accountability mechanisms that will exist between the new Council and its CCOs.

The CCOs will be accountable to Auckland ratepayers through the Auckland Council.  CCOs will:

- Give effect to the Auckland Council's Spatial Plan and other plans
- Agree their Statements of Intent (SOI) with the Council and make them public
- Report regularly to the Auckland Council, and be audited by the Auditor-General

"The Discussion Document seeks feedback on the assets and activities, structure and responsibilities, accountability and governance arrangements of the proposed CCOs.  I encourage the citizens of Auckland to put forward their views," says Rodney Hide.

Aucklanders can have their say by providing feedback online at [www.discussiondocuments.co.nz](http://www.discussiondocuments.co.nz/) or in writing to Auckland Council CCO Feedback, Auckland Transition Agency, PO Box 99394, Newmarket 1149, Auckland by 26 March 2010.
