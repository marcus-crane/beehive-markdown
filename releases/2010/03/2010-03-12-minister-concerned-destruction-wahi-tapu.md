Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has asked Te Puni Kokiri to work with local people to identify and protect any other wahi tapu at Te Anga, in the Waitomo district.

"My heart goes out to the people of Marokopa Marae over the dynamiting and removal of a sacred rock from the site of a hydro scheme, and I acknowledge the mamae they must be feeling right now," said Dr Sharples.

"The top priority at the moment must be to prevent any further damage. I am pleased to hear a number of parties are working together with the same aim.

"I have also asked my officials to liaise with the marae whanau, iwi organisations and the relevant authorities on protocols and procedures to ensure something like this does not happen again.

"The Historic Places Act and the Resource Management Act provide mechanisms for protecting wahi tapu. It is important that support is in place to allow everyone who should have participated in this matter to do so properly," he said.

Dr Sharples says he will continue to monitor the situation.
