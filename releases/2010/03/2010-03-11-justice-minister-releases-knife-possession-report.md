Justice Minister Simon Power has today released a report on knife possession laws in order to stimulate public debate on the issue.

The Minister ordered the report last month after growing concern about knives.

The Youth Justice Independent Advisory Group, chaired by Principal Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft, has previously raised concerns about the serious harm that exists when knives, alcohol and immaturity are involved.

And, last month a High Court judge expressed concern about people carrying knives without reasonable excuse.

"I am considering all options in the Ministry of Justice report which is aimed at reducing knife possession, and sending a clear signal that carrying knives is not acceptable," Mr Power said.

The report shows that the penalties for knife possession offences are in line with similar offences.

It also shows that police arrests for the offence of ‘possession of a knife in a public place' has remained relatively stable over the past decade.  However, the apprehension rate for the more serious offence of ‘possession of an offensive weapon' (an estimated 19% of which involve knives) has been increasing.

The report goes on to canvass possible options available to the Government,  including:

- Increasing the penalties under the Crimes Act for possession of an offensive weapon.
- Using schools and the Government's Fresh Start programmes to educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives.
- Developing a voluntary accord, involving retailers, local authorities and Police, to limit the sale of knives to young people.

"It's timely we have a debate on knife possession to ensure knife crime does not escalate. I'm very keen to hear what the public thinks about these options and will be monitoring the debate closely," Mr Power said.

"I'm looking at making decisions and taking recommendations to Cabinet in the next six to eight weeks."
