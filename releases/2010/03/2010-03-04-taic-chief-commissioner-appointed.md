Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Mr John Marshall QC as Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC).

John Marshall's appointment is for a five year term starting on 8 March.  He will take over as Chief Commissioner on 1 May after a transition period with the current Chief Commissioner Hon Bill Jeffries.

John Marshall has over 40 years' experience in a wide variety of legal work including litigation, mediation and arbitration.  He will soon retire as President of the New Zealand Law Society, and is chair of the Wellington College Foundation and a member of the Todd Foundation.  He has served in a number of positions on professional organisations, school boards of trustees and various community groups.

"I am pleased to appoint someone of John Marshall's calibre as Chief Commissioner," says Mr Joyce.

"I would also like to thank Bill Jeffries for his 13 years of exemplary service to the Transport Accident Investigation Commission.

"Under his leadership, TAIC has kept pace with rapid advances in safety investigation best practice, and many of its more than 400 investigations have led to fundamental changes to aspects of New Zealand's transport safety systems.

"Bill Jeffries has also made an international contribution to transport safety, including a term chairing the International Transport Safety Association."
