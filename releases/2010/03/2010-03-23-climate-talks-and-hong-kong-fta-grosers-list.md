Trade and International Climate Change Negotiations Minister Tim Groser departs today for an informal climate change meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, before progressing New Zealand's trade agenda in Hong Kong and Southern China.

The "Dialogue for Progressive Action" climate change meeting in Cartagena will bring together a select group of countries to discuss the outcomes from the Copenhagen conference, and how best to progress the climate change negotiations during 2010. 

"We need to find more effective ways of working together this year towards a new climate change framework. This meeting is one of the first opportunities to share views with others on how to achieve this," said Mr Groser.

Mr Groser then travels on to Hong Kong where on the evening of Monday 29 March he will sign the New Zealand Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership (CEP).

"Concluding this agreement represents a strategic milestone for New Zealand and is particularly significant for Hong Kong as its first free trade agreement with any economy outside of Mainland China," said Mr Groser.

"This deal will help New Zealand businesses take further advantage of growing opportunities in the region and help maintain momentum towards New Zealand's wider goal of deeper integration in the Asia-Pacific."

Minister Groser will then travel across the border into Southern China to visit Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Southern China to undertake trade promotion activities in the region.
