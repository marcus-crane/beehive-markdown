Some of New Zealand's most brilliant minds have been honoured in the first annual Prime Minister's Science Prizes, the country's most prestigious and valuable science awards.

Prime Minister John Key today announced the prizes, which have total prize money of $1 million, at the Stardome Observatory and Planetarium in Auckland.

Mr Key says, "Our scientists are doing high quality research in many areas but too often their achievements receive little public acclaim. Today's prizes follow up on a Budget promise last year to raise the profile and prestige of science in New Zealand".

The top award, the Prime Minister's Science Prize, goes to a research team from Industrial Research Limited (IRL) for its world-leading development of high temperature superconducting (HTS) technology.

HTS is a rapidly emerging field that enables the transmission of electricity without resistance or loss of energy.  This allows the manufacture of lighter, smaller, more efficient and more environmentally friendly components and machines.

"IRL's work is an outstanding example of how science can lead to major economic benefits, with HTS estimated to be worth about $80 million a year to the country.

"We see science and innovation as key to lifting our economic performance, and we are determined to increase the profile and effectiveness of New Zealand science."

Other prizes were awarded to the country's top science teacher, a young scientist embarking on scientific study, an emerging scientist at PhD level and a science communicator.

"These prizes help to give science the prestige it deserves. We want to see more young people embark on scientific careers and make a vital contribution to New Zealand's prosperity."

The full list of winners is:

- Dr Jeff Tallon and Dr Bob Buckley, IRL - The Prime Minister's Science Prize. Drs Tallon and Buckley receive $100,000 with a further $400,000 going to IRL.
