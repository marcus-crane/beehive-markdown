Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Chris Moller as the incoming Chair of the NZ Transport Agency.

Mr Moller's appointment is for a three year term, starting on 1 April after a short transition period with the current Chair Brian Roche.

Mr Moller is trained as an accountant. He was chief executive of the New Zealand Rugby Union, deputy chief executive of Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, and a director of a range of joint venture and subsidiary organisations of the New Zealand dairy industry.

He has a portfolio of commercial directorships including being a member of Meridian Energy Ltd, National Foods Pty Ltd, New Zealand Cricket Inc, NZX Ltd, Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd, Sky City Entertainment Group Ltd and Synlait Ltd. He is also a trustee of the Victoria University Foundation and Westpac Regional Stadium Trust.

Mr Joyce says he is pleased to be able to appoint someone of Mr Moller's calibre to chair the Agency, which is critical to the delivery of New Zealand's infrastructure and public transport services.

Given the role and functions of the NZTA, it is imperative to ensure there are strong financial skills and experience on the Board. Mr Roche brought this depth and Mr Moller will do the same.

"I also want to thank Brian Roche for his time as the inaugural Chair of the NZTA.

"Brian's vision and leadership have been instrumental in the successful establishment of the NZ Transport Agency. Brian has helped to establish an agency which is already improving New Zealand's transport systems and providing a more integrated approach to transport planning, funding and delivery.

"Under Brian's leadership the NZTA has continued to effectively deliver the essential services which New Zealanders depend on, while also picking up the new challenges set down by a new government. He can be proud of the NZTA's achievements over the past 18 months," says Mr Joyce.
