Interest in business migration is increasing and a new Immigration New Zealand website will give migrant investors greater opportunities to access New Zealand business networks, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman said today.

Speaking at the New Zealand - Australia Investment Forum in Auckland, Dr Coleman said the website, [www.investmentnow.govt.nz](http://www.investmentnow.govt.nz/), was designed to connect foreign investors to New Zealand business networks quickly and efficiently.

"Research indicates potential investors are seeking more information about investment opportunities, accessing business networks and also their relationship with Immigration New Zealand," Dr Coleman said.

Immigration New Zealand's Business Migration Branch reports that since the introduction of new policies last year there have been 99 expressions of interest lodged by prospective migrant investors.

"This indicates a healthy interest in New Zealand as a business destination, and is substantially greater than anything generated by previous policies," Dr Coleman said.

He told the forum New Zealand needed less restrictive policies to facilitate greater capital flows into the country, which is what the National government had set about providing.

"We also need to bring ourselves closer to world markets and cash in on our competitive advantages," Dr Coleman said.

In 2009 the World Bank ranked New Zealand second globally for ease of doing business, and the country is regularly ranked one of the least corrupt countries in the world.

"These are excellent reasons for migrant investors to come to New Zealand," Dr Coleman said.
