The Government's promise to put 300 Police officers on the beat in Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010 is well on the way to being fulfilled, with the district's 200th recruit now lining up for duty, Prime Minister John Key said today.

Meeting the newest recruits at the Counties-Manukau Police District Headquarters with Police Minister Judith Collins, Mr Key says the boost in officers for the area is already making a positive impact.

"Provisional statistics suggest crime in the region is dropping and, while crime can never be completely eliminated, the feedback the Government is receiving indicates extra officers are making a big difference.

"Business owners and residents in South Auckland are saying they're now seeing more Police and less trouble around their businesses and neighbourhoods.

"The Government believes all Kiwis should feel safe and secure in their homes, workplaces and out in public. One of the most effective ways to achieve that is to ensure we have a highly-visible and highly-effective Police force.

"Already, people in Counties-Manukau are noticing a change for the better, which is a tribute to the skills, enthusiasm and determination of both seasoned officers and our newest Police College graduates."

In addition to the extra officers in Counties-Manukau, the Government is committed to providing the rest of the country with a further 300 Police by the end of 2011, says Mr Key.
