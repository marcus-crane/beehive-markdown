Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced the formation of the Electricity Authority Establishment Board.

The board's job is to set up the Electricity Authority, which will replace the Electricity Commission by 1 October.

Dr Brent Layton, a senior fellow and former chief executive of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, has been appointed as chair.

Dr Layton also chaired the Electricity Technical Advisory Group which undertook the review of the electricity sector last year with the assistance of the Ministry of Economic Development.

Other board members are Simon Botherway, Miriam Dean, Roger Sowry, Peter Harris and David Caygill.

"These skilled and experienced people are responsible for setting the strategic direction for the new Electricity Authority and the development of its operational structure," Mr Brownlee said.

"I'm confident we've assembled the right people to manage a smooth process as we bed in the decisions coming out of last year's ministerial review."

The Establishment Board will be accountable to the Minister of Energy and Resources for its performance.  The appointments run to 30 September 2010 and will commence immediately.  Board appointments to the inaugural Electricity Authority Board will be announced at a later date.

**Background**

Following the 2009 ministerial review into the electricity market, the establishment of a new electricity regulator to replace the Electricity Commission is one of 29 measures the government is implementing to improve the performance of the electricity market.

The objective of the Electricity Authority is to promote competition, reliable supply and efficient operation of the electricity market for the long-term benefit of consumers.  The Electricity Authority will focus on market facilitation, monitoring and rule making.

The Electricity Authority will be an independent Crown entity under the Crown Entities Act.
