Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp has welcomed the planned amalgamation of his Ministry and the Foundation for Research Science and Technology, announced today by the Minister of State Services, Tony Ryall.

"This move complements the strategic direction and priorities for science for the future. It enables proper integration of the work of the Ministry and Foundation," he said.

"The amalgamation is part of the overall strategy around boosting the contribution of science to the Government's economic agenda.

"The Prime Minister has clearly signalled the importance of science in the Government's growth strategy. Science and innovation are at the heart of lifting our economic performance. We must have a high-performing public science system which supports economic growth," he said.

"One of the key issues in the merger is the independence of the contestable funding process. The Government intends that deciding particular grants will be made at arm's length.

"The merger will be a major step in ensuring that public expenditure science

achieves the goals of growth and sustainability," he said.
