The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service's Director, Dr Warren Tucker, has been reappointed for a further two-year term, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Mr Key says Dr Tucker's reappointment will provide leadership continuity for the NZSIS.

"Dr Tucker is a career intelligence officer, and his professionalism is highly respected and regarded by the intelligence and security communities both at home and abroad.

"I am delighted Dr Tucker has agreed to remain in office for a further term. He has redesigned the structure of the NZSIS to improve the ways in which it conducts its business, and has continued to improve its protective security function."

Dr Tucker's reappointment will be effective from 1 November.
