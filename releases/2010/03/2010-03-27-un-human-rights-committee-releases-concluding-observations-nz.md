The United Nations Human Rights Committee has released its concluding observations following consideration of New Zealand's Fifth Periodic Report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The Covenant is the principal international human rights treaty affirming fundamental civil and political rights. 

Justice Minister Simon Power last week presented the report to the committee in New York, fulfilling New Zealand's requirement to report periodically on how the Covenant obligations are being implemented domestically. 

The committee has praised New Zealand's self-critical attitude and constructive engagement with protecting the fundamental rights of its citizens.

In its concluding observations, released today, the committee has acknowledged the quality of the written replies and oral answers during consideration of the report.

The committee has welcomed positive human rights developments in New Zealand, including the adoption of several pieces of legislation.

The committee has also made several recommendations across a range of issues, and has asked the Government to respond to three of them within 12 months.

They are the over-representation of Maori in prisons, issues relating to the Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act, and the review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004.

The Government will respond to the remaining recommendations in its sixth periodic report due to be submitted by 30 March 2015.
