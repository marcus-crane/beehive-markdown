Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples called for wider recognition and adoption of tikanga Maori as a way to improve race relations.

In a hard-hitting speech this evening to commemorate Race Relations Day, Dr Sharples outlined challenges to the government and the public on issues as diverse as Maori representation on the Auckland super-city, the role of tangata whenua in politics, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and immigration.

Speaking at Orakei Marae, Dr Sharples outlined the history of Ngati Whatua's support for the government and the city over 150 years, leading to the loss of their land and and their eventual eviction from Okahu Bay, which the Waitangi Tribunal described as ‘cultural genocide'.

"It is against these events that I regret the decision made by my Government this term that there should be no designated seats for Māori on the new Auckland super-city," said Dr Sharples.

"It seems to me to be poor reward for such a major role played by Ngāti Whatua in ensuring that the city of Auckland could survive, grow, and flourish

"So I feel that the Auckland city seats decision is a missed opportunity, lost to the politics of the day. I am saddened by that course of action," he said.

Dr Sharples said rangatiratanga is often protrayed as exclusive rights based on race, which it is not.

"In order to live as tangata whenua in the land of our tipuna - which they agreed to share with the settlers - our people must maintain their traditional collective relationship with and responsibilities for their natural and cultural heritage," he said.

"Since the signing of the Treaty, the interest of the settlers has had to be taken into account. But public rights cannot be allowed to prevent us living as Māori in our own lands. The guarantee of rangatiratanga protects our customary rights and interests."

He portrayed the agreement between the Maori Party and the National Party as an example of leadership in race relations, but Dr Sharples said it was not always easy.

"I have to admit that while we have a rangatira to rangatira agreement with the John Key led National Government, at times it is very difficult and stressful. The Auckland super-city seats are an example of this," he said.

He indicated the Government's stance on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is another source of tension.

"Minister Simon Power has announced our intention to support the declaration, but as we know this has a number of caveats attached to it. I am dedicated to completing this exercise and to pull back these caveats. I believe adopting the declaration would mean recapturing some of the courage and momentum in advancing race-relations that we lost with the Auckland seats.

However Dr Sharples said progress was being made on recognition of the Treaty partnership.

"We now have a situation where Tribal matters can be seen across all of Government, in almost all of Government service delivery, in fact our tribes have established their own points of contact with central and local Governments."

And while Pacific Island immigrants hade made their mark, and European and South Africans settled in quickly, that was not true of all immigrants.

"Asians, however, we tend to ignore socially, or exclude, and in many cases they are victims of social insults, from our New Zealand cultural arrogance. It is time that we honoured our immigration program, and in the manner of Ngāti Whatua 150 years ago we should make our settlers feel welcome and included."

Dr Sharples suggested the marginalisation of immigrants is an issue that tangata whenua could address.

"To me, personally, I feel shamed at those admissions. I feel it is a role that we must complete - and powhiri our Asian settlers - as a Māori, I feel it is our duty.

"Perhaps, a major event consummating the Asian contribution and acknowledging their presence towards new settlers is another project towards good race-relations," he said.
