The New Zealand Customs Service's office at Opua was officially opened today by Minister Maurice Williamson.

"The Customs Service plays a vital role in protecting New Zealand's border and helps to facilitate trade and travel", the Minister said.

"This new facility enhances Customs' ability to deliver these services with over 65 percent of small craft coming to New Zealand entering the country through Opua."

The site was blessed by Customs' Kaumatua on an occasion which also marked the Service's presence in the Bay of Islands since 1840 when the first Comptroller arrived on "HMS Herald" with Governor Hobson.

This year Customs celebrates its 170th anniversary of protecting New Zealand's border.
