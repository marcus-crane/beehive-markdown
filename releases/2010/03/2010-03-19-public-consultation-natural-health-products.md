The Ministry of Health today launched a two-month public consultation period on a proposed regulatory scheme for the fast-growing natural health products industry.

Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman said the results of the public consultation process will guide the drafting of a Natural Health Products Bill, which is expected to begin later this year.

"I would like to encourage both consumers and industry representatives to take this opportunity to have their voices heard," says Dr Coleman.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed last year, the Green and National Parties agreed to work together on three shared policy initiatives. One of these initiatives is to develop a regulatory scheme for natural health products that will give the public confidence that such products are safe and true to label.

Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says, "I am delighted that at long last we are developing a stand alone New Zealand based regulatory system for natural health products."

Dr Coleman says the current legislation governing natural health products is outdated, inadequate and quite restrictive.

"A regulated industry will give consumers increased confidence about the safety of products. It is expected that providing assurance about the safety, efficacy and quality of the products will also facilitate the uptake of natural health products within the primary healthcare setting," he says.

Ms Kedgley added, "A regulatory scheme will help industry increase sales and expand into export markets."

There are around 450 companies that currently supply some 6,600 natural health products in the New Zealand market. About a third of these companies have a turnover of between $5 million and $20 million, whilst 14 per cent have a turnover of more than $20 million. The rest of the companies have a turnover ranging from $100,000 to $5 million.

The consultation paper on natural health products is now available on the Ministry of Health's website ([www.moh.govt.nz](http://www.moh.govt.nz)). Submissions on the paper close on 17 May 2010.
