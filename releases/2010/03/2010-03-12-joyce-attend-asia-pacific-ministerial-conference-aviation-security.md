Transport Minister Steven Joyce will attend the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Aviation Security on 13 March 2010 in Tokyo, Japan.

The conference is being hosted by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. It is part of a series of conferences scheduled following the attempted terrorist attack onboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on 25 December 2009.

During the conference, the Minister will attend bilateral meetings with his Japanese, American and Australian counter-parts.

The major focus of the conference will be around general aviation security, including the alignment of security requirements internationally, and developments in technology.

Mr Joyce says the meeting presents an opportunity to strengthen security links with other nations.

"When it comes to aviation security and international terrorism, no country is immune. It's important that New Zealand is involved in discussions of this nature and remains vigilant in its approach to aviation security."

The Minister will return to Wellington in time for Cabinet on Monday 15 March.
