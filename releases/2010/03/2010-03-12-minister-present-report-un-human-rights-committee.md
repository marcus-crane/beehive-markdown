The Minister of Justice, Simon Power, leaves for New York tomorrow to present New Zealand's Fifth Periodic Report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.

The presentation takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday, New Zealand time.

"New Zealand takes its human rights commitments seriously, and I look forward to presenting our periodic report to the committee," Mr Power said.

"New Zealand has challenges it must face, especially as we come out of a recession, but we can be proud of our history in human rights and of our efforts to protect the most vulnerable in our society."

The covenant is the principal international human rights treaty affirming fundamental civil and political rights.  New Zealand is required to report periodically on how the covenant obligations are being implemented domestically.

"This is an important occasion where we have an opportunity to engage in a candid dialogue with the committee on the human rights landscape in New Zealand."

Mr Power said human rights were not just rights which people exercised when they were before a court of law, but were also the right to protection of the family, mothers, and children, and the right to an adequate standard of living. 

New Zealand's Fifth Periodic Report is the product of extensive public consultation.
