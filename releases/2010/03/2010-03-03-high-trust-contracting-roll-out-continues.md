Four High Trust contracts signed with community-based organisations, signify a continued fresh approach to the way Government funds social services, says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

"This funding model lets high-performing social service providers get on what they do best - delivering effective services to communities - instead of getting bogged down ticking the boxes and filing endless paperwork for the sake of it," says Ms Bennett.

 The four high trust providers are Te Runanga o Te Rarawa (Far North), Coromandel Independent Living Trust (Coromandel), Life to the Max (Horowhenua) and the Otago Youth Wellness Trust (Dunedin).   

"These providers will benefit from a simpler way of contracting which will see the focus shift to the results actually being achieved for clients and families, and less on compliance and reporting," says Ms Bennett.

Whole of government contracts are for providers with multiple government funders such as the Ministries of Health, Social Development, Education and Justice, Housing New Zealand and New Zealand Police.

The approach to whole of government contracts follows the Ministry's introduction of high trust contracts for Ministry providers, starting with Ngati Awa Social Services Trust in Whakatane and Waipuna Trust in Christchurch.

The Ministry of Social Development expects to have entered into twenty high trust contracts by 1 July 2010.
