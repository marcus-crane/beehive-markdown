State Services Minister Tony Ryall today announced changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government agencies.

"We are looking to future-proof agencies during a time of increased restraint and rising public expectations of service delivery" said Mr Ryall.

"Some agencies are going to need to work differently within their existing baselines to meet those expectations."

The Government has agreed to:

- amalgamate the New Zealand Food Safety Authority back into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
- amalgamate Archives New Zealand and the National Library into the Department of Internal Affairs, and
- amalgamate the Foundation for Research Science and Technology into the Ministry of Research Science and Technology.

The package also includes non-structural changes to lift the performance of State sector agencies and ensure agencies are working together to strengthen cross sector arrangements.

"These changes are part of the Government's ongoing programme to reduce duplication and operational costs, and ensure we have stronger government agencies delivering better public services in the future."

"We are expecting to save up to an estimated $20 million over the next three years including a reduction in staff numbers of up to 55 full time jobs."

The State Services Minister said the changes will be coordinated and implemented over time with costs met from within existing baselines.
