Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is praising the work of the Maori Wardens at this year's Golden Shears.

The annual four day event attracts thousands of spectators and for the second year in a row the Maori Wardens will be assisting the organisers and Police to ensure the event runs smoothly.

"Today I saw first hand what an exceptional job the wardens are doing and how they make such a constructive contribution to the running of a major event.""

"The Maori wardens are an intrinsic part of this community, and it is evident to me just how much they are respected by both locals and visitors to the area."

In addition to the Maori wardens from the Wairarapa more than 25 wardens from Hastings and Gisborne are also assisting at the event and were officially welcomed at Rangimarie Marae today.

Minister Turia commends the Wairarapa branch for the work it has done in coordinating the wardens' presence at Golden Shears.

"I am told the Wairarapa branch has led the way in revitalising their organisation and is a role model for other branches around the country."

"I would like to especially mention Sam Morris and Edwin Perry for their work in pioneering the Maori Wardens relationship with Masterton District Council and the Police."

"This has led to the wardens having their own office base and the Police gifting a van and radios."
