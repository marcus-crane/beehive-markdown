Racing Minister John Carter has today invited nominations for appointment to the New Zealand Racing Board.

The opening of nominations is due to the expiry of a current Board member's term on 31 July 2010.

"The New Zealand Racing Board is responsible for the promotion, organisation and development of the racing industry, and also provides racing and sports betting services through the TAB," Mr Carter says.

"It is necessary for nominees to have expertise in business, marketing and/or economics, as well as a good knowledge of the racing industry.

"Racing is a dynamic business that employs a significant number of people. They look to the Board to lead the industry and facilitate long-term planning that ensures its sustainability.

"New Zealand racing has a rich history, but like many businesses today it is facing challenges attracting participation and competition for the discretionary dollar.

"Board members need both the experience to manage this and the passion to see the racing industry well placed for the future."

An appointment is expected to be made for 1 August 2010. Nomination forms and further details about the Board's membership, functions and powers can be obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs website ([www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz/)) or by phoning (04) 495 7200. 

The closing date for receipt of nominations is **Friday 9 April 2010**.
