Health Minister Tony Ryall has met with the Medical Council to discuss issues which emerged from a case of a suspended doctor.

Mr Ryall says, "The Council told me that processes could be sped up, particularly where things have been held up by a doctor failing to engage properly with the council."

"They also acknowledged that they could be more attentive to providing feedback to the Health and Disability Commissioner on the actions they are taking when they are dealing with complaints."

"I have written to the Council and asked that they look closely at how they deal with doctors who are not compliant with their conditions." 

This includes proactive monitoring of cases to give timely warning of non compliance.
