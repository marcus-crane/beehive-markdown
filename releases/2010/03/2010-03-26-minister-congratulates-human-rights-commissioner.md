Justice Minister Simon Power today congratulated Human Rights Commissioner Rosslyn Noonan on her election as chair of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.

"This is a great honour for Ms Noonan and New Zealand.

"It's both a reflection of her work and of New Zealand's standing in the international community on human rights issues.

"Our 'A' rating on human rights issues is due to the continuing hard work and vigilance of Ms Noonan and others at the commission."
