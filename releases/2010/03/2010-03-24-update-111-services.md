Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has today announced a series of steps being taken to ensure the reliability of 111 emergency call services.

He says the impact of the recent Telecom network outages has highlighted the need for agreed standards for 111.

"I am calling on telecommunications carriers to sign up to the Emergency Calling Code as a matter of urgency."

The code has been developed by the Telecommunications Carriers' Forum, including input from Government. Carriers sign up to the code as a legally binding document and can do so whether or not they are a member of the forum.

"The code provides a good starting point for ensuring the effective delivery of emergency calls by providing minimum standards," says Mr Joyce.

An industry-led voluntary code is preferable to regulation but the Government will be prepared to act if necessary.

"I also call upon mobile network operators to complete a formal arrangement for emergency roaming between their networks, using SOS mode."

SOS mode enables mobile phones to use alternative networks for emergency calling when they are unable to access their own network for technical reasons.

"Because New Zealanders increasingly rely on their mobile phones, we must ensure that they are able to use them to contact emergency services as much as possible."

Officials are actively engaged with the Analysys Mason independent review of recent outages of Telecom's XT mobile network and Telecom's internal investigation of the fault in the Papatoetoe exchange which affected 111 in the early hours of 26 February 2010.

"I will be reviewing closely the results of investigations into recent network outages to assess whether any further action is required to protect the integrity of the emergency calling system", says Mr Joyce.
