Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today that the government will contribute $250,000 from the Major Events Development Fund towards Rally New Zealand 2010 event, being held around Auckland in May.

Rally New Zealand 2010 is round five of the 13-round Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) World Rally Championship, and is the key Asia Pacific round in the series.

"The funding from the Major Events Development Fund will allow Rally New Zealand to present the event in a way that enhances their case to stay on the FIA world calendar for the World Rally Championships," Mr Brownlee said.

Funding will be used for better promotion of the event offshore and to build stronger relationships with key FIA officials and North One Sport - the official global WRC promoter.  It will also be used to upgrade the start and finish ceremonies and develop sections of the Rally to provide better television viewing for international audiences.

The government's support will help meet some operational costs for North One Sport within New Zealand, and provide additional support for some of the more high profile and influential teams during their stay in New Zealand.

"We are very pleased to support Rally New Zealand 2010 as an international motorsport event that does a great job of showcasing New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.

The 6-9 May 2010 New Zealand Rally will be the 40th time the event has been run, making it probably New Zealand's longest-running motorsport series.  This year at least five manufacturers will be represented with drivers from over 25 countries.

"Being based around Auckland will lift the rally's profile and provide access to a large fan base," Mr Brownlee said.
