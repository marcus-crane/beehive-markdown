Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the announcement today of a $168.7 million funding package for the design and construction of the Te Rapa bypass is the first of a number of key milestones on the Waikato Expressway this year.

"Awarding the contract for this project is a vital step in seeing the Waikato Expressway - one of the government's seven Roads of National Significance - delivered on time," says Mr Joyce.

The Te Rapa section of the expressway will provide better access to developing industrial areas in Hamilton and reduce congestion around Te Rapa.

Mr Joyce says construction of the 7.2 kilometre Te Rapa section will create up to 250 jobs directly, with many more downstream.

"Construction will be underway by September, meaning three sections of the Waikato Expressway will be underway by next year - Te Rapa, Rangiriri and Ngaruawahia."

The NZTA has also released a summary statement on the Waikato Expressway outlining the implementation plan for the completion of the entire route.

"The Waikato Expressway is made up of 10 sections which when complete will deliver around 100 kilometres of new or improved state highway in a divided four-lane expressway," says Mr Joyce.

The sub-projects are as follows:

"National made a pre-election commitment to have the Waikato Expressway completed within ten years of National taking office," says Mr Joyce. 

"There is a long way to go and it's a big challenge but we remain committed to this goal in government and we're one big step closer today."
