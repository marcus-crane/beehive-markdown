Changes to Land Transport, Maritime and Marine Protection Rules coming into force on 1 April will simplify regulations without compromising safety, says Transport Minister Steven Joyce.

"The new rules are examples of simpler, more practical and more effective regulation. They meet the aim of achieving good standards of safety while reducing compliance costs as much as possible."

Mr Joyce says bringing together a package of Rules starting on the same date of 1 April is a more straightforward approach for affected industries and the public.

"It means they don't face the task of trying to keep track of new requirements scattered throughout the year. It also makes it easier to manage publicity and education on the new Rules."

The government intends as much as possible to ensure that new rules are introduced on either 1 April or 1 October.

Mr Joyce says the new and amended Rules show the benefits of incorporating useful feedback, introducing greater flexibility and removing unnecessary restrictions.
