New Zealand has signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with Dominica and with St Vincent and the Grenadines, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced.

"TIEAs are important bilateral international treaties that allow tax authorities in the participating countries to exchange information on civil and criminal matters and are an important benchmark for offshore financial centres in meeting OECD standards for transparency and the exchange of information," Mr Dunne said.  

"The latest agreements bring the number of TIEAs New Zealand has entered into to 15.

The two new TIEAs will come into force once New Zealand and the treaty signatories give legal effect to them.
