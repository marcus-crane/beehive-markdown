Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announces the appointment of Carl Davidson as Chief Commissioner for the Families Commission.

"I am delighted Mr Davidson will lead the Families Commission and I am confident he will provide clear direction and a fresh vision," says Ms Bennett.

Carl Davidson is a recognised leader in the field of social research, practise and theory, who is widely published.

As a sociologist he has an ongoing interest in social change and social issues and is committed to family issues in particular.

"The Families Commission must provide relevant information that informs us about the issues families' face, so policies can be better geared towards those needs," says Ms Bennett.

"I believe Mr Davidson has the skills, experience and the understanding to ensure we get the best out of the Commission," says Ms Bennett.

Commissioner Bruce Pilbrow has been acting Chief Commissioner since Jan Pryor resigned in March.

"I am very grateful to Bruce Pilbrow who stepped up when he was needed and has done a fantastic job," says Ms Bennett.

Bruce Pilbrow will return to his previous role as a Commissioner.

"Mr Davidson has a strong team behind him, they have my full support," says Ms Bennett.

"My clear expectation is that Mr Davidson will provide the leadership necessary to make the Commission an expert centre of quality family research, which can be used to inform Government policy," says Ms Bennett.

The appointment of Chief Commissioner runs for three years.
