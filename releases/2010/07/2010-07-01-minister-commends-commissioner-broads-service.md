Police Minister Judith Collins today commended the service of Police Commissioner Howard Broad who will not be seeking another five-year term in the role.

"Mr Broad brought to the role an understanding of frontline Policing honed from years on the streets, strong  intellectual, organisational and technical knowledge, and a desire to modernise Police," Ms Collins said from Canberra where she is attending a meeting of Australian law enforcement Ministers.

"He has many notable achievements, particularly the rewriting of the Police Act 1958, the establishment of the Electronic Crime Laboratory and he has worked to ensure Police continue to be one of this country's most trusted institutions.

"As his watch draws to a close, the New Zealand Police are better trained, better equipped and better able to tackle crime than at any other time."

Mr Broad joined Police as a Constable in 1975. He served in uniform and as a detective for 18 years before joining Police National Headquarters in Wellington.

He was appointed Commissioner in 2006 for a five-year contract which ends in April 2011.

"Police Commissioner is an incredibly demanding job and that requires an enormous commitment. I fully respect Mr Broad's decision to not seek a further five-year term," Ms Collins said.

"I would like to thank Mr Broad for his considerable contribution to the New Zealand Police and wish him the very best for the future."
