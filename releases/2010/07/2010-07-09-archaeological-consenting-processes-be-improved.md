The process for getting approval for archaeological consents will be made faster, simpler, and more efficient, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

"Currently, obtaining consent can be complex and time consuming," Mr Finlayson said. "We have reviewed the Historic Places Act and identified several opportunities to streamline the consents process, and align it with the Resource Management Act," Mr Finlayson said.

"This will result in a significant reduction in time and an improved process for those seeking permission to carry out work which affects archaeological sites. The level of protection for archaeological sites will remain the same."

The key changes are:

- a streamlined application process;
- shorter processing timeframes, aligning applications under the Historic Places Act with comparable timeframes for resource consent applications;
- removing the need for assessments of archaeological effects where the New Zealand Historic Places Trust agrees these are minor, saving an estimated $1,000 - $3000 per application;
- involving the Trust's Māori Heritage Council in all applications of interest to Māori;
- requiring the Trust to consult on and publish policies for administration of the archaeological provisions of the HPA.

The review was carried out by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage as part of a wider review of the Historic Places Act 1993.  A bill incorporating these changes is expected to be introduced into Parliament later this year.
