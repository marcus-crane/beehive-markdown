A call has gone out for rangatahi Māori to be nominated to a national Māori Youth Council, to advise the Minister of Māori Affairs on issues affecting young people.

"I'm looking for 12-15 representatives from across the country and a range of iwi, who are active in their communities, interested in Māori affairs and have strong leadership skills. I want them to meet every couple of months as a Māori Youth Council, to give me and my department practical advice and feedback on issues affecting rangatahi Māori. I will also chair quarterly meetings with the Council" said Dr Sharples.

"The Māori population is younger than the national average, so rangatahi are an important part of our society and we need them to play a full part in planning our future," he said.

"I want to hear directly from young people what they think about how the Government's policies and programmes work for them; and I hope the experience of working with the Maori Youth Council will further develop their leadership skills.

"It will be an open invitation process. I have also asked Te Puni Kōkiri to seek nominations from a wide range of community groups, universities, iwi and hapū. I want a broadly representative group".

If you know someone aged 18 to 25 who you think might be a good representative for their community, go to [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/)  for a form and get your nominee to fill it out, or contact your local Te Puni Kōkiri office. Deadline is 30 July 2010.
