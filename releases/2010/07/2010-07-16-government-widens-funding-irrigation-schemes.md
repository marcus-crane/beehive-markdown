Agriculture Minister David Carter today announced changes to the Community Irrigation Fund to help fast track the development of agricultural irrigation schemes.

"Accelerating reliable and environmentally sound irrigation to secure access to fresh water is one of the most obvious ways to boost primary sector growth," says Mr Carter.

The Government is extending the scope of the Community Irrigation Fund to speed up and improve the management of irrigation scheme developments and reduce costs.

"While the size of the fund remains the same, its eligibility criteria will widen to cover the funding of technical design work for irrigation schemes and training for scheme developers in areas such as financial management and community and local government management skills," says Mr Carter.

"What won't change is the need for applicants to demonstrate very sound environmental standards and processes.

"Access to fresh water is vital for growing our primary industries but getting an irrigation scheme off the ground is a complex, time consuming process.

"The Community Irrigation Fund plays a key role in supporting local communities and regional councils to develop irrigation schemes and water strategies."
