Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is congratulating Claire Szabo for being named Young Executive of the Year for the central region by the New Zealand Institute of Management.

Claire Szabo is the chief executive of English Language Partners New Zealand, an organisation that works with migrants and refugees.

Operating in 23 locations throughout the country, the organisation delivers English language tuition and settlement support to adult refugees and migrants.

"This is a fantastic result for not only Claire and English Language Partners New Zealand but also the non-profit sector as a whole."

"Working in the non-profit sector is sometimes seen as a soft option by some but it is a perception that people have been working a lot to change over the past 10 years.

"Working with the range of ethnic communities that English Language Partners New Zealand works with requires a high-level of skill and knowledge."

"It is great to see that a young chief executive of such an active non government organisation being recognised alongside her peers."

"Claire is a very hard working and focussed individual who has brought about a lot of organisational change since coming into her role."

"I have no doubt that this young woman will continue to develop her leadership skills."
