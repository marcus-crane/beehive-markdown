Audience and performance information for broadcasting entities receiving Crown funding is now available online at one easy to access site says Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman. 

"The aim is to create a one-stop information shop for the New Zealand viewing and listening public that transparently presents ratings and performance information gathered by state funded broadcasters," Dr Coleman says.

"It is important the public can get an overview of what projects are being funded, and how many people are watching or listening. This government promised transparency, accountability and competition in the broadcasting arena.

"The website will deliver the regular publication of rating, audience and household penetration data for any broadcasting entity receiving state funding."

The publicly funded broadcasting entities are NZ On Air (which funds Radio New Zealand), TVNZ, Freeview, Maori Television, National Pacific Radio Trust (Niu FM and 531pi), Radio New Zealand International and the Broadcasting Standards Authority.

The information will be updated twice a year in May and November on the Ministry of Culture and Heritage website. To view the latest information visit:
