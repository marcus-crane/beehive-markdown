A new website helping connect volunteers with event volunteering opportunities has gone live today, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia and Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee.

VolunteerNet provides a free online volunteer recruitment and management tool for event organisers as well as giving people who want to get involved easy access to volunteering opportunities.

"Volunteers are an important part of our community and the VolunteerNet website will enhance the capability of the events sector, making it easier for New Zealanders to get involved in volunteering and help promote volunteering in general," says Mrs Turia.

"Volunteers play a key role in the success of any event, big or small and the high profile of events like Rugby World Cup 2011 will put volunteering in the spotlight like never before," says Mr Brownlee.

VolunteerNet aims to encourage more New Zealanders to get involved in volunteering, providing long lasting benefits for both the community and the events sector. It is about binding our communities' together, te taura here tangata," says Mrs Turia.

"We encourage anyone who wants to get involved in volunteering, or who needs volunteers to help make their event a success, to visit and register on VolunteerNet," says Mr Brownlee.

VolunteerNet was created by New Zealand Major Events, which is part of the Ministry of Economic Development and is based on ‘VolWeb' technology developed by 2010 Legacies Now, a Canadian not-for-profit organisation established to create community legacies from hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.
