Customs Minister Maurice Williamson will meet with officials from US Customs and Border Protection over the next two days while he is in the United States.

"This is a valuable opportunity to continue to improve the efficiency and security of New Zealand trade and travel with the United States," Mr Williamson says.

"The United States is a significant export destination for New Zealand.  They're our third largest trading partner and most important individual country market for agricultural exports," he says.

Mr Williamson will visit US Customs and Border Protection facilities in San Diego and Long Beach, including visiting the US-Mexico border at San Ysidro. He will also meet with several US Customs officials over the next two days before returning to New Zealand.

"New Zealand Customs enjoys a close relationship with the United States, which is recognised in our trusted trader status. This allows New Zealand exporters quicker access for their goods into US markets."

New Zealand is one of only five countries that has been awarded trusted trader status by the United States. The others are Canada, Japan, South Korea and Jordan.

"This is my first chance to meet with US Customs and Border Protection officials since the two countries signed a treaty-level agreement known as the science and technology agreement in January," he says.

"The agreement focuses primarily on science and technology issues and provides a basis for broader cooperation on Customs matters between our two countries."

Mr Williamson was in the United States to present at the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) International Users Conference in San Diego last weekend. This is one of the largest geographic information system conferences in the world.
