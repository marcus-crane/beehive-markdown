Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman today announced further progress in providing a new regional eating disorders service for people in the top half of the North Island.

Auckland DHB has contracted Challenge Trust to establish a day clinic and residential treatment facility by the end of the year. 

Mr Ryall said "The new services are the result of an extra $26 million funding this government announced last year to improve eating disorder services nationwide."

"We inherited a situation where there was next to no inpatient or residential care for people seriously ill with eating disorders in the northern region. As a result, many families were having to go to Australia for treatment" said Mr Ryall.

Dr Coleman said "Starship hospital established five new dedicated beds for children under15 years with eating disorders last year as part of this extra funding.

The new facility will eventually include up to 9 residential beds available for adolescents and adults and will provide a home- like environment for patients, where they can spend time with their families.

Patients from Northern and Midland region DHBs will be eligible to use these services.

"This is a good example of DHBs working together regionally for the benefit of their patients" said Dr Coleman.
