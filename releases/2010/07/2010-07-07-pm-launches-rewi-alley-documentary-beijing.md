Prime Minister John Key today announced the release of a five-part documentary series about New Zealand author, poet, and humanitarian Rewi Alley, produced jointly by Natural History New Zealand (NHNZ) and China's CCTV.

The opening broadcast coincides with Mr Key's visit to China, as part of a trip to strengthen ties across the Asia region.  It will premiere July 9, New Zealand's designated ‘national day' at the Shanghai Expo.

"This is a great opportunity.  Rewi Alley is hugely popular in China, and New Zealand continues to gain significant benefits from his status as a well known and highly respected figure," says Mr Key.

Rewi Alley spent nearly sixty years in China, working to improve the lives and living conditions of millions of people.  In doing so, he established a reputation for New Zealanders as practical, hard working, and honest people. 

"China is our second largest trading partner, an important source of investment, and a growing consumer of services such as tourism and education.  Reinforcing the positive image of Rewi Alley to a combined audience of more than 300 million can only help strengthen our relationship further."

The Asia-Pacific is also expected to be the fastest-growing region for global entertainment in the next five years, with China leading much of that trend.

"This collaboration will provide momentum for a Film Co-production Agreement with China, delivering substantial commercial opportunities for the New Zealand film and television industry."
