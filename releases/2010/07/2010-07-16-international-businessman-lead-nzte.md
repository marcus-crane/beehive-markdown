Minister of Economic Development Gerry Brownlee and Minister of Trade Tim Groser have announced the appointment of Peter Chrisp as chief executive of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE).

Mr Chrisp is currently based in Sydney as regional president Australia for major multinational Norske Skog and will move to Wellington to take up the role of NZTE chief executive effective 23 August 2010.

Mr Brownlee said that in seeking a new chief executive the government and the NZTE board were looking for an outstanding leader with the vision, energy and aspiration to lead NZTE in enabling the success of New Zealand businesses in export markets around the world.

"It was important for us to take the time to appoint the right person for the job, and that meant an international search," Mr Brownlee said.

"The board has appointed Peter because he has the combination of export and international business experience, strategic leadership capability, commercial acumen, and political insight to work with NZTE's diverse national and international stakeholders.

"He is an experienced exporter and his work globally has exposed him to major projects across the public and private sector."

Mr Chrisp's international business career spans more than 20 years in the engineering, manufacturing and pulp and paper industries.  He worked his way through the management ranks at Fletcher Challenge Paper (which was then purchased by multinational Norske Skog), for whom he worked initially in New Zealand, then at headquarters in Oslo, and more recently in Sydney.

Mr Groser said Mr Chrisp would bring a wealth of experience and expertise to NZTE. 

"Peter brings an international perspective, export experience and a clear understanding of the need to harness New Zealand's potential.

"He is a committed New Zealander, is passionate about New Zealand business and has an excellent understanding of New Zealand's position and international economic aspirations.

"He is also personable and engaging, and is somebody we are confident will be able to lead and inspire staff to continue the work that led to NZTE winning the World Trade Promotion Award in October 2008."

Mr Chrisp replaces founding chief executive Tim Gibson who left in December 2009.
