Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the start of the tender process for the construction of the Waterview Connection, part of the Western Ring Route - one of the government's seven Roads of National Significance.

He says this is a very important step towards unlocking the benefits that the completed Western Ring Route will bring to Auckland and the whole country.

The NZ Transport Agency today announced the approval of up to $2 billion to complete the Western Ring Route and called for tenders for the construction of the Waterview Connection.  This extension of SH20 (including the tunnel construction) will form the last new section of the Western Ring Route, creating 48km of continuous motorway as an alternative to SH1 through central Auckland.

"This is the largest and most complex single roading project ever embarked upon in New Zealand and there has never been a better time to let the contracts given industry capacity domestically and internationally," says Mr Joyce.

The tender process will run in parallel with the consenting process, using the provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Running these two processes in tandem will save time and money, helping the Agency get the best value for money from this work and complete the improvements as quickly as possible.

Mr Joyce says the completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

"It will also contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore."
