The Government is investing $4.44 million through TechNZ in advanced cyber security technology research by Auckland firm Endace Ltd.

"Endace is an emerging leader in cyber security technologies," said Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp.

"It is an excellent example of the type of company that will drive economic growth.

"Endace spends more than 20 per cent of its revenue on research and development. The TechNZ investment will accelerate this, allowing the creation of more top R&D jobs in New Zealand.

"These are the kinds of jobs in the high-tech sector that bring highly-skilled New Zealanders home from overseas," Dr Mapp said.

 "Cyber security is of increasing importance to organisations whose networks carry sensitive commercial and government intelligence.

"This area is a growing niche for New Zealand companies such as Endace who have access to Western markets," he said.

Based in Auckland, Endace also has of­fices in the UK and US. The firm employs 98 staff in New Zealand, many in research and development.

The TechNZ funding is for 50 per cent of the cost of a series of substantial product developments over the next two years.
