Commerce Minister Simon Power today tabled in Parliament the Government's response to the Commerce Select Committee's report on the petition of John Dickson.

The response follows an independent report by Peter McKenzie QC into issues relating to the select committee's recommendation that the Government consider making an ex gratia payment to Mr Dickson.

The Government was asked by the select committee to consider an ex gratia payment in recognition of events that contributed to Mr Dickson's loss of opportunity to pursue his legal rights regarding a Commerce Commission merger clearance determination in 1986.

"Mr Dickson's petition has a long and complex history, and the Government has given the issue careful consideration by seeking independent legal advice," Mr Power said.

"In light of this advice, the Government will not be making an ex gratia payment to Mr Dickson.

"Mr McKenzie found that though the Commerce Commission might have failed in one aspect of this matter, that failure was not exceptional.  Therefore, the Government does not think an ex gratia payment would be appropriate."

The Government's final response, along with Mr McKenzie's report, is available on Parliament's website - [www.parliament.govt.nz](http://www.parliament.govt.nz/)
