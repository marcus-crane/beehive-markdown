Minister of Trade Tim Groser welcomed a NZ$20 million international investment into Auckland healthcare company Atlantis Healthcare.

White Cloud Capital, which announced its investment today is backed by leading industrial families from Europe, India, North Asia and Australasia. 

Atlantis Healthcare develops innovative support programmes to help patients adhere to their prescribed course of treatment. It has offices in New Zealand Australia and the UK, and employs 120 people.

Mr Groser said the investment will help Atlantis expand quickly in the international marketplace. "It's a good news story and a signal that the world is now recognising New Zealand's innovative achievements in health and health technology"

New Zealand has pioneered advances in many areas of healthcare technology, ranging from leading electronic medical records, ground breaking medical devices and biopharmaceutical products to software and information technology (IT) solutions. 

"We are building an international reputation for quality and innovation in this arena"

"For example, over the past few months, Orion Health has secured major projects in Europe, North America and the Middle East against strong global competitors."

In addition to Atlantis and Orion, there are a number of other New Zealand health and technology companies making an impact internationally including the likes of Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Emendo, Intrahealth and Mesynthes.

It is fantastic to see these international wins Mr Groser concluded.
