Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy today completes her visit to the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) troops on deployment in Timor-Leste, returning to New Zealand this weekend with a deeper insight into the work that NZDF personnel are doing and the high regard in which they are held.

"The feedback I have received during my visit is a testament to the dedication and professionalism displayed by New Zealanders - NZDF personnel, Police and others - while deployed in Timor-Leste," Mrs Roy said.

"While the focus of this visit was on observing and meeting with NZDF personnel it also provided an opportunity to meet with New Zealand Embassy staff, the New Zealand Police contingent and other members of the UN in Timor-Leste.

"I also attended a service to lay a wreath at the memorial to Private Leonard Manning, killed in action almost 10 years ago to the day, while on patrol with his unit near Tilomar in the Cova Lima District of Timor-Leste.

"All of this has served to reinforce my knowledge that our troops are performing in an exemplary manner; as fine ambassadors for New Zealand they are respected and well-liked by other UN personnel and the local population.

"I'm returning to New Zealand with a much greater understanding and appreciation of the efforts that our troops are making in, what is, the newest member of the Southeast Asian community," Mrs Roy said.
