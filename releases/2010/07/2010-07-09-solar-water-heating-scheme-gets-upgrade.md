Grants to assist households to invest in solar water heating will continue under a new programme which will also include heat pump water heaters, Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"The government is helping New Zealanders reduce their electricity and gas costs by investing in technology to improve energy efficiency.

"Solar water heating is an investment that pays itself off through lower energy bills over time," Mr Brownlee said.

"This new programme is designed to get the greatest value for money, by giving the highest grants to those solar water heating systems that save the most energy.

"All systems need to meet stringent standards, but grants will be either $1000 or $500, depending on the system's performance rating, and whether it measures up to the very latest industry standards.

"This will build on work to date with the solar industry to further improve standards for product quality and installation."

Grants will also be made available for heat pump water heaters, Mr Brownlee said.

"Heat pump water heaters are another efficient form of water heating, now available in New Zealand.  They will be eligible for the same grants, once sufficient data has been collected to calculate their performance levels."

Water heating grants are administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). 

"Water heating makes up around 30 per cent of the average household's energy use, so investments in greater energy efficiency can really help reduce on-going energy bills," Mr Brownlee said.

The new programme will come into effect for solar water heating on 1 September 2010, when it will replace the current solar water heating programme, which ends on 31 August 2010.   Grants for heat pump water heaters are expected to be in place before the end of the year.
