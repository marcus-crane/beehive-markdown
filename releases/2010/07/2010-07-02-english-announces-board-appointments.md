Finance Minister Bill English has appointed new members to the boards of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation, the Crown Forestry Rental Trust (CFRT) and National Provident Fund (NPF).

Former Bankers Trust chief executive Gavin Walker joins the board of the Guardians, Wellington barrister Guy Royal joins the board of the CFRT and chartered accountant Graeme Mitchell joins the board of the NPF.

"These individuals bring a range of relevant expertise to these boards and I'm confident they will make a strong contribution," Mr English says.

Mr Walker has a lengthy financial market and funds management background both in New Zealand and Australia.

Mr Royal is a Wellington-based barrister and solicitor with over 13 years experience as a commercial lawyer. He is currently a partner and director of Tuia Legal, the legal division of Tuia Group Ltd.

Mr Mitchell is a chartered accountant and was formerly with Deloitte, Wellington where he was an Audit and Assurance Partner for over 28 years.

Mr English also announced the reappointment of Angela Foulkes to the CFRT Board. Ms Foulkes has served on the CFRT Board since April 2001, and has been reappointed for a term of two years.
