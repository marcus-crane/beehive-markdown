Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully is comfortable with the Auckland Regional Council exploring options that involve moving and protecting Shed 10 at their cost, so long as they do not risk the Government's plans for an appropriate entertainment venue during the Rugby World Cup.

"It is frustrating that the sheds that the ARC regarded as 'old and cheap and nasty' are now the subject of last-ditch attempts to change course," Mr McCully said.

"The Mayoral Forum and others made it very clear that they wanted no decisions made in haste that would compromise the long-term strategic vision for the development of the waterfront.

"However, if the ARC wishes to take steps to move the sheds in order to protect any heritage value until such time as the new Waterfront Development Agency takes over, I have made it clear that I am open to that.

"In saying that, I absolutely insist that nothing will put at risk the provision of suitable facilities on Queens Wharf, at reasonable cost and on time, to support a world-class Rugby World Cup event in New Zealand next year," Mr McCully said.
