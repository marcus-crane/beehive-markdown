Justice Minister Simon Power today thanked all political parties for their contribution to a bill which enables greater use of video links in courts.

Mr Power told Parliament during the third reading of the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill, which was passed unanimously, that the use of AVL will help to simplify and speed up the criminal justice system.

"Video links will minimise some of the costs and risks associated with transporting prisoners, at the same time as making the justice system more efficient and effective.

"Initially, the use of audio visual links is likely to be focused on procedural matters.

"However, after listening carefully to the debate over recent days I was persuaded that more explicit protection is needed for the appearance of a defendant at their actual trial.

"Last night I tabled an amendment which states that video links cannot be used for the appearance of a defendant in a trial to determine his or her guilt or innocence, without the defendant's consent.

"This change means it is the defendant at a substantive trial who will decide if they wish to appear by video link."

The Government has committed about $2 million over the next year to have video link facilities installed in courts and prisons.

The Ministry of Justice anticipates that by 2014 some of the country's busiest courts could each see up to 2,000 remand prisoner appearances by video link every year.
