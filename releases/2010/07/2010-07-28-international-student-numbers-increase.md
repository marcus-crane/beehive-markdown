There has been a 7% rise in the number of fee-paying international students for the first four months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, says Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce.

This increase follows on from the rise in international students in 2009, when 93,505 students were enrolled. The 6% rise in 2009 was the first annual increase in international student numbers since 2003.

Mr Joyce says he will be talking with the sector in the coming months about what can be done to continue to grow the international sector to New Zealand's benefit in a responsible and sustainable way.

"International education contributes more than $2 billion in total to our economy each year - further development of the sector will bring real benefits in terms of economic growth plus additional income to allow our tertiary institutions to grow."

There was a10% overall growth in revenue from international fee-paying students during 2009, totalling $664 million.

Private training establishments' numbers were up 8% for the period, to 21,776 enrolments. Public tertiary education institutions reported a 7% increase in their enrolments - driven mainly by the polytechnics, which were up 15%. The eight universities reported a 4% increase in their international student numbers.

Primary schools reported a 6% increase in student numbers, to 1,959 compared to 1,843 during the same period in 2009. Secondary schools reported a 4% increase, to 9,558 students, so the overall increase in school enrolments was around 5%.

"International students add to the broader understanding of other cultures in schools," says Anne Tolley.

"New Zealand students learn as much from their foreign classmates as the international students do about this country.

"It's great that our education system is so highly regarded overseas, and that parents trust us to educate their children."

International students currently make up around 13% of the student roll in New Zealand universities, compared to an average of more than 20% in Australian universities.

Mr Joyce says if we want our universities to successfully compete for the top academic talent with Australia and other comparable countries, then they will need to keep developing all their revenue streams.

"While government investment in the tertiary sector in this country is high by international standards, fee income received from international students is low. 

"If universities grow their income from international students to levels approaching the levels of Australian universities, then the experience for all students will be enhanced," says Mr Joyce.
