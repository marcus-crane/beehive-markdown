Transport Minister Steven Joyce says tougher penalties for drivers causing death recognise the serious nature of these crimes and will make our roads safer.

Cabinet has today agreed to strengthen penalties for the following offences:

- Drink / drug driving causing death
- Dangerous / reckless driving causing death
- Illegal street racing causing death
- Failing to stop after a crash when someone is killed.

"Officials have reviewed penalties for these offences and found they are low when compared with other crimes. The public have also expressed this view," says Mr Joyce.

The maximum prison term for dangerous / reckless driving causing death will be doubled to up to 10 years in prison.

"With imprisonment penalties for these offences last reviewed in 1962, these changes are well overdue. Tougher sanctions will bring these penalties in line with other similar serious offences and with penalties in other jurisdictions".

Charges of manslaughter or murder would remain as an option for Police in cases that warrant them.

Mr Joyce says these changes will ensure offenders are dealt with appropriately when they drive recklessly and cause the death of another New Zealander.
