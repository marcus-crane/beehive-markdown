Housing Minister Phil Heatley today announced new appointments to the State Housing Appeal Authority, including the appointment of Marilyn Wallace as Principal Member. 

"Ms Wallace is an experienced tribunal chair.  She has a wealth of experience in tribunal work with a wide range of people and issues," Mr Heatley says.

Ms Wallace is currently a barrister sole in Wellington and the chair of the Social Security Appeal Authority.  She brings over 14 years' experience with tribunals, having sat on a number of different tribunals including the Removal Review Authority and the International Education Appeal Authority.

Three new members have also been appointed to the Authority for a three-year term.  They are Tu'inukutavake Afeaki, of Auckland, Deborah Cranko, of Wellington, and Gavin Cook JP, of Auckland. Jeannette Mackenzie, who has been a member since 2000, has also been reappointed for another year.

"The new members have a broad range of tribunal, governance and mediation experience, which will be important in carrying out the functions of the Authority," Mr Heatley says.

Mr Heatley also thanked the retiring members for their work, and former Principal Member Kay McKelvie for her leadership during her term.

The State Housing Appeal Authority was established under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters (Appeals) Regulations 2000.  It sits as a judicial body to determine appeals from applicants in relation to decisions made by Housing New Zealand Corporation on assessments of income related rents, as well as an applicant's eligibility and assessed need for Housing New Zealand Corporation housing. 

The Authority has nine members, including the new appointees. For more information about the State Housing Appeal Authority visit: [www.dbh.govt.nz/state-housing](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/state-housing)
