Agriculture Minister David Carter has congratulated the Meat Industry Association and Beef + Lamb New Zealand on joining forces with a plan to lift the performance of the meat industry.

"There is no doubt that greater co-operation is critical for the meat industry to lift its game so today's announcement of a joint strategy is exactly the action needed," says Mr Carter.

"It has been widely acknowledged for some time that status quo for the industry is unacceptable, but there has been a frustrating lack of action. This must change.

"Our farmers are efficient and innovative producers of high value products and the world is demanding more. We're getting record high prices for our meat in the UK. Yet the industry is struggling.

"This partnership between the two industry organisations representing farmers and processors is an obvious link to the future profitability of the sector."

Mr Carter says swift action is needed to capture the top-end of the market and the world's most discerning customers.

"I congratulate the Meat Industry Association and Beef + Lamb New Zealand for recognising this and adopting a collaborative approach. It is important this strategy is developed by the sector, for the sector.

"The Government has committed to supporting this initiative because we must all work together to bring back much-needed profitability to this industry," Mr Carter says.
