Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key today confirmed Cabinet's decision to fully integrate the Ministry of Tourism into its home department, the Ministry of Economic Development (MED).

"Since day one, this Government has recognised the importance of tourism as one of New Zealand's leading export industries," Mr Key says.

"Tourism is an integral part of the Government's economic growth agenda - not an add-on. This move ensures Tourism is positioned at the heart of the Government's economic plans and is a significant player in growing a high-value, productive economy."

"There will still be a Minister of Tourism, a Tourism Portfolio and a separate appropriation for Vote: Tourism.  The same approach is taken to other portfolios at the centre of New Zealand's economy such as Commerce, Energy, and Communications," Mr Key says.

The decision follows an independent review by consultancy Martin Jenkins and Associates.  The review focussed on the responsibilities of the Government's key tourism agencies the Ministry of Tourism and Tourism New Zealand.

The review found that Tourism would benefit from greater integration and a sharing of functions and expertise common to the Ministry of Tourism and MED, including policy, research and monitoring.

"I have made it clear that, just as with all other parts of the bureaucracy, I expect my key tourism agencies to lift their game and provide better value for money," Mr Key says. 

The structure and staffing around the integration are the responsibility of the chief executive of MED and final decisions are expected to be made in the next few weeks.
