The New Zealand aviation industry has gone from strength to strength in recent years, a new report commissioned by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says.

"We have a world-class industry," Associate Economic Development Minister Wayne Mapp said, launching the New Horizons report in Wellington today.

"New Zealanders are naturally air-minded. We have a higher involvement with aviation than most countries. This has translated into an impressively large range of aviation-related businesses. The report details how innovation and new technology in the industry have driven significant growth over the past five years."

The report says that New Zealand's aviation industry generated $9.7 billion in revenue in 2009. It has more than 1000 aviation-related organisations employing 23,525 staff who are paid wages and salaries estimated at $1.3 billion.

"These organisations range from Air New Zealand, one of New Zealand's largest and most prominent companies, to well-established aircraft manufacturers such as Pacific Aerospace, who developed the amazing PAC 750 XSTOL that has sold world-wide and attracted the attention of the US military; to Glidepath, who have built a $100 million-plus business selling airport baggage handling and security systems from the Bahamas to South Africa; and to Peter Beck and his Rocket Lab team, who last year not only put a rocket into the fringe of space from Mercury Island, but did it on the day they said they would.

"These are just a few of the many current examples of our international aviation successes," the Minister said. "In areas as diverse as training, aircraft design, airport systems and advanced rocket technology we find New Zealand companies exporting successfully into the global market.

"The research released today confirms the role that aviation can play in economic growth. It produces high-value products and services, and provides high-value jobs. This is exactly where this Government sees New Zealand's future.

"The report identifies the need for an ‘NZ Inc' approach. Across my own portfolio responsibilities of research, defence and associate economic development I am promoting the benefits of getting in behind our innovative companies and supporting their expansion.

"The report sets out the potential for the years ahead. I am confident that the industry can meet the challenge of the marketplace and build on its already impressive growth," Dr Mapp said.
