There have been significant gains in positive attitudes towards the Māori language over the last decade, according to the Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples.

Releasing a summary report of the findings of the 2009 Māori Language Attitudes Survey today, Dr Sharples attributed this success to support by Māori and non-Maori alike.

"Language thrives on positive reinforcement and something we have all played a part in," says Dr Sharples.

"This survey is conducted every three years, and measures progress towards the government's goal to increase the status of Māori language by developing positive attitudes towards it among speakers and non-speakers," he said.

"Non-Māori acceptance and support for Māori people speaking Māori in public places has almost doubled since 2000, from 40% to 77%.  Māori support for the Māori language has remained consistently high over the decade.

"We celebrate the progress we have made so far and the positive platform that it provides us for the current review of the Maori language strategy and sector.  As the late Sir James Henare said, we have done too much, not to do more, we have come too far, not to go further".

The 2009 Māori Language Attitudes summary report is available at [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/), with the full report available shortly.
