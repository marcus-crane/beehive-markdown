Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson has received the final report of award winning director and producer Sir Peter Jackson and film academic David Court, reviewing the New Zealand Film Commission legislation.

"Sir Peter Jackson and David Court spent the best part of a year interviewing stakeholders and experts throughout the film industry to produce this very thorough and thought-provoking review," Mr Finlayson said. "I thank them for their efforts and for the work they have produced. We could not have asked for a better qualified team."

"The reviewers have made certain findings across a wide-range of areas, which I will be looking at more closely."

"At a higher level, the reviewers posed themselves the question ‘Do we need the New Zealand Film Commission?'"

"Their answer was an unreserved: yes."

"With that in mind, I will be looking very closely with officials and the Film Commission at the review's findings and recommendations, on how to further improve the Film Commission's performance in the next thirty years of the New Zealand film industry."

The review makes a number of suggestions, including:

- \- A more strategic long term vision which will allow for more flexibility;

<!--THE END-->

- \- The Commission should move towards being more "talent" focused than project-focused;

<!--THE END-->

- \- A larger development team within the Commission;

<!--THE END-->

- \- Bringing short film funding back to the Commission, and using short films as part of a more integrated strategy for developing feature film talent;

<!--THE END-->

- \- Relaxing the current reliance on producer-centred projects;

<!--THE END-->

- \- Continuing the Screen Production Incentive Fund.

"Some of the suggestions - such as increasing funding for the New Zealand Film Archive and the division of responsibility between staff and the board - relate to concerns that have already begun to be addressed since the review began," Mr Finlayson said. "This increases my confidence this Government is moving in the right direction to help the creative industries."

"Other recommendations will be carefully considered along with officials, the Commission and my colleagues, in particular Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee, before we take recommendations to Cabinet."

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT REVIEW OF THE NEW ZEALAND FILM COMMISSION

**Purpose**

To examine and identify what is needed to enable the New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC) to work in the most effective way possible as New Zealand's film funding agency in a rapidly changing environment and taking account of wider policy and economic imperatives, including fiscal sustainability.

These included, but were not limited to, the following topics:

- 1\. What are the challenges facing the NZFC in a rapidly changing domestic and international film industry context? This will include looking at technological changes, and the development, financing, production, marketing and distribution challenges that the New Zealand industry faces in an international setting.
- 2\. How can the NZFC most effectively act in a facilitative role to enable the industry to develop and produce high quality film projects that meet New Zealand cultural content objectives and reach a domestic and international audience?
- 3\. What impact has the introduction of the Large Budget Screen Production Grant Scheme and the Screen Production Incentive Fund had on the public funding environment and the role of the NZFC? What is the role of the NZFC in helping New Zealand production companies take advantage of these new incentives?
- 4\. What is the NZFC's role in providing assistance to ensure that New Zealand films reach an international market? Are there tensions between the NZFC's own interests and the interests of filmmakers and third party investors in marketing and selling New Zealand films domestically and internationally?
- 5\. Are there changes to the NZFC's role that are called for given the challenges facing the New Zealand film industry and the NZFC in the international environment?
- 6\. What are the NZFC's objectives and strategy for professional development, training and industry support? Examine these in the light of the international and domestic environment and best practice.
- 7\. Examine the NZFC's current approach to providing information and research and whether any changes should be made in this area to meet the needs of filmmakers and audiences.
- 8\. Examine the relationship between the NZFC, private investors, filmmakers and the international industry with a particular focus on roles in raising finance, developing, producing and marketing New Zealand films. Are there areas where greater collaboration would be desirable and if so how might this be achieved?
- 9\. Are the NZFC's structural, governance and management arrangements effective and similar to those of relevant national film bodies in other countries? How can the NZFC improve organisational/operational capability and value for money.
- 10\. How can the NZFC be responsive to the needs of New Zealand filmmakers to ensure that active industry professionals are involved in setting its strategic direction?
- 11\. Are the NZFC's strategic aims and objectives relevant to the current international and domestic environment and do they take account of the need to manage future funding demands?
