Prime Minister John Key says a new programme to expand research collaboration between China and New Zealand is the latest step in the growing research and science relationship between the two countries.

"The New Zealand-China Strategic Research Alliance", was signed in Beijing today by New Zealand's Ambassador to China, Carl Worker, and Mr Cao Jianlin, Vice Minister of Science and Technology.  

 "The Alliance will expand the excellent science and technology relationship that has been built up between our two countries," Mr Key says.

"China is now one of New Zealand's top ten partners for scientific collaboration and enhanced cooperation has the potential to deliver real benefits for both partners.

"This Alliance links education, research and markets.  This connected approach will help ensure that research results in economic returns," Mr Key says.

The Alliance is the latest development in New Zealand's long-term partnership with China in science and technology. 

The formal Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement between the two countries dates back to 1987 and an updated Agreement was signed in 2003. 

Research cooperation between New Zealand and China has grown rapidly, particularly in crop science, food safety, plant and animal genetics, health research, environmental science and advanced materials.
