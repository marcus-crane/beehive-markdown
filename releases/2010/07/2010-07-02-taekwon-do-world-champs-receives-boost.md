Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today that the government will contribute $100,000 towards the ITF Taekwon-Do World Championships in March 2011, following news that New Zealand will host the event in Wellington in March next year.

"Taekwon-Do is a sport with a worldwide following of 180 million people, and is a big part of many New Zealand families and communities," Mr Brownlee said.

"This will be the first time the New Zealand body, International Taekwon-Do, has hosted the ITF Taekwon-Do World Championships - the most significant event on the ITF calendar." 

Around 60 countries are expected to be represented in New Zealand, with most bringing senior and junior teams.  The event is expected to attract 2,000 competitors, officials and supporters.

"Funding has been provided from the Major Events Development Fund to support an international marketing programme and to leverage the event to create economic, social, cultural and international exposure benefits for New Zealand and New Zealanders."

International Taekwon-Do will also host the Oceania and New Zealand National Championships this weekend, 3 - 4 July, in Wellington at TSB Bank Arena.  Hosting these events will give the organisers an opportunity to trial some systems and processes in preparation for the 2011 World Championships. 

ITF World Championships 2011 chairman Nick Lourantos says he is delighted the World Championships have attracted government support.

"The government's assistance will help us stage a tournament that will set the benchmark for future events," Mr Lourantos says.
