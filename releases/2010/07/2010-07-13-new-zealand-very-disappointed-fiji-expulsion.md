Foreign Minister Murray McCully has described Fiji's plans to expel the Australian head of mission from Suva today as "completely unjustified and very disappointing".

Mr McCully said the expulsion was "counterproductive on almost every level", and rejected any suggestion that Australian and New Zealand pressure was the reason for the collapse of the Melanesian Spearhead Group meeting that Commodore Bainimarama planned to host.

"It is deeply insulting to Vanuatu Prime Minister Natapei to suggest that his decision to defer the MSG meeting was made because of pressure from New Zealand and Australia. Prime Minister Natapei needed no help from New Zealand or Australia to work out that democratic principles should prevail within the region.

"Today's move will further diminish Fiji's standing in the eyes of the region and the international community, and further delay any recovery in the Fijian economy.

"It is also a sign that, despite our best efforts, Fiji still does not place much value on the maintenance of diplomatic relations and dialogue as a means of resolving differences," Mr McCully said.
