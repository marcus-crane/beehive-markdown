The claim today by the Green Party that the Government's approval of a proposed moratorium on the Hurunui River is a back down is extraordinary, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

"A proposed moratorium on the Hurunui River for 14 months is only possible because of the Environment Canterbury legislation passed by the Government in March which the Green Party opposed," Dr Smith said. "The very reason we included moratoria powers for the Commissioners is so they could be used to improve major decisions like those on the Hurunui River.

"The Environment Canterbury Act enables the Commissioners to align all the Hurunui River processes including making decisions on a water plan and proposed water conservation order. Taking this integrated approach should draw support from all those genuinely interested in improved water management in Canterbury.

"Russel Norman is wrong in claiming progress on the Hurunui River Water Conservation Order has been delayed by the Environment Canterbury Councillors being replaced by the Commissioners. Councillors did not have any role on water conservation orders - they are made by the Minister for the Environment with a separate tribunal. So it is quite incorrect for Mr Norman to claim this would have any affect."

"What this proposed moratorium shows is the Government is determined to make real progress on water issues in Canterbury. It seems the Green Party is more interested in protest and divisive politics than in ensuring Canterbury develops its freshwater resources in a sustainable way."
