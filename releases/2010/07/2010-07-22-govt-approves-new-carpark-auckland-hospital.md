The Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced approval for a multimillion dollar car park for Auckland City Hospital, in Auckland today.

Mr Ryall 'turned the first sod' with DHB members and staff in Auckland today.

"The Government has approved the DHB's proposal to spend more than $10 million on the 400 park facility.

"Parking around Auckland City Hospital at Grafton has caused patients and visitors problems for years.

"Visitors using the current public car park have a confusing path to the hospital reception, following a blue line painted on the ground, across a road, through basement corridors to a lift which takes them to the 5th floor reception.

"It's expected that more than 120 people will be employed on this job at various times during the construction, with another 80 plus people employed offsite involved in design, manufacturing and transport.

"The new carpark will be just inside the entrance to the hospital grounds, and people should be able to use the new parks from the end of next year."
