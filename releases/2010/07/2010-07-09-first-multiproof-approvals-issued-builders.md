The first two MultiProof approvals have been issued to volume builders in Christchurch and Palmerston North, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

MultiProof, a new streamlined national multiple-use approval service for volume builders, enables builders to obtain fast-tracked building consents for standard multiple-use building designs.

Mr Williamson congratulated Christchurch-based Spanbild for being first to get MultiProof approval and Palmerston North-based Little Buildings Limited for being the first to have consent issued for a MultiProof-approved design.

"MultiProof has already proved its worth," Mr Williamson says. "Little Buildings saved $2800 on consent fees for its first two houses and the consents were issued within three working days."

Mr Williamson presented the certificate for the first MultiProof approval to Spanbild chief executive Peter Jensen at a function held in Christchurch today.

"MultiProof is one of the first of the Government's Better Building Blueprint initiatives to take effect, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring the building regulatory environment meets the needs of the sector," he says.

"This initiative streamlines the consenting process and will save time and money for consumers and builders without compromising quality."

For building designs that have MultiProof approval, only site-specific conditions will need to be checked by local councils, reducing the timeframe for building consent decisions from 20 days to 10 days or less.

"The range and application of these designs demonstrates the flexibility of a MultiProof approval to address variations around standard designs," Mr Williamson says.
