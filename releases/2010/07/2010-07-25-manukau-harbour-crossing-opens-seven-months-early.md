Transport Minister Steven Joyce has paid tribute today to the hard work and skill of the men and women working on the Manukau Harbour Crossing, which he officially opened with Prime Minister John Key today - seven months ahead of schedule. 

He says the government's billion dollar boost to state highway funding has provided a secure funding pipeline which has given contractors the confidence to continue investing in people and machinery and complete projects more quickly.

Earlier this month, the NZ Transport Agency announced that the southern half of the new Newmarket Viaduct on State Highway 1 will also open six months ahead of schedule.

"Realising the benefits of the Harbour Crossing project seven months early will come as a huge relief to the 80,000 motorists using the route to travel between central and South Auckland every day," says Mr Joyce.

It's expected that the new bridge will deliver travel time savings of up to 20 minutes in each direction between the airport and the city during peak times.

"As well as shortening the journey time for motorists and reducing transport costs for business, greater efficiencies and access to the airport will provide a real boost the economy - both regionally and nationally," says Mr Joyce.

The new $230 million duplicate bridge, together with existing bridge, completed in 1983, will provide 10 lanes of traffic directly over the Manukau Harbour - four lanes of general traffic in each direction, plus two bus shoulder lanes. 

The Manukau Harbour Crossing is part of the southern end of the Western Ring Route - a 48 kilometre alternative to State Highway 1 running between Manukau and Albany via State Highways 20, 16 and 18.

Last year the route was identified as one of seven Roads of National Significance.
