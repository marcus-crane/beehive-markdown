New Zealanders wanting to travel overseas to do research are encouraged to apply for a fellowship from the New Zealand Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Hon Tariana Turia.

 

"Churchill Fellowships help to fund New Zealanders working in many fields to conduct intensive research overseas and bring that international knowledge back home," said Mrs Turia.  "The new insights they return with will enrich their community and New Zealand as a whole."

 

Fellows are granted up to 80 per cent of their travel costs and can spend between three weeks to three months overseas.  The average grant is from $5000 to $7000.

 

Fellows approved during the 2009/2010 financial year are conducting research in the fields of health, ecology, literacy, social services, and New Zealand history and culture, including:

 

- Debbie Hager: to travel to Australia and the United Kingdom to investigate the provision of specialised women's refuge services.

 

- Ruth Harvey: to visit a number of museums and art galleries in the United States of America to explore innovative strategies that effectively engage young adults with art and cultural heritage.

 

- Gary Holmes: to travel to the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America to undertake a study of leading business improvement districts which have a partnership with a transport management association.

 

Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts also operate in the United Kingdom and Australia.

 

Applications close on 31 July 2010.  Successful applications will be announced in December 2010.
