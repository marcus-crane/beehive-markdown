Ensuring ethnic communities have practical information about domestic violence and how to access support is the objective of the Intimate Partner Violence brochure launched today by Ethnic and Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong.

Mrs Wong says the brochure, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Women's Affairs and Office of Ethnic Affairs, will contribute significantly to creating an increased awareness in our ethnic communities about the issue of domestic violence.

"If we can get people in our ethnic communities to talk and address this issue we will be making progress. The objective is to encourage ethnic women who are experiencing or fear domestic violence to seek help."

The brochure will be printed in ten different languages.  It provides information on the laws and rights in relationships in a New Zealand context.  There are also facts about the different forms of intimate partner violence and where ethnic women can get help. 

"The brochure alone won't resolve the problem but, alongside other initiatives such as the *It's Not OK* campaign, it will ensure we can address this very important issue in a constructive and practical way.

"I am determined that ethnic women in New Zealand should not have to suffer in silence. Domestic violence is a societal problem and we must work determinedly to include all at-risk groups."
