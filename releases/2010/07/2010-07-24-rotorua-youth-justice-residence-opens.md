Social Development Minister Paula today officially opened Rotorua's Youth Justice residence Te Maioha o Parekarangi.

The 30 bed residence just south of Roturua, will house young people aged 14 to 17 who have been ordered to complete a residence order by a Youth Court judge.

"The young people who come here, will experience routine, discipline and specialised support from staff to help address their offending behaviour," says Ms Bennett.

"This is an opportunity for young people to make a choice about turning their lives around," says Ms Bennett.

This Youth Justice residence joins others in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch and brings the total number of available beds to 146.

The addition of a residence in Rotorua means young people from the Waikato/Bay of Plenty region can stay local.

"By keeping young people close to family and whanau, we give them the best chance to rehabilitate and ultimately transition into work, education and home life," says Ms Bennett.

Child Youth and Family took an innovative approach with Te Maioha o Parekarangi by partnering with Parekarangi Trust and working together to complete the project.

"I'm particularly pleased with the close involvement of iwi, which is vital to the ongoing success of this residence," says Ms Bennett.

The new youth justice residence in Rotorua will assist the implementation of Fresh Start initiatives which include longer stays for more intensive help for young offenders.

"We know current supervision with residence orders are too short at 3 months, so we doubled that to six, so there is more time to address offending behaviour," says Ms Bennett. 

Supervision with Activity orders will also be extended from three to six months, with follow up supervision in the community increased to up to six months under Fresh Start.

Fresh start changes also include:

- 300 extra places on mentoring programmes
- 232 extra place in drug and alcohol treatment
- 700 new parenting programmes.
- 215 places on military -style activity camps

The development of Te Maioha o Parekarangi was budgeted to cost $62 million but the projected final cost is $15 million below that at $47 million.
