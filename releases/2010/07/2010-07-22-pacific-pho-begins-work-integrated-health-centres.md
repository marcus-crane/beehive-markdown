The Health Minister Tony Ryall, and Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu have congratulated the Alliance Health Plus PHO group at the beginning of work on their Integrated Family Health Centre in Mount Wellington this morning.

The Alliance Health Plus Trust is an amalgamation of three PHOs, Langamalie PHO (Tongan Health Society), TaPasefika PHO and AuckPac PHO.

Together they developed one of the nine successful expressions of interest from around New Zealand looking for new ways to advance the Primary Health Care Strategy.

Tony Ryall says, "The work is now moving into implementation phase. Construction of the Trust's two Integrated Family Health Centres is underway and we'll be seeing the improved community-based services rolled out over the next several months."

Georgina te Heuheu says, "This is a great example of Pacific providers working together, embracing the best from their practices and delivering improved services to their people."

The Ministers say, "The people driving these changes deserve congratulations for their vision, and significant potential to improve performance and health outcomes."
