Education Minister Anne Tolley is warning journalists and the public to treat Trevor Mallard's statements with extreme caution following his latest untruthful media release.

"Mr Mallard clearly thinks he can mislead New Zealanders," says Mrs Tolley.

"His claim that I forced the Parliamentary Library to withdraw a research paper on National Standards is outrageous and completely without substance.

"The truth is that the Library contacted my office yesterday morning to explain that the paper, which was full of mistakes, opinions and speculation dressed up as facts, was being withdrawn due to the lack of proper scrutiny.

"This was the first contact my office had with the Library or the Speaker over this issue.

"I have since written to the Speaker saying that, while satisfied with the paper's withdrawal, I am concerned a paper with such significant defects could be published in the first place.

"Those are the facts of the matter. Any pathetic attempt by Trevor Mallard to twist these events should be seen as the workings of a man out of touch with reality and public opinion.

"I would urge journalists who are tempted to regurgitate his comments to be aware the drivel in Mr Mallard's statements simply can't be trusted."
