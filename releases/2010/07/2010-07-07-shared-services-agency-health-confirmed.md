The Government has confirmed that a shared services agency will be established to harness the power of bulk purchasing for the public health service.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "Getting better value from smarter purchasing was one of the key recommendations from the Ministerial Review Group report on minimising administrative costs and bureaucracy in health."

Former managing director of Progressive Enterprises, Ted van Arkel has been appointed chair of the new shared services agency.  Mr van Arkel is currently chair of Unitec and Restaurant Brands.

Other board appointments will be announced shortly.

It has been estimated that a shared services agency could help save up to $700 million over several years.  Mr Ryall says, "That money will be crucial to help us maintain and improve frontline services over the next few years."
