Transport Minister Steven Joyce says excellent progress has been made in the State Highway 25 Kopu Bridge replacement project, on which construction started one year ago today.

The anniversary was marked today with the last of four steel bridge beams that connect the middle span of the new bridge lifted into place. The beams will support the concrete bridge deck which will carry two-lane traffic and a shared pedestrian/cycle path.

Mr Joyce says the milestone marks considerable progress for this crucial Coromandel project, well ahead of its initially slated construction start of 2011.

"Work towards the replacement of the Kopu Bridge was not scheduled to start until 2011, but we were able to bring that forward as part of the government's $500 million Jobs and Growth plan.

"Work on the bridge has created about 50 local jobs that would not have otherwise been there, as well as work for local companies involved in supplying materials and providing supporting services.

"Once complete, the new bridge will come as a huge relief to those reliant on it - particularly during the peak holiday period when queues of up to 10 kilometres long are not unheard of.

"The Coromandel is one of the country's fastest growing visitor destinations, with 2.5 million visitors expected in 2011, and traffic volumes expected to continue to rise year-on-year. 

"As well as creating a better link for holiday makers during the peak summer period, the new bridge will create a viable transport link for the community will support growing a strong local economy," says Mr Joyce.
