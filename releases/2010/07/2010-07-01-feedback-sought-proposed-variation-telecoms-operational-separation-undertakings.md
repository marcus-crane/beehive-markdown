Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce is seeking feedback on Telecom's recent request for a further proposed variation of the company's Operational Separation Undertakings. 

Telecom has requested amendment to the following components of the Operational Separation Undertakings to stop the risk of disruption and the high costs of investment in systems that Telecom says will become redundant as the Government's Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) Initiative proceeds:

- suspend the forced bulk migration of broadband customers being served by the old wholesale broadband service onto the new wholesale broadband service
- remove the requirement for Telecom to migrate 17,000 customers onto a new VoIP over copper service by 31 December 2010
- remove the requirement for Telecom to build a new set of wholesale operational support systems that are not consistent with the industry structure implied by UFB.

"I welcome the views of the public and industry on the proposal put forward by Telecom," said Mr Joyce.

"The variation proposed by Telecom has downstream implications for some other later undertakings milestones that Telecom must complete to meet enforceable commitments set out in the Undertakings.

"It is important any significant detriment to other service providers' business operations arising from delay in delivering relevant undertakings be identified, as is whether the proposed variation meets the purposes of operational separation as set out in Part 2A of the Telecommunications Act.

"It is also important that any consideration process consider the impact on future undertakings, and for this reason I am also asking submitters to consider specific questions when making their submissions."

The variation proposal is available at [www.med.govt.nz/operational-separation](http://www.med.govt.nz/operational-separation). 

Submissions close at 5.00 pm on 23 July 2010.  They should be sent to [opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz](mailto:opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz).

**Submissions questions**

*Wholesale Broadband Service Migration*

Do you agree that the Undertakings requirement to migrate 90% of broadband customers being served by the old wholesale broadband service onto the new wholesale broadband service by 31 December 2010 should be suspended?

Do you agree that the Undertakings requirement to migrate 100% of broadband customers being served by the old wholesale broadband service onto the new wholesale broadband service by 31 December 2011 should also be paused, pending agreement of a new migration plan in the context of the UFB process?

What would be the impact on your telecommunications business of suspending the UBA migration requirements proposed by Telecom?  In particular, would there be an impact on EOI for relevant wholesale services?

*Wholesale Future Mode of Operation (FMO) Systems*

Do you agree that the Undertakings requirement to build a new set of wholesale operational support systems (i.e. the FMO systems) should be removed where they are not consistent with the industry structure implied by UFB?

What would be the impact on your telecommunications business of Telecom's proposal to remove such a requirement, taking into account the FMO based systems that Telecom has implemented to date?  In particular, would there be an impact on EOI for the relevant wholesale services, and if so, what aspects of EOI are likely to be affected?

Do you agree with Telecom's claim that Wholesale FMO systems are not needed to deliver EOI for the relevant services?  Please provide your reasons.

If the Undertakings were amended to remove wholesale FMO systems requirements that are not consistent with the industry structure implied by UFB, in your view would it be necessary to require Telecom to address any specific issues with affected telecommunications service providers to ensure that relevant EOI requirements are met?  If so what specific EOI issues and why?

*PSTN Migration*

Telecom says that the Undertakings requirement to migrate 17,000 customers onto a new VoIP service by December 2010 needs to be removed and a reassessment of the PSTN migration path set out in the Undertakings is required to take into account the Government's UFB Initiative and other significant developments since the Undertakings were put in place.  Do you agree or disagree? Please provide your reasons.
