The Hawke's Bay Museum and Art Gallery will receive a Government grant of $6 million for its redevelopment project, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

"Funding to the Hawke's Bay Museum and Art Gallery will ensure visitors to Hawke's Bay and its residents will have substantially better access to its nationally significant collections which include taonga Māori, New Zealand social history and design, and fine art," Mr Finlayson said.

The Hawke's Bay Museum and Art Gallery redevelopment project involves multiple existing buildings and the construction of a new wing.  The project will also refurbish the museum's main 1936 building, which was designed by notable Napier architect J. A. Louis Hay.

"The people of Hawke's Bay have a real sense of ownership of their museum and gallery," Mr Finlayson said. "Families have donated objects for generations, and local fundraising has been particularly effective. This grant gives their treasures the setting they deserve."

Mr Finlayson acknowledged the work of local Members of Parliament Craig Foss and Chris Tremain advocating for the region's interests.

The grant has been made under the Regional Museums Policy Funding, which is intended to ensure nationally significant material is housed adequately and made accessible to New Zealanders.

To qualify for funding under the Regional Museums Policy, a museum must be able to demonstrate that it holds a nationally significant collection, that is of special or outstanding significance to New Zealand, and makes a substantial contribution to New Zealand's cultural heritage. Previous recipients of the fund have included the Auckland Art Gallery, Rotorua Museum, Otago Settlers Museum, and Puke Ariki.
