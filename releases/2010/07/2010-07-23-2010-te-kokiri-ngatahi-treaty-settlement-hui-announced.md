The Crown and claimant iwi will continue to discuss improving the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process at this year's Te Kokiri Ngatahi conference on September 23 in Wellington, Treaty Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Te Kokiri Ngatahi ("moving forward together) hui were initiated last year so the Government could meet with settling groups to discuss its commitment to completing the settlements process, its aspirational goal of settling claims by 2014, and how best to achieve this. A number of ideas to improve the settlement process were adopted after two hui in April and June last year.

This year, claimants who have already reached settlements will also attend, to share their experiences.

"This Government is committed to reaching just, durable and speedy settlement of historical Treaty claims," Mr Finlayson said. "Our belief, shared by claimants, is that the faster we can reach settlements, the sooner those communities can enjoy the benefits of economic development and acknowledgement of their histories, and move forward."

The hui have helped with the acceleration of the settlement process - the Crown and claimant groups reached around 30 significant milestones between the beginning of 2009 and June this year.
