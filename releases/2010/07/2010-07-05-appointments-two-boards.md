Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment and reappointment of members to the New Zealand Geographic Board Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa and the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board. 

Mr Williamson made four new appointments to the New Zealand Geographic Board. They are Archie Taiaroa, of Taumarunui, Rikirangi Gage, of Opotiki, Jennifer Vernon, of Ngaruawahia, and Basil Morrison, of Paeroa. He also reappointed Sir Tipene O'Regan, Michael Roche, and David Barnes. All are for a three year term.

"The new appointees will bring a range of expertise and perspectives on New Zealand society and history to the Board," Mr Williamson says.

The New Zealand Geographic Board has been responsible for naming all geographic features since 1946 when the original New Zealand Geographic Board Act was enacted.

Mr Williamson also made two appointments to the Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board. They are Felicity Price, of Christchurch, who has been appointed as a full lay member and Marion Miller, of Invercargill, who has been appointed as a substitute member. Both are for three year terms.

The Cadastral Surveyors Licensing Board licenses cadastral surveyors who conduct cadastral (land title) surveys under the Cadastral Survey Act 2002. The Board sets the standards of education and practical experience required for licensed surveyors and also exercises disciplinary powers.

"I look forward to the contribution the new members will make to their respective boards," Mr Williamson says.
