Another two projects will receive $440,000 in government funding in the last round of approvals from the 2009/10 Housing Innovation Fund, Housing Minister Phil Heatley announced today.

Mr Heatley says Habitat for Humanity's two projects, worth a total of $1 million, will provide four new houses for affordable home ownership - three in Porirua, near Wellington and one in Kaiapoi, near Christchurch.

"Habitat for Humanity's projects will contribute to affordable home ownership for families who are likely to be low to moderate income earners and existing Housing New Zealand tenants," he says.

"There is considerable demand for affordable home ownership options, and the Government is pleased to partner with Habitat for Humanity to provide a strategic approach to supporting home ownership."

The Housing Innovation Fund for 2009/2010 supported 18 projects that will result in 172 houses throughout New Zealand for families and individuals in need.

The Housing Innovation Fund was set up to foster collaboration between government and community organisations in order to provide more housing for New Zealanders on low incomes or with special housing needs.

Budget 2010 provided $20 million to extend the Housing Innovation Fund for another year.
