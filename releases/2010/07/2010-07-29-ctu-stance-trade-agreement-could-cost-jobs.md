It is disappointing that the Council of Trade Unions has requested the United States union movement pulls its support for the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, Trade Minister Tim Groser says.

"Negotiating new trade agreements is one part of the Government's broad-based plan for faster growth and more jobs. The CTU's moves against this particular trade opportunity are puzzling and could actually cost jobs," Mr Groser says.

"It's particularly disappointing that the CTU is prepared to put petty politics ahead of New Zealand's economic and trade interests.

"New Zealand and New Zealanders stand to benefit substantially from further successful trade deals - particularly with large and influential economies such as the United States. These deals will help us create higher-paying jobs and enjoy better living standards.

"I'm therefore sure the CTU's members will be keen to know why their organisation is, in effect, working against their own interests in such a way."

Mr Groser was commenting on the CTU's confirmation that it will no longer cooperate with the Government on trade issues and that it has persuaded the United States central union organisation, the AFL-CIO, to pull out of a planned visit to New Zealand early next year.

AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka had intended to visit New Zealand next February at the invitation of the Government.

"It appears the visit will not now be happening, at the request of the CTU," Mr Groser says. "This is a missed opportunity and I cannot see how this will benefit the CTU's membership. The interface between trade and labour is one of the most sensitive issues in international trade, particularly with developing countries.

New Zealand has made considerable strides in negotiating  models of cooperation in trade and labour in a variety of our trade agreements. We would have preferred to develop our thinking in the context of this important negotiation with input from the New Zealand trade union leadership. However, that is their choice"
