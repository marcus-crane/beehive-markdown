Education Minister Anne Tolley says the overwhelming message from principals and school trustees gathered in Christchurch at the weekend is that National Standards are being implemented from Southland to Northland and initial feedback from parents has been very positive.

Over 600 trustees and principals attended the New Zealand School Trustees Association conference, held on the 21st anniversary of self-governing schools.

"The trustees, who govern schools on behalf of communities and parents, were extremely supportive," says Mrs Tolley.

"They have a positive approach to the Standards, and are clear that parents should be given plain language information about how their child is progressing in reading, writing and maths. 

"They were are at pains to point out that those in the sector who claim the sky is falling are very much a vocal minority playing politics, and that the majority of schools are quietly and professionally getting on with the task of implementing the Standards.

"The trustees said that even in schools where there is some opposition, teachers are working professionally on the Standards as we seek to lift achievement for all of our students.

"I appreciate the calm and common sense approach of trustees. The board members are wholly focused on children and parents, and this is exactly how it should be as we give every single young New Zealander the chance to reach their potential."
