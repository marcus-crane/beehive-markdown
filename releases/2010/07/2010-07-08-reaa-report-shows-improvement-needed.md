Associate Minister of Justice Nathan Guy has welcomed a report into the employment of Jonathan Moss at the Real Estate Agents Authority.

"As the Minister responsible for the REAA I am pleased they have undertaken this review of the processes surrounding the employment of Mr Moss.

"The review finds that there was no impropriety in the employment process and that full disclosure of the police investigation was made by Mr Moss.

"However I am concerned this situation was allowed to arise. I am disappointed that there were failures in best practice, and that there was no formal system for checking referees.

"I have received an assurance from the Chair of REAA that employment procedures are being reviewed and improved. The REAA has accepted the recommendation of the review and will adopt the recruitment policy of the SSC.

"The REAA has an important role to play in licensing real estate agents and providing help and support for the public. I want to see this good work continued."
