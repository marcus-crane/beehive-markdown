Health Minister Tony Ryall announced today that a new deputy chair and six further directors have been appointed to the Board of the new shared services organisation, Health Benefits Limited. 

The organisation has been created to help reduce the cost of DHB back office functions and harness the benefits of bulk purchasing, with estimated savings of up to $700 million over several years.

Former managing director of Progressive Enterprises, Ted van Arkel has already been appointed Chair of Health benefits Limited. The newly appointed directors are:

- Dr Lester Levy (Deputy Chair) - a medical practitioner with extensive experience in management and governance in both the private and public health sectors, Chair of Waitemata DHB.
- Ms Paula Rebstock, Deputy Chair of NZ Railways Corporation, former Chair of the Commerce Commission
- Mr Brent Esler, Chief Executive of Combined Rural Traders Society Christchurch
- Mr Paul Harper, Professional director and partner in Lodestar Business Consulting, former General Manager of Procurement and Distribution at Carter Holt Harvey
- Mrs Edie Moke, Professional director and accountant, former board member on the Crown Health Financing Agency.
- Mr Chris Fleming, Chief Executive of South Canterbury DHB
- Ms Tracey Adamson, Chief Executive of Wairarapa DHB

"I'm confident that this group brings a high level of commercial expertise to the board. Collectively, they provide an excellent balance of health sector, shared services, procurement and contracting experience.

"The organisation will play a critical role in working with DHBs to ensure that savings are returned to frontline health services," Mr Ryall added.
