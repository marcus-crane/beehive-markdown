Associate Justice Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed an independent legal review by the Real Estate Agents Authority (REAA) into the appointment of Jon Moss.

"Having an independent review is the right thing to do. Employment matters are the responsibility of the board, but as the Minister with responsibility for the REAA I want to be reassured that all the proper processes have been followed in this case.

"Today I met with the Chair of the REAA and Ministry of Justice officials who briefed me on this case.

"The REAA has an important role to play in licensing real estate agents and providing help and support for the public. I want to see this good work continued."
