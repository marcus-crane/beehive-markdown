Feedback is now being sought on a draft Relationship Agreement between the Communities of Aotearoa New Zealand and the Government.

Drafted by the Kia Tutahi *Standing Together* Steering Group, the agreement will be a guide for how government agencies and communities can work together, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia.

"The Government places high value on the role that the community and voluntary sector plays in Aotearoa New Zealand.

"It is important that we work together to address the complex and diverse issues we face and find some common principles and mutual objectives.

"I would encourage the community and voluntary sector, public and government agencies to read the draft agreement and provide their feedback to ensure an agreement is developed which is beneficial for all."

During July and August the Steering Group will seek public input through nationwide hui, written submissions and an online discussion forum.
