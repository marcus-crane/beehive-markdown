New Zealand will send 37 Defence Force personnel to the Solomon Islands to boost security arrangements during the upcoming election, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

The platoon will be part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) Combined Task Force.

"The security situation in Solomon Islands is currently stable, and this deployment is simply a precautionary measure to ensure RAMSI has sufficient resources on the ground to assist the Solomon Islands Police, which is leading election security efforts," Mr McCully said.

"The contribution of the platoon has been welcomed by the Solomon Islands Government, and it underscores New Zealand's contribution to the on-going security and stability in the Solomons, as well as our commitment to supporting free and fair elections."

The Election Force leaves New Zealand on Thursday, with the election to be held on 4 August.
