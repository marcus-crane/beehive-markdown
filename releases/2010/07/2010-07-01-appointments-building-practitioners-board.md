Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has announced the appointment of Brian Nightingale and Bill Smith to the Building Practitioners Board.

"Brian Nightingale and Bill Smith will bring extensive management, commercial and financial experience to the board," Mr Williamson says.

Mr Williamson also announced the reappointment of chair Alan Bickers, deputy chair Paul Blackler, and member David Clark. He paid recognition to outgoing members Graham Moor and Patrick Lawrence for their valuable years of service to the board.

"Alan Bickers has served as chair for five years, and his reappointment, along with Paul Blacker and David Clark, provides continuity and expertise during the lead up to restricted building work in 2012," Mr Williamson says. 

From March 2012, critical building work on homes must be done or supervised by licensed builders.

Licensed building practitioners are accountable to the independent Building Practitioners Board. The board investigates and hears complaints, and can take disciplinary action against licensed builder. The board also approves the rules and can hear appeals against decisions of the registrar.

Brian Nightingale, of Lower Hutt, is the government appointed representative on the Eden Park Redevelopment Board.  He has held several building related board appointments, including chair of the Registered Master Builders Technical Advisory Committee.

Auckland-based Bill Smith is chair of the Building Industry Federation of New Zealand, and a member of the Building Research Advisory Council. Both Mr Nightingale and Mr Smith have been appointed for a term of three years.
