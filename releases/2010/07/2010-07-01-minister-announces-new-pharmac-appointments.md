Health Minister Tony Ryall today announced changes to the Pharmac board.

Current deputy Chair Stuart McLauchlan has been appointed as Chair of the board, taking effect from 1 July 2010.

"Mr McLauchlan brings strong financial and governance expertise to the board " said Mr Ryall.

Existing board member Dr David Kerr of Christchurch has been reappointed.

Associate Professor Jens Mueller of Waikato University and specialist paediatric surgeon Dr Anne Kolbe of Auckland University School of Medicine are newly appointed members of the board.

Mr Ryall thanked the outgoing Chair Richard Waddel who has held the position since 2001.

"I'd like to acknowledge and thank Richard Waddel for his commitment to the job during the nine years he was Chair."

Mr Ryall also thanked retiring board member Ms Adrienne von Tunzelmann of Tauranga for her seven years of service on the Pharmac board.

The two remaining Pharmac board members are Ms Kura Denness of New Plymouth and Mr David Moore of Wellington.
