Prime Minister John Key today announced a fair and balanced employment law package aimed squarely at jobs and economic growth.

"This employment law package is all about policies to help productivity and employment in New Zealand," says Mr Key.

"As we continue to grow out of the recession, it's important we have the right environment to create more jobs. 

"Employment growth happens because a business is prepared to give someone a chance - often someone they have never met before and know very little about.

"The extension of the 90-day trial period to all workplaces is all about giving prospective employees a shot at work, and giving employers the confidence to hire.

"An evaluation of the 90-day trial period showed that 40 per cent of employers who used it said they would not have, or were unlikely to have, hired that person without a trial period. In addition, employers have generally acted responsibly and workers have been treated fairly.

"Many other developed countries we compare ourselves with, like Britain and Australia, have similar policies.  In some cases the policies go much further.

"We are giving many more businesses increased confidence to hire new employees, and giving many more people a chance to prove themselves in the job market.

"We are making a number of other changes to improve the Employment Relations Act, many in line with the National Party's 2008 manifesto including making union access to workplaces require employer consent - which cannot be unreasonably withheld. 

"We are also implementing our promise to allow employees the choice to request the trade of their fourth week of annual leave for cash.  This is alongside other changes to the Holidays Act to improve this area of the law.

"I would like to acknowledge the Act Party's involvement in this package and their support for it.

"The employment law package is one more step on the road to a more productive economy and increased employment."
