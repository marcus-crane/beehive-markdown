Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee today announced the awarding of the first of a series of state sector-wide contracts, with others to come into effect progressively during July, which will save the taxpayer millions of dollars.

Corporate Express New Zealand and OfficeMax New Zealand have won contracts and will form the panel of suppliers from which state sector agencies can buy their stationery and other office supplies at special discounted rates.

Other all-of-government contracts will shortly be awarded to panels of suppliers for vehicles and selected IT hardware.  Once all of the contracts are in place, they are expected to save more than $115 million over the next five years.

"We're harnessing the collective buying power of the whole state sector for the first time, and the benefit to government and taxpayers will be significant," Mr Brownlee said.

"Use of these contracts is expected to deliver savings of over $115 million over the next five years.

"Delivering smarter, better value public services is vital, whatever the economic climate.

"The New Zealand government spends about $30 billion a year on goods and services - by being smarter about how we spend that money, we can get better results for taxpayers."

As well as saving money for the taxpayer, the contracts will reduce the cost of doing business for companies providing goods and services to government.

In each category, a contract will be awarded to a panel of suppliers to ensure choice and maintain a competitive marketplace.  A single contract between the Crown and each of the successful panel suppliers will replace individual contract arrangements for around 200 agencies.  This will reduce the tendering costs of both agencies and suppliers alike.

Cabinet has now given the go ahead for the Ministry of Economic Development to assess additional categories of goods and services that could be suitable for all-of-government contracts.  These are: external legal services (in conjunction with Crown Law), recruitment services, travel services, ICT hardware (e.g. mobile telephony), and utilities (e.g. electricity).

Developing all-of-government contracts is one initiative of a wide-ranging, four-year Government Procurement Reform Programme being led by MED.  Officials have been listening to suppliers' concerns about the barriers they face when doing business with government, and government will shortly announce additional measures to cut red tape.
