Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong will attend the annual meeting of the Australian Ministerial Council for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Melbourne tomorrow.

Mrs Wong will speak to the Council about New Zealand's achievements and key priorities in the Ethnic Affairs portfolio.

"New Zealand has made substantial progress in ensuring that ethnic New Zealanders, including new migrants, get the help they need to be able to contribute, participate, and succeed in our country," says Mrs Wong.

"I look forward to updating my Australian counterparts on New Zealand's achievements, and sharing ideas on how we can make further progress in this area.

"Australian federal and state governments are dealing with issues similar to those faced in New Zealand.  Strengthening links and sharing ideas will contribute to better outcomes for ethnic communities in both our countries."

New Zealand's participation in these meetings contributes to strengthening the bilateral relationship with Australia and linkages with the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship at immigration policy level.
