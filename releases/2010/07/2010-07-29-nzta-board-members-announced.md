Transport Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointments of Jerry Rickman, Tony Lanigan and Patsy Reddy to the Board of the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA).

Mr Rickman and Dr Lanigan have been appointed for a three year term commencing 1 August 2010, and Ms Reddy for a two year term commencing 1 October 2010.

"Jerry Rickman, Tony Lanigan and Patsy Reddy join recently-appointed Chair Chris Moller in bringing strong commercial experience to the board, in addition to their financial, legal and engineering skills," says Mr Joyce.

"Injecting their collective experience into the Board will be highly beneficial to NZTA's operations."

The terms of Paul Fitzharris and Grahame Hall end on 31 July 2010.
