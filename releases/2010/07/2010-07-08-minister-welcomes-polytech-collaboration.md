The Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce has today welcomed news that the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology and the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology have signed an agreement to investigate projects they can work together on.

"Earlier this year we signalled to polytechnics that they should be looking at ways of becoming more efficient in delivering education and training in the regions," says Minister Joyce.

"This agreement between CPIT and NMIT will allow them to share one another's teaching expertise and work to avoid duplication in future curriculum development.

"While this is a first step, I am confident that their memorandum of understanding will set the platform for future collaboration and over time will enhance the services of both organisations.

"I look forward to other ITPs following the lead of these institutions and investigating their options. Enhancing performance through collaboration is a positive way to strengthen each ITPs longer term position, and allow them to best meet the future needs of their regions."
