Health Minister Tony Ryall's moratorium on District Health Boards charging patients for laboratory services ordered by private specialists will be made permanent.  

That means the three district health boards who have been charging for privately referred lab tests - Capital and Coast, Hutt Valley and Tairawhiti - will reinstate publicly funded laboratory tests once their current contract arrangements expire over the next two years.

"This decision means the country returns to a single policy on privately referred lab charges."

"For many years patients' lab tests ordered by private specialists have been publicly funded, just like medicines prescribed by private specialists."

But the previous government approved charging for privately referred lab tests by the three DHBs in 2006 with the intention of requiring all DHBs to do so.

Soon after the election, Mr Ryall ordered a moratorium on any more DHBs following suit and commissioned an independent review of the policy. 

"That review found patients who didn't have insurance cover or who had chronic or complex conditions requiring ongoing tests unfairly faced large bills."

"Some of those patients subsequently chose to delay, reduce, or even forego the tests they needed."

Mr Ryall says he understands that the doctors interviewed by the reviewers were almost unanimously opposed to charging for lab tests. 

"While there were savings for DHBs charging for these tests, I've been advised a national roll out of the policy would force up insurance premiums across the board. That in turn would drive some privately insured patients into the public health system. Reverting back to the previous arrangement makes a lot of sense."
