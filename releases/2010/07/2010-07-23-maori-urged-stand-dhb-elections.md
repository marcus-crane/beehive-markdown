Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is urging more Maori, Pasifika and ethnic community representatives to stand in this year's District Health Board elections.

Candidate nominations open today and close at midday on August 20.

Mrs Turia says it is vital that District Health Boards have representation from all sectors of the community.

"It is important that iwi and other ethnic communities have the opportunity to participate in decision making given the numerous health issues that can impact on these groups."

"New Zealand is going to be a very different country in 20 years time and I would encourage Maori, Pasifika and ethnic communities to invest their time now in safeguarding and improving future health outcomes of their communities."

Elections are held every three years with seven members elected to the board and the Minister of Health appointing up to a further four members.

"This is also an opportunity for community representatives to gain invaluable experience and training in all areas of governance."
