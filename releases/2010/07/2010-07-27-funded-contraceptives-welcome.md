Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the approval of a new Government funded and long-acting contraceptive as another option for women.

Pharmac has announced long-acting Jadelle implants, small removable implants that work for up to five years, will be funded as many other oral contraceptive pills currently are.

"I welcome the addition of this new form of contraception as a modern solution for modern women," says Ms Bennett. 

"Implanted into the arm, they're simple to insert and remove and because they're long acting, women don't have to worry about remembering to take a daily pill," says Ms Bennett.

The fully reversible implants will cost about the same as oral contraceptives.

Because they last longer, choosing the implant will mean fewer visits to the doctor and fewer fees, so there is a cost saving attached.

"I'm really pleased Pharmac has agreed to fund long-acting contraceptives, giving women of any age another low-cost, convenient option to consider," says Ms Bennett.

Jadelle implants will be funded from 1 August.
