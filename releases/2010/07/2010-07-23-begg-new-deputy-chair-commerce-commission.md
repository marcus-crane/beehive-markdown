Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Sue Begg as deputy chair of the Commerce Commission.

"Since her initial appointment as a member of the commission in June 2009, Ms Begg has proven to have outstanding leadership and analytical skills," Mr Power said.

"Her appointment to this role will enable the chair to focus on enforcement while Ms Begg focuses on regulation.

"The separation of roles aligns with the commission's organisational structure." 

Ms Begg formally begins her four-year term as deputy next Monday.
