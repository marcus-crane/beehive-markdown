New Zealand's next High Commissioner to India will be career diplomat Jan Henderson, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

Ms Henderson will also be cross-accredited to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

"India is a key relationship for New Zealand, and its importance to us is growing - a reflection of India's rising economic power, and the key role it plays regionally and internationally," Mr McCully said.

"In the coming decades India will be one of the region's most significant partners for New Zealand, and the free trade agreement currently under negotiation will bring our two countries even closer together."

Two-way trade with India passed the $1 billion mark in 2009, with exports growing to $709 million, making it our 11th largest market.  Indian tourists and students are also increasingly choosing New Zealand as a destination, with over 26,000 visitors and nearly 9000 students coming here last year.

Ms Henderson is currently Director of the Environment Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, having previous served as Ambassador to Turkey, Israel, and Jordan, and been posted in Washington DC, Honiara, and Bangkok. She takes up her assignment in December, replacing Rupert Holborrow.
