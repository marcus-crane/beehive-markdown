People have been keen to tell the Government what they think about simplifying the tax system via an online consultation forum which still has over a week to run, says Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

"There have been more than 40,000 page views in the first month of the forum and 176 comments have been posted," Mr Dunne said.

He said he was impressed with the public response to the second tax-related online consultation process, following on from consultation around student loans last year.

The *Making Tax Easier* consultation was launched on June 9 through a discussion document and online forum. It includes proposals to simplify PAYE and income tax returns for individuals and employers, and make it easier for taxpayers to shift away from paper forms and manage their tax affairs with Inland Revenue via the internet. 

Other proposals for comment include Inland Revenue potentially sharing some of its information - with appropriate safeguards - with other government departments, and businesses using software that automatically communicates with Inland Revenue to routinely manage tax compliance.

"The Government wants to hear what taxpayers and businesses think about these proposals before we make any decisions" Mr Dunne said.

Consultation remains open until next Friday, 23 July, at [http://www.makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/](http://www.makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/)
