Applications have opened for the Chief Executive's job at the new Ministry of Science and Innovation. The Ministry comes into being on 1 November.

"This is an outstanding leadership opportunity," Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp said. Dr Mapp's portfolio becomes Science and Innovation under the new structure.

"Science and innovation are cornerstones of the Government's economic growth strategy," he said.

"Last year we started the biggest overhaul of the science system in 20 years. We have set clear priorities in the system. The Crown research institutes are being reformed to have a clearer sense of priorities and more effective funding. The Budget provided extensive new funding for business and manufacturers to connect with our research institutions.

"The creation of this Ministry is the next step in improving the science system and setting the scene for excellence in science and innovation. This Ministry will ensure better returns from public investment and direct Government support where it can make the greatest difference," the Minister said.

"The Chief Executive will have a crucial leadership role in managing science funding, advising the Government on New Zealand's science system, and driving knowledge transfer from the science sector to business and other research users.

"The Government is committed to unlocking the huge potential science has to lift our economy. We have created an environment where that can happen. This person will have a key role in making it happen," he said.
