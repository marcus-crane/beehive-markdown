Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the electrification of Auckland's rail system is one step closer today, with KiwiRail announcing a short list of four potential suppliers to build the region's 38 new electric multiple units.

"KiwiRail advises me that they are very happy with the number and quality of bids and that they are on track to award the tender by the middle of next year and have the first trains on the ground and operational from 2013."

At the end of July 2010 KiwiRail will invite the short listed potential suppliers to provide comments and engage with the Project Team on the draft Rolling Stock Technical Specification.  KiwiRail intends to release the full RFP document to short-listed bidders at the end of August.

Mr Joyce says, after double tracking, electrification is the important next stage in the development of Auckland's rail network. 

"Rail is an increasingly important way for Aucklanders to get to work each day. The upgrade and electrification of the Auckland rail network will provide for more frequent trains at peak times and help to meet future passenger demand.

"New Zealand's future success is tied to that of Auckland as our largest city and largest local economy. Getting Auckland transport working well is crucial to getting Auckland growing faster and providing more jobs"

"The government's comprehensive rail and roading plan for Auckland is gaining momentum towards improving transport across the city.  Increased productivity and growth in Auckland delivers flow-on effects for the rest of the country."

The Crown has invested $1.6 billion in the development of Auckland's metro rail system, which comprises:

- $600 million for Project DART
- $500 million for the infrastructure required to support electrification
- $500 million for purchase of electric trains (government loan to KiwiRail).
