Opening a Supervised Group Home for troubled young people in Mangere, Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announced twelve group homes will open nationally.

"These homes are for seriously at-risk young people who will benefit hugely from a positive environment where they'll learn how to behave and relate well to people," says Ms Bennett. 

The new group homes will be in Northland, South Auckland (2), West Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch (2) and Invercargill.

"Some of these young people have had pretty awful childhoods and this is a concerted effort, utilising specialist staff to turn their lives around before it's too late," says Ms Bennett.

The homes will be supervised 24/7 and the young people aged 12 to 17, will be in school or training while working on their individual plans for the future, gaining necessary skills for life.

"One on one help from trained professionals is vital to making this work," says Ms Bennett.

The behaviour change programme and group work will help build social skills and days will be carefully structured, so the young people know what's expected of them.

"We're determined to help these young people gain life skills and learn to trust and relate to others, so they can join the rest of society and lead healthy, happy lives," says Ms Bennett.

Each home will cater for small groups of up to five young people per home who will live there for between two and six months.

Families of the young people will be supported to gain the confidence and skills needed to continue the good work when their young person is ready to go back home. 

"With strong community support and people who care about them, these young people stand every chance of overcoming their challenges and having a good life," says Ms Bennett.
