Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong joined the Certified Builders' Third year Apprentice Challenge winner and other Auckland tradeswomen for breakfast this morning to share stories about their work lives in male-dominated trades.

Kartika Mutzelburg won the Third Year Apprentice Challenge at the Certified Builders' annual conference in Queenstown in June this year.  Kartika was the Auckland representative and headed off six other regional finalists.

Women carpenters, joiners, electricians, plumbers, mechanics and others have been brought together in an initiative developed by the Ministry of Women's Affairs as part of an effort to encourage and retain more women in trades.

Mrs Wong hosted a similar networking event in Wellington last December that saw 25 tradeswomen talk about their experiences and discuss ways to get more women into trades.

Mrs Wong said she was pleased to meet the Auckland tradeswomen after the successful Wellington event.

"The Wellington Women in Trades Network have gone on to hold two more meetings during the year. The women themselves have told us how beneficial and enjoyable the get-togethers are. They are definitely helping to reduce the feeling of isolation that tradeswomen can feel in their careers.

"The Ministry of Women's Affairs wants to encourage more women to see trades as a career option where they can earn while they learn and set themselves on a prosperous and viable career path."

Mrs Wong said New Zealand had skill shortages in many trades and women entering the trades would help meet those shortages.

"The Ministry is also hoping to set up networks in other parts of New Zealand."
