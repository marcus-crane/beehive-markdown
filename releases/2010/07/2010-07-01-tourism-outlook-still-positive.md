Associate Minister of Tourism Dr Jonathan Coleman today released the latest Ministry of Tourism forecasts, which show that overall, the sector's future looks positive.

International visitor numbers are predicted to reach 3.1 million over the next seven years.  By 2016 arrivals will likely grow by 27%, which will equate to an additional 669,000 international visitors each year. 

"The numbers show that the sector is highly resilient and has weathered the recession very well," Dr Coleman says.  "We are one of only a small group of countries whose international arrivals are holding steady and with the Rugby World Cup just around the corner, we can look forward to some good growth."

"Government continues to actively support the sector with an additional $30 million to feed into tourism marketing.  This follows on from an extra $20 million for Tourism New Zealand last year.  From these forecasts, that investment is already paying dividends. 

"Given the tight fiscal nature of this year's budget, this further funding is a huge vote of confidence in New Zealand tourism," says Dr Coleman. "These forecasts set out a solid starting point, but I believe that the sector will outperform them."

By the end of 2010 arrivals should grow by 3.7%. 2011 predictions are for a 6.8% increase in arrivals-a product of both the Rugby World Cup and an improved global economic outlook.
