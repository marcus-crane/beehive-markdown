New Zealand and Viet Nam have agreed to an ambitious Action Plan to guide the bilateral relationship over the medium term, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Mr McCully who is in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, for a range of regional meetings, signed the Action Plan during a bilateral meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem.

"Last year New Zealand and Viet Nam agreed to elevate the relationship to one of Comprehensive Partnership in recognition of the importance of the relationship to both countries," Mr McCully said. 

"The Action Plan identifies specific initiatives across a range of areas such as trade and investment, aid, education, science and technology, trans-boundary cooperation, and collaboration in regional and international organisations.

"It is an ambitious document but one which will guide the relationship to ensure that the excellent bilateral cooperation that we already enjoy achieves its full potential.

"Viet Nam is a close and valued partner for New Zealand both bilaterally and within Asia more broadly, where we share the common objective of working to ensure the long term peace and stability of the region," said Mr McCully, who is also attending the ASEAN-New Zealand Post Ministerial Conference; the ASEAN Regional Forum; East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' consultations, and the South West Pacific Dialogue meeting.

This year marks 35 years of bilateral relations between New Zealand and Viet Nam. Earlier this month Prime Minister John Key made an official visit to Viet Nam to mark the milestone.
