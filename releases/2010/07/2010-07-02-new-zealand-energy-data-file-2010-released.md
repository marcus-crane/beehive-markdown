New Zealand's leading record of annual energy data shows a year-on-year increase in renewable electricity generation of eight per cent, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"In 2008, annual renewable electricity generation was at 65 per cent.  That rose to 73 per cent for the 2009 calendar year, with generation from wind and geothermal playing a bigger part in New Zealand's electricity generation mix," Mr Brownlee said.

"The 2009 figures are more in line with the government's future expectations - renewable generation will continue to rise."

The 2008 year saw unusually high levels of electricity generated from coal.  In 2009, total installed capacity of wind powered electricity generation increased by 55 per cent to nearly 500 MW.

The latest edition of the *New Zealand Energy Data File*, which sets out detailed information on the supply and use of energy in New Zealand since 1970, was released by the Ministry of Economic Development today.  A new *Energy Snapshot* publication has been released alongside the *New Zealand Energy Data File*.

"The New Zealand Energy Data File is the go-to reference for anyone interested in the energy sector in New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.  "This year, that information has been distilled further for those with little or no knowledge of the New Zealand energy sector."

The 2010 edition has also been updated to include liquid biofuels production information and P90 oil and gas reserves information, in line with the recommendation from the Electricity Market Review. 

Other key highlights reported in this edition are:

- Although down eight per cent from 2008, crude oil production in 2009 was the third highest on record with the new Maari field coming online

<!--THE END-->

- Total electricity generation in 2009 was 42,010 GWh, slightly below the level seen in 2008

<!--THE END-->

- Diesel demand in 2009 was down four per cent from 2008 levels, and the lowest since 2004

<!--THE END-->

- Remaining oil and gas reserves from currently producing fields at the end of 2009 were 983 PJ and 2,076 PJ respectively
