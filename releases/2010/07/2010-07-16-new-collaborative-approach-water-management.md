The formation of the Hurunui-Waiau Zone Committee is an important step towards a more collaborative approach to freshwater management in Canterbury, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

"The Hurununi is centre stage in a growing national debate over water with major proposals for water conservation orders and irrigation development," Dr Smith said. "This new approach based on the Bluegreen principles of carefully balancing economic development with responsible environmental management and resolving issues by collaboration rather than adversarial court contests has the potential to lead the way nationally on water management."

Dr Smith was in Hanmer today to mark the formation of the committee - the first to be established under the Canterbury Water Management Strategy.

"This is an important milestone in the life of the Hurunui community and the Hurunui River. This committee is the first of many being set up in Canterbury this year to support the development of a more robust and durable framework for managing freshwater," Dr Smith said. What we are seeing in the Hurunui area is a reflection of the wider issues with water that are starting to play out elsewhere in New Zealand as the pressures on our water resources grow.

"There are many stakeholders with equally valid but often competing interests that needs to be balanced. Like the Land and Water Forum, which is looking at the boarder national issues of water management, the Hurunui-Waiau Zone Committee brings together key stakeholders to address the issues and seek consensus.

"Improving freshwater management is one of the Government's key environmental priorities and it is clear that New Zealand needs a step change in how we manage it. That requires collaboration from all groups to achieve the best outcomes for the community, the environment and the economy.

"I commend the Hurunui community, in particular Mayor Garry Jackson, for their leadership and hard work in setting up this committee and look forward to its results."
