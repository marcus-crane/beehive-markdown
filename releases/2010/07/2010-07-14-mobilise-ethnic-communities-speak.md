Ethnic and Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong launched the Office of Ethnic Affairs and Ministry of Women's Affairs' joint Intimate Partner Violence Project's brochure - *Speak Up, Seek Help, Safe Home* yesterday. 

This first initiative, a brochure, contains translated information in ten languages about rights of women and the help available to victims of intimate partner violence.  This is a result of extensive consultation with ethnic communities.

Mrs Wong says that reducing the damaging impact of domestic violence is a priority for the government.  "Domestic violence affects every part of society regardless of ethnicity, socio-economic or employment status.  Taking a leadership role and providing information to ethnic communities in their own language is an effective way for ethnic communities to speak up and seek help."

Ranjina Patel, QSM, JP, and President of the Manukau Indian Association said language barrier meant that ethnic communities often lacked information on New Zealand law and their rights in relationships and where to get help.

"It's comforting to see that an effort has been made to have this information translated into languages other than English.  It's an excellent idea, especially if the information is aimed at an ethnic audience."

Kai Luey, Chairman of the New Zealand Chinese Association Auckland Incorporated said "it's good to see that help is being directed to ethnic communities in a manner that is understood and helpful.  Many incidents are not reported in ethnic communities due to cultural barriers or lack of understanding of rights in New Zealand.  I'm glad to see that we now have access to information that will make this process easier for our communities."

Prem Singh, President for the NZ Federation of Multicultural Councils said "we want to be in regular contact with our people and this will put us in a good position to get feedback on how it's been received.  The Government's response to ethnic communities and to addressing domestic violence is fantastic.  This particular brochure is certainly more relevant to our communities."
