Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully says he has seen part, but not all, of the comments

made by Andy Haden on Sky Television on Wednesday night.

"Naturally I am disappointed to again be in a situation where Mr Haden's comments have

provoked public controversy. It is the role of 2011 Ambassadors to promote the outstanding

programme of activities planned for next year, not to provide a major distraction from them.

"It is not possible to combine the roles of television rugby shock-jock and 2011 Ambassador.

This is something I will discuss with Mr Haden quite soon."
