Agriculture Minister David Carter has welcomed the unanimous passing today of legislation that significantly raises penalties for cruelty to animals.

The Animal Welfare Amendment Act will increase the maximum sentences and fines for animal ill-treatment and neglect, and redefine the way some offences are described.

"This legislation sends a clear message that serious offending against animals will not be tolerated," says Mr Carter.

"The unanimous support it received in Parliament reflects the fact that New Zealanders want strong laws to protect animals from harm."

The Act expands the threshold for the offence of wilful ill-treatment - the most serious animal welfare offence - and it adds a new offence of reckless ill-treatment. 

The maximum sentence for wilful ill-treatment of an animal increases from three to five years and the maximum fine will double to $100,000 for an individual and $500,000 for a body corporate.

Penalties also increase for a range of other neglect and ill-treatment offences and the Act expands the law relating to forfeiture of animals and disqualification from having custody of animals.
