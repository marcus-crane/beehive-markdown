Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson leaves for the United States tomorrow to address 400 international senior executives at one of the largest geographic information system conferences in the world.

"This is a great opportunity to showcase the contribution New Zealand has made to the geospatial sector.  It's an honour to be asked to present at the conference," Mr Williamson says.

Mr Williamson will address a senior executive seminar at the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) International Users Conference on Sunday morning (early Monday morning NZ time). The week-long conference is being held in San Diego and attracts over 12,000 professionals from around the world.

"Geospatial information and technology is widely used in New Zealand and already contributes $1.2 billion to our economy.  There are significant opportunities to grow this contribution through better use," he says.

New Zealand is currently implementing a national geospatial strategy through the work of the New Zealand Geospatial Office, based within Land Information New Zealand.

"Geospatial information is information about location. Every time you use GoogleMaps, call emergency services, fly or take a ferry, or buy a house, you are using geospatial information.

"These are just a few examples of how geospatial information is becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives," Mr Williamson says.
