The total number of jobs advertised online continues to rise, up by 36.9 percent since June last year and by 9.4 percent over the last three months.

The *Jobs Online* results released today show *skilled* job vacancies increased by 10.0 percent over the last three months and by 33.6 percent since June 2009.

"I'm particularly pleased to see strong and consistent growth in the number of skilled jobs being advertised online," says Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

The biggest industry increases were in construction and engineering (up 14.9%) in sales, retail, marketing and advertising (up 10.5%) and IT (up 10.4%).

Advertised Health jobs online increased 8.3 percent over the last three months.

"It's encouraging to see job ads increasing across all industries, including health, which is the latest industry to rebound in advertised vacancies," says Ms Bennett.

Advertised skilled jobs also increased across all regions, with particularly strong growth in the North Island outside of Auckland and Wellington (up 10.1%). 

Skilled jobs advertised online rose 10 percent in Auckland and 8.7 percent in Wellington over the last three months.

*Jobs Online* collates data from New Zealand's leading online advertisers Trade Me Jobs, Herald Jobs and SEEK.
