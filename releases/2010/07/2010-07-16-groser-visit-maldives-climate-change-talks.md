International Negotiations Climate Change Minister Tim Groser is to visit the Maldives this weekend to take part in an international climate change meeting.

The second meeting of the Cartagena Dialogue for Progressive Action will draw together a number of countries seeking a middle ground and consensus on climate change.  It will focus on how to progress the climate change negotiations during the remainder of 2010. 

"We're looking for practical and pragmatic solutions to addressing climate change," Mr Groser said.  

 "I'm going to be talking about the importance of using carbon markets to make the biggest possible impact on reducing emissions."

"That means reducing emissions where you get the biggest effect and spending money on what really works to help countries where the need is greatest". 

"It is significant that this meeting is taking place in the Maldives, which like some of our Pacific neighbours is already feeling the effects of climate change," Mr Groser said.

The Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, is one of the world's most low-lying countries. It is a frequent ally of similarly low-lying Pacific countries in climate change discussions.

The two-day Maldives meeting will consider finance, actions to reduce emissions, and the likely direction of the negotiations leading up to a major UN meeting in December.

After visiting the Maldives, Minister Groser, who is also Trade Minister, will hold climate change and trade talks in Singapore. He returns to New Zealand on Tuesday.
