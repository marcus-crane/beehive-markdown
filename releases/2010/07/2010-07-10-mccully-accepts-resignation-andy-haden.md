Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully today received the  
resignation of Andy Haden as a 2011 Ambassador.

Mr McCully said he had accepted the resignation "with sadness".

"While it had been my intention to discuss this matter with Mr Haden  
later today, I have, in the interim, received an email from Andy Haden  
relinquishing his position as a 2011 Ambassador (a copy of that email  
is attached). I have accepted his resignation and thanked him for his  
excellent contribution to our 2011programme.

"Mr Haden has made it clear that he will continue to be available to  
assist in any way with preparations for next year's ambitious calendar  
of events, in the same way in which he has so generously supported the  
interests of New Zealand and rugby in the past.

"I am grateful to him for that and will most certainly look forward to receiving his  
valuable input," said Mr McCully.

July 10th 2010,

The Minister,

Rugby World Cup 2011.

 

Dear Murray,

I wish to advise that I have decided to resign my role as an honorary

Ambassador of the Government's 2011 Rugby World Cup programme.

I do so to ensure that neither your leveraging initiatives or the game of Rugby

that I love are compromised by the current media backlash to the comments

I have made on television recently.

I feel that to stay in the role, given the current media beat-up, would mean

having to remove myself from making public comments on the game or

related issues.  I have always believed in saying what I think and I will always

be true to myself in that regard and it's a sad day for society when people such

as I are unable to express what we believe without a media beat-up from those

with sectional interests.

I remain totally committed to assist with ensuring that the 2011 Rugby World Cup

is a success and to this end I am available, as and when required.

I won't be making any further public comment on the issue of my resignation and

I am happy therefore for you to use this email as a press release on the matter.

Kind regards,

Andy Haden
