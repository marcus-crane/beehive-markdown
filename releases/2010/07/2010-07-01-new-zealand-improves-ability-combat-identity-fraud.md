New Zealand's ability to combat identity fraud will be improved following the signing of an agreement between New Zealand's and Australian's immigration agencies overnight, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman says.

"It is important we are able to establish the true identity of people seeking entry to New Zealand so can we protect our borders and people," Dr Coleman says.

The two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding for checking fingerprint information at a meeting in London of the Five Country Conference (FCC), a grouping of immigration agencies from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States of America and New Zealand.

The initiative will give Australia and New Zealand:

- greater confidence that non-genuine immigration cases will be refused through the improved detection of fraudulent identity and immigration claims;

<!--THE END-->

- improved border security by ensuring people with known criminal histories are identified early in the immigration process;

<!--THE END-->

- early identification of ineligible immigration applicants to reduce fraud cost.

"This arrangement will help both countries' immigration agencies establish the true identities of people and help to ensure genuine cases will be successful, while fraudulent cases will be dealt with appropriately through the improved ability to detect identity crime. Our new cooperation with Australia will create safer Trans-Tasman borders and will also facilitate faster processing for genuine travellers."

The new data-sharing arrangements have been developed consistent with privacy laws in all participating countries.

"The protection of personal information is important to all the countries involved in these arrangements. All arrangements conform with Australia and New Zealand's respective Privacy Acts," Dr Coleman says.

The FCC conference started in London on June 30 and ends today (July1).
