The Crown signed terms of negotiation with Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Te Rangi Iwi Trust in Tauranga today in a further step towards settling all historical Treaty claims in Tauranga Moana, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

Ngāi Te Rangi is an iwi of the Mataatua waka. Its members are descended from the tūpuna Te Rangihouhiri and Tamapahore, and have interests in the Tauranga Moana region including the harbour and islands.

Terms of negotiation set out the rules of engagement for a comprehensive settlement of the iwi's claims in the Tauranga Moana area.

"Today is a significant milestone for Ngāi Te Rangi," Mr Finlayson said. "The milestone will also be celebrated by other Tauranga Moana iwi as it means all three Tauranga Moana iwi have now formally entered Treaty settlement negotiations." 

The three iwi of Tauranga Moana, Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Ranginui and Ngāti Pūkenga will now be able to discuss their shared interests in a meaningful way, given they are all at about the same stage in negotiations. The three iwi have already begun some discussions on shared interests. This initiative by iwi has been encouraged by the Crown, as it is likely to expedite the negotiations process.

The Government has a goal of settling all historic claims by 2014. Since June 2009, the Crown has signed seven Terms of Negotiation, eleven Agreements in Principle and six Deeds of Settlement throughout New Zealand which represents an increase in the pace of settlements.

The Crown is also working with representatives of Ngā Pōtiki, a hapū of Ngāi Te Rangi, to determine how they might be represented in Treaty settlement negotiations.
