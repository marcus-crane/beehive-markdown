Police Minister Judith Collins today congratulated the Police for the successful conclusion of a year-long drugs operation that resulted in the seizure of more than $5 million worth of methamphetamine.

The operation, which involved Auckland Police and the Organised and Financial Crime Agency NZ (OFCANZ), netted 5kg of methamphetamine worth around $5 million, two kg of precursor drugs worth $500,000, $236,000 in cash and firearms.

Several addresses in Auckland were searched simultaneously this morning. Six people have been arrested and face drugs-related charges.

"This is a massive haul of methamphetamine which would have created misery and a wave of crime in the community had it not been intercepted by Police," Ms Collins said.

"I would like to congratulate Police for their good work in bringing this operation to such a successful conclusion, and preventing this evil drug finding its way to our streets and neighbourhoods," Ms Collins said.

Over the past year the Government has introduced a raft of new policies aimed at tackling criminal gangs and the drugs trade.

"Tackling the drugs trade is one of the Government's top law and order priorities because it is linked to so much criminal offending in New Zealand," Ms Collins said.

"Today's arrests are the result of meticulous intelligence gathering by Police. It sends a strong signal to those who try to import, produce and sell drugs that they will be caught."
