Queens Wharf will be re-developed in time for the Rugby World Cup following an agreement between the Government and the Auckland Regional Council, Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The Government will proceed with building the temporary ‘Cloud' structure at the harbour end of the wharf for fan zone activities, festival events, industry showcasing, and international media and VIP hosting," Mr McCully said. 

"Shed 11 will be dismantled and removed, while the ARC will repair Shed 10 to a sufficient standard to ensure it is safe and does not visually impair the site. ARC's share of Queens Wharf transfers to the new Waterfront Development Agency on 1 November 2010, and it will then be up to the WDA to determine the shed's long-term future.

"The Government purchased our half share of Queens Wharf because we recognised the site's enormous potential for the Rugby World Cup, and as a legacy asset for Auckland.  At times in the last few weeks our ambitions for Queens Wharf appeared under threat, but we remained determined to make the most of the opportunities presented by the tournament.

"The solution announced today ensures that we can deliver an outstanding facility for Rugby World Cup celebrations, while leaving decisions relating to the wharf's long-term development, as well as the future of Shed 10, in the appropriate hands of the Waterfront Development Agency.

"I now look forward to working with the ARC and, very shortly, the Waterfront Development Agency to complete this important project," Mr McCully said.
