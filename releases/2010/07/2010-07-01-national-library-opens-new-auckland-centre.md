The Minister Responsible for the National Library, Nathan Guy, has tonight opened the National Library's new $1.9 million Auckland centre.

"This new centre is a proud moment for library users and a great asset for the Auckland region. It is a key step in modernising services and keeping up with technology.

"The National Library plays a key role in promoting literacy by supporting around 720,000 students in over 2,500 schools across the country.

"This new centre will provide the latest technology for educators to inspire students. This is a vibrant and engaging space that will help foster the joy of reading in young people.

"It also features displays and exhibitions open to the general public, showing some of the treasures held by the National Library on behalf of the nation."

The new centre is in addition to a $52 million programme to upgrade the Wellington National Library building.
