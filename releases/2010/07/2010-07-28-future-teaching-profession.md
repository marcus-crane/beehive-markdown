Education Minister Anne Tolley is encouraging New Zealanders to have their say on the future of the teaching profession through a report currently out for feedback.

"The quality of our teaching workforce, and of school leadership, is vital to the success of every student," says Mrs Tolley. 

"That is why I commissioned an independent report, *A Vision for the Teaching Profession,* which  includes some bold discussion and proposals about initial teacher training, career progression and reward, and leadership in schools.

"The period for feedback closes on 6 August 2010, and I encourage everyone with an interest in our children's education to take part. We want teachers in training or in the workforce, principals, boards of trustees, professional bodies and parents to have their say.

"This Government is serious about lifting achievement for all young New Zealanders. An important part of that is ensuring we are attracting, training and retaining high quality teachers."
