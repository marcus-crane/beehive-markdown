Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the completion of the southern half of the Newmarket Viaduct replacement project more than six months ahead of schedule is testament to the hard work and skill of those working on the project.

The NZ Transport Agency today announced that an important milestone in the $215 million Newmarket Connection: viaduct replacement project will be achieved on September 6. 

The initial opening of three lanes on the new state of the art viaduct will allow contractors to complete a fourth southbound lane by early 2011. 

The full capacity benefits of the new structure will thereby be realised more than six months ahead of the original schedule.

Mr Joyce says the government's billion dollar boost to state highway funding has provided a secure funding pipeline which has given contractors the confidence to continue investing in people and machinery and complete projects more quickly.

"The early delivery of this new stretch of motorway will be a huge relief for the 160,000 motorists who travel over Newmarket everyday. 

"The new viaduct will make way for decreased journey times resulting in benefits for our exporters and businesses that rely on the route.

"Importantly, along with the capacity improvements associated with the Manukau Harbour Crossing and SH20 - SH1 connection at Manukau, this upgrade will allow Auckland's motorway network to be performing better than ever in time for the Rugby World Cup."

The Newmarket Connection: viaduct replacement project is an innovative urban design integrated staged replacement of one of Auckland's most vital pieces of transport infrastructure. 

The staged approach allows the NZTA to keep the motorway open throughout the replacement process while delivering significant improvements for motorists and the surrounding community.
