Social Development Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the approaching reality of New Zealand families being able to adopt Russian orphans.

Russian officials have granted a permit to ICANZ (Inter Country Adoption New Zealand) to operate an adoption programme.

"This is a positive first step, we still have to work through the details, but we are moving closer to allowing Russian adoptions," says Ms Bennett.

Russian adoptions were suspended in 2006, after which New Zealand and Russia began work on strengthening adoption protocols.

"We are satisfied the work has been done to ensure the process will be robust and we continue to work with Russian officials on that," says Ms Bennett.

While New Zealand is a party to the Hague Convention where it applies to international adoptions, Russia is not, so similar protocols must be formed.
