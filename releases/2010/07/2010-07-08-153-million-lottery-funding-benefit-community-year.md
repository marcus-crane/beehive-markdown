$153 million in lottery funding will be pumped back into the community this year, the Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

"I'm very pleased that the Lottery Grants Board has allocated the same amount of money for 2010/2011 as it did last year.

"The money raised from games like Lotto, Instant Kiwi and Daily Keno plays an enormous role in building stronger communities.

"This funding helps communities help themselves, with grants to such iconic organisations as Age Concern, St John, Barnardos, Plunket, Women's Refuges and Cancer Societies.

"Environmental causes also benefit, with funding to save the kakapo in Fiordland and preserve our wetlands in Hawke's Bay.

"Churches, marae and toy libraries for our kids all keep going with the help of lottery grants.

"New Zealand's sporting talent is getting a big helping hand with a grant of almost $31 million to Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC).

"$10.8 million has been allocated to the New Zealand Film Commission and $23.2 million goes to Creative New Zealand.

"As I've travelled around the country I've seen just how important lottery funding is in building strong, sustainable communities in New Zealand. Many organisations would struggle without this help."
