The strategy and infrastructure of the Maori Language sector is to be completely reviewed, to ensure the programmes and expenditure across the whole of government are responsive to Iwi/Maori aspirations, Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has announced.

"Government spends around $226 million every year to revitalise Maori language, in schools, through broadcasting, in programmes supported by Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Maori and so on," said the Minister.

"Most of the funding is managed by Government departments to fulfil their policies and plans. Other funding is allocated to Iwi, hapu, whanau and communities to support their projects and priorities.

"However, we need a more coordinated approach. We also need a strategy that will empower Iwi/Maori to take control of the Maori Language. I am asking the review group to consider whether responsibilities, programmes, services and expenditure are coordinated and whether or not they located with the right agencies or Māori stakeholders. By restructuring and consolidating the sector we can only achieve better results.

"A revised Maori Language Strategy will bring together all our efforts to promote and revitalise our language - a strategy that will be based on partnership between the Crown and Iwi/Maori " said Dr Sharples.

A Ministerial review group of seven language experts will carry out this review. Professor Tamati Reedy will chair the group, with Toni Waho, Hana O'Regan, Cathy Dewes, Pem Bird, Pania Papa and Rahera Shortland as members.

A secretariat from the government agencies involved will be hosted by Te Puni Kokiri. The review report is due to be presented early next year.

**Ka arotaketia ngā whakanuitanga i te reo Māori**

Ka whakamātauria, ka arotaketia whānuitia ngā rōpū whakanui i te reo Māori, me ō rātou kaupapa, kia aronui ake ai te kāwanatanga ki ngā wawata me ngā hiahia a ngā iwi Māori, e ai ki te Minita Māori ki a Tākuta Pita Sharples.

"Tata ki te $226 miriona ka pau i te Kāwanatanga ia tau, ia tau ki te whakarauora i te reo Māori, mā roto i ngā kura, mā ngā whakapāhotanga, mā ngā mahi a Te Taura Whiri, a Te Puni Kōkiri me ētahi atu," hei tā te Minita.

"Ka whakahaeretia te nuinga o ngā pūtea e ngā tari kāwanatanga ki te whakatinana i ō rātou kaupapa here. He pūtea anō e tohaina ki ngā iwi, ki ngā hapū, ki ngā rōpū Māori ki te tautoko i ā rātou mahi.

"Engari, me whakawhāiti tātou i ā tātou mahi. Me whakamana te Rautaki Reo Māori i te rangatiratanga o ngā iwi, hapū, o te reo. Mā te Rōpū Arotake e wānanga, e tika ana ngā mana whakahaere Kāwanatanga, Māori hoki; e tika ana ngā ratonga, ngā putea; e haere ana i runga i te whakaaro kotahi rānei, kāore rānei. Mā te whakatika i ngā whakahaeretanga, ka nui ake ai ngā hua.

"Mā tētahi Rautaki Reo Māori hōu, he mea whakatū i runga i te mahi tahitanga a ngā iwi me te Karauna, ā tātou mahi whakarauora i te reo e whakakotahi," hei tāna anō.

Tokowhitu ngā pūkenga reo kua tohua ki tētahi Rōpū Arotake a te Minita: Ko Ahorangi Tāmati Reedy hei Heamana, ko Toni Waho rātou ko Hana O'Regan, ko Cathy Dewes, ko Pem Bird, ko Pānia Papa, ko Rāhera Shortland hei mema.

Mā Te Puni Kōkiri e hautū tētahi ohu kaimahi kāwanatanga; ā, ka puta te pūrongo ā te wāhanga tuatahi o te tau hōu.
