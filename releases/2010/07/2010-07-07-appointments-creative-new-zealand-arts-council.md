Academic and historian Professor John Davidson has been appointed to the board of the Creative New Zealand Arts Council of New Zealand, and Alastair Carruthers has been re-appointed as chair of the council, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

The Arts Council is responsible for overall policy development for Creative New Zealand, which operates at arm's length from government in encouraging, promoting and supporting the arts in New Zealand.

 "I appreciate that Alastair Carruthers has agreed to remain as chair of the council during a time of proposed legislative change to the governance structure of Creative New Zealand," Mr Finlayson said. "I am also delighted that Creative New Zealand will have the considerable talents of Professor Davidson, who has been one of our leading academics. Professor Davidson replaces actor and writer Oscar Kightley, whom I thank for his contribution as a council member". 

Alastair Carruthers is the Chief Executive of a major New Zealand law firm, Chapman Tripp Barristers and Solicitors, based in Wellington and Auckland.   He has strategic business skills and experience in musical performance and governance.   He is a former trustee of the New Zealand String Quartet Trust and   was appointed as chair of the Arts Council in 2007.

Emeritus Professor Dr John Davidson, was until recently, Head of School, Art History, Classic and Religious Studies at Victoria University Wellington.  He has had a long career in academic work and research. Professor Davidson is a member of a number of professional organisations including being President of the Australasian Society of Classical Studies.

The Government introduced the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Bill into Parliament last month. It is intended to streamline Creative New Zealand's four governing bodies - including the Arts Council - into a single board to reduce complexity and improve its effectiveness.
