Health Minister Tony Ryall says the findings from an audit of hospital patients with acute coronary syndrome have led to immediate action.

The report is published in today's New Zealand Medical Journal, and Mr Ryall says, "The findings reinforce the need for the National Cardiac Clinical Network which was set up last year."

"The first priority was reducing cardiac surgery waiting lists, and the next area for improvement in cardiac services is the treatment of patients arriving in hospital with cardiac chest pain."

"I am advised things have improved in most regions in recent years, but the poorest access exists in the central north island 

"As a result of the cardiac network of the Midland DHBs will work together to improve access."

"We want to see patients needing angiography services getting them within 72 hours. They're currently waiting up to five days in some parts of the region."

"I have written to every DHB about the issue, and outlined the plan which has been developed by clinicians."
