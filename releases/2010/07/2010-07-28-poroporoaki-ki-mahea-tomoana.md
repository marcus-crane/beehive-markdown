**‘He toi whakairo, he mana tangata.'**

Artistic excellence reveals the essence of humanity.

*Mahea, e te whanaunga, e te rangatira, kua kapohia atu koe e te ringa kaha o aitua.*

*Kei waenganui i a matou to tinana e takoto ana, a tona wa e whakahokia ai ki to tipuna whaea ki a Papatuanuku.*

*E rere to wairua ki te rangi, ki nga haki, ki nga manu aute i whakairotia e koe hei whakaari, hei whakangahau, hei tohu mana mo o iwi.*

*E hia mano nei nga tangata o roto o Ngati Kahungunu, nau i awhina ki te whakaputa wairua, whakawhiti whakaaro, whakamau mana, na to kokiri, to whakahaere, i nga kaupapa toi.*

*Ko a ratou taonga, hei whakamaumaharatanga ki a koe, ake, ake, ake.*

Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples today expressed his condolences to the family of Mahea Tomoana, of Ngati Kahungunu, who passed away today after a sudden illness.

"Mahea's support for the arts over many years has been very influential throughout the tribal territory of Ngati Kahungunu," said Dr Sharples.

"Mahea himself was an established painter, sculptor and screen-printer, and he was well-known for the commmunity workshops he organised on Waitangi Day and Matariki, to make flags and traditional kites.

"With his wife Ngaromoana, Mahea founded the Mahia-based community arts exhibition ‘Gifted Sands' at Opoutama, which raised thousands of dollars each year for local artists.

"Mahea's drive was to support his iwi and community, and the flourishing arts scene among Ngati Kahungunu will be his lasting legacy," said Dr Sharples.
