A new-look government website launched today will help save small business owners time and money, Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Mr Williamson says the [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz/) website has been redeveloped to be a first-stop-shop for businesses in New Zealand.

"The portal will be a single repository for all the information a business person would need to start, manage and grow their business," he says.

"It will also be the doorway between small businesses and government agencies, enabling business owners to go to one place to find out about government regulations, news that may affect them, and tools to help them with their business."

Mr Williamson says the portal has a new look and improved functionality, which are designed to save small business owners time and money.

The new portal allows for an initial set of transactions with the New Zealand Companies Office and a number of other agency transactions are set to be introduced in the coming months.

"We have listened to what small business owners told us about interacting with government departments. They told us we had great tools and great information, but nobody knew where to find it," he says.

"They also said they wanted a simple, seamless way of transacting with government. I'm confident the redeveloped portal addresses those concerns and will meet their needs."

The portal was originally created in 2007 and has been updated to ensure it would continue to deliver user-friendly, better value public services.
