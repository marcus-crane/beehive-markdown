Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads overseas tomorrow on a trip that will take in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Afghanistan, and Viet Nam.

In the UAE, Mr McCully will meet Foreign Minister His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, with the agenda including New Zealand's rapidly-expanding political and trade relationship with the UAE and the wider gulf region.

In Afghanistan, the Minister will attend the International Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul on 20 July. 

"The Kabul Conference is being held at a critical time for the government and people of Afghanistan, and for all those nations - including New Zealand - who are committed to its stability and security," Mr McCully said. 

"This is the first international conference to be held at Foreign Minister level in Kabul, and to be run by the Afghan Government, which is a sign that the Afghan Government is taking greater responsibility for its own affairs."

Mr McCully will then head to Viet Nam to take part in a suite of ministerial meetings including the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Informal Consultations; the ASEAN-New Zealand Post Ministerial Conference; the 17th ASEAN Regional Forum, and the 8th South West Pacific Dialogue.

"Strengthening relationships with our regional partners is a key priority for the Government, and my attendance at these meetings signifies New Zealand's strong commitment to working together on regional and global issues," Mr McCully said.
