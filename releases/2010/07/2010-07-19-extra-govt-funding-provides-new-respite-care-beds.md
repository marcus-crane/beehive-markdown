Health Minister Tony Ryall today opened a new wing at Sevenoaks Retirement Village in Paraparaumu housing ten new respite and palliative care beds.

Three of the beds are dedicated to short term respite care funded out of the extra $5 million for respite care the government announced last year.

"This is a good example of a community identifying and meeting its own local health needs, and the result is an impressive facility," said Mr Ryall.

"The Kapiti Retirement Trust began 50 years ago to meet a shortage of appropriate accommodation for the elderly, and has followed the same principles today in identifying a shortage of respite and palliative care beds then filling that gap."

"Older New Zealanders deserve quality services in their retirement - they deserve to live as good a life as possible and it is refreshing to see communities like this one responding to the needs of their older people - and doing that well.

"The Government is committed to improving the quality and standards of care for older people. We have spent an extra $60 million on aged care and DHBs are expecting to spend more on home support next year."
