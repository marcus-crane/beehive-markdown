Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced that community pharmacies will be able to manage blood thinning therapy (warfarin) for patients, in collaboration with general practices, at up to 15 demonstration sites.

Mr Ryall says, "This will mean more convenience for these patients. They'll be seen, tested, and get their medication, all by their community pharmacist, without having to go to their GP as much."

"Doctors will sign standing orders for their patients and will designate the pharmacists who can manage each patient. Patients will have regular finger-prick blood tests and pharmacists will be able to modify the prescription in collaboration with the GP."

Anticoagulation, or blood thinning, is currently managed in GP surgeries, often by a practice nurse supervised by the GP. Patients are required to visit the GP clinic, often weekly.

Mr Ryall says, "The aim of this demonstration is greater convenience for patients, making greater use of pharmacists' skills in the community, and freeing up GPs to see other patients."

The demonstration sites will be established from October, and there will be an evaluation before the end of next year.

This demonstration is being funded by Health Workforce New Zealand, after being proposed by the Pharmaceutical Society following a successful trial in Hamilton.
