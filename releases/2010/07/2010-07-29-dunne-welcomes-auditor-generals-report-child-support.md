Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the Auditor-General's performance review of Inland Revenue's management of child support, describing it as "useful and positive".

"The Auditor-General has hit the nail on the head on a number of issues and challenges around child support, and I welcome the report," Mr Dunne said.

The report found that overall Inland Revenue is doing a good job monitoring, prioritising and collecting child support debt, but that it could do more to stop debt from accruing in the first place.

"The Auditor-General has pointed out that the system can seem complicated, particularly when it comes into people's lives at a very stressful time as a relationship breaks down.

"I also agree with the report's comments on simplifying the information available to parents, but most of all I would like to see people stay out of the child support system.

"It is very much what happens when a splitting couple cannot resolve their situation themselves and come to agreement," Mr Dunne said.

"Another valid point is that the child support scheme will work best when people comply voluntarily. That requires simplicity and parents seeing an obvious benefit to their children from the child support they are providing," he said.

Mr Dunne said he was expecting a report from Inland Revenue officials shortly, and this is likely to form the basis of a paper that he will n turn present to Cabinet.

"This is a particularly important issue, and we do need to improve the way things are done," he said.
