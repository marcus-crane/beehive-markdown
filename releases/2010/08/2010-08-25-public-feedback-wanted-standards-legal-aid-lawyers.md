A consultation paper has been released today seeking public feedback on proposed new standards for legal aid lawyers.

The proposed entry criteria and practice standards are the latest in a series of initiatives to improve the legal aid system, following Dame Margaret Bazley's critical report in November 2009.

"The majority of legal aid lawyers provide high quality services," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"However, Dame Margaret's report showed a troubling minority do not provide a level of service that the client and the taxpayer have a right to expect.

The bill is expected to receive its first reading in Parliament shortly.

The bill:

- Disestablishes the Legal Services Agency and shifts responsibility for the administration of legal aid to the Secretary for Justice.
- Establishes an independent statutory officer, the Legal Services Commissioner, who will have responsibility for granting legal aid and ensuring the independence of lawyers in the Public Defence Service.
- Allows the Secretary for Justice the flexibility to establish different legal services and deliver services in different ways.
- Streamlines eligibility for low-cost criminal cases in the summary jurisdiction.
- Allows the Secretary for Justice to contract community law centres to provide legal services.
- Replaces the Legal Aid Review Panel with the Legal Aid Tribunal, which will consider applications for review of legal aid applications.

Mr Power says people have until Wednesday 20 October to make a submission.

"It's important we gain the insights of those who have received legal aid services, as well as those who provide them, to ensure the legal aid system delivers high quality services."
