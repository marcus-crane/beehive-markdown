Health Minister Tony Ryall is declining a request to allow self-funded chemotherapy drugs to be administered in Dunedin Hospital.

News that a new private chemotherapy service is planned for Dunedin removes the primary impetus for Southern DHB's proposal to pilot 'Bridging the Gap'.

The DHB's pilot proposed to allow patients in Otago and Southland to access self-funded cancer treatment in the public health system instead of having to travel to Christchurch or beyond.

Currently patients can get publicly funded cancer drugs administered in Dunedin but must travel north to get unfunded cancer drugs.

"However, the recent announcement by Dunedin's Mercy Hospital that it will provide a comprehensive chemotherapy service in Dunedin aims to address this gap in private provision," says the Health Minister.

"The new service will mean more convenient access to self-funded cancer treatments for patients living in the Southern DHB area."

"As a result of Mercy Hospital's new service plans, with advice from the Ministry of Health, I am declining the request from Southern DHB to pilot the 'Bridging the Gap' proposal," says Mr Ryall.

"This decision will require clinicians to ensure that for those patients receiving self-funded drugs privately there is strong communication between public and private over the patient's treatment programme."
