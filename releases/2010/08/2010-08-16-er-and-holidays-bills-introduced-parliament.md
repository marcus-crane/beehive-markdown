Two new bills amending the Employment Relations Act 2000 and Holidays Act 2003 respectively have been introduced to Parliament, Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"The Government is committed to producing an employment relations system that is fair, pragmatic and helps to give New Zealanders more opportunities and flexibility," says Ms Wilkinson.

"The proposed changes announced last month have been widely debated. The extension of the 90-day trial period and the option to exchange the fourth week of leave for cash have both received a significant amount of public support.

"I'm pleased to now be able to introduce both the Employment Relations Bill and Holidays Bill to Parliament."

Ms Wilkinson says the Holidays Bill includes one late amendment in order to clarify the law around the Christmas and New Year public holidays.

"The Employment Court recently ruled that where a firm routinely shuts its doors over the Christmas and New Year period employees are not legally entitled to the public holidays that fall within that time. They would need to use annual leave to cover those days instead.

"The Christmas and New Year holidays are an established feature of the New Zealand summer. Where firms do decide to close their doors it's important that staff aren't unfairly disadvantaged by losing four public holidays.

"The law will be amended to ensure working Kiwis remain entitled to those days off, as they have been in the past."

After their first readings, both bills will be referred to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee.
