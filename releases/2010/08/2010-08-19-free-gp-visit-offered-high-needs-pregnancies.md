Demonstration projects have started where lead maternity carers (LMC) can refer high-needs pregnant women for a free GP visit, which their midwife can attend as well.

The three-way meeting will improve collaboration between midwives and GPs for these women's overall maternity and primary health care.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "In Budget 09, the Government committed to spending an extra $103.5 million over four years to support a suite of maternity initiatives."

"Demonstration projects are now underway in Canterbury and Wairarapa to provide high needs pregnant women with the option of an extra free consultation with their GP which can also be attended by their midwife or obstetrician."

"This initiative aims to improve the support and continuity of care during pregnancy for women with high needs. If the lead maternity carer can't attend the meeting, they will be informed of any decisions made at the meeting."

The women who are eligible for the extra visit are likely to have ongoing medical and/or mental health conditions and/or unhealthy lifestyles that are most appropriately managed by their GP.

"The types of extra services they may access include smoking cessation, Green Prescriptions, primary mental health services and chronic care management services."

Tony Ryall says the demonstration projects will run to December 2011, including an evaluation, before a decision is made about rolling this initiative out nationwide.
