The list of directors and chairs for the Auckland Council's new council controlled organisations was agreed to by Cabinet last week, Minister for Local Government Rodney Hide said.

Minister Hide said that those chosen were the elite in their respective fields, and testament to the quality of structure and organisation the new Auckland Council represents.

"The Government has been fortunate in being able to appoint men and women of such high calibre. In New Zealand, we have a small, but rich, pool of talent, and these are people whose talents would be welcome anywhere in the world. What is more, they are all Aucklanders," he said.

"This CCO team has extensive experience in a multitude of sectors, from finance to diplomacy. It includes a solid foundation of eleven people who have experience in working on the boards of the Auckland region's existing CCOs."

Transport Minister Steven Joyce also welcomed the appointments to Auckland Transport, which will be chaired by Mark Ford - currently chairman of the Auckland Transition Agency.

Auckland Transport will replace the nine separate existing transport entities across the city.

Mr Joyce says the result will be an agency equipped to provide the focus and continuity in decision-making needed to deliver a transport network that supports Auckland's growth and economic success.

"Given the role and functions of Auckland Transport, it is imperative to ensure the board has a good mix of commercial, infrastructure and local government experience. I'm also pleased with the continuity that will be brought to the table by having both the current and former chairs of ARTA serving on the new board.

"I am very impressed with the makeup of this Board and look forward to working alongside them and the new Auckland Council following next month's elections," said Mr Joyce.  
The appointments are for a term of between one and three years. Furthermore, the Auckland Council will be able to appoint between one and three additional directors to each of the boards once the council is established.  
Mr Hide noted that there was a very high level of interest in the positions, with over 200 nominations received for the 31 roles.  
The Auckland Council's new CCOs include Auckland Council Investments Ltd (ACIL), Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development Ltd (TEED), Regional Facilities Auckland (RFA), Auckland Council Property Ltd (ACPL), Auckland Waterfront Development Agency (AWDA), and the statutory entity Auckland Transport.  
Remuneration per annum for directors and chairs was determined by way of benchmarking against comparable organisations, including other CCOs and state owned enterprises, as well as a range of private sector organisations.

The asset base, budgets, revenues and staff size, as well as the complexity and level of risk, were all taken into account when recommending fee levels.  
As such, ACIL, TEED, RFA and ACPL's directors initial fees per annum will be $35,000, deputy chairs $43,750 and the chairs $70,000.  
For the AWDA directors fees will be $40,000, the deputy chair $50,000 and the chair will earn an initial fee of $80,000 per annum.  
Auckland Transport's directors will earn $52,500 its deputy chair will earn $66,625 and the chair $105,000 per annum.  
The Auckland Council will establish its own remuneration policy for CCOs once it is in place.  
Watercare is a continuing council organisation until it becomes a full Auckland Council CCO in June 2012. Its existing Board will stay in place, with no further appointments announced.

The Auckland Transition Agency gathered the nominations which were forwarded to Ministers for their consideration and decision following an initial assessment by Sheffield Search.

"The new CCO directors will be effective from November 1, ensuring that the Auckland Council will be ready for business from the start.

"We only have to wait for the October election and the new Auckland Council will be up and running under a single Council and mayor, working to help Auckland reach its potential," Hon Hide said.

Note: Please note that these positions will become formalised through being published in the New Zealand Gazette on 3 September.
