Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has extended warm congratulations to Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae on his appointment as Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau. 

The appointment was announced by Prime Minister John Key earlier today.

"Lt Gen Mateparae has had a distinguished military career culminating in his appointment as the Chief of Defence Force in May 2006. 

"His period of command has been marked by a very high operational tempo and several major acquisition programmes.

"He has shown outstanding leadership and is highly respected throughout the Defence Force and in the defence environment overseas," Dr Mapp said.

"Lt Gen Mateparae has had a leading role in formulating and carrying out the Defence Review.  His deep experience has been invaluable in the Review.

"It has been a privilege working with Lt Gen Mateparae. He has provided exceptional leadership and has set a high standard for his successor."

The process to appoint Lt Gen Mateparae's successor has begun and an appointment will be announced towards the end of the year, the Minister said.
