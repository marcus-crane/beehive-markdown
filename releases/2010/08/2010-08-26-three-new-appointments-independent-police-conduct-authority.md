Ms Hauk-Willis and Ms Macaskill have been appointed for three-year terms, and Mr Woods has been appointed for two years.

The IPCA consists of up to five members appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of Parliament. The IPCA is currently chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard. 

"Under Justice Goddard's leadership, the IPCA will continue to be a rigorous and independent watchdog," Mr Power said.

"These appointments give it a range of management and governance experience required by a Crown entity board."
