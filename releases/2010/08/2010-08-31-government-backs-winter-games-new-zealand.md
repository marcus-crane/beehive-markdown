Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today that government will contribute up to $750,000 from the Major Events Development Fund to support Winter Games New Zealand 2011.

"Winter Games New Zealand is a home-grown event - New Zealand owned and managed.  It offers elite international winter sports competition across the Otago and Canterbury regions in the northern hemisphere's off-season," Mr Brownlee said.

The government contribution secures the Winter Games for a second year.  This will provide a platform for the event to build its reputation and critical mass, enabling it to become a recurring biennial event so that in the next few years Winter Games New Zealand will become self sustaining and independent of government support.

The event will run over 16 days from 13 to 28 August and includes alpine skiing, cross country skiing, winter triathlon, free skiing, snowboarding, curling, ice hockey and figure skating.

"Winter Games New Zealand is the biggest winter sports event outside the Winter Olympics with last year's inaugural event attracting over 800 of the world's top snow and ice sport athletes from 41 countries. 

"The number of competitors, spectators and tourists is expected to increase when the event is held for the second time next year," Mr Brownlee said.

"The event organisers are implementing a formal programme to take advantage of the opportunities the event will generate for New Zealand.

"Maximising international media coverage so that New Zealand is marketed as a premier winter destination is a major goal," Mr Brownlee said.
