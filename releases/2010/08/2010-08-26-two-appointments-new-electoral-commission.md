The Government today named two members of the new Electoral Commission, which has been created as part of the Government's wider programme of electoral reform.

Justice Sir Hugh Williams QC has been appointed chairperson, while Robert Peden will be Chief Electoral Officer.

"Parliament has unanimously endorsed the new commissioners, who will begin their roles with a focus on the Mana by-election, the next general election, and the referendum on our voting system," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"Justice Williams will provide the new commission with strong legal leadership.

"As president of the existing Electoral Commission he is well informed on the issues and complexities associated with preparations for the next general election.

"Likewise, Mr Peden has been Chief Electoral Officer since 2006 and his appointment provides valuable continuity.

"I intend to ask Parliament to consider the appointment of the deputy chair of the commission in the near future."

The new Electoral Commission will be an independent Crown Entity and will take over the functions and responsibilities of the Chief Electoral Office and the current Electoral Commission. 

It will be fully functional by 1 October 2010 and will be responsible for all electoral functions at a national level, including public education, research, conduct of general elections, by-elections, and referenda.

A second bill is planned that will transfer the functions of the Chief Registrar of Electors to the Commission in 2012.
