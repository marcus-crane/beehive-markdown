New Zealand is giving another $2 million to international flood relief efforts in Pakistan, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"It is now estimated that over 20 million people have been affected by the floods. Close to 1500 people have died, and more than a million homes have been destroyed," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand was one of the first donors to respond to the emergency - initially contributing $2 million through UNICEF, the Red Cross, and other NGOs active in Pakistan.

"However with the full extent of the disaster becoming increasingly apparent, and with the situation continuing to worsen, the Government has decided to make a further $2 million contribution to relief efforts.

"The additional funds will go to the United Nations Pakistan Emergency Response Fund."

Mr McCully said cash donations of any size, rather than the donation of goods, were always the best way for ordinary New Zealanders to assist relief efforts following humanitarian disasters.
