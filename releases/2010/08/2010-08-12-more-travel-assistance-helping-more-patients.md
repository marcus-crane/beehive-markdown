Increased funding and greater awareness of the National Travel Assistance (NTA) policy has seen more people getting more financial help from the Government with their travel expenses for specialist health appointments.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "We have refunded $33.7 million in the year to June, which is $6.2 million more than the previous year."

"Part of that is due to the fact that in March last year, this Government increased allowance people could claim for the first time in 20 years.

"And that has helped lift the number of registrations, or claims for mileage or accommodation. Two years ago there were just over 142,000 registrations, and in the year just finished there were more than 193,000 registrations."

"The reasons are greater promotion and awareness of the programme, and the higher reimbursement rate."

The aim of the NTA Policy is to improve access to specialist health or disability services for people who have to travel long distances, incur high travel costs as a result of frequent visits, or have significant financial need.

The NTA support has always been intended to help, rather than fully reimburse actual costs.

Mr Ryall says, "In tough financial times every bit extra is a help, especially for people who have health issues that are not easy to manage close to home."
