Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson is welcoming Phil Goff's restatement of support for the Government's move to give workers more choice over their holidays.

"Phil Goff clearly sees the fourth week issue as sensible policy that offers choice to workers.  Asked about his position on radio again he said it was a question of choice and he reiterated Government policy, which includes built-in safeguards for employees."

On the Farming Show this week, Mr Goff was asked: *"Why have you done a flip flop on it?" PHIL GOFF: "Well no I think it is about choice but there's two things that you have to take into account for that. Firstly, is there a genuine choice on the part of the worker to make that decision? And secondly you know, are they going to come under pressure?"*

"It now seems Mr Goff's gone back to the sensible position he first occupied.  That is Government policy and we welcome his support," says Ms Wilkinson.

"I'm pleased that he has finally arrived at this conclusion after a week of discussion about what the Opposition's position actually is.  

"Considering Mr Goff himself told Q&A on Sunday ‘I have never tripped up, I have never stuffed up', I can only conclude this is the definitive Labour Party position."
