Prime Minister John Key says that at the request of Act Party Leader Rodney Hide, he has accepted the resignation of Heather Roy as a Minister in the National-led Government.

"Mrs Roy tendered her resignation in writing to me today," says Mr Key.

"Following Mrs Roy's resignation, Mr Hide requested I advise the Governor-General to appoint John Boscawen as the second Act Party Minister, as agreed under the National-Act confidence and supply arrangement. I have done so this afternoon.

"Mr Boscawen is to be appointed Minister of Consumer Affairs.  In addition he will be Associate Minister of Commerce," says Mr Key.

"Mr Hide will be given Associate Education portfolio responsibilities, and will no longer be Associate Minister of Commerce.  There will be no Associate Minister of Defence.

"Mr Boscawen will be sworn in tomorrow by the Governor-General."
