New Zealand will provide $2 million in emergency aid to Pakistan following severe flooding in the north west of the country, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"The flooding in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan is the worst in living memory. It is estimated that over 1400 people have died, and a further three million have been affected. Houses, roads, and bridges have also been badly damaged, and it will be some time before the full extent of the disaster can be assessed," Mr McCully said.

"It is important that New Zealand supports international efforts to provide emergency shelter, drinking water, food, and medical supplies.  Health organisations are also concerned about the

risk of a cholera outbreak, and it is important that aid agencies move quickly to avoid further loss of life from disease."

Mr McCully said New Zealand's funding would be shared between Red Cross, United Nations relief agencies and NGOs that are already working in Pakistan.
