Employers are set to benefit from changes to temporary work visas Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

‘'The new interim visa is a bonus for businesses. In most circumstances it provides continuity in the workplace as employers have the security of knowing their staff member can continue working legally while Immigration New Zealand processes their application,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'For some time temporary migrants have been falling through the gaps because in the period between applying for a new permit and receiving that permit, their legal immigration status has lapsed. Knowing they can maintain lawful status while applying for a new visa will provide peace of mind for migrants.''

The visa will be introduced in March next year and the changes are part of the new Immigration Act which comes into effect in November.

Dr Coleman also confirmed new sponsorship provisions will be introduced in November. It allows organisations and government departments to sponsor migrants when previously only individuals could.

‘'Allowing organisations and government agencies to sponsor under the Talent and Visitor policies better reflects the sponsorship needs of stakeholders, such as community and sporting groups,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'Sponsorship is also key to protecting the Crown from the costs of people accessing New Zealand's publicly-funded services without entitlement. Those who sponsor the entry of the foreign national can be held liable for debts the person incurs.''
