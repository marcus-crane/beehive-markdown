There are now 100 extra paramedics filling ambulance rosters around the country as part of the Government's $48 million four-year spend to support national ambulance services.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "We now have in place extra paramedics in more than 40 centres throughout New Zealand, particularly in many smaller towns.

"Otaki has three new paramedics, and as a result, the number of incidents that two officers attend has doubled from 44% to 88%."

Otorohanga and Te Kuiti each have two extra paramedics, which means an ambulance officer will be on duty in the town seven days a week, with one on duty every night supported by another on call.

New paramedics at Kaitaia, Dargaville, Kaikohe, Waihi, Paeroa and Thames mean all these communities now have 24 hour, seven day a week cover.

Wellington's reliance on volunteer staff to fully crew ambulances has reduced, and average number of ambulances available both day and night has increased.

"This means a much better ambulance service for many thousands of New Zealanders, up and down the country," Mr Ryall said  
A list of where the extra paramedics have been deployed is attached.
