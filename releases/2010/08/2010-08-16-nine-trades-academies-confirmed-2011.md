Education Minister Anne Tolley has confirmed that nine Trades Academies will open around the country in 2011, providing trades and technology programmes for over 800 secondary school students.

"This Government continues to deliver on its promise to give young New Zealanders the opportunity to reach their potential," says Mrs Tolley.

"Trades Academies are a vital part of the Youth Guarantee and provide an innovative approach to keeping 16 and 17 year olds engaged in education, as they develop their vocational skills and talents through trades and technology programmes."

The Academies are based on partnerships between schools, tertiary institutions, industry training organisations and employers. They enable students to earn both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, while gaining practical skills in the workplace.

"Our young people need a flexible education system and Trades Academies will provide a great advantage for those following an industry-related career."

The nine Trades Academies opening in 2011, which will call for enrolments soon, are:

- Tai Tokerau Trades Academy (Northland)
- Southern Cross Trades Academy (Auckland)
- Eastern Bay of Plenty Trades Academy (Whakatane)
- Waikato Trades Academy (Hamilton)
- New Zealand Primary Industries Trades Academy (Auckland)
- Primary Industries Trades Academy (Wairarapa/Hawkes Bay/Taranaki)
- Wellington Trades Academy
- Canterbury Trades College (Christchurch)
- The New Zealand Virtual School Trades Academy (South Otago)

Further Trades Academies are also scheduled to open in Taranaki, Hawkes Bay and the West Coast in 2012.

"These Academies will be great for students and for the country as a whole," says Mrs Tolley.

"As well as providing more career choices for students, with no fees, they will contribute to growing our economy and productivity as young people with better skill levels enter the labour market."

Trades Academy students will still be enrolled at school but may study at another site, for example at a workplace or polytechnic, on some or all days throughout the term.
