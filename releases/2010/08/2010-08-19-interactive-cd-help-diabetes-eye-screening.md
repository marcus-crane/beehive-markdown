An interactive CD for health professionals developed to help raise awareness of diabetes eye screening, has been launched.

Heath Minister Tony Ryall said, "This interactive CD supports the evidence on the benefits of eye screening, and will support the training and practice of photo-screeners, ophthalmologists and optometrists," Mr Ryall said.

The *Diabetes Retinal Screening Interactive CD for Health Professionals* was developed jointly by the University of Otago and the Ministry of Health.

The CD was identified as a priority within *Diabetes and Cardiovascular Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) (2008*).  

The CD is a learning tool, which provides an opportunity for health professionals to review a patient's case history and eye photos to diagnose the extent of eye disease and recommend the date for their next eye screen or referral to treatment.  

"Research suggests that around 70 people in New Zealand become blind each year as a result of diabetes. To reduce the number of individuals who are at risk of blindness, retinopathy screening is provided free to New Zealanders who have diabetes."

The screening workforce consists of photo-screeners, optometrists and ophthalmologists.  

Copies of the CD are available at no charge, by ordering from:
