Minister of Consumer Affairs John Boscawen today released the annual reports of Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal (MVDT) adjudicators Chris Cornwell and Nicola Wills for the period July 1 2009-June 30 2010.

"The MVDT provides a low-cost option through which consumers can have motor vehicle disputes addressed.  These reports summarise applications the Tribunal dealt with during the year," Mr Boscawen said.

"The Tribunal received 245 dispute applications - an increase on the 228 received for the year ended June 2009.  I note that the Tribunal found in the consumer's favour in around 70 percent of cases, and that almost 80 percent were decided using the Consumer Guarantees Act.  I congratulate the adjudicators for managing the increased workload and thank them for their good work.

"The adjudicators' reports also make recommendations for amendments to legislation based on the Tribunal's experience.  At present, all cases found against a trader must be published and the adjudicators have again recommended that the Motor Vehicle Sales Act be amended to allow the Tribunal to publish decisions against a trader at its discretion.

"The adjudicators also suggested that the Act needs to be amended to allow for the publication of a manufacturer's details when found to be at fault, not just those of the trader.

"These issues are being considered as part of the 'One Law' review of consumer legislation currently being undertaken by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs," Mr Boscawen said.
