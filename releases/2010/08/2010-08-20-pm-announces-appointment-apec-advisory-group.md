Prime Minister John Key today announced the appointment of Maxine Simmons as one of New Zealand's three representatives on APEC's Business Advisory Council (ABAC). Maxine Simmons joins New Zealand's current representatives, Tony Nowell and Gary Judd.

Maxine Simmons has a background in biotechnology, and currently runs a company focusing on advising early-stage biotechnology ventures. She was also a founding director of Industry New Zealand, a forerunner to New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

"Maxine's strong understanding of the commercialisation of science will add great value to the work of the Council," Mr Key says.

"ABAC plays a major role in stimulating support among the Asia-Pacific business community for APEC's trade and investment agenda.

"New Zealand's ABAC representatives play a valuable role, and I look forward to working closely with them in the lead-up to the APEC and ABAC meetings in Yokohama in November, and also in 2011 when the US hosts APEC," Mr Key says.

Established in 1995, ABAC's main function is to provide advice, from a business perspective, to APEC leaders each year on the implementation of APEC's work programme on trade and investment liberalisation. It reports to leaders at their annual meeting on the basis of a series of discussions held during the year.
