It is with great sadness that Prime Minister John Key has learned of the death of a soldier serving with the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan, Afghanistan.

The soldier was killed in an attack while he was on patrol.

Another two New Zealand Defence Force personnel and a local interpreter in the patrol were also injured.

"This is New Zealand's first combat loss in Afghanistan and reinforces the danger faced daily by our forces as they work tirelessly to restore stability to the Province.

"This soldier's contribution and that of all New Zealand Defence Force personnel should never be underestimated.

"It is with enormous sadness that I acknowledge that this soldier has paid a high price and my thoughts are with his family and the families of the injured."
