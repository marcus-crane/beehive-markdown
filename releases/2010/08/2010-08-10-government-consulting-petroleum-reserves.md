Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee today released an options paper aimed at improving the quality of information available about petroleum reserves.

Getting better information is an important part of the government's petroleum action plan, which is aimed at unlocking the potential of New Zealand's abundant resources to create a wealthier and more prosperous country. 

The options paper also responds to a specific action item arising from the electricity industry review.

Current and forecast movements in oil and gas reserves are the first and most important factor in all forecasts of future oil and gas availability and supply.

The information is provided by industry and compiled and published by government.

"Reserves information is important to the Crown as owner and manager of the Crown's petroleum estate, and it is important to a range of users for future planning decisions," Mr Brownlee said.

"Having good information out there in the right form will help everyone make good decisions."

The Options Paper proposes three options:

- 1\. Carrying out more extensive analysis of existing information, but with no regulatory change.

<!--THE END-->

- 2\. Extending the information reporting requirements to include information on a wider range of potential resources, in a similar way to the United Kingdom.

<!--THE END-->

- 3\. Extending the reporting requirements further to allow the government to come to a full independent assessment of reserves estimates, in a similar way to Norway.

**Feedback on the options paper closes at 5pm on Friday, 10 September 2010.**

The options paper and information on the submissions process is available at [www.med.govt.nz/upload/70853/NZ\_Petroleum\_Reserves.pdf](http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/70853/NZ_Petroleum_Reserves.pdf)

 

**Questions and answers**

**What are petroleum reserves?**

Reserves are those quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable. Reserves are further categorised in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates, and may be sub-classified based on project maturity and/or characterised by development and production status.

**What are the Government's objectives regarding the reporting and publication of petroleum reserves?**

- Ensuring a reasonable degree of consistency in estimation methodologies between fields and companies;

<!--THE END-->

- Improving the accuracy and precision of reported reserves;

<!--THE END-->

- Widening the spectrum of reported reserves so that all stakeholders have a view of both the upside and downside potential at existing fields and can manage their risk accordingly.

**What are the principal concerns with the current reporting regime?**

- There is a perceived lack of confidence in the accuracy, precision and consistency of reserve information currently reported by industry and published by government.

<!--THE END-->

- The quality and quantity of petroleum reserve data is not sufficient to allow government to independently verify and validate reserves estimates.  This in turn negatively impacts the government's ability to optimally manage the Crown's petroleum estate.

<!--THE END-->

- Neither the government nor industry stakeholders have any visibility of the upside potential at existing fields.  Confusion arises where prominent market participants express views on future gas supplies which are far more bullish than what is supported by published reserve data.

**How do I make a submission?**

The government is inviting feedback on the proposals set out in the options paper.  This will help the government make decisions on how to progress its petroleum action plan, including the review of the Crown Minerals Act and broader regulatory settings around petroleum being undertaken concurrently.

Submissions should be made by 5.00pm, Friday 10 September 2010 by email to [petroleumreserves@med.govt.nz](mailto:petroleumreserves@med.govt.nz) or by post.  Details on how to make a submission are provided at the front of the options paper.
