Young New Zealanders will be able to spend a year working, studying and holidaying in Brazil from September 1, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

The New Zealand-Brazil Working Holiday Scheme allows 300 young New Zealanders to travel to Brazil each year, and offers reciprocal rights to the same number of young Brazilians.

"This is a wonderful opportunity for young Kiwis aged between 18 and 30 to spend a year sampling the life and culture in Brazil," Mr McCully said.

"At the same time the scheme will see a growing group of young Brazilians developing a real affinity and understanding of New Zealand, which will have a positive impact at a time when the relationship between our two countries is steadily gaining in importance at political, commercial, and cultural levels."

The Brazilian Embassy in Wellington will start accepting Working Holiday Scheme visa applications from Wednesday, September 1.
