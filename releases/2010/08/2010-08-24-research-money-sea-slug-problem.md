Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has announced that Nga pae o te Maramatanga, one of eight Government-funded Centres of Research Excellence, would provide $250,000 over two years to investigate the sea slugs plaguing Auckland beaches.

The sea slugs contain tetrodotoxin, the same poison found in puffer fish, and were last year found to be responsible for a number of dog deaths.

The Cawthron Institute will collaborate with the Hauraki Maori Trust Board on the two-year project. It will determine if there is risk in harvesting seafood from the Hauraki Gulf.

"Information that will help us deal with these sea slugs is a top priority," the Minister said.

"They are already a danger to people and their pets. We need to know whether they are a wider threat to seafood.

"This research is a significant project not only to Maori but also regionally, nationally and internationally," Dr Mapp said.

"New Zealand is a world leader in marine science. This vital research for Auckland and Hauraki iwi allows experts in marine ecology and toxicity from the Cawthron Institute in Nelson to engage and work with local iwi," he said.

Based at Auckland University, the Centre (formerly the National Institute of Research Development and Advancement), facilitates projects deemed important to Maori.

The Nga pae funded project is the first major piece of research into tetrodotoxin since its discovery on Auckland beaches last year following the deaths of a number of dogs.

Toxic slugs have been found at a number of beaches along the North Shore, including Narrowneck and Milford beaches and in Torpedo Bay.

Last week toxic slugs were also found on Kohimarama Beach - the first time sea slugs have been found on any Auckland City beach, on the south side of the harbour.
