Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the reappointment of Frank Handy as the Secondhand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Licensing Authority.

The role of the Pawnbrokers Act 2004, under which the appointment is made, is to make it harder for criminals to dispose of stolen goods through secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers, and to make it easier for police to recover stolen goods and solve property crimes. 

The main functions of Mr Handy's job are to issue licences and certificates, maintain public registers, and conduct public hearings into police objections and complaints.

"Mr Handy has been in the role since 2005 and I'm confident he will continue to perform his functions ably."

Mr Handy is a former partner and chairperson of the law firm Rudd Watts and Stone. He has been a sole practitioner since 1999. From the early 1980s he was involved principally in commercial transactions, and commercial and construction disputes. He has been an adjunct instructor for the College of Law in Wellington since 2004, and has held appointment as an Acting Student Allowances Appeal Authority.
