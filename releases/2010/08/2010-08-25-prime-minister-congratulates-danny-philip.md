Prime Minister John Key today congratulated new Solomon Islands Prime Minister Danny Philip on his election.

Mr Key says, "Solomon Islands is an important partner for New Zealand in the Pacific region. I look forward to working with Mr Philip to further strengthen our relationship.

"Our relationship is broad and deep, and has developed over many years of close association. It includes successful initiatives such as the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme, our development assistance programmes in key areas such as education, fisheries and transport, and our ongoing contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands."

New Zealand remains committed to supporting sustainable economic development in a safe, secure Solomon Islands.

Mr Key also acknowledged the tenure of outgoing Prime Minister Dr Derek Sikua.

"Dr Sikua's government worked hard to make Solomon Islands a better place for all Solomon Islanders. I wish him and his family well for the future."
