‘The use of a consistent measurement standard over time allows for accurate comparisons of the gender pay gap figures. Such consistency will ensure that the outcomes are reliable and credible, and can be relied on by observers and commentators.' said Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong.

‘There is a range of different measurement standards for gender pay gap, including the median weekly earnings, the average hourly earnings, the median hourly earnings, the average hourly earnings, and the full time median hourly earnings. Comparing these measurements at random will create confusion and offers an inaccurate picture of the real situation.

‘Since at least 2004, the Ministry of Women's Affairs has been measuring gender pay gap by comparing the "median hourly earnings of men and women" figures as generated by the annual New Zealand Income Survey. The median hourly earning is not influenced by the value of benefits received, and is less influenced by the number of hours than weekly earnings are.

‘The latest available annual New Zealand Income Survey figure from June 2009 shows a gender pay gap of 11.3 percent, down from around 12 percent since 2001.'

Mrs Wong said that gender pay gap is a priority for the Ministry of Women's Affairs, which has received an additional $2 million funding to tackle this issue.
