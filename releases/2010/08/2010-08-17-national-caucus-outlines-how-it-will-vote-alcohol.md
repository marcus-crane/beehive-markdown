The National caucus has agreed on how it will vote on upcoming legislation concerning alcohol reform.

Justice Minister Simon Power today led discussions with his caucus colleagues ahead of the Government announcing its alcohol law reform package, while Transport Minister Steven Joyce led a discussion around drink driving measures.

As a caucus they agreed to:

- A party vote on the alcohol law reform package, which is due for its first reading before the end of the year.
- A conscience vote on the alcohol purchase age.
- A party vote on all transport legislation designed to reduce the impact of drink driving on our roads.

"The National caucus agreed that voting for the alcohol legislative package along party lines, with the exception of the purchase age, will ensure the bill provides a consistent, coherent, and enduring regulatory framework for our alcohol laws," Mr Power said.

"However, National MPs will be able to exercise a free vote on the alcohol purchase age, recognising that this is a conscience issue."

Transport Minister Steven Joyce said the caucus also held further discussions around measures to reduce the impact of alcohol on our roads.

"The caucus has affirmed that all transport safety measures will continue to be voted on as a party," Mr Joyce said.

It is intended that legislation enabling the following will be in place by early next year:

- A zero drink drive limit for recidivist drink drivers.
- A zero drink drive limit for drivers under 20 years of age.
- Much tougher penalties for serious offences causing death and drink driving causing death.
- The introduction of alcohol interlocks for repeat drink-drivers.
- Research to be conducted to determine the level of risk posed by drivers with a blood alcohol limit of between 0.05 and 0.08.

Mr Joyce said once research is complete, the Government will revisit the issue of whether or not the blood alcohol limit should be reduced.

"In the meantime, I stress that 0.08 is not a target.  People whose judgement is impaired by alcohol should not be driving regardless of their measured alcohol level - if they are they can be charged with careless or dangerous driving or for being incapable of having proper control of the vehicle."

It will be up to the caucus of each political party to decide how they will vote on alcohol legislation.

The Government will announce its alcohol reform package shortly.
