A tax policy issues paper released today is seeking feedback on two sets of suggested changes to remove uncertainty on matters relating to the depreciation of assets, including the fit-out of non-residential buildings, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has announced.

The Government announced the review of the tax treatment of building fit-outs during Budget 2010.  The review was prompted by concerns about the treatment of non-residential building fit-outs. 

The officials' issues paper suggests an option to clarify the law on when non-residential fit-outs can be depreciated separately from the building. 

The second clarification relates to the grandparenting of depreciation loading for certain assets acquired before Budget 2010. 

The issues paper suggests that depreciation-loading should apply when there was a commitment to purchase or construct an asset prior to 20 May 2010. 

"The tax system aims to impose taxes on investment in as neutral a manner as possible to remain fair.  For this reason, it is appropriate to examine these depreciation issues and address them," Mr Dunne said.

The issues paper, *Post-Budget depreciation issues* is available at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/).  Submissions close on 1 September 2010.
