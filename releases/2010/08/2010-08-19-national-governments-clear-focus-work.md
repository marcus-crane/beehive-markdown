Legislation aiming to break the cycle of welfare dependancy and get more people in work signals a turning point says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Changes to welfare law rebalancing incentives and obligations and providing a greater focus on work, are fair and reasonable says Ms Bennett.

"I know these are tough times but you won't find a job unless you're looking and that's what we expect people to do," says Ms Bennett.

This week legislation extending the 90-day trial period to all employers and employees also takes another step in Parliament.

"This is a great week for New Zealand, with two pieces of legislation encouraging job opportunities and removing the barriers to work," says Ms Bennett.

"This Government is growing a stronger economy, creating more jobs for New Zealanders and making it easier for employers to take on staff," says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

The Employment Relations Amendment Bill will be read for the first time today.

Changes to the welfare system include:

- Work testing for DPB recipients with a youngest child aged six and over
- Unemployment Beneficiaries required to re-apply after one year
- Increased abatement rates making 28,000 people better off
- Effective sanctions that don't penalise dependant children

The Social Security (New Work Tests, Incentives and Obligations) Amendment Bill passed 65-55 last night.
