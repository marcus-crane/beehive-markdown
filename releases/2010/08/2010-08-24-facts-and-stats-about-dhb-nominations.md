Health Minister, Tony Ryall says "A total of 375 people have put their names forward for places on the 20 District Health Boards in the upcoming elections.

"District Health Boards are big, complex organisations with big budgets and large staff numbers. Several have budgets over a billion dollars per annum. Budgets range from $100 million to $1.2 billion."

"In many parts of New Zealand, the local DHB is the biggest employer and the biggest organisation.

"Waitemata has the highest number of candidates with 33, while the two Southern DHB constituencies (Otago and Southland) have the fewest candidates with 11 each.

- 119 incumbent members are standing (113 elected; six appointed) which is 31.7% of all candidates.
- 60% of the candidates are men and 40% are women.
- 80% of incumbent elected members are standing for re-election.

"The responsibilities and challenges for DHBs are significant, especially as they look to improve frontline services in the context of making every dollar count.

"Despite the difficult economic times, DHB budgets have increased by over $400 million this year," says Mr Ryall.

A table of who is standing in each DHB is attached.
