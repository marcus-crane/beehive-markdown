The Environmental Protection Authority is expected to receive infrastructure applications totalling more than $6 billion by the end of next year, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

"The national consenting option provided in the first phase of the Government Resource Management Act reforms has attracted a high level of interest in applications," Dr Smith said. "This new one-step process overseen by the Environment Protection Authority, or EPA, requires a decision within nine months with limited appeal rights.

"There have been real problems with resource consenting with infrastructure projects like the Wellington Inner City Bypass taking 15 years, the Whangamata Marina taking 12 years, the Northern Gateway taking 10 years and the Wairakei geothermal expansion taking six years.

"The EPA has already received two major applications - Contact Energy's $1 billion Tauhara II geothermal station near Taupo and last Friday received an application from the New Zealand Transport Agency for the $2 billion Waterview Connection on State Highway 20.

"The EPA is also aware of six other major infrastructure projects that are likely to be lodged with it over the next year, including Transmission Gully in Wellington and the Stage 2 motorway in Christchurch. The expected total infrastructure investment being considered by the EPA during this term of Parliament is worth more than $6 billion.

"These changes to efficiently process major infrastructure projects are an important part of the Government's economic and jobs strategy that is starting to pay dividends."
