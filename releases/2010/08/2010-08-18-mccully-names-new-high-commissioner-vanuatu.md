New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Vanuatu will be career diplomat Bill Dobbie, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"New Zealand has a warm and long-standing relationship with Vanuatu, and we work closely in regional organisations such as the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community," Mr McCully said.

"Vanuatu is also one of our most significant development partners in the Pacific, with the bilateral aid programme worth $19 million a year, targeted at improving economic and education opportunities, as well as governance and security issues.

"Vanuatu is also an important participant in New Zealand's Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme, with over 2500 workers coming here each year to work temporarily in the horticultural and viticultural sectors," Mr McCully said.

Mr Dobbie, most recently Director of the Audit Review Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Wellington, has previously been posted to London and Apia. He takes up his post in February, replacings Jeff Langley, who will return to Wellington.
