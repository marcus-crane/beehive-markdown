The Ohau Channel Diversion Wall in Lake Rotoiti is proving a major success diverting nutrients from Lake Rotorua and improving the water quality, Environment Minister Nick Smith says.

"Though it's still early days, the clarity of Lake Rotoiti has improved quite markedly since the diversion wall was completed in October 2008.  Although neighbouring Lake Rotorua has had algal blooms since the wall was erected, they have not appeared in Lake Rotoiti with the nutrient flow going directly down the Kaituna River," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith was on-site today to see first-hand how the diversion wall is contributing to improving the water quality in Lake Rotoiti. Accompanying the Minister were members of an Australian-New Zealand joint steering committee who are overseeing a review of Australasian water quality guidelines. 

"With its picture postcard scenery, world-class trout fishing and reputation as a boating and recreational playground, Lake Rotoiti is a key tourism asset for New Zealand. This wall and other projects are reversing the decline in water quality in the Rotorua lakes which are taonga and of major importance to Te Arawa," Dr Smith said.

"The Government has shown its commitment to the Rotorua Lakes, Te Arawa, and Rotorua community not just through the $4 million contribution to the Ohau Channel Wall Diversion, but also through $72.1 million to restore four of the most degraded of the Rotorua lakes.

"The Government is determined to improve water quality in New Zealand and innovative solutions such as the Ohau Channel Diversion Wall show real progress can be made by working closely with local authorities and iwi."
