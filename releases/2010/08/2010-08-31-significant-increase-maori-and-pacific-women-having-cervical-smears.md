More women have had cervical smears as part of the National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) during the past three years, says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

"Having regular cervical smears can reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by 90 percent," says Mrs Turia.

About 160 New Zealand women develop cervical cancer every year and about 60 die from the disease.

In the 36 months to January 2010, 54 percent of Maori women had cervical smears as part of the Programme, compared with 47 percent in the 36 months to September 2007.

In the 36 months to January 2010, 59 percent of Pacific women had cervical smears as part of the Programme, compared with 47 percent in the 36 months to September 2007.

Mrs Turia says Maori and Pacific women have lower cervical screening rates and higher rates of cervical cancer.

"It's therefore great news that screening rates for these women have increased, potentially saving lives and greatly reducing their chances of developing cervical cancer."

Mrs Turia is crediting the increase to the successful public education campaign urging women to have smears so they would be there for their whanau.

"We have had extremely positive feedback about the campaign, and in particular the advertisements featuring Pacific women and using humour.

"In September we are launching new commercials which we hope will be equally well received by women, and will continue to encourage women to have regular cervical smears."

She says the increase in screening numbers is also attributable to health promotion activities and the efforts of providers to recruit women to the programme.

September is Cervical Screening Awareness Month and Mrs Turia is urging women to use the month as a prompt to think about when they last had a cervical smear.

"Most women between the ages of 20 and 70 should have a smear every three years, and many women will get a reminder from their smear taker when their smear is due.

"Ultimately cervical screening is about saving lives and adding to the lifespan of our mothers, aunties and daughters.  What better goal can there be than that."

Cervical Screening Awareness Month is coordinated by the National Screening Unit, in partnership with Stayfree. For more information go to [www.cervicalscreening.govt.nz](http://www.cervicalscreening.govt.nz/).
