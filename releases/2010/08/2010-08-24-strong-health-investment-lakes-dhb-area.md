Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Lakes District Health Board has posted big improvements in key services over the past year.

Immunisation is a particular success story. In the first half of 2009-10 Lakes had the lowest immunisation coverage of the 21 DHBs, yet by year end had exceeded the target of 85 per cent of two year olds fully immunised.

The improvement in the ED target is also impressive. At the start of the 2009-10 year it was at 82 per cent and by year end had met the target requiring 95 per cent of patients to be admitted, discharged or transferred from an Emergency Department within six hours.

"Lakes DHB has received an extra $28.4 million from the Government over the last two years, and is investing strongly in improving health services," said Health Minister Tony Ryall.

During the year ended 30 June 2010, Lakes DHB treated 39,160 people from the Rotorua and Taupo districts and delivered 163,257 procedures, assessments, education contacts, ED visits, community and home visits.

During that time Lakes DHB also delivered 3248 elective procedures, up from 3,082 in 2009.

"While people in the Lakes DHB area received improved health services in 2009-10, Lakes DHB also again finished the year on budget," said Mr Ryall.

"The DHB had budgeted for a deficit but came in with a modest surplus this year."

The Health Minister says in 2009-10 Lakes DHB brought significant capital projects on stream including:

- Construction began on the $83 million redevelopment of Rotorua Hospital
- $2.9million spent on replacement or upgraded clinical equipment, including radiology, ultrasound and theatre items.
- $3.7 million upgrading patient management and other information systems
- Paimarie Whanau Accommodation - five new units to house families of acutely unwell patients, who come from out of town
- Commencement of the construction of the new laboratory building

"During the year the Lakes DHB has provided services to more patients, staff have completed more procedures, and significant results have been achieved in the six Health Targets.

This is the result of great teamwork at Lakes DHB, and the staff should be well pleased with what they have achieved so far," said Mr Ryall.
