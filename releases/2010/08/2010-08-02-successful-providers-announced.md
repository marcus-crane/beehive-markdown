Thirty one Maori health, disability and social service providers have successfully gained contracts through Te Ao Auahatanga Hauora Maori, the Maori Health Innovation Fund, says Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

Last year Mrs Turia announced that Te Ao Auahatanga Hauora Maori would invest up to $20 million over the next four years in the design, development, promotion and delivery of innovative whanau ora driven health services.

"A lot of Maori providers have already adopted innovative ways to tailor their services beyond what was reasonably expected.

"This fund will support them with the resources they need to grow those innovative services or develop new ones that have a whanau ora approach.  The key emphasis running in all contracts is that they will improve Maori health outcomes."

"The successful proposals confirmed that these organisations have the capacity and capability to build, share and model innovative whanau ora services throughout Aotearoa," says Mrs Turia.

The Ministry of Health received 231 Registrations of Interest from Maori organisations interested in Te Ao Auahatanga Hauora Maori funding.

Forty nine were invited to submit full proposals for consideration by an expert panel comprising consultant Amster Reedy, health professional Dr Keri Huia Ratima and educator, Toni Waho.

"This fund acknowledges the spirit of innovation among Maori in health and I look forward to seeing it help turn the tide on the health of our people."
