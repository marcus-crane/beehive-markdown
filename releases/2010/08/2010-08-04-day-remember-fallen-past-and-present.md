On the 96th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins today called on New Zealanders to remember service personnel who have lost their lives in conflicts past and present.

On 4 August 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany following the German invasion of Belgium. New Zealand, as part of the British Empire, quickly entered the war. 

A total of 120,000 New Zealanders enlisted during the course of the war, with just over 100,000 serving overseas. Around 18,500 New Zealanders died and nearly 50,000 more were wounded during the war.

"Place names such as Gallipoli and Passchendaele remain in our consciousness today.  The memory of those men and women who served in the First World War is honoured on hundreds of war memorials throughout New Zealand.

"While the last of our Great War veterans has passed away, it is vital that we keep their memory alive. I would urge all New Zealanders to pause and remember their acts of courage and sacrifice today.

"On a day when we have learned of the terrible loss of Lt Timothy O'Donnell and injuries to two fellow soldiers in Afghanistan, we also pay tribute to the New Zealand Defence Force staff deployed on peacekeeping operations and UN missions around the world.

"We mourn the loss of Lt O'Donnell, we remember the ANZACs who have fallen in the name of peace and freedom, and we hold our serving men and women overseas in our thoughts and look forward to their safe return home."
