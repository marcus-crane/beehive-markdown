Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today opened the redeveloped Midland Regional Forensic Psychiatry Service at Waikato Hospital.

The $10 million upgrade of the forensic 44-bed unit of the Henry Rongomau Bennett Centre involved the construction of two new buildings - a rehabilitation ward (Kokiri) and a Whare for cultural activities. In addition the existing forensic ward was refurbished.

Dr Coleman says the new facilities will allow the delivery of a more effective model of treatment and rehabilitation for forensic patients. Another key feature of the redevelopment is the amalgamation of two providers to deliver one service.

Health Waikato and Hauora Waikato (Māori mental health service) will jointly provide this service to the Midland region for Waikato, Lakes, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki DHBs. Up to 70 percent of admissions are Māori.

‘'The collaboration between partners marks a significant step in the delivery of forensic mental health services. It allows us to pool expertise, facilities and resources to provide more effective treatment to patients and better engagement with their whanau,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'The service's new name, Puawai, evokes the ultimate aim of forensic psychiatric services - a new start through rehabilitation and reducing the chance of re-offending. It's a very complex area, but this model aims to provide the right care at the right time.''
