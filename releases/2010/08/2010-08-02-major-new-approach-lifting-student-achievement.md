Education Minister Anne Tolley has today announced a major new approach to lifting achievement for all students, alongside the $36 million in support for schools identified as needing extra help through National Standards.

"Schools will now receive direct and focused Ministry of Education support," says Mrs Tolley.

"Principals and teachers have told me that this is the kind of direct assistance which has been needed for a long time, and I've instructed the Ministry to make significant changes to the way it operates.

"Up until now it has concentrated on administering the system. From now on the Ministry will have a much stronger focus on frontline support in schools, as we give every young New Zealander the chance to reach their potential.

"National Standards will provide vital data on student achievement in reading, writing and maths, which will enable support and resources to go where they are most needed."

There are three core elements to the new approach.

Firstly, expert practitioners from the Ministry and the education sector will be appointed to work closely with schools and build strong relationships.

"These experts will have proven ability in lifting student achievement, and will give specially-designed support to schools to meet the specific needs of their students and teachers. They will use student data to assess where support will be most effective, and make sure schools get help much earlier."

Secondly, the $36 million announced for National Standards in Budget 2009 will go towards new intervention programmes being developed for students who need extra support in reading, writing and maths, over and above good classroom teaching.

"One in five of our children are being failed by the schooling system," says Mrs Tolley.

"National Standards will help us identify which children are struggling, and this next stage in the process will help schools to get these students back on track.

"We need programmes in place that provide tailored, specific and concentrated support for students and for teachers.

"These programmes will be monitored closely to make sure they are making a difference in classrooms.

"Lastly, I have asked the Ministry to redesign its approach to professional development for principals and teachers.

"The Government invests $86 million a year in this area, and we need to make it much more targeted, to ensure it helps schools lift student achievement.

"A range of organisations will now be able to bid for funding to supply professional development, with the Ministry selecting high-quality providers with proven skills in providing support that accelerates student progress, across all subject areas.

"This recognises that our teaching professionals want to do a good job for their students, and deserve quality support so they can keep up with the latest developments in effective teaching, leadership and assessment practices."

Work on the new approach to lifting student achievement will begin straight away, initially focusing on primary and intermediate schools, and will be fully operational by June 2011. A wider plan will be developed for secondary schools and rolled out to them in 2012.

"This intense frontline focus is needed to ensure that every student is on track to achieve at least NCEA Level 2," says Mrs Tolley. 

"It is an exciting and innovative way forward for schooling, as the Government delivers on our promise to give every child in New Zealand the opportunity to succeed."

**Frequently asked questions and answers**

**Why is this approach being taken?**

The Government is lifting the bar for achievement in New Zealand schools.

All schools need to set ambitious goals for every student, and put effective plans in place for all students to achieve those goals.  The new approach will ensure schools are well supported to meet the needs of all students, especially those who are at risk of not being on track to gain at least NCEA level 2.

**Why is this change happening now?**

The introduction of the New Zealand Curriculum and National Standards provide the opportunity for the Ministry to strengthen its work with schools on student achievement, in particular literacy and numeracy. National Standards data will identify the students needing extra support, and the schools requiring targeted professional development. 

**How does it differ to the current approach?**

Currently, the Ministry's work with schools focuses on a range of areas, including student support and administration. Regional offices will continue to manage these areas.  What will change, however, is the significantly increased emphasis on student achievement and targeted support for schools.

**What difference will schools notice?**

The change will mean different things for different schools, depending on the level of support they need. All schools, however, will see a stronger focus from the Ministry in supporting them to lift student achievement.  Where a school needs intensive support to lift student achievement, the Ministry will work with that school much earlier, to ensure it gets the kind of support required.

**How many expert practitioners will be appointed to directly support schools?**

At least fifty practitioners, from within the Ministry or appointed from the sector, will have close relationships with schools or clusters of schools. Some schools will require very little support, while others will need intensive short and longer-term help to lift achievement levels.

**How does this approach fit with the work of the Education Review Office?**

The Ministry will work closely with ERO to examine the progress of schools in lifting student achievement. ERO's role is to evaluate and report on schools.  The Ministry will continue to monitor and support schools.

**What evidence is there that this will work?**

There is an abundance of evidence that targeted professional development, intensive programmes for students and clear goal setting make a difference for students. 

**Will there be new programmes to help students with literacy and numeracy?**

Yes, and resources. The $36 million in additional funding for National Standards announced in the 2009 Budget will be used to develop and pilot resources and evidence-based programmes for students who need support, over and above high quality classroom teaching. Examples of this could include:

- Access to a specialist literary teacher and/or individual or small group support for students struggling with literacy.

<!--THE END-->

- Specialist resources for maths focused on five key points in learning. There are clearly identifiable points where students get stuck when studying maths. Support will be targeted to help students get over those hurdles so they can continue learning.

<!--THE END-->

- More schools able to use Reading Together, a programme which helps parents support their children reading at home.

**What's being done to help those students beyond year 8 who need help with literacy and numeracy?**

After working with secondary sector representatives, a wider plan will be rolled out to secondary schools in 2012.

From next year (2011) there will be specific literacy and numeracy unit standards at NCEA level 1. Numeracy and literacy requirements for University are built into the Achievement Standards for level 1 and level 2.

**How much is being budgeted for these changes?**

The change in approach will be funded from within the existing baseline of the Ministry and is expected to cost $10 - $12 million each year.  In addition, $36 million appropriated in the 2009 Budget will help schools support students to meet the National Standards.

**What does this means for the Ministry of Education's regional staff who work closely with schools now?**

This approach is about strengthening the work of the regions so that they have increased capacity to work more closely with schools specifically on raising student achievement.  The Ministry will be releasing more details in the near future.

**Will this mean the Ministry's central office reduces in size, with regional offices growing?**

The Ministry will be building the expertise in regional offices. Further work is being done on how this will affect staff numbers at national office and in the regions.
