Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Roger MacDonnell to the board of TVNZ and the elevation of Joan Withers to deputy chair.

Mr MacDonnell was a founding partner of the Colenso BBDO advertising agency and retired as Chairman in 2008. During his long career with Colenso he provided marketing and communications advice to many top corporations and was a former president of the Advertising Agency Association of New Zealand.

He is currently the director of an independent publishing company and chairs a Sydney-based recruitment agency. Mr MacDonnell replaces Rob Fenwick as a director on the board and has been appointed until April 2013.

Ms Withers, a fulltime company director, was appointed to the TVNZ board in October 2009. She was previously the CEO of Fairfax New Zealand from 2005 until June 2009.

‘'Roger's extensive background in advertising and marketing will be invaluable for TVNZ as it looks to recover from the advertising slump which has hit the industry hard,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'His experience strengthens the board further and Joan's elevation to deputy chair is another bonus given her wealth of media and commercial expertise. I would also like to thank Rob for his work as deputy over the years.''
