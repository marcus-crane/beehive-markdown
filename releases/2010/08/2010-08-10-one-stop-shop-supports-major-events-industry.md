A one-stop shop resource that helps support the major events industry in New Zealand was launched by Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee at the New Zealand Association of Event Professionals *Eventing the Future Conference 2010* in Christchurch today.

"The Events Resource Bank is a practical resource for New Zealand major event organisers and owners that draws on the ‘tried and true' knowledge and expertise of New Zealand's most experienced and successful event professionals," Mr Brownlee said.

"While the resource is targeted at major event organisers the information is relevant to events of all types and sizes.

"It supports the major events industry in New Zealand so organisers can ensure consistently high standards of delivery and we can continue to build our international reputation for excellence in event hosting."

The Events Resource Bank contains best practice information, examples, checklists and templates that can readily be adapted or adopted for different events.  It covers a number of areas including: health and safety; security and accreditation; workforce and volunteers; marketing; sponsorship; environment and sustainability; border and transport; and post-event reporting.

The material will be continuously reviewed and updated, with additional topics being added, and 'lessons learned' from events, incorporated as they happen.

"Providing support to event organisers and sharing ideas is the key to an increasingly successful New Zealand events industry," Mr Brownlee said.

The Events Resource Bank has been developed by the Ministry of Economic Development's New Zealand Major Events unit, in partnership with the New Zealand Association of Event Professionals.  It is available on the New Zealand Major Events website at [www.majorevents.govt.nz](http://www.majorevents.govt.nz/)
