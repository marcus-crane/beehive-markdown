Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has today announced the appointment of three new members to the New Zealand Registered Architects' Board, including Warwick Bell as the new chair.

Mr Bell and Anthony Van Raat have been appointed for five year terms and Christina Van Bohemen for three years. Helen Tonkin, an accountant and existing member of the Board, has been reappointed for two years.

"Mr Bell is a registered architect who has held a number of board appointments and has significant experience of governance," Mr Williamson says.

"He also brings extensive academic experience to the role. Mr Bell has been a part-time tutor and lecturer at Victoria University's School of Architecture for 20 years." 

Mr Williamson said Warwick Bell replaces Professor Gordon Holden, whose term expired this year, and who decided not to stand again.

Anthony Van Raat had been the Head of the School of Architecture at Auckland's Unitec Institute of Technology since 2002. He has also been the president and secretary of the Association of Architecture Schools of Australasia. He replaces Carolyn Bull.

Christina Van Bohemen was nominated by the New Zealand Institute of Architects and replaces Ron Pynenburg.

The Registered Architects' Board was established under the Registered Architects' Act 2005 and regulates the New Zealand architecture profession. It develops and administers rules about competency standards and ethics. It also handles complaints and disciplines members of the profession. 

Mr Williamson thanked Professor Holden, Ms Bull and Mr Pynenburg for their contribution to the Board.
