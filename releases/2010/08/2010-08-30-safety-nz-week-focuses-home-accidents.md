Twelve New Zealanders are dying every week and 12,000 are injured as a result of accidents in their own homes, ACC Minister Nick Smith says.

"One in seven, or 632,920 New Zealanders were injured in their homes last year and 621 people died from their injuries.  These are alarming statistics with the majority of the injuries caused by slips, trips and falls," Dr Smith said.

"This week is Safety NZ Week and the focus by ACC this year is to highlight that many of these accidents could have been avoided.

"To avoid the risk of injury, New Zealanders should make simple changes in the home such as remembering to turn on the light switch when using stairs, or properly securing a ladder when cleaning roof gutters. Last year in New Zealand 5400 people were injured while using a ladder at home. That's 104 every week or 15 a day.

"It is only right that ACC continues to focus on safety in the home where there is a public misconception that it is safer than other environments. One in three accidents are sustained at home and last year the cost of looking after people injured in their own home was $622 million.

"Injury prevention starts in the home. If we all take simple steps to ensure where we live is safe, then we reduce the risk of accidents and injuries."
