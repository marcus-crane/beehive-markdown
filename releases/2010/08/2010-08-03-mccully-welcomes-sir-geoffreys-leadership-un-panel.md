Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the decision by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to appoint Sir Geoffrey Palmer to head the UN's Panel of Inquiry into the flotilla incident off Gaza in May.

"Sir Geoffrey has had a long and distinguished career, and his recent work as New Zealand's Whaling Commissioner has demonstrated his standing in the world of international law and diplomacy," Mr McCully said.

"Sir Geoffrey has been appointed personally by the Secretary-General after extensive consultation with representatives of Israel and Turkey.

"He will be acting entirely as an independent expert, and in no way as a representative of the New Zealand Government. Sir Geoffrey is taking on a challenging and demanding task, and I wish him well in his work - the long-term goal for this government, and for others, is an enduring peace for all in the Middle East.

"I understand that Sir Geoffrey will not be making any comments to the media now that the process for the inquiry is underway," Mr McCully said.
