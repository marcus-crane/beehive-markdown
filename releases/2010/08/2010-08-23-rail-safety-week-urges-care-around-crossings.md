National Rail Safety Week is a timely reminder for all drivers, cyclists and pedestrians to be aware of the dangers around rail tracks and level crossings, says Associate Minister of Transport Nathan Guy.

"New Zealanders need to take responsibility around level crossings and on rail tracks to stay safe, and take on the message to ‘stop, look and live'," says Mr Guy.

"Over the last decade there were 55 deaths at level crossings and 97 people were been killed as a result of trespassing on train tracks.

"Already this year there have been 27 level crossing collisions and one fatality. These are sobering statistics and I urge everyone to exercise caution and common sense when approaching a level crossing.

"This year National Rail Safety Week is focusing on the ‘Call It In' campaign for reporting of near collisions at level crossings. I strongly support every KiwiRail, Tranz Metro and Veolia train driver in their efforts to report all near misses at level crossings around the country."

Rail Safety Week runs from 23 - 29 August and aims to improve safety at rail crossings and reduce trespassing on rail tracks. It is coordinated by KiwiRail and the Chris Cairns Foundation and jointly funded by the NZ Transport Agency, KiwiRail, Veolia, Auckland Regional Transport Authority, Tranz Metro and the Chris Cairns Foundation.

A billboard campaign, school visits and the display of a car wreck from a train collision are planned around the country.

"Rail in New Zealand has an exciting future with projects underway including the KiwiRail Turnaround plan and major upgrades to the Auckland and Wellington networks. More freight and passengers are predicted to use rail in coming years, making safety even more important.

"The Government contributes up to $1 million per year to upgrade level crossings with warning lights, bells, and half-arm barriers. This contribution is made up of $500,000 from the Crown and $500,000 from the New Zealand Transport Agency.

"Of course there is only so much the Government can do - the decisions that people make at level crossings are often the difference between life and death. A little patience and commonsense will help reduce these preventable tragedies."
