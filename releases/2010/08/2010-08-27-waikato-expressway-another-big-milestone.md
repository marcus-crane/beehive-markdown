Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the announcement today that the next stage of development of the Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway is underway is an important milestone for the project.

The NZ Transport Agency has awarded a $6.5 million contract for the work which includes preliminary design, more detailed engineering work and securing resource consent.  It will take three years to complete and is a key step before construction begins.

"Once complete, the Hamilton section of the expressway will reduce traffic congestion and improve safety on Hamilton's local road network by removing through traffic," says Mr Joyce.

He says the Waikato Expressway is a priority for investment because of the economic and safety benefits it will bring both regionally and nationally.

"This section of SH1 is the main southern road access to Auckland, and links New Zealand's 'Golden Triangle' of population and economic growth - Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.

"Pre-election National committed to having the Waikato Expressway completed within ten years of National taking office.  It remains a big challenge we're committed to this goal in government and we're a further step closer today.

"The contract awarded today is an important step towards getting the Expressway designed and built so that these benefits can be realised.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities," says Mr Joyce.
