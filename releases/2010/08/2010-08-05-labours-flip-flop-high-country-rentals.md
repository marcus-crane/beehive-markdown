Agriculture Minister David Carter has welcomed Labour's flip-flop on high country rentals which now sees it supporting the Government's new policy of basing rentals on earning capacity.

"This is a major backdown by Labour considering its implementation in 2007 of a rent formula that ignored earning capacity and charged rent for views and amenity values," says Mr Carter.

"Labour has finally realised that simply giving a sheep a lakeside view doesn't give it the ability to grow more wool and produce more income.

"Damien O'Connor should acknowledge it was his government that caused stress and frustration for high country farmers by attempting to charge them exorbitant rents, in some cases higher than the gross income of the farm.

"Labour's ‘greedy landlord' approach ignored the ability of these farmers to sustainably manage the land.

"National has now sorted out Labour's mess and is allowing farmers to get on with the job of farming and looking after the high country rather than fighting bureaucracy," says Mr Carter.
