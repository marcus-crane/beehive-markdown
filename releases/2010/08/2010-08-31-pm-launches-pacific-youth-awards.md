High-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders will be recognised for their outstanding contributions through the newly-created Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards.

Launching the awards at Bishop Viard College in Porirua today, Prime Minister John Key says the initiative is designed to celebrate the endeavours of young Pacific people across a range of disciplines, as well as provide a platform for further achievement and leadership.

"New Zealand's Pacific population is growing. A large of part of our country's international competitiveness will depend on how well we capitalise on the skills and talents of Pacific New Zealanders, and it's vital young Pacific leaders are recognised for their achievements and potential," says Mr Key.

The three awards are:

- The University of Auckland Award for Leadership
- The Weta Award for Creativity
- The Cogita Software Award for Inspiration

"I am delighted one of our top tertiary institutions and two globally-successful businesses have come on board to help some of our most talented young people seize new opportunities," says Mr Key.

"These awards will help develop leadership potential among Pacific youth, as well as opening up career or study options for the recipients."

Nominations for the awards close on 11 October, with winners announced on 19 November.
