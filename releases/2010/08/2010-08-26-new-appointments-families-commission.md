Minister of Social Development Paula Bennett has announced the appointment of two new part-time Families Commissioners to replace outgoing Commissioners.

James Prescott and Robyn Scott have been appointed Families Commissioners for the next three year term commencing 1 September 2010.

"I am delighted Mr Prescott and Ms Scott are joining the Families Commission, they are both highly capable people who will make a strong contribution," says Ms Bennett.

James Prescott is of Tongan heritage with a background in research and education.

He was a former chairman of the Pacific Island Education Resource Centre.

As chief executive of Philanthropy NZ, Robyn Scott is also experienced in applying research to the social sector and dealing with families.

The outgoing Commissioners David Smyth and Sandra Alofivae have completed their three year term and will serve until 31 August.

"I am grateful to Mr Smyth and Ms Alofivae for the work they have done for the Commission and I thank them for their contribution," says Ms Bennett.
