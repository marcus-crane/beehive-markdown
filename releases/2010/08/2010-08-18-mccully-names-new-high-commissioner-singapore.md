New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Singapore will be career diplomat Peter Hamilton, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Mr Hamilton will also be cross-accredited to the Republic of Maldives.

"Singapore is one of New Zealand's closest friends. It is a key partner for us in South East Asia, and has long been a strong supporter of New Zealand's participation in Asian regional processes," Mr McCully said.

"We are also both outward-looking nations, and our perspectives on many global and regional issues intersect. Singapore is New Zealand's our fifth-largest bilateral trading partner, and we have close defence ties, with our forces having served together in Afghanistan, and continuing to train and exercise together regularly.

"Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo visited New Zealand in June, and we agreed the bilateral relationship was in excellent shape. The challenge now is to come up with innovative ways to take it to new levels."

Mr Hamilton is currently Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has served as Ambassador in Berlin, and High Commissioner in Apia, and also been posted to Suva, Ottawa, and Geneva.

He replaces current High Commissioner Martin Harvey, who is returning to Wellington.
