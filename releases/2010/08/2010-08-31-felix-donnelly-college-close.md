Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Felix Donnelly College in South Auckland is to close on 27 January 2011.

"Following consultation last year I am satisfied that the complex needs of the students are not being met at the school and that it should close," says Mrs Tolley.

The special school, which has a lengthy history of serious management and governance issues, has had a Commissioner in place since early 2007.

It currently provides education for 35 young people with a range of social, learning and behavioural problems which cannot be catered for in a mainstream school. Many of these children are in the care of Child, Youth and Family.

"A new state school will open in 2012 on the former Waimokoia School site to provide the specialist care and education that these children deserve. 

"This new approach will see each student being assessed for their behavioural and social needs when they enter the school. Individual learning programmes will then be developed, with regular evaluations on how each student is progressing."

Following the closure of Felix Donnelly College, current students and those who may be enrolled through CYF next year will be provided with education through a private provider until the new school opens.

The Ministry of Education and other government agency staff including Child, Youth and Family, will ensure that processes are in place to support the children through the forthcoming transition stage.

"The new school will support effective management, teaching and learning, pastoral care and cultural leadership. That is what these children need if they are to lead successful lives."
