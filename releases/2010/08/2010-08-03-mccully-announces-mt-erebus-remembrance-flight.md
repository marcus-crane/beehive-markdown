Up to 80 family members of the victims of the 1979 Mt Erebus disaster will have the opportunity to join a remembrance flight to Antarctica this summer, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Following the 30th anniversary of the Mt Erebus disaster last year, it was felt that one final opportunity to visit Antarctica should be extended to family members of those who died," Mr McCully said.

"As a result, the Government has been working with Air New Zealand to provide such an opportunity through a Royal New Zealand Air Force 757 flight to Pegasus Airfield near Scott Base.

"As the crash site on Mt Erebus is difficult to get to, there will be a remembrance ceremony at the Scott Base flagpole. Weather permitting, participants will be able to view Mt Erebus from there.

"This event will be an important final milestone for the Mt Erebus disaster, and will offer remaining family members to achieve a degree of closure to an event that was, and still is, keenly felt by the nation.

"The flight will be supported by Antarctica New Zealand and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and will be subject to the usual operational requirements of working in Antarctica's extreme climate.

"The Government is also extremely grateful for the essential support the flight will receive from the United States National Science Foundation," Mr McCully said.

Air New Zealand will operate an independent ballot for seats on the flight, open to immediate family representatives of passengers, cabin crew, and flight crew.

Two hundred and fifty-seven people died when flight TE 901 crashed on Mt Erebus on November 28 1979, in New Zealand's worst aviation disaster.
