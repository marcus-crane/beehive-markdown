Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has announced a comprehensive support package for New Zealanders to provide a home for life for a child in care.

"We have more than 5,000 children in Child Youth and Family custody and every one of those kids deserves a secure home," says Ms Bennett.

"This is about removing the obstacles to taking a child on permanently and giving them a better life," says Ms Bennett.

The support package for families to provide a Home for Life includes:

- Financial support for clothing and other costs ($2,500 upfront payment)
- Babycare pack - cot, pushchair, bottles and babywear
- Reasonable assistance with legal costs
- Expert CYF support for as long as necessary
- Parenting seminars
- Respite breaks for carers to get some time out

"There are over 2,000 foster carers currently, many of who may be able to offer a child permanency, this package supports them to do that," says Ms Bennett.

"But it's open to any New Zealander who is considering welcoming a child into their home - we want to give them every support possible," says Ms Bennett.

A dedicated support person from CYF will walk potential carers through the legal process and assistance will be provided to get correct entitlements.

The support package is designed to meet the financial, practical and individual support the child and family needs.

"Offering a foster child a home for life, means they're no longer in State care and finally they belong somewhere, which gives them the security they need to start enjoying being a child," says Ms Bennett.

Anyone wanting to know more about caring for a child should call 0508 CARERS or email homeforlife@cyf.govt.nz

"A home for life is an opportunity to offer your lifelong commitment to a child who needs you."
