Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu QSO today attended the formal opening ceremony to mark Level 2 of the Specialist Courts and Tribunals Centre in the Gen-i Tower, Auckland, becoming fully operational. 

The Gen-i refit and subsequent move by the specialist courts is part of the Ministry of Justice's strategy for Auckland - the Auckland Service Delivery Programme - which is implementing ways for the courts to deliver improved and cost effective justice services to Auckland's growing population.

With the Employment and Environment Courts in Auckland housed under one roof in close proximity to Auckland District Court, this is the first step in creating a specialist facility for tribunals and specialist courts.  Consolidating the Courts into a shared space will improve operational efficiencies and bring a raft of benefits for all court users.

Speaking at the opening, Minister te Heuheu said that "well supported and capable court facilities enhanced public and legal confidence in the delivery of justice", and that the new centre would undoubtedly achieve this.

The new centre comprises two primary courtrooms, with courtroom 1 being one of the largest in Auckland, fully equipped with video conferencing and digital evidence recording and a multi-purpose courtroom for smaller hearings, judicial conferences and mediations.

Minister te Heuheu said that "the new accommodation would enhance the administration and delivery of justice for both courts".
