Prime Minister John Key has underlined New Zealand's commitment to supporting Vanuatu's economic development at a ground-breaking ceremony with Vanuatu Prime Minister, Edward Natapei, for the nation's new passport office.

Mr Key is in Vanuatu for the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Meeting.

"Since 2008, Internal Affairs staff from New Zealand have been working with their Vanuatu counterparts to develop a passport system in-line with international standards," says Mr Key.

"The new system will contribute to greater security in the Pacific by both reducing the potential for fraud and identity crime, and helping ni-Vanuatu take advantage of economic opportunities overseas, like New Zealand's Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme," says Mr Key.

To date, almost 2500 ni-Vanuatu have taken advantage of the RSE scheme.

Mr Key said the passport assistance is part of New Zealand's growing aid partnership with Vanuatu, which is worth $19 million in 2010/2011.

"Our development programme with Vanuatu is significant and is targeted at improving economic opportunities, education, and safety and security issues."

On Wednesday, the two Prime Ministers also witnessed the signing of a Tax Information Exchange Agreement as part of international efforts to strengthen cooperation in the area of tax evasion and tax avoidance.
