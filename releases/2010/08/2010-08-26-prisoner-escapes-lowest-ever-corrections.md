The number of escapes from New Zealand prisons has reached a record low, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said today.

During the 12 months to 30 June 2010, nine prisoners escaped from Corrections custody - the lowest number since the Department of Corrections was established in 1996.

The nine escapes compares to 12 escapes in the 2008-2009 year and 23 escapes in the 2007-2008 year.

"I'm delighted that new measures introduced by Corrections have made it more difficult for prisoners to make a break for freedom," Ms Collins said.

"A new security classification system, more sophisticated perimeter fencing, new detection and surveillance systems, improved intelligence and single points of entry at our prisons are paying off in fewer escapes.

"This dramatic reduction in escapes comes at a time when there are more prisoners behind bars than ever before.

"Keeping the public safe from our most difficult and dangerous people is the No 1 priority of Corrections. I would like to congratulate Corrections staff on their good work in further lowering the number of escapes from our prisons."

Of the nine escapes in 2009-2010, three were breakout escapes (from Wellington, Auckland and Waikeria prisons). A further five escapes occurred when prisoners absconded from their place of work. One prisoner absconded from hospital.

All escapers have been recaptured.

Last year Ms Collins asked the Corrections Department to review the eligibility of every prisoner employed in work parties outside prisons because they had the most opportunities to escape.

The new security classification system tightened the criteria that a prisoner must meet to be considered for employment in a work party outside the prison perimeter.

All walkaway escapes that occurred in the 2009/2010 year took place before the new security classification system was implemented.
