The Crown and Ngāti Kuia have initialled a Deed of Settlement for historical Treaty claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

"This initialling brings the completion of a full and final settlement with Ngāti Kuia a step closer," Mr Finlayson said.

The deed of settlement initialled with Ngāti Kuia sets out in detail an offer for redress which will settle Ngāti Kuia's historical Treaty of Waitangi claims. It will become a final settlement if it is ratified by members of Ngāti Kuia and implemented through settlement legislation.

Ngati Kuia signed a Letter of Agreement in February 2009 together with Ngāti Apa Ki Te Ra To and Rangitāne o Wairau, negotiating collectively as Kurahaupō ki te Waipounamu.

The claims of Ngāti Kuia cover Te Tau Ihu, the top of the South Island, and relate primarily to the failure of the Crown to adequately recognise the customary rights of Ngāti Kuia in pre-1865 purchases of land. Its claims also relate to the Crown's failure to set aside adequate reserves and to ensure that Ngāti Kuia retained sufficient lands for their future needs.

Today's initialling brings to a conclusion the first of eight settlements with iwi who have interests in Te Tau Ihu. Negotiations with the eight iwi have been progressed on a regional basis, and are intended to lead to settlement of all remaining claims in the South Island. The Crown is currently in the final stages of negotiations with these groups and hopes to initial deeds of settlement with them shortly.
