Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) are spending nearly a fifth less time on tax matters than they did just five years ago, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

In releasing an Inland Revenue report, *Changes in SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2009: Evaluation report 2,* he said it shows the time it took to attend to their tax requirements dropped by 17.5 percent.

"These findings are particularly significant when businesses are operating in a very tough world today.

"Yes, they need to meet tax requirements, but the more we can cut the time and cost of compliance, the better," Mr Dunne said.

He said the report also showed that changes that had reduced the amount of time businesses needed to put into meeting their tax obligations had also cut reported stress levels.

"Again, that is a good sign - we want business focused on doing business and succeeding for themselves and for the New Zealand economy," Mr Dunne said.

He said the positive changes are the result of a determined Government focus on minimising compliance costs over the past five years.

"Inland Revenue has done well on this and is focused on continuing to streamline its requirements," he said.

The report shows that overall compliance costs for SMEs have dropped by 1.3 per cent in the past five years.

Mr Dunne said that drop was small but significant when the costs of the introduction of KiwiSaver and more employees repaying student loans within that period was considered.

"The 2004 survey set the baseline for tax compliance costs prior to the introduction of GST and provisional tax alignment changes. The baseline was set before the introduction of KiwiSaver, the Independent Earners Tax Credit and a raft of other changes brought in with the 2009 tax package created new costs."

The report is available on the Inland Revenue website at
