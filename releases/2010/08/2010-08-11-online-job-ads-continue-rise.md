The total number of job vacancies advertised online continues to rise, up 39.6% since July 2009 and by 7.6% over the last three months.

The number of *skilled* jobs advertised online increased by 8.2% over the last three months and by 36.7% over the last year.

‘The economy took a big hit from the recession and it's a long haul back from there, but we can see the picture is improving, albeit slowly," says Ms Bennett.

Advertised skilled jobs across all regions and major industry and occupational groups continue to grow.

The biggest increases by industry over the three months to July this year were in construction and engineering (up 13.3%) and IT (up 7.1%).

Auckland has seen the strongest growth in advertised skilled jobs (up 10.1%).

"We know some people are still struggling to find work and things remain tough, but the jobs are coming in and people need to be ready for them," says Ms Bennett.  

Advertised skilled jobs outside of the main centres have also increased with the South Island (excluding Christchurch) up by 8.6% and North Island (excluding Auckland and Wellington) up by 6.5%.

*Jobs Online* was launched in December 2009 and collates data from New Zealand's leading online job advertisers Trade Me and SEEK.
