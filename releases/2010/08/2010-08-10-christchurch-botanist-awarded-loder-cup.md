A Christchurch botanist who has spent his lifetime studying, protecting and teaching others about New Zealand's native plant life has been awarded one of the country's highest conservation honours, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson announced today.

Dr Colin Burrows has been awarded the prestigious Loder Cup for a catalogue of achievements including:

- Leading and supporting projects throughout the South Island, including active involvement with the famous Save Lake Manapouri Campaign in the 1970s, and currently helping drive the Otamahua/Quail Island restoration in Lyttelton Harbour.
- More than 33 years as a teacher and half a century working as a botanist, scientist, researcher, writer, and ecologist.
- A vast array of written work, including a 2005 book on New Zealand botany pioneer Julius Haast, described by New Zealand Geographic as ‘much more than a normal biography'.

"This prestigious Cup is awarded for outstanding service and commitment to the protection of New Zealand's native plant species. It is a fitting tribute to Dr Burrows," Ms Wilkinson says.  

"He has had a long involvement and contribution to Canterbury's natural history, particularly the South Island mountain environments. For over 50 years he has been inspiring others as a researcher, mentor and teacher, and as a role model for community conservation projects."

**Background notes on Dr Colin Burrows**

Dr Burrows was nominated for the award by the Lincoln University, supported by the Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust.  The Cup will be presented in a special ceremony later this year on a date yet to be decided.

In addition to his outstanding contribution of over 33 years to the education of New Zealand students as a teacher and supervisor, Dr Burrows was supervisor of the Cass Field Station (University of Canterbury).

He has been a member of Arthur's Pass National Park Board 1968 - 1979; and on committees and as an advisor to various agencies and groups on key land areas, reserves, wetlands, lakes and coastal areas in the South Island.   He was a member of the Beech Research Advisory Committee in the 1970s and took an active role in the save Manapouri Campaign at that time.  He has been involved in a range of consultative work on various land areas, including Mount Cook National Park weed problems, and road works at Arthur's Pass and Otira Gorge.

In addition to his nationally significant botanical work, Dr Burrows has volunteered much of his time to community groups.  Over the last 13 years he has been a primary driver for the Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust's community eco-restoration project on Otamahua/Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour, to restore the island's indigenous flora and fauna. He has volunteered significant time to this community project as an ecological advisor and active worker, personally growing and planting many of the eco-sourced native species. 

In 2008 he received the Environment Canterbury Natural Resource Management Award (individual Category) for his work on Quail Island.    

Most recently Dr Burrows has given his time to assist the Mt Cass Ridge Protection Society as an unpaid expert witness on the ecological aspects of the ridge, concerning the Mt Cass Ridge wind farm proposal.

**Loder Cup**

English botanist Gerald Loder donated the Loder Cup in 1926, to honour New Zealanders who work to ‘retain, investigate and cherish New Zealand's incomparable flora'. The Minister of Conservation awards the Loder Cup each year to acknowledge achievements in flora conservation.
