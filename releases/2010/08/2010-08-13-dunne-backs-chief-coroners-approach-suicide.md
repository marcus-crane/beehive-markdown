Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said today that he is "sympathetically disposed" to the calls from the Chief Coroner, Judge Neil MacLean, for greater openness around the reporting and discussion of suicide.

"I am very open to what he is saying," Mr Dunne said.

"I think there needs to be more discussion about exactly how what he is proposing might work.

"We need to take away the ‘mystery' of suicide without sensationalising or glorifying it," he said.

"Suicide is still too hidden, given that there are more suicides than road deaths each year."

Mr Dunne said he would seek to discuss the Chief Coroner's ideas at the next meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Suicide Prevention.
