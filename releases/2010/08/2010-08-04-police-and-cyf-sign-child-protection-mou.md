Police and Child Youth and Family today signed a memorandum of understanding that would see them working closer to fight "appalling" rates of child abuse and better serve victims.

Police Commissioner Howard Broad and Ministry of Social Development Chief Executive Peter Hughes today signed the memorandum at Police National Headquarters in Wellington.

The Minister of Police, Judith Collins, and Minister of Social Development, Paula Bennett attended the signing.

The memorandum outlines how Police and CYF staff will continue to work together to ensure children are kept safe, child abusers are brought to justice and child abuse is reduced.

"All children have a right to grow up free from abuse and violence by those who they should be able to look up to and to trust," Ms Collins said.

 "Sadly, New Zealand has an appalling record on child abuse.  When a child's life is marred by the horror of abuse or violence, that child must have somewhere to go, and someone they can turn to for help. That child must be assured of a caring, compassionate, speedy and professional response."

Ms Bennett said child abuse is an enormous social problem that no one Government agency or organisation could tackle by itself.

"It is a problem that requires the expertise, knowledge and resources of a wide range of agencies, organisations and individuals to address," said Ms Bennett.

"Police and CYF are two of the frontline agencies who deal with the terrible results of child abuse every day.

"This memorandum shows the commitment of Police and CYF to better deal with child abuse. It represents a promise to our children that we will stand by them, we will protect them and we will bring justice for them.

"These children are precious and they are our future. The quality of that future depends on how we look after them today."

Ms Collins said Police and CYF do everything in their power to help rebuild lives and prevent child abuse.

"However, they are not responsible for these crimes. The problem will not stop until the adults who commit these crimes choose to do so no more."

"CYF and Police are determined to work together to prevent these mongrels from abusing children and bring the full weight of the law to bear on those who do," says Ms Bennett.
