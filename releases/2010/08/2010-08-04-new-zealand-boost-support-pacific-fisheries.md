New Zealand will commit an additional $4.8 million to support the management and policing of the Pacific's fisheries, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

"The Pacific's fisheries are the cornerstone of the region's economy. It's in the best interests of all Pacific nations to pool our efforts," Mr Key says.

"I have discussed with Pacific Island leaders how New Zealand can help manage and develop this critical regional resource.

"As a result, in addition to our current $3.33 million support to the Forum Fisheries Agency, New Zealand will contribute $4.8 million to support the management and delivery of sub-regional and national observer programmes.

"These initiatives will enhance effective fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance efforts in the region, as well as creating up to an additional 250 skilled jobs.

"New Zealand also contributes $5 million to the highly successful SPC Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme, which is designed to improve stock assessment and management of tuna species in the region," Mr Key says.

New Zealand supports a number of sub-regional fisheries initiatives, including an arrangement with fisheries administrations in several Polynesian countries, and closer co-operation on fisheries management and development with a new arrangement between New Zealand, Kiribati, Nauru, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.

New Zealand plans to support these arrangements through a focus on vocational training, strengthening management capacity, and private sector support to catch, process, export and market the resource, says Mr Key.

This sits alongside significant bilateral support, such as a new, scaled-up three-year programme in the Solomon Islands.
