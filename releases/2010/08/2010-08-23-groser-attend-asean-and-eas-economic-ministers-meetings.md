Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today to attend annual meetings of Economic Ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its East Asia Summit (EAS) partner countries in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

EAS is a forum held annually by the leaders of 16 countries in the East Asia region.

Mr Groser will attend meetings with counterparts from the 10 countries of ASEAN, as well as a broader meeting with Ministers from China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, India, and Australia.

"The meetings will be an important opportunity for New Zealand to encourage Ministers to look at pathways that lead to greater regional economic integration in East Asia.

"In Da Nang, Economic Ministers will also examine progress towards implementation of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) which entered into force for some countries on 1 January this year.

"We will be encouraging New Zealand businesses to develop opportunities stemming from this new agreement," Mr Groser said.

The meeting of EAS Economic Ministers is also an opportunity for Ministers to discuss preparations for the fifth East Asia Summit to be held in Viet Nam in October.
