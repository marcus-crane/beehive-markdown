Two major investment partnerships announced today will take primary sector innovation to a whole new level and deliver directly on the Government's economic growth plan, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

The Government's Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) is to fund nearly half of $321 million in research and innovation projects proposed by the dairy and red meat industries, our two largest primary sector exporters.

The two partnerships involve a DairyNZ/Fonterra-led programme ($170 million) and a Silver Fern Farms, PGG Wrightson and Landcorp Farming programme ($151 million).

"The Government's investment of $144 million in these programmes is what the PGP is about - a commitment to significantly boost economic growth through innovation," says Mr Carter.

"This is the biggest investment by Government in primary sector innovation in decades.

"The PGP aims to transfer great ideas into research, development and ultimately products, jobs and growth. It is exactly the business innovation that the Government has identified as one of the six drivers of economic growth.

"All New Zealanders stand to benefit from the partnerships announced today because the dairy and red meat industries are pivotal to the successful performance of our economy.

Mr Carter congratulated the industry groups on meeting the robust approval process and said the economic spin-offs for the country will be significant.

"This Government is making a serious investment in primary sector innovation because we recognise the crucial role it has in accelerating growth and delivering a brighter future for all New Zealanders," Mr Carter says.
