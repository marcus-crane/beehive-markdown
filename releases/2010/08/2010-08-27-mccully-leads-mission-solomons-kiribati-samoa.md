Foreign Minister Murray McCully will lead a delegation of MPs, business people, NGOs, media and officials on the 2010 Pacific Mission to the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Samoa next week.

"The Government has made New Zealand's relationships with its close neighbours in the Pacific a key priority," Mr McCully said.

"This year's Mission to the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Samoa will provide an opportunity for a diverse range of New Zealand representatives to look at the development challenges these countries face, and how New Zealand can best focus its assistance.

"In Solomon Islands I will meet newly-elected Prime Minister Danny Philip, and will underline to him New Zealand's commitment to strengthening our relationship through our development assistance work and through our contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission.

"In Kiribati I will meet with President Tong. The visit will also bring home the significant challenges faced on the densely-populated atoll of Tarawa, as well as the opportunities for tourism and economic development on Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, which lies some 3000km to the east. 

"The conclusion of the Mission in Samoa will allow the delegation to see first-hand how Samoa is recovering from last year's devastating tsunami. I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Tuilaepa how New Zealand's assistance has contributed to the recovery effort," Mr McCully said.
