The House this morning unanimously passed a bill to update and streamline New Zealand's outdated limitation law. 

"This is a banner day for black letter law," Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson said after the third reading of the Limitation Bill.

"The new Limitation Act 2010 clarifies and improves the existing limitation law contained in the Limitation Act 1950." 

"The new Act makes the limitation rules clearer and easier to apply," Mr Finlayson said. "It also introduces some important reforms to avoid the sometimes harsh consequences of the current Act."

"This type of black letter legal reform may not often attract headlines, but it makes a real difference to the day to day administration of our justice system." 

The law of limitations provides a defence to legal claims that are brought after a certain period of time. It balances the interests of claimants, who want to enforce their rights in law, and the interests of defendants to have claims against them brought in a timely fashion.

The Limitation Act 2010 updates and streamlines the Limitation Act 1950 and the patchwork of case law about limitations periods.

Under the Limitation Act 2010, the limitation period for most "money claims" will be six years after the act or omission on which the claim is based. After this time period has expired a defendant can raise a limitation defence against the claim.  Under the current Limitation Act periods vary for different types of claim.

A key reform introduced in the Bill is a new three-year late knowledge period.

Currently a limitation period may end before someone knows they have a claim.  The Bill gives a claimant at least 3 years from when they discover the claim to bring proceedings.  To prevent indefinite liability for some defendants the Bill also introduces a 15 year longstop defence.  A defendant will be able to argue that a claim brought after 15 years is out of time even if the claimant was not aware of the claim earlier. 

To prevent injustice, the Bill gives the court discretion to grant relief in some particularly deserving cases even if a limitation defence would usually apply.  One example where the court will have this discretion is in the case of the abuse of minors. 

Also, in some rare personal injury claims harm may not become apparent until after 15 years have passed and these claims may be time-barred.  The court will have discretion to grant monetary relief in these cases if the injuries are not covered by accident compensation. 

The 1950 Act will continue to apply to claims based on acts or omissions before the Bill comes into force.  But claims under the 1950 Act must be brought by the later of 15 years from the date of the act or omission or 5 years after the new Act commences.  This means that generally the old Act will be phased out after 15 years from the commencement of the new Act subject to rare exceptions.  The judicial discretions will also apply in these cases.
