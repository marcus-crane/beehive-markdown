The new 24/7 Victim Support Contact Centre would get the right help to victims of crime, and get it to them faster, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

Ms Collins joined Victim Support staff and volunteers, and Police to open the new Contact Centre at Police National Headquarters in Wellington.

The facility will centralise calls to Victim Support, an organisation comprising 130 paid staff and 1100 volunteers throughout the country who provide help and advice to victims of crime or crisis.

The Contact Centre will enable Victim Support to provide a more consistent and professional response. Calls will be received by staff who are trained to help people who might be suffering from grief or trauma.

"The new Contact Centre will help Victim Support better serve victims of crime wherever those victims might be, at whatever time they call for assistance, and whatever their need," Ms Collins said.

Ms Collins paid tribute to the work of Victim Support which helps around 70,000 New Zealanders each year.

"The hundreds of Victim Support volunteers throughout the country generously give their time, their expertise and their compassion to helping people in the community deal with the aftermath of crime."

Ms Collins also acknowledged Police who provided the office space and phone system for the new Contact Centre.

"I am delighted that Victim Support works closely with Police. I know this is a relationship Police value a great deal and that is exemplified by the Contact Centre we are opening today, located in the heart of Police National Headquarters.

"The ability to contact Victim Support through a centralised number and be assured of a consistent response is an important part of their victim-focused approach to policing."
