Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has announced an employment assistance package for Pacific job seekers, including a million dollars for targeted work programmes.

The Government recognises the significant impact of the recession on Pacific families so the 2010 Pacific Strategy channels resources towards this group.

"National is determined to help Pacific people, especially youth into work and this Strategy provides the skills and support necessary to do that," says Ms Bennett.

"This is an important investment in the potential of Pacific people, to contribute to their communities and the wider nation," says Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia.

The Pacific Strategy is a multi-pronged approach focussing on skills training, work experience and proactively approaching employers for jobs for Pacific people.

"We will have dedicated case managers working with Pacific people, building up their skills and confidence and literally promoting them to employers," says Ms Bennett.

2010 Pacific Strategy also includes two streams targeting Pacific youth:

- The four week Pacific Youth Project provides help with CVs, confidence building, interviewing skills, how to look for a job and get a drivers license.

<!--THE END-->

- The 14 week Pacific Multi Service Project is focussed on preparation, work experience and placement into a job.

"Young people are really disadvantaged in a tight job market, so gaining job search skills and work experience will make a real difference to Pacific youth," says Ms Bennett.

"I'm pleased this Strategy for all Pacific job seekers, including youth will mobilise Work and Income to proactively find jobs for our Pacific people," says Mrs Turia.

More than 70 percent of the Pacific population lives in South and West Auckland so that is where the Pacific Strategy is aimed.

The million dollar funding comes out of the $12.6 million fund for Employment Assistance announced in the May Budget.
