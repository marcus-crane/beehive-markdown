Health Minister Tony Ryall has announced consultation on new recall procedures for medicines and medical devices following a number of medicine recalls earlier this year.

Mr Ryall says, "The Ministry of Health has been looking at processes, procedures, contracting arrangements and the level of compensation for pharmacies when they are involved in recalls.

"As a result, Medsafe has revised the recall guidelines, which have been released today for consultation.

In parallel, the Ministry of Health is continuing to work on the issue of compensation for costs incurred by health professionals participating in a recall.

The revised guidelines called *Uniform Recall Procedure for Medicines and Medical Devices* along with details on how to make a submission is available at [http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/hot/Consultation/contents.asp](http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/hot/Consultation/contents.asp)

The closing date for submissions is 27 August 2010, and both the guidelines and compensation work are expected to be finalised before the end of the year.
