Prime Minister John Key has noted with sadness the death today of Sir Ron Trotter.

Sir Ron, the former chairman of Fletcher Challenge, died in Wellington this morning after a long illness.

Mr Key says, "Ron's contribution to business in New Zealand was significant. His achievements, including being founding chairman of the Business Roundtable, will leave a lasting legacy.

"His knighthood for services to business in 1985 was a well-deserved recognition of the substantial difference Sir Ron made to business in New Zealand.

"His vision, determination and leadership were legendary. 

"It was with much sadness that I heard of his death this afternoon and I would like to pass on my sincere condolences to Lady Margaret and his family."
