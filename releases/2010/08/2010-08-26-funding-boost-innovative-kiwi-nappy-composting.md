Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced a $30,000 grant from the Government's Waste Minimisation Fund towards a feasibility study to look at setting up a disposable nappy composting facility in the Wellington region.

"North Canterbury company Envirocomp opened for business a year ago and each day processes around 15,000 nappies and incontinence products into safe, odourless compost at its site in Balcairn," Dr Smith said. 

"This practical recycling initiative has been a huge success in Canterbury providing an important service to parents, stopping thousands of tonnes of nappy waste going to landfills, and creating a useable product.

"Many New Zealand parents like me have embraced the convenience of disposable nappies but get the environmental guilts over the volume of waste generated. This innovative business solves this dilemma. 

"This is the sort of Bluegreen initiative that this Government wants to back. It is the first of its kind in the world to be composting nappies and shows real Kiwi ingenuity. It is also consistent with our clean green brand as a nation to be going the extra step to protect our environment.

"This $30,000 grant will enable a feasibility study to be undertaken into establishing a new facility and service in Wellington. The study will take eight months and I am hopeful of the new service opening in late 2011."
