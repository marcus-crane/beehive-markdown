Trade Minister Tim Groser has congratulated HSBC New Zealand and Longbeach Holdings Ltd on their joint announcement that they have completed New Zealand's first trade settlement in China's Renminbi (RMB) currency.

"The facility to settle bilateral trade in RMB is a significant step in the trading relationship between New Zealand and China," said Mr Groser.

"An ability to do business in RMB will become increasingly important to New Zealand companies transacting considerable amounts of business with Chinese purchasers and suppliers."

"The provision of flexible business services to support traders is important to the growth of international trade and to the profitability of New Zealand firms."

"I am sure that this first settlement will be a forerunner of many future settlements by banks and businesses."

China announced at the end of June that it would permit trade settlements in RMB with companies based in States beyond its immediate border.   

China is New Zealand's second largest country market for exports.  New Zealand exported over $4 billion of goods to China in the year to June 2010.
