Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today released a survey on KiwiSaver, showing that the retirement scheme is encouraging people into longer-term savings.

The *Survey of Individuals* carried out by Inland Revenue is part of an ongoing evaluation of KiwiSaver.

The survey asked why people were members or not, how they viewed or used the KiwiSaver features that encouraged them to save, and whether KiwiSaver was an extra savings mechanism for their retirement.

Mr Dunne said the survey is only an early indication, but shows encouraging signs that New Zealanders are beginning to take a longer-term view towards retirement saving.

"Kiwis have traditionally not been committed to long-term saving. In the past most people have put money into a mortgage hoping for a capital return at a later date.

"What this survey shows is that individuals are starting to think about a longer-term strategy for saving money outside the property market."

"This is a particularly important issue, and we do want to encourage people to save in the longer term. The survey suggests that KiwiSaver is encouraging people down that path," he said.

Seventy-two per cent of KiwiSaver members said one of the main reasons for joining KiwiSaver was that it is an easy way to save. Sixty-seven per cent said the government contributions were a reason for enrolling, while the first home-ownership feature was a reason for joining for 24 per cent.

Of non-members, 32 per cent said they couldn't afford it, 30 per cent said there were better ways of providing financial security and 28 per cent cited not getting around to it.  

Most non-members had never been members of KiwiSaver, and only 12 per cent had opted out of KiwiSaver.

Mr Dunne said the *Survey of Individuals* is just one part of the KiwiSaver evaluation of the scheme.

"At the end of the evaluation, we will be able to determine whether the features of KiwiSaver are generating expected outcomes, get a really good picture of the amount of take-up, determine the impact on the savings habits of New Zealanders and assess the impact on financial markets and the superannuation industry," he said.

It sampled 825 respondents, of which 474 were KiwiSaver members and 351 were non-members. The numbers were weighted to reflect population characteristics for gender, age and household size.
