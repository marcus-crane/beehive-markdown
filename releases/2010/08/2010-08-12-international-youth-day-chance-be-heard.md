Minister of Youth Affairs Paula Bennett is encouraging young people to celebrate International Youth Day by having their say on decisions that affect them.

International Youth Day today also marks the launch of the International Year of Youth.

The theme for International Youth Day is ‘Dialogue and Mutual Understanding,' which will be followed by the theme for the year of ‘Our Year, Our Voice.'

"This is a perfect opportunity for young people to step up and be heard on issues that matter to them," says Ms Bennett.

"As Minister of Youth Affairs I encourage all young people to get involved in decision-making and I also encourage adults to better involve young people," says Ms Bennett.

The Ministry of Youth Development gives young people the opportunity to be involved through the Aotearoa Youth Voices Network.

Research released today by the Ministry of Youth Development, shows 30 percent of young people say adults in the community don't seem to want them around.

The research comes out of Victoria University's Youth Connectedness Project 2006 - 2008.

"Young people are key members of communities, but their views are often overlooked when local and national leaders are making decisions," says Ms Bennett.

Nearly one in five New Zealanders are between 12 and 24 years old.

"Their thoughts, experiences and ideas add a unique quality to decision-making and it's an important part of including them in the community," says Ms Bennett.

Encouraging young people to be involved in decision-making is a key role of the Ministry of Youth Development.

MYD also has resources available for communities and adults that help involve young people in decision making. Find out more information at www.myd.govt.nz.
