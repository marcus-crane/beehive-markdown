Promoting and nurturing business links between India and New Zealand is the key objective of tomorrow's Business Leaders of India Forum, says Ethnic Affairs Minister, Pansy Wong.

"This Forum will be a great opportunity for participants to share ideas about the special business relationship between the two countries. I also see it as a platform for providing feedback and ideas to the Government on ways in which it can support the business community in facilitating commercial relationships between India and New Zealand," says Mrs Wong.

New Zealand and India are currently negotiating a Free Trade Agreement.

Mrs Wong says India is a key partner for New Zealand and the negotiation of the Free Trade Agreement between the two countries has brought the relationship into sharper economic focus.

"There is significant growth potential in the Indian market. An integrated market opens up new opportunities for businesses, and removes barriers to sell products and acquire capital goods and raw materials.

"I am keen to encourage an environment where New Zealand can make the most of the expertise and knowledge our ethnic communities possess in relation to overseas business cultures," says Mrs Wong.

The forum is being attended by businesspeople with an interest in trading with India; businesspeople who are keen to increase their existing relationship with India; management teams seeking investors with capital and connections in Indian business; and government officials working to strengthen connection with counterparts in the Indian Government.

The Forum is being organised by the Office of Ethnic Affairs in collaboration with other government agencies.  The Forum is also supported by the India New Zealand Business Council and Asia New Zealand Foundation.  The ANZ Bank is a strategic partner for the forum.
