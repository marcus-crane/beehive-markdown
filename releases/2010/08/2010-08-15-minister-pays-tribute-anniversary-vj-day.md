Sixty-five years after the end of the Second World War, New Zealanders still enjoy the peace and freedom that so many fought and died for, Veterans'  Affairs Minister Judith Collins said  today on the anniversary of VJ (Victory over Japan) Day.

On 15 August 1945 Japan surrendered to the Allies, bringing to an end six years of bitter conflict in which more than 11,000  New Zealand troops lost their lives.

"The victory that our service personnel fought so bravely for in all theatres during the Second World War ushered in an enduring peace for New Zealand," Ms Collins said.

"Today, on the 65th anniversary of VJ Day, we remember the sacrifices of all who served in the Second World War, and pay tribute to those who did not return.  It is due to the efforts of those men and women that we enjoy peace and freedom today."

The war against Japan began in December 1941 when the Japanese bombed the American naval base at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. A day after the attack, the US, Great Britain and other allies, including New Zealand, declared war on Japan.

The Pacific War was fought over a large area, and New Zealanders primarily fought in three areas - Singapore, the Solomon Islands and the seas around Japan.  Thousands of men and women from New Zealand's Army, Navy and Air Force served in the Pacific.

Victory against Japan was achieved in August 1945 when Japan signed the Armistice.
