Former Environment Court Judge Shonagh Kenderdine has been appointed Chair of the Board of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson announced today.

 She replaces John Acland of Canterbury who has completed his term.

The purpose of the Historic Places Act 1993 is to promote the identification, protection, preservation and cultural heritage of New Zealand.

Mr Finlayson said "I am delighted that Former Judge Kenderdine has agreed to be the Chair of Historic Places Trust where her experience as an Environment Court Judge and her wider interests will be a great asset to the Trust."

"I also want to thank retiring Chair, John Acland, for his contribution as a long serving member and Chair of the Trust."

She was previously a Senior Counsel at the Crown Law Office, and was in private and academic practice. Along with the environment, her interests encompass history, Treaty of Waitangi 1840, climate change and cultural issues.
