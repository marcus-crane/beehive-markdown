Trade Minister Tim Groser and Indian Commerce Minister, Sri Anand Sharma announced today the start of negotiations towards a free trade agreement between New Zealand and India.

Mr Groser, attending a meeting of WTO Trade Ministers in Davos, Switzerland alongside Mr Sharma, welcomed the Indian Government's confirmation that it will open negotiations with New Zealand. 

"A free trade agreement with India offers great promise for New Zealand businesses. India is already one of our fastest growing markets, with New Zealand exports having tripled over the last decade. 

"Our negotiators will target the currently high barriers facing New Zealand exporters to India so that trade can further flourish," Mr Groser said.

Mr Groser also emphasised the strategic importance to New Zealand of the growing Indian economy - forecast to grow at almost 8 percent in 2010.

"India has a population of over one billion people. By 2025, India will almost certainly be the third largest economy in the world."

The New Zealand Cabinet approved the start of negotiations in March last year and the relevant Indian Cabinet Committee last week approved the proposal - a decision delayed until now by India's mid-year election in 2009. 

"I expect negotiations to start soon and am confident we can deliver a high quality agreement with significant benefits to New Zealand exporters," Mr Groser said.
