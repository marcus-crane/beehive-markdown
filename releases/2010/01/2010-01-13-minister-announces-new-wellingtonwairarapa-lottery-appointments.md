Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Susan Perry, Michelle Laurenson and Mele Wendt to the Lottery Wellington/Wairarapa Community Distribution Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Michelle Laurenson of Waikanae is a community volunteer and fundraiser. She has extensive experience and involvement in the community, including event management, fundraising, sport, coaching, and mentoring. She has been recognised for her community involvement with a civic award for services for the disabled. Ms Laurenson has represented New Zealand in athletics and cycling.

Susan Perry of Masterton is a Director in a farming partnership. She has long term involvement in senior roles with community groups such as Save the Children.

Mele Wendt of Wellington is the Executive Director of Fulbright New Zealand. She has experience assessing grant and funding applications through her employment and various board appointments. Ms Wendt has worked in the youth sector as a liaison officer for student recruitment and as international advisor for Victoria University in Wellington.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Wellington/Wairarapa Committee has five members in total and last year gave $2.4 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Wellington/Wairarapa Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

All appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
