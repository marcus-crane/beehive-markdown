Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Beryl Lusty, Dennis Catchpole and Fatuma Elmi to the Lottery Waikato Community Distribution Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Beryl Lusty of Hamilton is a business administrator for Patrick and Associates Ltd. She has formerly worked as a real estate agent, office manager and tutor. She is the coordinator for Neighbourhood Watch and a committee member of Circolo Italiano, a not-for-profit group that organises Italian language classes. She has previously been involved with school and Plunket committees and sports clubs.

Dennis Catchpole of Te Awamutu is the Director and Fund Manager of NBCI Ltd - an investment company incorporated in Papua New Guinea with the purpose of investing church funds and reinvesting income back into Papua New Guinea. Mr Catchpole has undertaken volunteer work overseas through the church and his community involvement includes various groups such as Young Farmers, Federated Farmers, Budget Advisory and Rotary.

Fatuma Elmi of Hamilton is an active member of the Somali community and an advocate and representative for women's health and domestic violence awareness. Ms Elmi works with Waikato Health, Marlborough House and the University of Waikato on the development of appropriate mental health options for Somali and other refugees. She is actively involved in refugee awareness and is the regional representative for ethnic women in Hamilton. Ms Elmi also provides support for special needs children.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Waikato Committee has five members in total and last year gave $2.9 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Waikato Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

The appointments of Beryl Lusty and Fatuma Elmi are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013. The appointment of Dennis Catchpole is to fill a vacancy on the Committee and his term of appointment is for the remainder of that term, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 30 September 2010.
