Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Christchurch businessman Richard Holden to the Board of the Lotteries Commission.

"Mr Holden's community involvement and financial expertise will be an asset to the Lotteries Commission," said Mr Guy.

Mr Holden is Managing Director of a Christchurch based financial planning firm. He has long involvement with community and sporting organisations, being a past president of the Marist Rugby Football Club and a past member of the general committee of the Canterbury Rugby Union.

The Lotteries Commission's function is to provide governance of the Lotteries business - such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Daily Keno and Instant Kiwi - in order to raise money for the community through lottery games. It operates in a competitive and commercial environment with revenue in the last year exceeding $800 million.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. Good management of the Lotteries business means more funding for valuable projects in our communities."

The Commission does not distribute the funds it raises - that is the responsibility of a separate entity, the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board.

Mr Holden's appointment is a three year term, ending in 2012.
