Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today for Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum between 27-31 January. He will then visit Beijing, China and Tokyo, Japan.

A key focus of Mr Groser's trip to Davos is the annual informal meeting of Trade Ministers which will address remaining issues preventing the conclusion of the WTO Doha Round of trade talks.

Mr Groser then travels to Beijing between 1-3 February to meet with Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming, and officials responsible for trade and climate change. 

"I'll discuss economic and trade issues, including our shared interests in the continuing success of the New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which has supported strong two way trade growth in 2009.  

"2010 shapes as a big year in New Zealand-China relations and so I will also be discussing New Zealand's commitment to the Shanghai Expo this year, along with climate change and New Zealand's Global Research Alliance proposal," Mr Groser said.

Mr Groser will visit Tokyo on 4-5 February and will meet with counterpart Ministers responsible for trade, agriculture and the environment.

"Visiting Tokyo builds on the momentum of the Prime Minister's visit last October and will reinforce New Zealand's desire for closer trade ties with Japan," Mr Groser said.
