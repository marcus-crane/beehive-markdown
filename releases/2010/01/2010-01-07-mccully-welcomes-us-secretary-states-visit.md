Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed news from the United States confirming that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit New Zealand from 15-17 January.

"This will be the first visit by a member of President Obama's Cabinet to New Zealand, and comes at a time of continued growth in the partnership between our two countries," Mr McCully said.

"Secretary Clinton's programme will include discussions with the Prime Minister and myself, as well as a range of other activities.

"We very much look forward to the visit.  There is much to discuss about international and regional developments. 

"The visit will be a good opportunity to continue to advance the strong bilateral relationship with the United States," Mr McCully said.

The last visit by a US Secretary of State to New Zealand was in 2008.
