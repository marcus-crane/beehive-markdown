The Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon Nathan Guy, has announced the appointment of Alison McAlpine, Jim Mears and Maria Williams, and the reappointment of Butch Bradley to the Lottery West Coast/Nelson/ Marlborough Community Distribution Committee. Alison McAlpine has been appointed Presiding Member of the Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy. 

Butch Bradley of Nelson is the Commercial and Marketing Manager for the Tasman Rugby Union. Butch is a former radio host and has nearly 20 years experience in radio and marketing. He has also worked as the National Manager for the Sport, Fitness and Recreation Industry Training Organisation (SFRITO) and as a consultant for Success Performance Solutions. He is involved with tourism as Chair of the Te Ara a Maui Maori Regional Tourism Board, and has served two terms on this lottery committee.

Jim Mears of Picton is a farmer and former member of the New Zealand Police Force. He has been appointed as a Justice of the Peace and is a Marriage Celebrant for the Marlborough Sounds area.  Mr Mears has served on the Federated Farmers executive and as a trustee of the Westland Savings Bank. 

Maria Williams of Greymouth is an interior design consultant for a Nelson manufacturing company, which she has owned and operated since 2001.  She is involved with the community through memberships of Plunket committees, the Business and Professional Women's Association and the Canterbury Neonatal Unit Trust.

Alison McAlpine of Nelson is the Statutory Manager of Salisbury School and a Nelson City Councillor.  She was formerly the principal of Nelson College for Girls for 18 years.  Ms McAlpine is actively involved with the community and was awarded the Queens Service Order of Merit for services to education and the Nelson community in 2007.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The West Coast/Nelson/ Marlborough Committee has five members in total and last year gave $1.4 million to local projects. 

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. This Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

All appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
