Minister for Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett is encouraging people to have their say on the new Auckland Social Policy Forum.

The Minister has today released a discussion document and is keen to get feedback over the next few months.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get the structures that support the social fabric of Auckland right," says Ms Bennett.

Ms Bennett says the Forum will bring together key political leaders from Auckland and central Government, providing a platform to ensure social issues remain high on the agenda as governance in Auckland changes.

"We want to see a range of organisations and communities involved with the Forum, so those making decisions about Auckland, understand the diverse needs of those groups", Ms Bennett says. 

"We want to feedback on the form and function of the Forum, the types of issues it should be considering, and how it can best engage with Auckland's diverse communities and social organisations."

"The framework's there, but now we need to flesh it out. I want to make sure Auckland communities, organisations and local government are at the centre of our thinking", Ms Bennett says.

Feedback on the discussion document closes on Friday 21 May 2010.
