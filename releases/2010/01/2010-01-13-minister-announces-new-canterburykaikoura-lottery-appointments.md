Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Quentin Hix, Christine Korako and Dugald McLean to the Lottery Canterbury/Kaikoura Community Distribution Committee. He has appointed Quentin Hix as the Presiding Member of the Committee.

"These three candidates have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Quentin Hix of Timaru is an independent barrister. He is the Chair and member of the Aoraki Trust, a charitable company distributing gaming machine revenue since 2002. He is a member and trustee of a variety of clubs, groups and trusts in Timaru.

Christine Korako of Rapaki Bay is the Director for International Inbound Travel Services. She has over 15 years experience in the travel and tourism industry and is involved with local schools, Māori Women's Welfare, groups for children and as an advisor to the Cholmondeley Children's Home Fundraising committee.

Dugald (DSA) McLean of Kaiapoi is a sheep and beef Farmer in North Canterbury and the Membership Development Officer for New Zealand Federated Farmers. Mr McLean is involved in the community through a wide range of organisations, including positions with Federated Farmers, the Glenmark Rugby Club, Lions, Youth for Christ and the Agriculture ITO North Canterbury Committee.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional committees. The Canterbury/Kaikoura Committee has five members in total and last year gave $2.9 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. This Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

Both appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
