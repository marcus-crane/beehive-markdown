Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed two milestones announced today on progress of Auckland's Western Ring Route.

The Lincoln Road interchange on the Northwestern Motorway will now commence construction this year, and the NZ Transport Agency has decided to apply for the Waterview Connection to be considered under the new national consenting process.

Mr Joyce said that the new consenting process for the Waterview Connection project would replace the usual two-step process of a council hearing followed by an Environment Court hearing, with either a single hearing before a board of inquiry, or a direct referral to the Environment Court.

"The ability to make a direct application to the Environment Protection Authority under the RMA was introduced by Government last year to streamline the decision-making process on matters of national significance", says Mr Joyce.

"I'm pleased to see that the NZTA is seeking to use this provision to ensure community involvement in this sensitive project while keeping to the completion date of 2015/16."

"By completing the Western Ring Route, including the Waterview Connection, we will be able to unlock the benefits of the entire 48 kilometre corridor."

The NZTA has today released further reports on both projects and confirmed the alignment change for the Waterview Connection announced in December 2009 that reduces the number of affected properties for no extra cost.

In addition, construction of the Lincoln Road interchange has been brought forward and will commence this year, following the appointment last week of contractors to undertake the next phase of design.

Earlier today Mr Joyce visited construction sites on the Western Ring Route and Victoria Park roads of national significance.

"These vital improvements will go a long way to providing the cohesive motorway network that Aucklanders expect.

Construction of the Victoria Park tunnel began last November, one year ahead of schedule, following the Government's decision to increase funding for state highway construction by $1 billion over the next three years.

"Without extra funding this project may never have got off the ground, and neither would the jobs and economic benefits it will bring.

"At its peak, the Victoria Park project is expected to employ 450 people - 350 directly onsite and a further 100 downstream.

"Victoria Park will deliver journey time savings of up to 20 minutes by 2016 on one of the busiest motorways in the country."

Mr Joyce says the Roads of National Significance are being developed alongside key regional roads and public transport services, and they will help secure a step-change in economic growth for New Zealand.
