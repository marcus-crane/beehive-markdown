The Government's voluntary bonding scheme for veterinarians is to be expanded to cover all practices that deal with production animals, Agriculture Minister David Carter announced today.

The scheme, launched last year, encourages new graduates to stay in an eligible practice by providing a taxable payment of $11,000 for every year, up to five years, that they are working in the practice.

The scheme was originally aimed at practices in specific rural areas. Since then, 20 vets have been accepted into the scheme.

From this year, all practices that deal with production animals like dairy and beef cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry will be eligible, providing the vets receiving the funding will spend most of their time working with these animals.

Mr Carter says the changes are the result of feedback from veterinarians and the Vet Association.

"When the scheme was launched, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry acknowledged that good data on vet shortages was scarce, so a transition year was agreed while vets and their Association, as well as Massey University and the Vet Council, could be consulted on the final design of the scheme.

"Its main limitation appeared to be the targeting of specific regions. Many practices reported they faced similar shortages and recruitment difficulties as those in the eligible areas, but were not able to use the voluntary bonding incentives to recruit and retain staff.

"I'm pleased that the scheme will now focus on encouraging vets into practices with production animals, wherever that practice may be," Mr Carter says.
