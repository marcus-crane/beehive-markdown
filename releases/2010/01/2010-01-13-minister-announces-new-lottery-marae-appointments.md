Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of John Clarke and Marina Sciascia, and the reappointment of Paora Ammunson to the Lottery Marae Heritage and Facilities Distribution Committee. He has appointed existing member, Haare Williams, as Presiding Member of the Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Marae Committee has five members in total and last year gave $6.9 million to help develop and preserve marae facilities around New Zealand.

John Clarke of Wellington is a public sector consultant providing advice on Māori perspectives in public policy. He is a former Chief Executive of the Ministry of Māori Affairs and has been involved in developing Māori/Crown relations over a significant period of time.

Marina Sciascia of Porangahau is the Public Relations and Branding Manager for Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Inc. She is involved in Māori cultural and iwi development and serves her community as kaumatua for hapu organisations and committees.

Paora Ammunson of Greytown has served one term on the Lottery Marae Heritage and Facilities Distribution Committee. He has involvement on public and private entities including Private Health Organisations, iwi authorities and companies as Chair, leader and manager.

Haare Williams of Auckland is a current member of the Lottery Marae Heritage and Facilities Distribution Committee. He is Course Leader of South Sea's Mahi o Rongo - Māori Film and Television Course. He is also kaumatua for the Manukau City Council.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Marae Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

All appointments, with the exception of Presiding Member, are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013. The appointment of Haare Williams as Presiding Member is for the remainder of his current term, expiring on 30 September 2010.
