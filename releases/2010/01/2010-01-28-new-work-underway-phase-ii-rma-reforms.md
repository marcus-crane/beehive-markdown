New Zealand needs to do better with its planning of urban development and associated infrastructure, Environment Minister Nick Smith said today announcing two new technical advisory groups to support the Government's programme of resource management reforms.

"There are major question marks over the way the Resource Management Act is working in urban areas," Dr Smith said. "I don't think we have the incentives right for developers to do the best urban design in our largest cities. There are also questions about the policy of metropolitan urban limits, the effect they have on section prices and the negative flow-on effects to the broader economy. Nor do we have a good track record of having the right infrastructure in place at the right time for supporting urban development.

"These are complex issues that require careful deliberation and expert input. That is why the Cabinet has appointed Urban and Infrastructure Technical Advisory Groups to work with the Ministry for the Environment to report on these issues this year."

The Urban TAG will be chaired by barrister Alan Dormer and includes planning consultant Adrienne Young Cooper, research economist and consultant Arthur Grimes, architect and urban designer Graeme McIndoe, Chief Executive of the Property Council of New Zealand Connal Townsend and Ernst Zollner of the New Zealand Transport Agency. It has a report date of 30 June 2010.

The Infrastructure TAG will be chaired by Mike Foster, Director of Zomac Planning Solutions Ltd, and includes planning consultant Adrienne Young Cooper, barrister Alan Dormer, solicitor Kelvin Reid, civil engineer Lindsay Crossen, Sacha McMeeking from Ngāi Tahu and the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Council for Infrastructure Development Stephen Selwood. It has a report date of 31 March 2010

"These issues of urban design and infrastructure have important linkages and that is why Alan Dormer and Adrienne Young Cooper have been appointed to both advisory groups. The work the TAGs will do will feed into the Government's broader Phase II RMA reforms and a further amendment Bill."
