Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Jeremy Sole and Roger Burrill to the Lottery Auckland Community Distribution Committee.

"Mr Sole and Mr Burrill have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Jeremy Sole is the Chief Executive Officer for the New Zealand Contractors Federation, which involves him in the civil construction, building, manufacturing and farming sectors. He is also involved in the local community through church and the Northcote Residents Association.

Roger Burrill of Manurewa is the Managing Director of his own tourism business, which operates a charter cruise business in and around the Hauraki Gulf. He has over 40 years of active participation in a wide range of local community organisations and has held positions at a senior leadership level.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Auckland Committee has five members in total and last year gave $7.7 million to local Auckland projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Auckland Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

Both appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
