Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Tom Mulligan and Diana Peterson to the Lottery Hawke's Bay Community Distribution Committee.

"Mr Mulligan and Ms Petersen have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Tom Mulligan of Hastings is the manager of a family trust and kaumatua for the Eastern Police District, the Hawke's Bay Māori Tourism Trust and the New Zealand Māori Tourism Society. He has served as a director on a variety of boards, including rugby, health, tourism, business development and the meat industry. Mr Mulligan is a life member of the Clive Rugby Club and Hawke's Bay Rugby Union.

Diana Petersen of Waipukurau is a former Councillor for the Central Hawke's Bay District Council and has been heavily involved in the community for the last 20 years. She is a Justice of the Peace and was appointed as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to local body and community affairs.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Hawkes Bay Committee has five members in total and last year gave $1.3 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Hawkes Bay Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

Both appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
