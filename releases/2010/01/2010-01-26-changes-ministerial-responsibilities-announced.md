Prime Minister John Key today announced three changes to ministerial responsibilities aimed at ensuring strong focus in key portfolios over the year ahead.

Steven Joyce becomes Tertiary Education Minister, allowing Anne Tolley to fully focus her efforts on the Education portfolio, and in particular the implementation of the Government's national standards policy.

Kate Wilkinson becomes Conservation Minister, a portfolio in which she is currently Associate Minister. This change reflects the fact that Tim Groser is frequently out of the country representing New Zealand's interests in the Trade and Climate Change fields.

Mr Groser, because he has primary ministerial responsibility for the international negotiations aspects of Climate Change, will have a change in title and becomes the Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations.

"More than a year into this parliamentary term, I am very pleased with how Ministers are working, both individually in their portfolios and together in Cabinet.

"These changes will help ensure that the government continues its progress towards implementing key election policies such as national standards in literacy and numeracy.

"I want to thank Mrs Tolley and Mr Groser for their contribution in the portfolios that today they are handing over to colleagues. In both Tertiary Education and Conservation, they leave sound foundations for their successors to build on," says Mr Key.

All changes take effect from Wednesday 27 January. There is no change in the Cabinet rankings.
