Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key has congratulated Air New Zealand on being named Airline of the Year by ‘Air Transport World' magazine.

"This is a great honour but, then again, no great surprise to those of us who continually experience the service that our national airline delivers."

In awarding Air New Zealand the title, the judges cited the airline's superb commitment to safety and operational excellence, its groundbreaking customer service, its environmental record, and its financial performance and fiscal management during one of the most turbulent periods in aviation history.

"Like so many New Zealanders I am immensely proud of Air New Zealand. Its ingenuity and innovation deliver new products that are mimicked by competitors around the world and its commitment to a more environmentally responsible future is leading the industry.

"However it is the people who make a real difference, as evidenced by the total selflessness and caring attitude adopted by the company and its staff during the Samoan tsunami.

"This honour is well deserved."
