Transport Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed confirmation of the NZ Transport Agency's plans for a $1.4 billion strategic upgrade of State Highway 1 from Puhoi to Wellsford and expressed frustration over the lack of planning for the route prior to last year.

He says early signs are that the first stage from Puhoi to Warkworth will be complete within 9 years but that the second stage (Warkworth to Wellsford) will be more challenging to finish in that time.  However, that remains the Transport Agency's goal.

"The government's $10.7 billion commitment to state highway funding over the ten year period means that funding is not the big issue for this project but the reality is design, consultation and consenting processes all take time. 

"On our current timetable this will be the fastest ever major highway project completed in this country from go to whoa."

The government announced the Puhoi to Wellsford section of State Highway 1 as a road of national significance in March last year and work began after that to scope the project and commence investigation of route options.

"Given the previous government seemed to believe the job finished at Puhoi and had no intention of four-laning beyond that, we were beginning from a standing start and have been playing catch-up over the last twelve months," says Mr Joyce.

"One option being investigated is to build the Warkworth Bypass first to relieve congestion at that point.  However, we would still need to know where the road north and south of that links into the bypass route so it will still take some time to get the consents for that section.

"The focus over the next couple of years will be undertaking detailed investigation and design work to determine route options and obtain statutory consents.  This will include public consultation on possible routes.

"The new road will bring significant benefits to the Northland and Rodney districts, as well as to Auckland.

"The Puhoi to Wellsford corridor has been identified as one of our most essential state highway routes to reduce congestion, improve safety and support economic growth in the Auckland and Northland regions."

Completing the Puhoi to Wellsford road of national significance will deliver significant benefits, including:

- enhance inter regional and national economic growth and productivity
- improve movement of freight and people between Auckland and Northland
- improve the connectivity between key growth areas in the north Rodney area
- improve reliability of the transport network through a more robust and safer route between  Auckland and Northland
- provide further route security for Northland residents
