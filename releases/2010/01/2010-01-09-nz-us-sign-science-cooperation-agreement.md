New Zealand and the United States have agreed to enhance cooperation  
in science and technology research to improve the shared capabilities of both  
nations to protect against acts of terrorism and other threats to domestic and  
external security.

"International collaboration in science and technology is a major  
part of our ongoing efforts to counter threats of terrorism.  This agreement  
will enhance our ability to collaborate on research and share innovative  
technologies to ensure our mutual security and protect the public," said US  
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

"The Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation Contributing to  
Domestic and External Security Capabilities strengthens New Zealand's  
longstanding relationship with the US in research science and  
technology.

"Under the agreement, New Zealand transport security and civil  
defence emergency management researchers will now benefit from collaborative  
project work with their US counterparts," Foreign Minister Murray McCully  
said.

The agreement calls for close cooperation between the US and New  
Zealand on the development of threat and vulnerability analyses and new  
technologies, and strengthened collaboration on border and transport security  
and civil defence emergency management.

It  
draws on the collective technical expertise of government scientists from both  
countries, and encourages robust participation by universities, non-profit  
organization and the private sector through public-private partnerships and  
collaborative funding.

It  
was signed on Friday in Washington by Secretary Napolitano and New Zealand  
Ambassador Roy Ferguson.

The United States has recently concluded similar agreements with  
Spain, Germany, France, Israel, Australia, the United Kingdom and  
Canada.
