Immigration New Zealand has notified the police about an immigration scam exploiting the Fijian community that is thought to be operating in the Auckland area, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

The alleged scam involves offers of residency permits under the Pacific Access Category.

Dr Coleman says there has been no change to the policy of excluding Fijians from the Pacific Access Category. That policy has been in place since 2006.

"Immigration New Zealand is the only agency which can grant visas to travel to New Zealand or permits to remain here.

"Anyone offering a visa or permit to a Fijian national under the Pacific Access Category is providing misleading information and acting illegally.

"Any person who receives such an offer should contact Immigration New Zealand in the first instance."
