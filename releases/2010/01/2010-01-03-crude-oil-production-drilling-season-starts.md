New  
Zealand's production of crude oil  
jumped nearly 20 percent in the quarter ending September, largely due to the  
Maari field reaching full production, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry  
Brownlee announced today.

The finding is one of a  
number of highlights from the *New Zealand*  
*Energy Quarterly*, published by the Ministry of Economic  
Development.

"Increased production of  
crude oil is a step in the right direction, given the massive economic benefits  
of a buoyant petroleum industry," says Mr Brownlee.

"On the back of this,  
production exports of crude and condensate were up 17 percent on the previous  
quarter.

"With the country's most  
intensive summer drilling season beginning, it's heartening to see our  
production levels lifting. New Zealand's petroleum resources are  
largely untapped - increasing exploration activities here is the first step in  
realising the government's goal of a thriving industry."

Other key findings  
include:

- Wind  
  generation set a new record high, accounting for over three percent of the  
  quarter's total generation. This is largely attributable to Meridian Energy's  
  143 MW West Wind project and spring wind conditions;

<!--THE END-->

- Electricity emissions were down six percent on the same quarter in  
  2008, due to better hydro inflows and less fossil fuel generation;  
  and

<!--THE END-->

- Gas  
  flaring was up on recent quarters, due to the large quantity being flared at the  
  Maari field.

The *New Zealand Energy Quarterly* presents  
statistics on the supply of major fuels, electricity generation and greenhouse  
gas emissions, and prices to the end of the September  
2009\.
