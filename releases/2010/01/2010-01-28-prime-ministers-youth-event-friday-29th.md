Minister of Youth Affairs, Paula Bennett will celebrate the achievement of 100 young people who've overcome adversity in their lives, at a barbecue for them and their families tomorrow.

Prime Minister John Key will also attend.

The group of 14 to 17 year olds were offered places on the Prime Minister's week-long youth programme as a reward for making positive, life-changing choices, as recognised by community leaders.

"Each of these young people has faced adversity, sometimes because of their own choices, or simply due to the world they've grown up in. But each and every one of them has made a conscious decision to turn their lives around," says Ms Bennett.

"This is a group of young people truly worth celebrating."

Celebrity mentors on the programme include former All Black Norm Hewitt, Taungaroa Emile, Teuila Blakely, Oscar Kightley and All Blacks coach Graham Henry.

"This is our opportunity to foster and build on the changes these young people have made, working with positive role models, doing things they wouldn't normally get to do. They've really stepped up and we're proud of them", says Ms Bennett.

Friday's BBQ picnic is the culmination of the week's events for the young people, their friends and families, with a dance exhibition, DJ, inflatable jousting and horizontal bungy. There will be a prize giving with the Prime Minister and Youth Affairs Minister Paula Bennett in the afternoon.
