Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Dot McKinnon, Bernard Wanden and Neil Riddle to the Lottery Manawatu/Whanganui Community Distribution Committee.

"These three appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Dot McKinnon is the Deputy Mayor of Whanganui and the Managing Director of the Kingsgate Hotel. She holds a number of director and chair roles and has significant involvement in the community, including the Home of Compassion, school Board of Trustees, performing arts, and regional enterprise and business.

Bernard Wanden of Levin is the owner/operator of Paper Plus Levin, a business he has run for 25 years. He is involved in the community through Rotary, the Libraries Trust and the Horowhenua College Board of Trustees. Mr Wanden is also a Justice of the Peace.

Neil Riddle of Taihape is the owner/operator of the Taihape Pharmacy, a business he has run since 2000. Prior to this he has held managerial roles in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr Riddle was previously a Captain in the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps and is also a Justice of the Peace.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Manawatu Committee has five members in total and last year gave $1.7 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. This committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

The appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
