Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Sue Price, Wendy Tozer and Jacky James to the Lottery Bay of Plenty/Gisborne Community Distribution Committee.

"These three women have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Sue Price of Mt Maunganui is a volunteer worker in the community and has dedicated her time to community services in a range of areas. Sue has previously been the owner and operator of her own business, employing a number of staff in the area and providing training for apprentices.

Wendy Tozer of Whakatane is a retail salesperson for a local business and has previously worked in a variety of areas including real estate, tutoring and education. Ms Tozer is a volunteer on various committees and groups, including hospice, community art, cycling safety, and library work.

Jacky James of Rotorua is the District Communications Manager for the Bay of Plenty Police. Ms James jointly managed the Bay of Plenty bid for involvement in the 2011 Rugby World Cup and is involved with a number of charities and community organisations including Wishing Tree, Project KPH and the World Blind Sailing Champs.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Bay of Plenty/Gisborne Committee has five members in total and last year gave $2.3 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. This Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

The appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
