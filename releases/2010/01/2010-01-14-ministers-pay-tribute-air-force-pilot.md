Defence Minister Wayne Mapp and Associate Defence Minister Heather Roy have extended their deepest condolences to the wife and family of flying instructor and Red Checkers pilot Squadron Leader Nick Cree, who was killed in a plane crash near the Ohakea Air Force base this morning.

The Ministers said Squadron Leader Cree was a highly experienced pilot and instructor. He served in two overseas missions to Timor-Leste and another to the Solomon Islands.

"Our thoughts are with Squadron Leader Cree's family as they try to come to terms with this tragedy," they said.

Dr Mapp said that every member of the Air Force had suffered a loss, as well as loved ones.

"Every day Defence Force people are training for their jobs. These are difficult and demanding tasks, often involving significant risk. They do so to serve and protect their fellow New Zealanders," he said.

"There is always an element of danger with flying and it is timely to remember that our Defence Force personnel put their lives on the line in the course of duty both when serving at home and when on deployment overseas," Mrs Roy said. 

"All New Zealanders will be saddened by the loss of a highly-skilled and professional member of the Royal New Zealand Air Force in the service of his country," the Ministers said.
