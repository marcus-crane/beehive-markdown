New Zealand is making an initial contribution of $50,000 to relief efforts in Solomon Islands following the recent earthquakes and tsunami there, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Our contribution will be allocated to various agencies working on the ground in Solomon Islands, as requests for assistance come to hand, However it is likely to include an immediate $10,000 to the Solomons' National Disaster Management Organisation to help them meet essential costs as they assess the damage and distribute relief supplies,

"We are also likely to make a significant contribution to Solomon Islands Red Cross and other similar humanitarian organisations to help them replenish stocks of essential items for around 1500 people who have been displaced by the tsunami.

"While the Solomon Islands Government has not officially requested assistance from international donors at this point, assessments of the scale of the damage are continuing, and New Zealand stands ready to provide further assistance, if requested," Mr McCully said.
