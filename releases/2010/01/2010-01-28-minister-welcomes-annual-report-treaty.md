Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has welcomed the release of two papers on Treaty of Waitangi relationships and human rights and the Treaty.

"These reports by the Human Rights Commission present factual information about developments in Crown-Maori relationships over the past year, to show progress, and to identify areas we need to keep an eye on," said Dr Sharples.

 "Today's reports themselves highlight the importance of the Treaty, and encourage all New Zealanders to read and think and discuss the issues.

"Naturally I'm pleased that the Maori Party's contribution to the government, our review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act, and a planned constitutional review are all seen as positive steps. An underlying theme is that the Treaty remains a basis for unity and equality.

"The Commission has also sought comments on how to give effect to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. I would support that call, and I look forward to seeing the Commission's final reports," said Dr Sharples.

"The Government strongly supports the idea of promoting public awareness of the Treaty, and building relationships between Maori and non-Maori at a community level," he said. "The more we know about our history, the easier it is to move together into the future."
