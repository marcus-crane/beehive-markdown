The Government's $1.6 billion investment in Auckland commuter rail continues to make strong progress with two major milestones reached today.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce officially reopened Auckland's Newmarket station and attended the signing of the $80 million contract to build 3,500 masts and portals to carry the overhead electric wires as part of the $500 million Auckland electrification project.

"After Britomart, Newmarket is the busiest train station on the Auckland network and is a major junction for trains travelling around the city," says Mr Joyce.

"Completing this project provides a new station offering all the amenities and services expected of a modern public transport facility, potential for more trains at peak times, and means fewer delays for trains coming into Newmarket."

These milestones mark progress towards a more reliable and efficient public transport network that more Aucklanders will want to use.

"New Zealand's future success is completely tied to that of Auckland as our largest city and largest local economy. These projects demonstrate the Government's big commitment to preparing Auckland's transport infrastructure for the future," says Mr Joyce.

"We need to get past the road versus rail debate. To meet its growth projections Auckland will need all transport modes operating effectively and efficiently. That's why the government is focussed on both rail and road infrastructure projects like the electrification of commuter rail, the completion of the Western Ring Route, the Victoria Park tunnel and Newmarket Viaduct.

"Once these major projects are completed over the next four or five years we will have achieved a step-change in the ability of Aucklanders to get around their city.

"Altogether the government is currently investing over $4 billion dollars in major highway projects and commuter rail in this city, without resorting to a regional fuel tax.  And that doesn't include the crucial inter-regional highway links to the north and south.

"Once the new Auckland Council is created we'll work with them to develop the next steps beyond the current wave of projects, including assessment of the timing of a third harbour crossing."
