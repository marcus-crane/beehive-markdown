Today's report in the Dominion Post which suggests that $26 million is being spent on a "charm offensive" on National Standards is wrong, says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

The headline in the newspaper, "$26 million to win over parents on tests", is both misleading and completely inaccurate.

"$26 million has been made available to provide training and support to teachers, principals and boards of trustees to help with the implementation of Standards in reading, writing and maths," says Mrs Tolley.

"This is in addition to the $36 million over four years which will be used to support schools which have identified students who need help.

"It shows the commitment this Government has to improving the lives of the one in five students who leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills they need to succeed.

"I'm looking forward to travelling around the country over the next few months and speaking to parents and communities about how National Standards will benefit children."
