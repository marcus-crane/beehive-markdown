The Government is coming to the aid of drought-stricken farmers in Northland, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

"The Government has declared Northland as a medium-level drought zone, following a recent meeting of the Northland Rural Support Trust, and a drought recovery package is now in place to help affected farmers," says Mr Carter.

All three of Northland's districts - the Far North, Whangarei and Kaipara - are affected.

Drought relief measures offered by the Government include tax assistance for farmers under the Income Equalisation Scheme, farm management advice, welfare support and funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help.

Mr Carter will be in Northland on Friday to see conditions and meet with the Northland Rural Support Trust and farmers dealing with the drought.

"I want to see and hear what's happening to make sure that relief measures and Government assistance meet the needs of those affected," says Mr Carter.

A record dry November and challenging spring conditions have led to poor pasture in many areas, which has dried out further with the recent low rainfall, high winds and temperatures.

"The situation in Northland is grim and if there is low rainfall through to March, as predicted, there won't be enough grass to feed livestock in many areas," says Mr Carter.

"As a farmer myself, I have real sympathy for the pain that farmers are feeling under these conditions. There is severe pressure on Northland rural communities.

Mr Carter says Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff will continue to actively monitor the situation and work with local Rural Support Trusts.

"I urge farmers in Northland to talk to their local Rural Support Trust and to seek advice if they are finding the conditions tough. The Government is fully committed to helping rural communities through this," says Mr Carter.
