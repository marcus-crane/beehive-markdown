Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Nigel Moore and Beverly Evans to the Lottery Otago/Southland Community Distribution Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy

Beverley Evans of Nightcaps is a volunteer with extensive community and volunteer involvement, including ambulance, victim support, Plunket, Playcentre, sport, and the community medical centre. She is the Chair of the Local Community Development Area Committee.

Nigel Moore of Gore is a Rural Real Estate Manager, an area he has been involved with for over 15 years. He has a wide range of community involvement including Toastmasters, community patrol, volunteer firefighting, and Rotary.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Otago/Southland Committee has five members in total and last year gave $1.8 million to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Otago/Southland Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

Both appointments are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013.
