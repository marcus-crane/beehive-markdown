The Governments of Fiji and New Zealand have agreed to improve diplomatic relations following talks between their respective Foreign Ministers last week.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully met his Fijian counterpart, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, in Nadi on Friday and Saturday.

A number of issues of bilateral interest to both countries were discussed in a positive and constructive atmosphere. The face-to-face meeting followed ongoing communications between the two Ministers over recent months.

The Governments have agreed to an additional Counsellor position being established for Fiji in Wellington, and for New Zealand in Suva, with approval in principle for Deputy Head of Mission appointments in each capital to follow soon.

The two Foreign Ministers agreed to keep in close contact and to meet as necessary in future.
