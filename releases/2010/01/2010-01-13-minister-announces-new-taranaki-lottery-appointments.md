Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Janette Brocklehurst, Lynn Bublitz and Matthew Hammond to the Lottery Taranaki Community Distribution Committee. He has appointed existing member, Heather Dodunski as Presiding Member of the Committee.

"These appointees have a wide range of community and business experience that will be a real asset to the work of the Committee," says Mr Guy.

Lynn Bublitz of New Plymouth is the former Deputy Mayor of New Plymouth. He has over 30 years experience in the education sector as a teacher, Deputy Principal, Principal and mentor. He also has a long standing involvement with the Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust as Member of the Executive, Board Member and Chair. Mr Bublitz was appointed as an Ordinary Companion of the Queens Service Order for services to local government, education, the arts and the community in 2007. He is also a Justice of the Peace.

Matthew Hammond of Urenui has over 40 years experience in farming, forestry and timber. Mr Hammond is a former Councillor for the Waitomo District Council. He is involved in organising various social and sporting events in the Awakino district and is involved in the community through the ratepayers association, dog trials and sports clubs.

The Lottery Grants Board allocates the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno to eleven regional and nine national committees. The Taranaki Committee has five members in total and last year gave $850,000 to local projects.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. The Taranaki Committee helps fund valuable projects that make a real difference in the local community," said Mr Guy.

The appointments of Janette Brocklehurst and Lynn Bublitz are for a term of three years, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 January 2013. The appointment of Matthew Hammond is to fill a vacancy on the Committee and his term of appointment is for the remainder of that term, commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 30 September 2010.
