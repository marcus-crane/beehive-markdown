The Government today welcomed the election of New Zealander Adrian Macey as Chair of the Kyoto Protocol at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancún, Mexico.

"This appointment reaffirms the respect in which New Zealand is held in the international climate change negotiations as well as being a personal tribute to Adrian Macey and his work as New Zealand’s Climate Change Ambassador between 2006 and 2010," Dr Smith said.

“New Zealand’s position as a developed country that is honouring its Kyoto obligations, has implemented the first ETS outside Europe, has initiated the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, and which has one of the highest proportions of renewable energy, places us in a strong position to provide leadership in the international climate change negotiations. This respect has been reinforced by the important role played by Tim Groser in the progress achieved in Cancún over the last week.

"This appointment is also a credit to New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade where Mr Macey has been a career diplomat for more than 30 years. He has developed a huge reputation for his sharp mind, careful listening and integrity in the international climate change negotiations."

Mr Macey’s appointment takes effect immediately and will involve chairing the key negotiations following on from Cancún on future commitments to emissions reductions after the existing agreement expires at the end of 2012.
