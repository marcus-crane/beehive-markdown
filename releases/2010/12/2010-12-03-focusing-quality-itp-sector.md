From next year the NZ Qualifications Authority (NZQA) will assume direct responsibility for quality assurance of Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics, taking the role from ITPNZ which has had the responsibility through ITPQ since 1993.

The Minister for Tertiary Education, Steven Joyce, says the change has come about as a result of discussions with the ITP sector about the international trend towards independent quality assurance for both public and private providers.

ITPNZ has voluntarily returned the delegation for quality assurance to NZQA.

Mr Joyce says this is the best outcome for the sector.

“The benefits of strong, independent quality assurance across the tertiary sector will help maintain and further improve confidence both here in New Zealand and internationally.”

A dedicated unit to provide services to the ITPs will be established within NZQA.

The unit will undertake course approvals, degree applications approval and external evaluation and reviews of individual ITPs. In addition an ITP Advisory Forum will be established to provide advice to NZQA on the quality assurance of the sector.

NZQA currently manages quality assurance for the PTE sector and for wananga. The university sector remains responsible for its own quality assurance.
