The Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples, today announced the appointment of Dr Grant Phillipson and the re-appointments of Sir Douglas Kidd and Dr Ann Parsonson to the Waitangi Tribunal, each for a term of three years.

“I am pleased to have such high-calibre candidates being appointed and reappointed to the Tribunal. Dr Grant Phillipson is a professional historian, who possesses a wealth of knowledge and experience of Treaty history and Tribunal processes,” said Dr Sharples.

“Both Sir Douglas Kidd and Dr Ann Parsonson have comprehensive Tribunal experience and are highly valued for their contributions to the effectiveness of the Tribunal”, he said.

Dr Grant Phillipson is currently the Chief Historian of the Tribunal. He will start in his role as a member of the Tribunal on 17 January 2011 after he completes his current duties. His professional career has involved historical research, planning, strategic management, and high-level historical advice to the Tribunal.

Sir Douglas Kidd was first appointed to the Tribunal in 2004. He is a former partner of a law firm, former Member of Parliament and former Minister of Māori Affairs. He has recently been involved on the Tribunal’s National Park Inquiry.

Dr Ann Parsonson was first appointed to the Tribunal in 2001. Dr Parsonson is amongst the nation’s most experienced historians specialising in Māori and Treaty history, with over 30 years academic and research experience. She has been an integral part of the Te Urewera Inquiry panel.

“I offer my warm congratulations to each of the members on their respective appointment and reappointments”, Dr Sharples says.
