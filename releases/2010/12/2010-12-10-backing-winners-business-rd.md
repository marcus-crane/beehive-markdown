The Government is spending $92 million over three years on business R&D through the new Technology Development Grant programme.

Announcing grants to 26 companies nation-wide in Christchurch today, Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp said that lifting high-tech export business is critical to New Zealand’s future.

“Increasing exports is an essential part of the Government’s economic strategy. These grants demonstrate the Government’s commitment to invest in businesses that have the ambition to grow through R&D,” he said.

“Today, 26 companies all over New Zealand are reaping the rewards of their ongoing commitment to R&D to grow their business. They are among the most innovative businesses in New Zealand. They have demonstrated their success through year on year increases in revenue.”

The companies span a range of sectors including manufacturing, biotechnology, 3D scanning and modelling, furniture design, digital technologies and software.

“This is about backing winners. These businesses are trailblazers in their commitment to innovation. The TIN100 list contains 19 of the 26 companies who are receiving grants today.

“New Zealand’s leading high-tech companies need to retain their competitive edge in global markets for the benefit of us all. Helping to take some of the risk out of R&D will encourage these firms to stretch for more ambitious goals.

“This is the largest business investment the Government has ever made in helping business innovate. The businesses will have more financial certainty over the next three years. They will be able to accelerate the development of innovative products and services and take them to their clients all over the world,” the Minister said.

The investments start at $490,000 and range up to the maximum level of $7.2 million over three years.

The Technology Development Grant is one of the flagship business assistance funds announced in Budget 2010 to boost business R&D. It is for 20 per cent of a business’s annual R&D spend. Investments are capped at $2.4m per year for three years.

“We are already planning for the 2011 round when, again, we will be investing in businesses who will take their R&D to the next level,” the Minister said.
