A webpage launched today will give people accurate information about the common marine and coastal area, Attorney-General Chris Finlayson said today.

“The Government is guaranteeing free public access to the common marine and coastal area and it is important people know that”, Mr Finlayson said. “The webpage provides the facts about the common marine and coastal area and answers many questions people have asked.”

“It will be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to know more about the Bill.”

“There is a certain amount of misinformation out there about the common marine and coastal area. This webpage clarifies that free public access to the common marine and coastal area is guaranteed under the bill and that existing rights, such as navigation and fishing rights, are protected.

The Government introduced the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill earlier this year. The bill repeals the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, and:

• Guarantees free public access;

• Makes a common space of the public marine and coastal area, ensuring it can never be sold;

• Protects all existing uses, including recreational fishing and navigation rights;

• Addresses two fundamental rights violated by the Foreshore and Seabed Act – the right to access justice through the courts, and property rights;

• Protects, and in some cases extends, rights of vital infrastructure such as ports and aquaculture.

Information on the webpage, which can be accessed via the Beehive website, includes a detailed breakdown of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill, background information on how the bill was developed and responses to public concerns.

“The Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill is about restoring access to justice and common property rights that were taken away under the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. These are principles valued by all New Zealanders”, Mr Finlayson said.
