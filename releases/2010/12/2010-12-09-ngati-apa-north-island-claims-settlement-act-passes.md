Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson welcomed the passage of the Ngāti Apa (North Island) Claims Settlement Act by Parliament this afternoon.

The Act settles of all Ngāti Apa’s (North Island) historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.

The claims of Ngāti Apa (North Island) relate primarily to breaches by the Crown of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi relating to the purchase in 1849 of the 260,000 acre Rangitikei-Turakina block.

“As part of this settlement the Crown apologises to Ngāti Apa for past dealings that breached the Crown’s obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi,” Mr Finlayson said.

The cultural redress of this settlement includes 12 Crown sites transferred as well as statutory acknowledgments, deeds of recognition and place name changes provided to Ngāti Apa in recognition of their association with sites within their area of interest.

The settlement also provides Ngāti Apa iwi an opportunity for cultural revitalisation through the gifting of papakainga properties and funding to implement a cultural redevelopment plan including programmes that cover such areas as te reo.

The financial and commercial redress in the settlement includes a cash payment of $16 million, a right of first refusal to buy Crown properties and an ability to purchase licensed Crown forest land and receive associated rentals.

“The Crown can never fully compensate Ngāti Apa for its losses and dispossession,” he said. “But through the Settlement in this Bill, we can provide the means for them to move forward to achieve their vision for a dynamic future”.

The Government has accelerated the momentum of the Treaty settlement process, in order to reach just and durable settlement of historical claims.
