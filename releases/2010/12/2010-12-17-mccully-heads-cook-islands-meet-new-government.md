Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to the Cook Islands today to meet new Cook Islands Prime Minister, Henry Puna and his recently appointed Cabinet.

“New Zealand and the Cook Islands have a particularly close relationship, underpinned by extensive personal links and our shared citizenship,” Mr McCully said.

"The visit will include discussions with the new government on a range of issues affecting our two countries, and New Zealand’s programme of development assistance in the Cooks.

“It will also be an opportunity to see first hand the reconstruction efforts on Aitutaki following Cyclone Pat earlier this year. In addition to our immediate humanitarian response, New Zealand provided a $6.4 million package to help rebuild homes and key infrastructure.

“Repairs to 95 extensively damaged houses are due to be finished before Christmas, and 65 new homes will be ready early next year. The hospital has been repaired and repair work on schools and evacuation shelters will be completed shortly.”

Mr McCully returns to New Zealand on 20 December.
