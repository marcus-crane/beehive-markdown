Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the reappointment of Mike Willing as a member and vice-chair of the governing board of the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ).

JAS-ANZ is responsible for overseeing a joint accreditation system that ensures safety and quality, and underpins environmental management schemes. As a trans-Tasman organisation, JAS-ANZ strengthens trade between New Zealand, Australia and other countries.

“I’m pleased Mr Willing has agreed to another term. He brings strong governance skills, as well as a good understanding of the role of standards and conformance in domestic and international trade,” Mr Power said.

Mr Willing’s three-year term begins on 1 January.

Background

Mike Willing is currently involved in the tertiary sector as a director of New Era IT Limited, a provider of ICT infrastructure services to the New Zealand education sector, and is a director of International Operations at New Era Pathways, a provider of education strategic planning, implementation, and advisory services. He has been on the JAS-ANZ governing board since 2004 in both chair and vice-chair roles.

JAS-ANZ was established under a 1991 treaty between Australia and New Zealand.
