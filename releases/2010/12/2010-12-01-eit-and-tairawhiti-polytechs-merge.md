Cabinet has accepted a proposal that will see the Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT) and Tairawhiti Polytechnic merge as of 1 January 2011.

Tertiary Education Steven Joyce says the new institution – which will be one of New Zealand’s largest - is an exciting opportunity for the Hawkes’ Bay and Gisborne.

“The merger will create one institution with a strong base to support and expand vocational education and skills development across the East Coast.

“The merger will take advantage of the academic and financial strength of EIT and result in a strong tertiary education provider well-placed to serve the needs of both Tairāwhiti and Hawkes’ Bay.

“It will result in the delivery of higher level qualifications in the Tairāwhiti region which will bring economic and social benefits for the community.”

“I would like to thank the staff of both institutions for their support for the proposal. Their input will be vital in the coming months as the merged institution takes shape.

“I was also impressed with the details raised by many submitters during the recent public consultation,” says Mr Joyce.

Following Cabinet’s recommendation, the Governor General’s agreement is required to disestablish Tairāwhiti Polytechnic. The two institutions will be merged, effective from 1 January 2011.

The merger will be supported by additional government investment of up to $7.5 million. EIT is required to regularly report on the progress of the merger over the next two years.
