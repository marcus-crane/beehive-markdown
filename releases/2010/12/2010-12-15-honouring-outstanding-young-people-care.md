Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today celebrated with 14 young people from foster care who won William Wallace Awards.

William Wallace scholarships are an annual award for children in care, sparked by a bequest to Child, Youth and Family from a former foster child.

“I'm always impressed with young people who achieve their goals with absolute determination,” says Ms Bennett.

“What sets this group of young achievers apart is the strength of character they've shown overcoming a difficult start in life and taking charge of their futures,” says Ms Bennett.

Each scholarship recipient will receive between $1,500 to $3,000 towards tertiary, vocational or leadership training.

This year’s William Wallace Award winners include university entrants, aspiring athletes and performing artists.

“These young people and their foster families should be really proud of what they’ve achieved,” says Ms Bennett.

“With the right support, these young people can achieve great things despite having to deal with major obstacles in their lives,” says Ms Bennett.
