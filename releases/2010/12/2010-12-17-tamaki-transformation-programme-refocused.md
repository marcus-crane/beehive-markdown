Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today announced the Government’s intention to create an Interim Tamaki Transformation Board (ITTB).

The ITTB will move the Tamaki Transformation Programme, a 15 to 20 year project aimed at redeveloping the Tamaki area, to its next phase.  Its brief will be to explore urban regeneration entities to provide Ministers and the new Auckland Council with advice on options and a recommended structure, scope, mandate and legal form for a new regeneration entity.

Mr Heatley says it is possible this interim governance structure may develop into New Zealand’s first Urban Development Agency.

"The Establishment Board’s focus when appointed in 2007 was on community engagement and improving the quality of state housing in Tamaki.

"The new Board will build on the positive levels of community engagement and take steps to formally partner with Auckland Council to create measurable improvement under four key components," he said.

"A social component will support Tamaki residents and families to get the skills, knowledge and employment opportunities they need. An economic component will look at measures to strengthen the local economy. A spatial component will create safe and connected neighbourhoods and the housing resources component will look at making optimal use of land and existing housing stock. This will inevitably mean extensive subdivision, building and infrastructure investment," says Mr Heatley.

"The Establishment Board has reached the end of its tenure. It has done a great job and I want to thank them for the work they have put in to this important project. Establishment Board Chair, Pat Snedden, has agreed to continue to oversee Tamaki until a new interim board is appointed at the end of March 2011", he said.

"The Tamaki Transformation project is extremely important to the Government.

The ITTB will be made up of Chief Executives of all relevant ministries as they are best placed to drive improvements and I will ask Auckland Council to advise on iwi and community candidates," said Mr Heatley.

"I will also be liaising with Mayor Len Brown regarding the appointment of two senior officials from the Auckland Council," he said.

"It is important that we get the right people with the right skills and influence in place to drive the transformation of Tamaki. A strong Auckland Council presence on the new Board is essential to achieve this."
