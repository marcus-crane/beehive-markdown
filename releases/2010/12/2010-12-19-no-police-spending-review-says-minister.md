There is no review of Police spending planned, Police Minister Judith Collins said in response to today’s Sunday Star-Times article “Police facing cutbacks.”

“There is no review of Police spending, and I do not anticipate a review of Police spending, by Rod Deane or anyone else,” Ms Collins said.

“The focus of the Government is on the Policing Excellence project, and ensuring Police have the tools and the support they need to keep the public safe.

“By the end of 2011 there will be 600 more officers on the beat than there was when National was elected to Government.”
