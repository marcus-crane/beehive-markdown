Minister for Regulatory Reform Rodney Hide today announced the Regulatory Reform (Revocations) Order 2010 which will clean up red tape and get outdated regulations off the books.

“Through regulation, government has the power to affect the lives of every New Zealander.  We need to use that power responsibly and ensure that only necessary and useful regulations are in force,” Mr Hide said.

“I asked all government departments to have a hard look at the regulations in their area, and tell me which ones should go.

“As a result, a total of 206 regulations have been put forward for repeal. 

“Better – and less - regulation will ultimately make New Zealand more productive and prosperous.

“The Regulatory Reform (Revocations) Order 2010 is an important piece of work which will help to achieve this,” Mr Hide said.
