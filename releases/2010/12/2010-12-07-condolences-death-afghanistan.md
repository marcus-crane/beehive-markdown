Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has expressed the Government’s deepest condolences to the family of the New Zealander killed in Afghanistan while serving in the British Army.

“It takes great courage to serve in Afghanistan. Every service person, whether in the New Zealand Defence Force or a similar service such as the British, knows they risk death or injury. They do so because they wish to serve their country and to protect us from terrorism.

“The New Zealand Defence Force is doing everything it can to assist the family and that will continue as long as necessary.

“This New Zealander has made the supreme sacrifice for the freedom of people everywhere. We mourn his loss and will do everything we can to support his family in the painful days and weeks ahead,” the Minister said.
