New Zealand has designated a further three international terrorist groups under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

The groups are: the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the National Liberation Army (ELN) of Colombia and Harakat-ul Jihad al Islami - Bangladesh.

“All three entities have committed various terrorist acts, including the indiscriminate killing of civilians,” says Mr Key.

“As a result of the designations, any assets held by the groups and found in New Zealand either now or in the future will be frozen. It will also be a criminal offence to deal with their property or make property or financial services available to them.

“Forms of support, such as fundraising and recruiting or harbouring terrorists, are criminal offences in New Zealand, regardless of whether a group is designated as a terrorist entity or not.

“These designations of non-UN listed entities are a counter-terrorism measure in line with our international obligations to suppress terrorist activities. They are not a response to domestic terrorist threats in New Zealand and nor are they influenced by New Zealand’s relationship with other countries. However, they do form part of our Government’s support against terrorism activities,” says Mr Key.

“Further, these designations help implement our international obligations under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, which is aimed at preventing terrorist activities.”

To date New Zealand has designated under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 nearly 500 terrorist groups and individuals listed by the United Nations, and 11 other terrorist entities not listed by the UN. They are Al-Shabaab (Somalia), ETA (Spain), FARC (Colombia), PKK (Turkey), Indian Mujahideen, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the Real Irish Republican Army, the Continuity Irish Republican Army, the New People’s Army/Communist Party of the Philippines, and Hizbollah’s military wing.
