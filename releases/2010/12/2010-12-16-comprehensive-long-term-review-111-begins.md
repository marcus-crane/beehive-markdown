The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, announced today that terms of reference for a comprehensive review of the long term future of the 111 calling service have been agreed.

Mr Joyce says the review, which was signalled following 111 disruptions earlier in the year, will ensure a framework is put in place which accommodates changing technologies, practices and structures.

“The review will provide certainty about the governance framework that controls the component parts of the 111 call system, and how new methods of reaching emergency services should be implemented.

“In particular, it will clarify who will have operational accountability for the delivery of the 111 calling service in each of the component parts, and who will have accountability for funding, maintaining, auditing, investigating and enforcing delivery of the 111 service component parts.”

The terms of reference have been discussed with emergency service providers and telecommunications providers, and both groups support the review.

“The terms cover the scope of the proposed review, advances in technology, governance requirements (including funding, audit and enforcement) and timing and consultation from the point of call origination through to the initial call answering point,” says Mr Joyce.

A draft discussion document will be ready for public consultation by the June quarter of next year.

“The review is one of a number of initiatives that were announced following the 111 service outages earlier in the year,” says Mr Joyce.

Other initiatives included:

- A memorandum of understanding with Telecom regarding its delivery of some aspects of the 111 service
- A revised TCF Emergency Services Code which covers the industry input into the 111 service
- A memorandum of understanding between Telecom, Vodafone and 2Degrees regarding emergency roaming
- Agreement between Telecom and Police, Fire, and Ambulance in respect of activating emergency roaming on the XT network for calls from compatible mobile phones; and
- Creation of a joint industry/government advisory board to oversee coordination of the emergency calling service activity.

“It is anticipated that many of these interim initiatives will be formalised or endorsed by the long-term review,” says Mr Joyce.

The Terms of Reference is available on the Ministry of Economic Development's website at [www.med.govt.nz/111](http://www.med.govt.nz/111).
