Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today that the review of the Crown Minerals Act (1991) and the review of associated minerals programmes and regulations will now be considered as a single package.

“It was originally envisaged that the review of the Crown Minerals Act would be complete by November this year, and a bill introduced into the House in December 2010.

“A second phase of consultation on revised minerals programmes for petroleum and for minerals other than petroleum, and on the various regulations, was to follow in 2011,” Mr Brownlee said.

“However, submitters have been clear that they want the opportunity to comment on all aspects of the minerals management regime at the same time.

“Releasing the package as a whole will enable people to comment on discrete changes and the overall proposed system. People will also be able to see how the first set of submissions has been considered.”

The review of the Crown Minerals Act is a key component of the government's Petroleum Action Plan, which aims to maximise the gains from New Zealand's petroleum resources for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

“This three-part system should be a seamless tool for the efficient and effective management of the Crown’s interest, and for the maximisation of economic returns to New Zealand from our mineral resources,” Mr Brownlee said.

A revised review document proposing changes to the minerals programmes and regulations, as well as to the Act, will be prepared for public consultation by the end of April 2011.
