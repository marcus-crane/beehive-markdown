The Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Steven Joyce, has welcomed an announcement from Crown Fibre Holdings that further negotiations are underway for the rollout of ultra-fast broadband (UFB).

Crown Fibre Holdings (CFH) has settled on three more parties to start negotiating binding offers for the rollout of UFB infrastructure:

- Enable Networks, covering Christchurch and Rangiora;
- Flute Joint Venture, covering Dunedin; and
- Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd, covering all areas except those covered by Northpower, UltraFast Fibre Limited and Alpine Energy bids.

“I’m pleased with the progress being made on this important infrastructure build project,” says Mr Joyce.

“Much faster broadband is an important part of the government’s growth strategy and we are well on track to deliver that.

“Within the last two weeks we have confirmed the first Local Fibre Company partners and confirmed the parties for the second round of negotiations. Tomorrow, the first government-funded fibre will be going in the ground. In addition good progress is being made on the complementary rural broadband initiative.”

“I look forward to receiving CFH's next recommendations on binding offers in the first quarter of 2011,” says Mr Joyce.
