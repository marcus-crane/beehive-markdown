Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Dr Andrew Jack as Chief Censor.

Dr Jack has 26 years experience in the public service and significant legal expertise that includes working with the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.

He is currently the Group Manager, Legal and Advisory Services at the New Zealand Customs Service and has worked for the New Zealand Police as Chief Legal Advisor.

“Dr Jack has a strong legal background and experience in dealing with law enforcement,” says Mr Guy.

“The role of Chief Censor is a difficult and demanding role with responsibility for classifying publications that may need to be restricted or banned. It involves balancing the freedom of expression with potential harm caused to the community.”

Dr Jack has been appointed for a three year term commencing 7 March 2011. His appointment follows the resignation of Bill Hastings, in July 2010, who took up a new role as District Court Judge and Chair of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification is an independent Crown entity, established by the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.

The Chief Censor is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs, acting with the concurrence of the Minister of Women’s Affairs and the Minister of Justice.
