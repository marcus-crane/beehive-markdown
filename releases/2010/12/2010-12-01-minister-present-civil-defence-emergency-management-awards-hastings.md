Civil Defence Minister John Carter will present the Ministerial Awards for Civil Defence Emergency Management in Hastings tonight.

The awards were introduced by Mr Carter in October 2009 to recognise career and volunteer personnel with the New Zealand Civil Defence sector.

“Emergencies will happen to communities – we don’t know when or where, but we know that they will strike. Civil Defence volunteers play an integral and extremely important part in responding to events” says Mr Carter.

"I am delighted to be making the presentations to these Hastings volunteers who are all receiving long service awards. All these people have made significant contributions and deserve recognition at a national level," says Mr Carter.
