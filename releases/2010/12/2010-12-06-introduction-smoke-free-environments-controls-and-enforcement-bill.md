Legislation to discourage smoking by removing displays of tobacco products in dairies and other retail outlets was introduced in Parliament today by Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia.

“This Government is serious about reducing the harm caused by smoking and it is vital that we do more to help people quit smoking and stop young people from being tempted to take up the habit.

“The evidence shows that most people who smoke want to quit. It’s harder to quit when you walk into a shop and are confronted with the instant temptation of tobacco on display.

“There is a growing body of evidence that tobacco displays prompt impulse purchasing and that there is a link between displays and young people taking up smoking.

“I’m very pleased that this Bill deals with the issue of having tobacco advertising or marketing in the face of our children and young people every time they go into a shop.

"I am looking forward to the time when I can walk into the local corner shop without being confronted with images of tobacco enticing customers to take up a habit which is unhealthy, addictive, and costly,” says Mrs Turia.

The Bill will now go through first reading before being referred to the Health Select Committee for public submissions.

Mrs Turia says the Bill meets three recommendations of the Maori Affairs Select Committee’s tobacco inquiry to ban tobacco retail displays, ban retailers from using tobacco trading names to advertise tobacco and stricter restrictions on selling tobacco to minors.

The Government is still considering the other recommendations made by the Maori Affairs Select Committee with a response due in early February.
