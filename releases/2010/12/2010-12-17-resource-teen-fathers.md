Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has launched a new resource to help support teen fathers.

The booklet Supporting Teen Fathers: A resource for service providers will be used by organisations working directly with teen fathers.

“Teen fathers are often overlooked as teen parent initiatives tending to focus on teen mothers,” says Ms Bennett.

The National Government is investing $730,000 in support specifically for teen fathers, with a further $20 million on broader teen parent support.

“We know children do better when their dads have a positive role in their life, so let’s help young dads do exactly that,” says Ms Bennett.

“We also know that teenage mothers parent better when they have strong social and emotional support from their child's father.

“The booklet provides a starting point for sharing practices and the expertise and knowledge of those working with teen fathers,” said Ms Bennett.
