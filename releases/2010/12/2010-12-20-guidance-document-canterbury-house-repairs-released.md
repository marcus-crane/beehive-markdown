A Department of Building and Housing document released today will provide guidance on the repair and rebuilding of houses in earthquake affected Canterbury, Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The Guidance on House Repairs and Reconstruction following the Canterbury Earthquake will help speed up the rebuilding effort while enhancing quality and safety.

Mr Williamson says the document will assist in the recovery effort by providing a clear and consistent approach to the rebuilding work as desired by councils, insurers, designers and builders.

“A consistent approach to repair and reconstruction in areas will minimise delays and aid the recovery. This document proposes engineering solutions that enhance quality and safety and are consistent, robust and well considered.”

The document is part of the Government’s support for recovery in Canterbury and the Department of Building and Housing’s ongoing work to simplify and streamline consent processes in Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri.

At this stage the guidance only applies to houses affected by the Canterbury earthquake, but the Department of Building and Housing will consider incorporating them into more general guidance for the rest of the country at a later date following sector consultation.
