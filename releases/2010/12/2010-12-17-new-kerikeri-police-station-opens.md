Kerikeri’s new $4 million Police Station will bring 60 police staff together under one roof and enable them to better serve the community, Police Minister Judith Collins said today.

“Our New Zealand Police deserve plenty of support and good working conditions if they are perform at their best,” Ms Collins said.

“It’s long been recognised that the existing complex, part of which dates back to 1957, did not meet the demands of a modern Police service.

“The new facility has been purpose built to make Police operations easier, more efficient and more effective. It will also be a focal point and a source of pride for the community.”

The 1000 sq m, two-storey station will bring the area’s staff together under one roof. Previously, staff were spread across three buildings.

The station - which will serve as the area headquarters - contains interview rooms, a community meeting room, training facilities and three holding cells.

It will be the base for approximately 60 Police staff made up of general duties, investigators, road policing, area headquarters staff, youth and community services. It will also house Neighbourhood Support and Victim Support staff.

“From the outset, the people of Kerikeri have been a part of the team that made this facility a reality,” Ms Collins said.

“I would like to thank the members of the community and iwi who provided feedback, advice and assistance to the Police during this project.”
