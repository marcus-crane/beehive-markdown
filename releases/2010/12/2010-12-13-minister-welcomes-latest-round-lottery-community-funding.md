Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced $6,813,063 million in funding for 27 projects through the Lottery Communities Facilities Committee.

“A range of exciting projects around the country have received funding, helping to build or improve important community facilities.”

Highlights include:

- $750,000 for construction of a community house in Southland
- $500,000 to the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra Trust
- $750,000 to the Muriwai Lifeguard Service Amenities Trust in Auckland
- $750,000 towards the Regent Theatre upgrade in Dunedin
- $750,000 for a multi-sports facility upgrade in Starling Park, Auckland
- $750,000 towards the construction of a performing arts facility in Porirua.

"These projects will significantly benefit their communities, regions and the whole nation. Without this assistance, most would not happen.

"This shows how lottery funding helps to build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

In total, $153 million will be distributed amongst the community this year from the profits of lotteries such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.
