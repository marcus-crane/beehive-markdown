A bill tightening up tobacco controls has passed its first reading in Parliament today and will now go to select committee for public submissions.

Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia says the introduction of the Smoke-free Environments (Controls and Enforcement) Bill is a further signal that this Government is serious about reducing the harm caused by smoking.

The Bill proposes banning tobacco retail displays and retailers from using tobacco trading names to advertise tobacco and stricter restrictions on selling tobacco to minors.

“Its objectives are simple - make tobacco less visible and attractive by reducing the marketing and advertising that still exist and make tobacco less accessible by providing for better measures to prevent sales to children and young people under the age of 18.

“Ultimately it’s about saving lives and it’s vital that we do more to help people quit smoking and stop young people from being tempted to take up the habit,” says Mrs Turia.

“The evidence shows that most people who smoke want to quit. It’s harder to quit when you walk into a shop and are confronted with the instant temptation of tobacco on display.

“I’m very pleased that this Bill deals with the issue of having tobacco advertising or marketing in the face of our children and young people every time they go into a shop.”

The Bill will now be referred to the Health Select Committee for public submissions.
