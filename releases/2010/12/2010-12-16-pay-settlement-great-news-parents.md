Education Minister Anne Tolley has welcomed the decision by primary school principals and teachers to accept new pay settlements.

“I commend the teachers and principals for recognising that these are fair offers in the current economic climate,” says Mrs Tolley.

“I also want to acknowledge the rational and reasonable approach of their union negotiators, alongside the efforts of the Ministry of Education.

“This gives peace of mind for parents and students, as schools can continue to focus on lifting achievement.

“I hope that this encourages the PPTA to return to the negotiating table to reach a settlement for secondary teachers in a calm and constructive manner, as families have had enough of their industrial action.”
