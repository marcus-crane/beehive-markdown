An independent expert panel has been appointed to review the provision of defence science and technology support in New Zealand, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp announced today.

“Expert advice on scientific and technological issues in defence is essential for the Defence Force to perform the tasks expected of it,” Dr Mapp said.

“The Defence White Paper identified the need for a comprehensive external review of the Defence Technology Agency and the provision of defence science and technology outcomes for New Zealand.

“In the coming decades the DTA will be expected to provide high-quality scientific leadership. This review will ensure that.”

The panel will be led by Rear Admiral (Rtd) David Ledson. The other members are the former CEO of the Ministry of Research, Science Technology Dr Helen Anderson, and scientist and entrepreneur Neville Jordan.

The panel will be talking with New Zealand stakeholders such as the security sector, science and business communities, as well as looking to overseas experiences and models of successfully delivering defence science and technology.

Interested parties will be able to make submissions to the panel online from late January, through the Defence Force website. A final report on the findings of the review will go to Dr Mapp in late March 2011.
