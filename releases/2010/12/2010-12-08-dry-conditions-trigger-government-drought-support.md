The Government is coming to the aid of Northland farmers facing worsening drought conditions.

Agriculture Minister David Carter has today declared all areas north of the Auckland Harbour Bridge a medium-level drought zone, triggering relief measures for farmers.

These include funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help, welfare support and farm management advice.

Mr Carter has been in Northland today meeting with farmers, Rural Support Trust members and primary sector representatives to discuss the dry conditions.

“The situation in Northland is serious.  Farmers are still recovering from last summer’s drought and they’re now facing it all over again, weeks earlier than expected,” says Mr Carter.

“Even if there is a wet summer, as some weather experts are predicting, this won’t change the severity of the situation as Northland has experienced its driest spring on record.

“This is putting pressure on many farmers and I urge those who are finding it tough to seek farm management advice.  Now is the time to look at stocking rates and feed levels, and to make the hard decisions.

“Across the country, it’s shaping up to be a long summer and there is every likelihood other areas will soon find themselves in the same situation as Northland.”

Mr Carter says Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff are actively monitoring conditions around the country, and working with local Rural Support Trusts, Federated Farmers and industry groups.
