Minister for the Environment Nick Smith today released a report that shows dioxin levels in the soil surrounding the former Fruitgrowers Chemical Company site in Mapua are lower than nationally and internationally recommended levels.

“This report should provide the local community with reassurance that the soils around the site have not been contaminated and are fit for purpose,” Dr Smith said.

“The levels of dioxin at Mapua were at least 50 times less than the values for rural residential locations in the Government’s proposed national environment standard for contaminated soils, consulted on earlier this year. Furthermore they are well below other international standards for dioxin.”

In August 2007, the Ministry for the Environment completed the cleanup of the former Fruitgrowers Chemical Company site. As with any earthworks project, and despite the dust mitigation measures undertaken, there were discharges of dust from the site.

Some local residents have been concerned that dust contaminated with dioxin may have settled on their properties. To reassure residents the Ministry commissioned an independent investigation into dioxin concentrations in residential soils around the site.

“The results of 10 soil samples taken show the concentration of dioxins were similar to those found in other similar locations within New Zealand,” Dr Smith said.

“This further report shows the Mapua community can begin to put the pollution problems at the former Fruitgrowers Chemical Company site behind it.”
