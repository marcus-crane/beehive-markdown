Global services management company Serco has been selected to manage the Mt Eden/Auckland Central Remand Prison from next year, Corrections Minister Judith Collins announced today.

Serco, a British company with operations in Europe, the Middle-East, Asia-Pacific and North America, was one of three companies that sought the contract through a Request for Proposal process.

Following evaluation and negotiations phase, the Department of Corrections recommended to the Minister of Corrections that Serco be selected as the successful contract partner. This was endorsed by Cabinet yesterday.

“This Government is committed to a world-class Corrections system in New Zealand. To achieve that, we must have access to world-class innovation and expertise,” Ms Collins said.

“The appointment of Serco as the contract manager for Mt Eden/ACRP will bring in new ideas and international best practice which will benefit the entire corrections sector.

“Serco has a strong track record in managing prisons. I’m confident that the company will bring the high standards of professionalism, safety, rehabilitation and security expected by the Government to Mt Eden/ACRP.”

ACRP was successfully contracted out under a National Government from 2000-2005 before the law was changed by the Labour Government to prohibit private management of prisons.

In 2009 the Government passed the Corrections (Contract Management of Prisons) Amendment Act 2009, which allowed private sector organisations to tender for contracts to manage prisons, on a case-by-case basis.

A number of the innovations introduced by the former contract manager were adopted by Corrections for use in public prisons and are still being used today.

The prison will operate within the current Corrections framework. All prisoners will remain the responsibility of the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections.

The contract manager will have to comply with all relevant New Zealand legislation and international obligations. Prisoners will still have the right to raise issues of concern with the Office of the Ombudsmen or Corrections Chief Executive, as they would in a publicly managed prison.

A contract is intended to be signed by 31 January 2011 and the site will be fully handed over to Serco by August 2011. The contract will be for six years, with the option to extend for a further four years. Probity assurance has been provided by Audit New Zealand.
