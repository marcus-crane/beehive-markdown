Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Te Raumawhitu (Te Rau) Kupenga to the Broadcasting Standards Authority board.

Mr Kupenga has been appointed for three years. He has a legal background and is currently an iwi consultant working with Ngati Porou. He also held senior positions in the Office of the Maori Trustee and recently was a regular panellist on a lifestyle television show.

‘’Te Rau’s legal experience will add a valuable perspective to the Broadcasting Standards Authority”, Dr Coleman says.

‘’He has a broad skill-set and has some broadcasting experience himself, so he’s a good appointment to the board.’’

The Broadcasting Standards Authority is a quasi-judicial tribunal established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. The Authority is tasked with overseeing New Zealand’s broadcasting standards regime covering programmes on television and radio.

Dr Coleman also acknowledged the work of Auckland journalist and outgoing board member Tapu Misa.

‘’Tapu served nearly eight years on the board and I’d like to thank her for her work and dedication. She’s been a great asset for the Broadcasting Standards Authority.’’
