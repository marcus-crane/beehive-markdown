Civil Defence Minister John Carter today praised three international agreements that will bring New Zealand, Australian and United States civil defence agencies closer together.

“These agreements will allow the agencies to support each other during and after emergencies, including maintaining 24/7 contact points as necessary,” Mr Carter says.

“Our agencies will be better able to share information, expertise and experience to help reduce risks and improve readiness before emergencies.”

The third of the agreements, a memorandum of cooperation between the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management and the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was signed today.

The process began in May last year when the Ministry and the Attorney-General’s Department of Australia signed a formal administrative arrangement. Emergency management is one of the functions of the Attorney-General’s Department in Australia.

That agreement was followed by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Australian Attorney-General’s Department and FEMA.

As well as setting out arrangements between the two signatories, each agreement also includes provision for multilateral relationships and work in the Pacific region.
