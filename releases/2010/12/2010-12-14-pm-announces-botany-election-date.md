Prime Minister John Key has announced that the date for a by-election in Botany will be Saturday 5 March.

The by-election follows the announcement today of the impending resignation of National MP Pansy Wong. Mrs Wong’s resignation takes effect on 17 January 2011.

“I would like to recognise the long service and dedication Pansy has given the National Party as both a Cabinet Minister and Member of Parliament.

“Her commitment to Botany and ethnic communities all over New Zealand cannot be questioned and she will be missed,” says Mr Key.

Mrs Wong entered Parliament as a list MP in 1996 and won the seat of Botany in the 2008 general election.

“The by-election Writ day will be Tuesday 1 February. The last day for candidate nominations to be received will be 8 February and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Wednesday 23 March.”
