The Crown and Ngāti Porou have signed a Deed of Settlement for the settlement of all Ngāti Porou’s historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ngāti Porou is New Zealand’s second largest iwi with 72,000 members, 58 hapū and 48 marae on the East Coast of the North Island. “I am very happy to bring this settlement to a conclusion,” Mr Finlayson said. “The settlement of such a major claim will put longstanding historical grievances to rest and bring significant benefits both to Ngāti Porou and to the East Coast region.”

The settlement includes financial redress of $110 million and the return of sites of high cultural significance in Ngāti Porou totalling approximately 5,898 hectares. It also provides Ngāti Porou with input into the strategic governance of specific conservation sites and relationship agreements designed to facilitate good working relationships between specific Crown agencies and Ngāti Porou.

The Crown and Ngāti Porou initialled the Deed of Settlement on 23 October 2010, and hui to consider the settlement were held throughout New Zealand and Australia. The people of Ngāti Porou voted in support of the Deed with an approval rate of over 90 percent.

“The settling of historical Treaty claims marks the beginning of a new relationship for Ngāti Porou and the Crown,” said Mr Finlayson. “The unprecedented acceleration of the settlement process has brought closure to a growing number of communities in recent times. With settlements on the verge of completion with Turanga iwi, all historical claims in the East Coast region will soon be settled.”

Legislation will be introduced to finalise the settlement in the New Year.
