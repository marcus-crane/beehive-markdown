Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is urging New Zealanders to celebrate the outstanding contribution volunteers make to their communities.

This Sunday is International Volunteer Day and today Mrs Turia released the latest Quarterly Generosity Indicators Update June 2010.

“Everyday of the week volunteers are helping in their communities whether it’s saving lives or just ensuring life is a little more comfortable.

“Approximately one million people volunteered in the June quarter with almost a third of the people surveyed volunteering in the previous three months,” says Mrs Turia.

The Update also shows that donating money was the most stable form of giving, with about 40% of people donating money in December 2009, March and June 2010 quarters.

“There is nothing more inspiring than watching people helping others in their community or hearing about a community working together for a common goal.

“As well as contributing to building a strong and healthy community, volunteering can also break down social barriers,” says Mrs Turia.

“We should never under-estimate how important volunteers are and I would like to thank the volunteers who give their time and energy to make communities thrive.”
