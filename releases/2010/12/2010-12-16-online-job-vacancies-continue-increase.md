Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says latest figures show online job vacancies increased by 2.6% over the last three months.

“It's good to see jobs vacancies are still on the rise as winter ends and the holiday season begins,” says Ms Bennett.

Skilled job vacancies also rose by 2.7% during the three months to November.

Hospitality and tourism (up 7.5%), and IT (up 7.3%) were the best industry performers.

Auckland (up 5.1%) and Christchurch (up 4.1%) continue to have the strongest regional growth in skilled job vacancies for the three months to November.

Job vacancies online have consistently increased since midway through last year’s recession.

With total vacancies up by 47.0% and skilled vacancies by 43.6% since June 2009.

The Jobs Online indicator provides information on labour market demand by measuring data from online job advertisers, Trade Me Jobs and SEEK.
