Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has today introduced a new Bill to Parliament that proposes changes to the Building Act 2004.

The Building Amendment Bill (No 3) is the result of a comprehensive review of the Building Act 2004.

“It forms part of a package of changes aimed at lifting the overall performance and productivity of the building and construction sector,” Mr Williamson says.

The Bill spells out clear accountabilities for the code compliance of building work for building practitioners, building consent authorities and consumers.

It also provides for a risk-based consenting process where the amount of checking and inspection is aligned to the risk and complexity of the work and the skills and capability of the people doing the work.

"This Bill will make it clearer who is accountable for what. People will know what is expected of them and what they can rely on others for. This should see more work built right first time.”

The proposed changes to the building consent system are expected to reduce compliance costs over time but not at the expense of building quality or public safety.

The Bill includes a Code of Ethics under the Licensed Building Practitioners Scheme and licensed building practitioners will be able to be disciplined for breaches or behaviour that brings the scheme into disrepute.

After its first reading the Bill will be referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee and is expected to be enacted in 2011.
