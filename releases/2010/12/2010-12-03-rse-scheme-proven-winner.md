New research released today by the World Bank and Waikato University shows the Government’s Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme is producing positive spin-offs for Tonga and Vanuatu.

RSE, which supplies migrant workers for the local horticulture and viticulture industry when New Zealanders are not available for work, improved per capita income for Pacific households with RSE workers by almost 40 percent.

‘’While the Government is committed to making sure Kiwis are first in line for jobs, RSE has supplied the horticulture and viticulture industry with the workers it needs in parts of the country when there are no New Zealanders available,’’ says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

‘’We know that New Zealand growers benefit from RSE, and this report now shows that the flow-on effects for our Pacific neighbours are significant.’’

Other key findings from the research include:

- RSE households were more likely to make home improvements and make major durable goods purchases;
- RSE households are more likely to have a bank account; and
- in Tonga, there have been significant increases in secondary school attendance for 15 to 18 year-olds in households participating in RSE.

New Zealand’s RSE scheme, which enters its fourth season, attracts approximately 6,500 workers a year, mostly from Tonga, Vanuatu and Samoa.
