Social Development Minister Paula Bennett unveiled the Government’s new cyber contract mapping tool in Parliament today.

Contract Mapping details community providers’ locations and the Government funding they receive around the country, on a publicly accessible website.

“Using technology to provide this level of detail is a first and reflects this Government’s focus on transparency and accountability,” says Ms Bennett.

“Finding out exactly what services are funded and by how much, anywhere in the country, is now a few clicks away,” says Ms Bennett.

The site has MSD contracts mapped now, with contracts held by the Ministeries of Justice, Health, Education and Te Puni Kokiri to be added soon.

“This tool will mean communities can immediately identify what services are funded in their area as well as gaps and overlaps,” says Ms Bennett.

“It will also help inform Government policy and funding decisions,” says Ms Bennett.

Some provider details will still remain veiled for security reasons.

“Providers like Women’s Refuge who deal with sensitive issues will have their exact location concealed, which I think makes sense,” says Ms Bennett.
