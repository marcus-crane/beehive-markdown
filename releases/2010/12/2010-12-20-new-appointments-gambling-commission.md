The Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Graeme Reeves as Chief Gambling Commissioner and Lisa Hansen as a new Gambling Commissioner.

“Graeme Reeves from Wellington is a former MP with a wide range of business, legal and governance experience. He will be the Chief Gambling Commissioner after six years of experience on the Commission.

“Lisa Hansen from Wellington brings a strong legal background and public policy expertise to her new role as Commissioner.

Both terms commence on 1 January 2011. As Chief Gambling Commissioner, Mr Reeves will serve until 17 June 2012 while Ms Hansen will serve a three-year term concluding on 31 December 2013.

They will join Paul Stanley who is currently serving his third term on the Commission.

“I would like to thank Peter Chin and Mary Lythe, whose terms have expired, for their years of good service.”

The Gambling Commission is an independent statutory decision-making body. The Commission hears casino licensing applications, and appeals on licensing and enforcement decisions made by the Secretary of Internal Affairs in relation to gaming machines and other non-casino gambling activities.
