Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is urging New Zealanders to treat people living with HIV and AIDS with dignity and respect.

Today is World AIDS Day and the theme is Universal Access and Human Rights.

“HIV and AIDS can affect anyone at anytime and it is important to remember that this disease knows no social, ethnic or economic barriers,” says Mrs Turia.

“By promoting individual human rights new infections can be prevented and people with HIV and AIDS can live free of discrimination.”

More than 3000 New Zealanders have been diagnosed with HIV since the mid 1980’s. It is estimated that up to 2000 people are living with HIV and last year alone 159 people were newly diagnosed.

A recent review by the Ministry of Health of services for people living with HIV and AIDS found that stigma remains a major issue for those living with the disease.

“We need to support people living with HIV and AIDS by encouraging them to talk about the challenges they are facing so that they can access the full range of treatment options available. Antiretroviral therapies are helping people to stay well for many years,” says Mrs Turia.

“It is important that we talk openly about HIV and AIDS because preventing transmission is the best protection and people need to know how to protect themselves.”

Mrs Turia is urging New Zealanders to support events being organised by the New Zealand AIDS Foundation including wearing a red ribbon, the symbol of World AIDS Day.
