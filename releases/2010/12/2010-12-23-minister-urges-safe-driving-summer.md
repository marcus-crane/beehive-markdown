Transport Minister Steven Joyce is reminding Kiwis to do their bit to be safe on the roads these holidays.

“The NZ Transport Agency and Police are working hard to keep the traffic flowing and help to make your trip a safe one. I urge road users to work with them and drive responsibly to stay safe.”

The official holiday period begins at 4pm Friday 24 December 2010 and ends at 6am on Wednesday 5 January 2011.

During the 2009/2010 Christmas holiday period there were 12 fatal crashes and 291 reported injury crashes. Those crashes resulted in 13 deaths, 67 serious injuries and 342 minor injuries.

The government has laid the groundwork for a number of road safety initiatives that will come into force next year. These include raising the driving age, introducing a zero drink drive limit for young drivers and repeat offenders, allowing alcohol interlocks for repeat offenders and raising penalties for dangerous driving causing death. Progress has also been made on actions to improve motorcycle safety.

“Ultimately, governments can only do so much. We all need to take personal responsibility in the decisions we make to help keep ourselves, our families and other road users safe,” says Mr Joyce.

Do what you can to make our roads safe:

- plan ahead together because it’ll take the stress out of your trip
- check your car because it needs to get you there in one piece
- drive to the conditions because every road is different and every journey is different
- don’t drink and drive
- expect the unexpected - over the holidays the road environment can be more unpredictable

“By taking the responsibility for keeping our roads safe this summer, we’re making sure each and every one of us gets to share the holiday season with the people we care about. Have a happy and safe holiday break.”

Historic holiday road crash statistics will be available on the Ministry of Transport website: www.transport.govt.nz.
