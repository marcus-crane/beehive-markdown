Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has approved funding for 131 community organisations through the Community Response Fund.

More than $7.5 million has been allocated in this fifth round of the CRF.

“We created this fund to help organisations keep delivering services to families through tough financial times,” said Minister Bennett.

“Since June last year, we’ve put $41 million into 779 community organisations and it’s helped keep many afloat,” says Ms Bennett.

A special round of the CRF was also added by Minister Bennett for Canterbury social service providers following the earthquake in September.

“This Fund also encourages social service organisations to think outside the square, to get smart and innovative,” says Ms Bennett.

The Fund’s innovation section has increased from 1% in round one to 33% in round five

“Organisations understand we’re all operating in a tough fiscal environment and they’re devising ways to work smarter with less,” says Ms Bennett.

The final round is now open and closes 25 February 2010.
