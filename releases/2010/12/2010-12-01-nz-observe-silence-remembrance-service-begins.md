Mr Key says, “I hope all of New Zealand will join with those of us at the service and observe two minutes’ silence at 2pm. This tragedy has affected all of us and tomorrow is an opportunity to join together in grief.”

Mr Key will be accompanied to the service by his wife Bronagh, the Governor General Sir Anand Satyanand and Lady Susan Satyanand, and Speaker of the House, Lockwood Smith.

The service will also be attended by Deputy Prime Minister Bill English, Leader of the Opposition Phil Goff and other Leaders and Ministers including Pita Sharples, Rodney Hide, Peter Dunne, Russel Norman, Gerry Brownlee, Nick Smith, Judith Collins and Kate Wilkinson.

The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Pedro Herrera and Deputy Chief of Mission of the US Embassy, Bob Clarke, will also be at the service.
