Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced changes to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) board.

EECA is a Crown agent with the role of encouraging, promoting and supporting energy efficiency, energy conservation and the use of renewable sources of energy. Its board is appointed by the Minister.

Dr Andrew Pearce, a former chief executive of Landcare Research, has been reappointed a member and appointed deputy chair for a term of two years.

Newly appointed members are Terrence Currie, Mervyn English and Marion Cowden, who have been appointed for three years, while Mark Oldfield’s appointment is for two years.

Roger Sutton was reappointed chair of the EECA board for three years in May 2010.

Mr Brownlee said the appointments brought a good mix business acumen and institutional knowledge to the board.

He acknowledged outgoing board members for their contribution to the operation of the authority and the commitment they have shown in their governance roles.

The outgoing members are Alastair Patrick (deputy chair), David Caygill, Greg Sise, Penelope Hulse, Joel Cayford and Toni Owen.
