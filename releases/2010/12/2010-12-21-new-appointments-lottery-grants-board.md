Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of new member Maggie Burrill and the reappointment of Tina Wehipeihana-Wilson to the Lottery Grants Board.

“Both candidates have a wide range of experience in both the private sector and their local communities which will serve them well,” says Mr Guy.

Tina Wehipeihana-Wilson of Taupo has been a member of the Lottery Grants Board since December 2009 and is currently the Managing Director of Tem Corporation Aotearoa Ltd, which provides accounting and business management services to small to medium sized Māori organisations.

Maggie Burrill of Auckland is an independent commissioner for Resource Management Act hearings. She is a former city councillor and Deputy Chair of the Botany Community Board, and has previously worked in the office and property management industry and as a solicitor.

Both terms are for three years commencing 1 February 2011.

The Lottery Grants Board exists under the Gambling Act 2003 to distribute the profits of New Zealand lotteries, arising from activities such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Instant Kiwi and Keno.

The Board’s primary function is to determine the proportions of lotteries’ profits to be allocated to the distribution committees and distribution agencies.
