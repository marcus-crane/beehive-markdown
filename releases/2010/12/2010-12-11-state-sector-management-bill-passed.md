Today Parliament passed the Research, Science and Technology Bill, the National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa) Amendment Bill, and the Public Records Amendment Bill - all formerly the State Sector Management Bill.

This legislation is an important step towards improved service delivery at a reduced cost, and a more future-proofed State sector says the Minister of State Services Tony Ryall. Passing the Bill today provides certainty to the staff who are expecting to implement the new structures from 1 February 2011.

The Bills amalgamate the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology into the new Ministry of Science and Innovation, and the National Library and Archives New Zealand into the Department of Internal Affairs.

“These changes are part of the Government’s drive to ensure the State sector is organised to deliver improved services within existing baselines, to reduce costs once the transitions are embedded, and to future-proof the long-term delivery of services by government agencies.

“In the case of the Ministry of Science and Innovation, this will mean a single strategic direction with more clarity and reduced transaction costs across the Research, Science and Technology sector.

“The enhanced Department of Internal Affairs will mean a more efficient and integrated approach to service delivery and significantly improved ability to face the challenges of the future,” Tony Ryall said.

It is expected that once the transitions are complete, the set of three structural changes (including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Food Safety Authority) will yield savings in the order of $25 million or greater over the period to 2013/14.
