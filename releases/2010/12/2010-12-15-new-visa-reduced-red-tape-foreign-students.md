Less red tape and a new visa will make it easier for international students to study in New Zealand says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

Under the new Immigration Act, which recently came into effect, interim visas can be granted to students while their applications are being processed. The frequency for which police and medical certificates must be provided is also being extended.

The changes, which commence in February 2011, will help boost the $2 billion a year export education market, says Dr Coleman.

‘’Interim visas mean students can still study here lawfully while their application is being processed, provided that they are lawfully in New Zealand when they apply.

‘’They’ll still have to meet all our standard criteria, but the visa provides peace of mind for students and makes the enrolment process smoother for education providers.’’

Interim visas may not be granted if Immigration New Zealand has significant concerns regarding an applicant. In 2009/10 Immigration New Zealand approved nearly 94,000 student visa applications, of which 65,500 were from full fee-paying international students.

Dr Coleman says fee-paying foreign students will only have to provide police and medical certificates every three years, rather than every two years as at present.

‘’These certificates can be expensive for students to obtain, and sometimes applications are returned because certificates have expired. This change will make it that bit easier and cheaper. Now a student studying for a Bachelor’s degree at university will only have to provide one medical certificate at the beginning, rather than a second one part way through their study.’’
