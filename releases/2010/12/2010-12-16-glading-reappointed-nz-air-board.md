Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the reappointment of Michael Glading to the board of NZ On Air.

Mr Glading has served one term on NZ On Air and was reappointed for two years from 1 January 2011.

“Michael has a 30 year career in music and sports management and has worked with a variety of musicians and sportspeople ranging from Yulia to Sir Bob Charles. His wide set of skills and industry experience will continue to add value to the board,” Dr Coleman says.

Mr Glading recently announced he was stepping down as chief executive of New Zealand Football. Previously he was the Chair and President of the Recording Industry Association for eight years.

NZ On Air funds non commercial radio, New Zealand content for television and makes a substantial contribution to locally produced new New Zealand music.
