Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson confirmed today that the Government will meet the reasonable costs of legal services for those families directly affected by the Pike River mine accident, which arise out of the Royal Commission of Inquiry.

"We recognise the importance of the families of the Pike River victims being represented and participating in the Royal Commission of Inquiry, and will move to see that happens," Mr Finlayson said.

The process for appointing appropriate qualified legal representation to assist the families will be handled by the Solicitor-General, David Collins QC. He will be contacting family representatives to make arrangements this week.
