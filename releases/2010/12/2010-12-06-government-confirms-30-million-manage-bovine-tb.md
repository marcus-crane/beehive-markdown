Agriculture Minister David Carter has today confirmed the Government’s commitment of $30 million annually until 2015 to manage bovine tuberculosis (TB).

"New Zealand is widely recognised as the world leader in TB management through its integrated disease control programme, and the Government is committed to supporting efforts to rid farmers of this disease," says Mr Carter.

"The ability of our beef, dairy and deer industries to compete in global markets hinges on the successful management of TB."

The Government’s contribution supports the revised National Pest Management Strategy, an $82 million annual programme administered by the Animal Health Board in partnership with the Crown, industry and regional councils.

Under the strategy, the beef, dairy and deer industries will contribute around $45 million and regional councils, around $6 million.

"Through the committed efforts of this ongoing partnership, we have already made significant progress in controlling TB. The numbers of infected deer and cattle herds has fallen from more than 1700 in 1994, to 98 in June this year," says Mr Carter.
