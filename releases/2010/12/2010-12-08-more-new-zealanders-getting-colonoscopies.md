Nearly 38,000 New Zealanders received colonoscopies to investigate for bowel cancer and other serious bowel issues in 2009/10 – 2,346 more than the previous year says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"Bowel cancer kills more than 1,200 New Zealanders a year but it is also one of our most treatable and curable cancers if caught early. Colonoscopies detect bowel cancer and early detection can save lives,” says Mr Ryall.

"A record 37,692 people had a colonoscopy in 2009/10. These record numbers build on earlier increases and show the sector is growing capacity for this important cancer test."

"The Government is fixing public health services with a concerted effort to make colonoscopy more freely and fairly available to all New Zealanders who need it," says Mr Ryall.

"We have appointed clinicians to be national leaders to keep up the momentum and ensure ongoing quality of service in endoscopy services (including colonoscopies).

The Government is also launching a bowel screening pilot in October 2011, involving between 60,000 and 130,000 people aged 50 to 74 years. The pilot will determine whether it is feasible for New Zealand to roll out a national bowel screening programme.

“We want to ensure all New Zealanders have fair access to early diagnostic and treatment services that will improve bowel cancer outcomes for everyone.”
