Housing Minister Phil Heatley today repeated his statement of full support for the swift action Housing New Zealand has taken over an allegation of bribery and called on anyone with knowledge of similar behaviour occurring elsewhere to phone the corporation.

"Housing New Zealand and I believe this is an isolated incident but we urge anyone with evidence to the contrary to phone the corporation's public complaints line: 0800 801 601.

"All calls will be taken in absolute confidence.

"Prospective Housing New Zealand tenants and the wider public must have confidence in the probity of the state house system.

"I'm confident all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that is the case," Mr Heatley said.
