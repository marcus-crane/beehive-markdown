Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy will tomorrow meet students who have received assistance to attend an independent school under the Aspire Scholarship scheme she launched as part of ACT and National's broader initiative to widen school choice for young people and their families.

"A key step toward fulfilling ACT's pledge to increase educational opportunities for students, the Aspire Scholarships enable young people from low-income families to attend an independent school they otherwise would not have the opportunity to attend," Mrs Roy said.

"Four of the students I will meet have used their Aspire scholarships to attend Auckland's Corelli School of the Arts - two of whom will participate in a documentary that follows a number of students through the first six months of their journey toward becoming international performers.

"I opened applications for Aspire last year with professional rugby player Victor Vito, who previously received a similar scholarship that enabled him to attend Wellington's Scot's College.  He spoke of his experiences as a scholarship student and attributed much of his success to the opportunities his scholarship provided - opportunities like those made available under Aspire.

"Aspire recipients now attend independent schools around the country: ACG Parnell College, ACG Senior College, ACG Strathallan, Ambury Park Centre for Riding Therapy, Auckland International College, Chilton St James, Destiny School, Diocesan School for Girls, Hamilton Christian School, Huanui College, Kings College, Kristin School, Living Way Learning Centre, Pinehurst School, Pukekohe Christian School, Queen Margaret College, Rangitaiki Independent School, Samuel Marsden Whitby, Springbank School, St Andrews College Christchurch, St Dominic's College, St Cuthbert's College, St Kentigern College, St Margaret's College, St Paul's Collegiate, St Peter's School, Sunderland College, Corelli School, Tu Toa, Wanganui Collegiate and Wentworth College.

"Choice is the key to ensuring achievement and success in education and it is encouraging to see that Aspire has been so well-received by students and schools alike.  I look forward to hearing of Aspire recipients' progress - and of those who will receive scholarships for the 2011 ands 2012 school years," Mrs Roy said.
