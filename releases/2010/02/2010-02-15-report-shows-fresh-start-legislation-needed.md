"A report into the effectiveness of Youth Court Supervision orders on re-offending, released today, shows the Government's Fresh start legislation is urgently needed, " says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The key findings of the report include an acknowledgment that young people who re-offended usually did so in the two years following a court order.

"By doubling Youth Court orders and increasing supervision periods, as well as increased mentoring, drug and alcohol and parenting programmes, the Government's plugging the holes in the system that young offenders have been falling through," says Ms Bennett

The report also highlights the effectiveness of Supervision with Activity orders in reducing re-offending. Government legislation doubles the duration available to Youth Courts.

The group of 14 to 16 year olds who go before a Youth Court are clearly defined in the report as a tiny minority - point four percent - of that age group.

The report's equally clear about the challenges in diverting this small group of serious repeat young offenders from a life of crime.

"But this Government refuses to give up on them. We will not leave it to communities to pick up the tab and bear the costs of long term offending," says Ms Bennett

The Government's Fresh Start initiative provides more tools to deal with youth offending including:

- More power for Youth Courts to issue new orders that address parenting education, mentoring, and drug and alcohol treatment
- Longer sentences for the worst offenders including longer Supervision with Activity and Supervision with Residence orders.
- Empowering the Youth Court to deal with a small number of 12 and 13 year olds charged with serious offences

"This is a fresh start for our most troubled and destructive young people that will help them break away from their offending lifestyle," Ms Bennett says.

The legislation is due to return to Parliament for a third and final reading.
