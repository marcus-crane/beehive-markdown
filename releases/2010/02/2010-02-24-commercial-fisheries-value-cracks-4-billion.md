New Zealand's commercial fisheries are making a vital contribution to the economy, highlighted by today's release of the Fish Monetary Stock account by Statistics New Zealand, which shows the value of commercial fisheries has passed $4 billion, Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley said today.

The Minister also announced that Patagonian toothfish will become the 99th species to be managed using New Zealand's world class Quota Management System from 1 October this year.

The Fish Monetary Stock Account shows an increase from $3.97 billion to $4.017 billion between September 2008 and September 2009 with an increase of 47 per cent since 1996 ($2.7 billion).

"This growth in value is directly attributable to New Zealand's effective fisheries management using the Quota Management System," Mr Heatley said.

"Fisheries in many parts of the world are in decline through subsidies and overfishing brought about by poor fisheries management.  New Zealand's Quota Management System and careful fisheries management mean our commercial fisheries keep growing in value and will continue to bring in export earnings and help drive the economy," he said.

The Patagonian toothfish fishery in New Zealand waters is at a very early stage with less than 50 tonnes of fish caught in New Zealand waters in the past 15 years.  

"Patagonian toothfish has been over-caught in some parts of the world; we need to make sure any development of the New Zealand fishery happens in a sensible, responsible and well managed way," Mr Heatley said.

"The Quota Management System is the best way to make sure this happens.

"Fishers will be able to get secure access to quota so they can develop fishing operations with confidence and the government can put in place sustainable catch limits and have confidence the fishery is being well managed."

**Background**

More information on the fish monetary stock account is available on the Statistics New Zealand website at this link: [http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/Corporate/Corporate/CorporateCommunications\_MR2009.aspx](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/Corporate/Corporate/CorporateCommunications_MR2009.aspx)

New Zealand's Quota Management System has received a number of recent accolades.  These include from the World Bank, which held up New Zealand's QMS and absence of subsidies as an example of how other countries' should manage their fisheries.

A major study published in the journal *Science* rated New Zealand's fisheries management as first equal out of all marine regions around the world. 

And most recently, a report published in the *Marine Policy* journal ranked New Zealand's fisheries management as the best of the world's 53 major fishing nations.

Patagonian toothfish are found in the far southern reaches of New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone, south-west of the sub-Antarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands.  The fish found in New Zealand waters are believed to be part of a larger fishstock found in New Zealand waters, Australian waters around Macquarie Island and also in the High Seas area into the Southern Ocean.

The next step in introducing Patagonian toothfish into the QMS will be to set sustainable catch limits for the New Zealand fishery. Because the fish stock straddles New Zealand and Australian waters as well as the high seas the catch limit will need to reflect New Zealand's international obligations and be consistent with Australian management of the Macquarie Island fishery.
