Over 3,350 individual and community groups received New Zealand Lottery Grants Board funding in the last year, Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

"The publication of the *2008/09 Lottery Grants Record* shows the diverse range of community activities that have benefited from lottery funding over the last year.

"The Cancer Society, Age Concern and Women's Refuge are just some of the groups to receive grants. Marae, churches, disability care and a huge range of regional charities have also benefited.

"Over the last 12 months lottery funding has become even more important as private and philanthropic funding have felt the squeeze of the recession.

"As I've travelled around the country I've seen just how important lottery funding is in building strong, sustainable communities in New Zealand. Many organisations would struggle without this help."

In 2008/2009, NZ Lotteries transferred $166.25 million in profits to the Lottery Grants Board for distribution and to three statutory bodies it supports: Creative New Zealand, the New Zealand Film Commission, and Sport and Recreation New Zealand.

The Lottery Grants Board funds a range of social, community, arts, heritage, sports, recreation, and health research services and projects which have a positive impact on communities.
