Transport Minister Steven Joyce says discussions between the government and the taxi industry on mandatory safety requirements for taxis are progressing well and decisions will be made as a matter of priority.

Mr Joyce and Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson this morning met with representatives of the taxi industry along with officials from the NZ Transport Agency, the Ministry of Transport and the Department of Labour.  The meeting was called in the wake of the death of taxi driver Hiren Mohini in Auckland at the end of January.

This was the second death of an on-duty taxi driver in 14 months. There were a number of serious assaults in the same period.

"While there are a number of issues to be considered all parties agree that many taxi drivers no longer enjoy safe working environments - particularly at night and particularly in our main centres," says Mr Joyce.

"The question is what should be made mandatory, where and at what times." 

Mandating for security cameras, security screens, duress alarms or a combination of the three are all options on the table. 

Learning from experiences in Australia, where most states have mandatory requirements, and evidence of improved safety outcomes will be central to the decision making process.

Transport officials will report back to the Minister within four weeks.  After he has considered their advice, he will meet again with the taxi industry before taking the issue to Cabinet.

Mr Joyce says he is confident of reaching a solution that will enhance the safety of professional taxi drivers, as well as their passengers.

"In the mean time, I urge all taxi companies to reassess their safety measures and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of their drivers, particularly those driving late at night," says Mr Joyce.
