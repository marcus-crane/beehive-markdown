Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today invited submissions on the Commerce Commission's final report on mobile termination access services.

This morning the Commerce Commission delivered its final report on mobile termination access services.  It recommended, by a majority decision, that the undertakings received from Telecom and Vodafone on the termination of voice calls and text messages on their mobile networks should be accepted.

The Commission did not recommend the regulation of mobile termination access services on the 2degrees network given that 2degrees had withdrawn all previous undertakings.

Under the Telecommunications Act, the Minister may accept, reject, or require the Commerce Commission to reconsider the recommendations.

Before making his decision on the Commission's recommendations the Minister is inviting written submissions:

- On new matters raised in the report; and
- That update comments already made in submissions to the Commission prior to the completion of the MTAS Report.

 "While I do not intend to re-open issues that parties have already had the opportunity to raise with the regulator, I am inviting comments on any matters raised in the report that were not, and could not have been, raised in previous submissions to the Commission, and on any relevant information that is not addressed in the Commission's report," says Mr Joyce.

"I would like to thank the Commission for its hard work in preparing its report.

"I will make a decision upon consideration of the report, submissions, and advice from officials.  It is my intention to do this in a timely manner."

Copies of the report can be downloaded from the [Commerce Commission website](http://www.comcom.govt.nz/).

Submissions should be sent to [mtas@med.govt.nz](mailto:mtas@med.govt.nz) by **5.00pm on Monday, 8 March 2010**. No cross-submissions will be sought.  Further information on the submission process is available at [www.med.govt.nz/mtas](http://www.med.govt.nz/mtas).
