Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key has welcomed the announcement that thirteen projects will go through to stage two of the next funding round of The New Zealand Cycle Trail Project.

The thirteen projects are in the following areas; Tauranga, Opotiki/Gisborne, Rotorua, Taupo, Ruapehu, Hawkes Bay, Nelson/Tasman, Westport, Greymouth, Mt Cook, Queenstown, Clutha and Central Otago.

"These thirteen routes were chosen as the very best of the 54 applications for funding that were lodged in December. They promise trails of spectacular beauty across both islands."

A feasibility study on these routes will now be undertaken where they will be priced and checked to see that what is promised in the concept can be delivered on.

"If all thirteen of these trails proceed through to construction they will, along with the previously-announced Quick Start trails provide a network of around 2,000 kilometres of iconic Great Rides.

"These thirteen projects are outstanding. They encapsulate the spirit of the Cycle Trail vision and will allow visitors and New Zealanders to experience some of the most stunning off-road scenery this country has to offer.

"I would like to thank all the regions and organisations who submitted expressions of interest. In the end, with a funding pool of $50 million, only a small number could be funded by the Government at this time.

"To those who have been successful - well done. If all goes well, your trail should be under construction by the end of this year.

"Your region will be richer for the efforts your community has made to be part of the iconic New Zealand Cycle Trail Project."
