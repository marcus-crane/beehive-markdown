Love is in the air for Valentine's Day this Sunday but also for Wellington's Absolutely Positively Pasifika festival at Waitangi Park on Saturday.

Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu says Wellingtonians have fallen in love with the annual Pasifika Festival which marks the increasingly important and significant contribution of Pacific Island people to the region.

"As political commentator and experienced businessman Colin James said recently, New Zealand is now increasingly of the Pacific, not just in the Pacific - a concept he calls the Pacification of New Zealand.

"The Pasifika Festival is our opportunity to celebrate this fact and to honour our cultural links and all the benefits and beauty of being a Pacific nation."

The festival will feature Pacific communities from Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Niue, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tokelau and Tuvalu.

Mrs te Heuheu said Wellington's Pacific Island population had grown by more than 30 per cent in 15 years to 35,000 people.

"Wellington is home to some of our greatest Pacific stars such as comedian Tofiga Fepule'ai, former All Blacks' Captain Tana Umaga, actors Robbie and Pua Magasiva and the Musical Island Boys barbershop quartet of Jeff and Will Hunkin, Marcellus Washburn and Matt Gifford.

"In addition, the 2010 Hurricanes rugby squad features at least 18 players of Pacific or Maori descent," Mrs te Heuheu says.

The Pasifika Festival follows several weeks of wonderful celebrations including the AC/DC concerts, the Wellington Cup at Trentham, Waitangi Day and the NZI Rugby Sevens.

"While New Zealand didn't win the sevens, we celebrated two great Pacific nations - Fiji and Samoa - in the final.

 

"I encourage all Wellingtonians to join the Pasifika Festival and to celebrate the diversity and vibrancy of cultures - Pacific, African, Asian and European," Mrs te Heuheu said.

The Minister congratulated the Wellington City Council's Pacific Advisory Group for their work in bringing the festival together.
