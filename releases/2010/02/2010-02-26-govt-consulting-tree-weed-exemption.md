Minister for Climate Change Issues Nick Smith today announced the Government's proposed regulations for allowing the clearance of some tree weeds without penalty under the Emissions Trading Scheme.

"A flaw in the previous Government's ETS was that it heavily penalised landowners for clearing tree weeds. These regulations fix this problem and ensure that the ETS does not inadvertently result in more tree weeds.

A discussion document on the exemption and the regulations that govern it was issued today. Submissions close on March 29.

"Forestry is internationally recognised as an essential part of the solution to climate change, but despite the positive benefits of carbon sequestration, some areas of forest are considered tree weeds due to their ability to spread and colonise other land.

"This exemption will mean groups such as the Mid *Dome* Wilding Trees Charitable Trust in Southland will be able to continue its good work in eradicating wilding pines from delicate high country grasslands without facing financial penalties under the ETS. There are other areas like the Marlborough Sounds where this too is a problem.

"These changes are part of the Government's pragmatic approach to climate change and ensuring the ETS is more workable."
