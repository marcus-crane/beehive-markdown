The Government has expanded eligibility for its voluntary bonding scheme for health graduates working in hard to staff areas and specialties.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "South Canterbury has been added to the list of hard to staff regions, and surgical nursing has been added to the list of hard to staff specialties which qualify for the scheme."

The voluntary bonding scheme encourages health graduates to establish careers in hard to staff specialities and communities in New Zealand by offering student loan debt write offs or cash incentives over three to five years.

"Demand in the first year of the scheme far exceeded expectations. We estimated around 350 Doctors, nurses and midwives may apply but confirmed more than 890 recent graduates."

Registrations for this year's intake will close on Friday 30 April 2010.

The full list of hard-to-staff categories and the terms and conditions of the Scheme are available on the bonding website [www.moh.govt.nz/bonding](http://www.moh.govt.nz/bonding)
