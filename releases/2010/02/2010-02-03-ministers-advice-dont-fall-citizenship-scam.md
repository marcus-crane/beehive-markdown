An alleged scam that offers citizenship to Tongan overstayers offers false hope to desperate people says Minister of Immigration, Jonathan Coleman.

"TV One News reported last night that hundreds of Tongan overstayers are heading to Waitangi believing that there is a path to New Zealand citizenship through adoption into a hapu," says Dr Coleman.

"I cannot state strongly enough that the only path to residence or citizenship is through the New Zealand Government.

 "Adoption into a hapu will not legally confer citizenship or residency upon anyone. The only agency that can offer residency is Immigration New Zealand.

"My advice to people is that if approached by anyone offering New Zealand citizenship or residency via hapu adoption, contact the police."
