Public submissions are being called for following the release today of a discussion document on the review of Part 6A of the Employment Relations Act 2000, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

Part 6A was passed by Parliament in 2004 and subsequently amended in 2006 with a requirement that this law was reviewed after three years.

It affects industries such as cleaning, food and laundry services, where work is often contracted and the change of a contract can create a restructuring or redundancy situation.

"The discussion document offers a chance for employers and employees in affected industries to offer feedback on whether Part 6A is working," Ms Wilkinson says.

"If there is a need for improvement or if aspects of the provisions are not relevant in the current environment I will be happy to look at suitable amendments."

The review will be open for public submissions till 15 March 2010.

Submissions can be e-mailed to [ERconsultation@dol.govt.nz](mailto:submissions@dol.govt.nz) or posted to Review of Part 6A, Workplace Policy Group, Department of Labour, PO Box 3705, Wellington.

Copies of the terms of reference, released in December 2009, and the discussion document are available on the Department of Labour's wesite at [www.dol.govt.nz/consultation](http://www.dol.govt.nz/consultation).
