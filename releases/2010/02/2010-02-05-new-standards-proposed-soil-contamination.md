New standards are needed to assist councils in dealing with contaminated sites, says Environment Minister Nick Smith.

Dr Smith today released a draft National Environmental Standard on assessing and managing contaminants in soil.

"The past use of chemicals or hazardous substances in industry, agriculture and horticulture has left a legacy of soil contamination," Dr Smith said.

"Soil contamination in New Zealand is not as serious a problem as many other industrialised countries but we do have sites that pose risks to public and environmental health.

"Our track record of dealing with these at places such as Mapua and Waiwhetu Stream is chequered. Councils need greater guidance from Government to assist them and that is what the National Environmental Standard is all about.

"The standards will provide clear guidance to councils on the appropriate use of land depending on the soil contamination. Affected properties should only be regarded as safe for use if they have been systematically identified, assessed, and if necessary, cleaned up.

"The standards also define the level of concentrations at which the risk to human health is considered acceptable. This is based on the latest toxicological findings from international research."

A 10-week consultation on the proposed National Environmental Standard for assessing and managing contaminants in soil begins tomorrow (6 February).

"These standards are about ensuring the public and landowners that district planning controls are appropriate, are nationally consistent and that councils gather and use the appropriate information," Dr Smith said.
