Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads to Canberra this evening to hold talks with his Australian counterpart, Stephen Smith.

"New Zealand and Australia have achieved a great deal together in the last year, both internationally and bilaterally," Mr McCully said.

"We cooperate extensively, especially in the Pacific, and our discussions in Canberra will cover regional issues, and how we can further improve cooperation with our partners in the Pacific Islands Forum.

"Minister Smith and I talk frequently, including at regional and international meetings, but these twice-yearly formal talks are an opportunity to discuss the foreign policy agenda in much greater depth."

The last formal talks between the two foreign ministers were held in June 2009 in Wellington.

While in Canberra, Mr McCully will also meet with the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Bob McMullan.
