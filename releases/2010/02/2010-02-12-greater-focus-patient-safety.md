A greater focus on quality improvement in the health service could save up to $100 million a year.

Health Minister Tony Ryall is inviting nominations for a new, stand alone, clinically led government agency to lift quality and safety in frontline health services.

"The new Quality and Safety Improvement Commission is a critical step towards improving patient safety across the health sector, and it's an opportunity for our clinicians to lead and coordinate that" says Mr Ryall.

The new Commission will replace the Quality Improvement Committee and was one of the recommendations by the Ministerial Review Group (MRG) which reported on ways to improve the public health service last year.

"The MRG consulted widely with doctors and nurses and other health professionals and received the very clear message that momentum had stalled" Mr Ryall says.

"Health professionals also advised the MRG that an independent agency led by clinicians was the best way to step up quality improvement across the whole sector."

Serious and sentinel event reporting will shift to the new Commission along with other safety and quality monitoring and reporting.

The Minister says it is estimated avoidable adverse events cost the health system between $500 million and $600 million a year.

"Realistically we can't save all of that over night - but even a 20 per cent reduction in errors could save us approximately $100 million a year that could be reinvested into frontline services."

"We want gains in better and safer care; better results and better patient experiences and we want clinicians to lead this."

Mr Ryall says the new independent Commission replaces the Quality Improvement Committee as part of a drive to reduce the number of committees and agencies within the Ministry of Health.

"This Government inherited 154 Ministry committees and agencies; so far we've got that down to 115 and we're tracking towards a goal of around 60" says Mr Ryall.
