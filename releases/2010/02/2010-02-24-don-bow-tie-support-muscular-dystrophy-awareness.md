Disabilities Issues Minister Tariana Turia is encouraging people to don a bow tie this week in support of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's awareness campaign.

The Minister says the nationwide campaign from 20th - 28th February is an ideal way to raise awareness of a condition which affects 43,000 New Zealanders.

\`\`The bow tie symbolises the difficulties people with a neuromuscular condition face daily,'' Mrs Turia says.

Neuromuscular conditions are an unpredictable and incurable condition that causes progressive muscle wasting and can strike anyone at any age.

The Muscular Dystrophy Association supports those living with neuromuscular conditions and their parents, families and friends.

People can also wear a bow tie pin designed by New Zealand fashion designers WORLD.
