The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, today announced that Judge Caren Fox of Ngati Porou and Rongowhakaata is to be the new Deputy Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court.

"Judge Fox will make a fine Deputy Chief Judge and I congratulate her on her appointment," said Dr Sharples. 

"The Māori Land Court recognises and supports the central bond between Māori and their whēnua. The Court's business is not simply land, it helps to maintain the identity and strength of the people, their commmunities and culture. Judge Fox has demonstrated her strong commitment to the work and ethos of the Māori Land Court.

"The Deputy Chief Judge plays a key role, including acting under delegated authority for the Chief Judge. Judge Fox has the skills and experience needed to undertake the role of Deputy Chief Judge, and to support the Chief Judge in the exercise of his duties and leadership of the Court," said Dr Sharples.
