Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed the introduction of the new Business Toolbox now available on the Statistics New Zealand website.

"The Business Toolbox improves access to a wealth of government-held information and will be especially useful for small and medium-sized businesses as well as community groups, researchers and policy-makers," said Mr Williamson.

"Businesses will be able to use the web-based tool to access industry profiles and a variety of information that will allow them to find their target customers, evaluate industry performance and support their decision-making around marketing efforts and business location.

"This new service builds on other recent innovations by Statistics New Zealand that improve online access to government information. These include their new website and the release of Infoshare last year.

"The Business Toolbox will contribute much to the government's aim of improving open and effective access to a wide range of government-held information. It can be found via the following link : [http://www.stats.govt.nz/businesstoolbox](http://www.stats.govt.nz/businesstoolbox)," said Mr Williamson.
