Education Minister Anne Tolley today welcomed the introduction of National Standards in primary and intermediate schools as many students return from their summer break.

"This is a very exciting year for education. Our National Standards policy is a groundbreaking initiative, and a critical part of the government's plan to lift education standards across the country," says Mrs Tolley.

"National Standards will help the one in five students currently leaving school without the basic skills they need."

From this year, primary and intermediate schools will report to parents twice a year in plain language on their child's progress in reading, writing and maths.

"I'm delighted that for the first time many parents will get the information they want and deserve about their child's progress.

"Children who are slipping behind will be identified so teachers and parents can help them improve before it's too late."

The Government is spending $36 million over four years to support schools which have identified students who need more support, and $26 million to provide training and support for teachers, principals and boards of trustees to help with the implementation of Standards.

"The Standards will be independently monitored and evaluated over the next three years to make sure we get it right.

"The vast majority of principals and teachers are getting on with the task of implementing the Standards and doing the very best they can for our children.

"I will continue to work hard this year alongside schools, parents and communities to make sure our children get the quality education they deserve."
