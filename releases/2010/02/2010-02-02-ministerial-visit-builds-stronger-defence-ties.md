New Zealand's strong defence ties with Singapore were cemented during last week's visit by the Singapore Minister of State for Defence, Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

"In a visit to Singapore last year I saw first-hand the technical skills and overall professionalism of the Singaporean armed forces. These were again evident when we visited the Singaporean artillery exercise Thunder Warrior in Waiouru," Dr Mapp said.

"In Auckland the next day our Navy was able to show Professor Koo the same professionalism during an at-sea demonstration on HMNZS Hawea of the capabilities of our inshore patrol vessels. Its CO and his crew did a first-class job," the Minister said.

"Singapore is a close friend and valued defence partner. This visit has reconfirmed  the excellent working relationship between the two countries, exemplified by the defence co-operation agreement we signed last year," he said.
