Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce today announced a ten-day feedback process on Telecom's request for a variation of the company's Operational Separation Undertakings. 

The proposed variation would enable Telecom to incorporate ultra-fast broadband related services, processes and capabilities into operational support systems being built to deliver the requirements set out in the company's Operational Separation Undertakings.

Mr Joyce says he welcomes feedback on any significant detriment to other service providers' business operations arising from delaying delivery of relevant milestones set out in the Operational Separation Undertakings.

"I am seeking views on whether the proposed variation meets the purposes set out in Part 2A of the Telecommunications Act 2001. 

"I will take all submissions into account when I consider Telecom's request."

Telecom's proposed variation is available at [www.med.govt.nz/telecommunications/operational-separation](http://www.med.govt.nz/telecommunications/operational-separation). 

Submissions close at **5.00pm on Friday, 26 February 2010**.  They should be sent to [opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz](mailto:opsepsubmissions@med.govt.nz).
