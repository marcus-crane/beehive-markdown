A report released today by the Ministry of Health, *"Kōrero Mārama: Health Literacy and Māori",* shows a lot more needs to be done to improve the health literacy of New Zealanders.  Health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.

"The limited health literacy amongst New Zealanders is alarming" said Mrs Turia.  "It is of particular concern to find that Maori have much poorer health literacy skills than non-Maori; four out of five Māori males and three out of four Māori females being categorised as having poor health literacy skills".

Older people and those on a low income are also more likely to have poor health literacy skills.

"The key issue around health literacy is that it can actually compromise patient safety, and lead to poor health outcomes" said Mrs Turia.  "Health literacy directly influences people's access to crucial information about their health and what health care is available to them" says Mrs Turia. 

"The research tells us that people with poor health literacy skills are likely to have less knowledge of their illness, treatment and medicines; less likely to manage their long-term/chronic conditions and to use prevention services; and more likely to use emergency services and likely to be hospitalised".

"I want whānau to have access to appropriate information so that we can be more active participants in decisions and be better able to manage our own health and well-being" says Mrs Turia.  "A health system that empowers patients and whānau to participate in decision making about their health and well-being will contribute greatly to whanau ora".

"I hope that this research will encourage greater awareness and communication amongst health providers, as well as serve as a strong reminder of the importance of cultural competence, to ensure that whanau and patients receive good information and can make good decisions".

"I note also that the research suggests a collaborative approach to build health literacy is required across sectors.   I hope that *Kōrero Mārama* provides the basis for a more concerted effort to improve health literacy.
