The Government is to remove unnecessary red tape for crèches at gyms and shopping malls, Education Minister Anne Tolley said today.

"We are taking away the requirement for Limited Attendance Centres (LACs) to be licensed as an early childhood education provider," said Mrs Tolley.

"Currently these short-term childcare centres must adhere to the same strict licensing regulations as early childhood education centres. 

"However we know that parents expect short-term childcare centres at shopping malls and gyms to provide a babysitting service rather than an education.  

"We want to make it easier for parents to find childcare for an hour or two while they are shopping nearby or at the gym.

"This Government trusts parents to make the right decisions for their children if they are satisfied that a Centre provides a safe environment and meets their requirements."

An amendment to the Education Act 1989 will be introduced to Parliament in 2010.

LACs will need to meet early childhood education licensing requirements until the legislation has been passed. 

Centres which want advice on the changes should contact their local Ministry of Education office.
