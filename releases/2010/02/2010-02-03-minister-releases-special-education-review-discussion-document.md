Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today opened public consultation on the Review of Special Education initiated as part of ACT and National's commitment to providing all students in New Zealand with the opportunities and tools they need to fulfil their potential.

"It is fitting that the Review of Special Education Discussion Document is launched at Evans Bay Intermediate School, which will have a Kimi Ora School satellite opened on its grounds this year," Mrs Roy said.

"The Special Education Review document proposes a vision for students with special education needs, outlines how the system works currently and asks what needs to change.  I urge parents, families, teachers, students, and the education and disability sectors to submit their views.

"Students with special education needs require the most support to learn.  While many aspects of our system work well, there is room for improvement.  This review is about improving the way these students are supported from across the education system to realise their potential.

"ACT and National's goal in Government is for every child and young person to achieve their potential by ensuring that high quality education and professional services are accessible to all students.  Families and whanau benefit from choices about the education they choose for their child, and should be actively involved in decisions that take into account students' best interests and cultural context.

"Questions in the review include: how could schools work together for students with special education needs?  What arrangements should we have for funding, decision-making, verification, and fund-holding?  What does successful special education look like and how should we measure it?

"The Government aims to improve support for special education students, build schools' capability to support them, and increase choice for parents.  Feedback on this document will be a valuable step toward that.  I invite anyone with an interest to take part in the consultation - parents, students, the 23 schools offering additional therapy services, and others who interact with the system daily.

"The Review of Special Education aims to ensure that all students are able participate in education, learn and achieve.  Getting it right for these students will benefit everyone," Mrs Roy said.
