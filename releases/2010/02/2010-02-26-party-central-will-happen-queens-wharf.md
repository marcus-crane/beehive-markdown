Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully says the Government and the Auckland Regional Council are "fully committed to delivering Party Central at Queens Wharf in Auckland for next year's Rugby World Cup", but have decided to delay the construction of a cruise terminal until after the event.

"The Government was a reluctant purchaser of its share of Queens Wharf, but stepped in when it was clear that Auckland City Council would not participate," Mr McCully said.

"Both the Government and the ARC remain convinced that a cruise terminal is an absolutely essential piece of infrastructure if Auckland and New Zealand wish to continue to benefit from the growth of the cruise industry.

"Last year New Zealand earned over $400 million from cruise business and projections suggest that growth path will continue, although some in the sector fear growth will plateau in the absence of an international standard cruise terminal in Auckland.

"We both remain convinced that Queens Wharf is the right location for the terminal. Indeed the alternatives that have been frequently cited by some are not publicly owned, and are not expected to be feasible options for a cruise terminal or any other major public development for the next 30 years.

"While there is clear public support for a cruise terminal it is also clear that the debate has left some with a concern that the proposal might be rushed in order to meet the World Cup timetable next year. For that reason the Government and the ARC have decided to delay the development of a cruise terminal until after the World Cup.

"In the meantime, the Government and the ARC will work in partnership to deliver Party Central on Queens Wharf.  We want Aucklanders and the city's visitors to be able to enjoy a new public entertainment space that was purchased as a legacy asset.

"We will also put in place temporary cruise facilities of a suitable standard to ensure that our reputation does not suffer during the period of intense cruise activity next year.

"I commend Mike Lee and the ARC on the leadership shown on this issue and look forward to continuing to work with them during an exciting period.

"I am pleased that the new Auckland supercity will inherit the opportunity to develop the cruise facilities and public entertainment space now made possible by the ARC and the Government at Queens Wharf," Mr McCully said.
