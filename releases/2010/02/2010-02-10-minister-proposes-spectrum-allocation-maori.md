The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, has presented a proposed allocation of spectrum to Te Pūtahi Pāoho (the Māori Television Service Electoral College).

"As part of the Review of the Māori Television Service Act, we have considered the spectrum requirements for Māori television broadcasting," said Dr Sharples.

"We are proposing to allocate a 20-year management right for 16 MHz, in two bands of 8 MHz. This would be subject to the same terms and conditions as for other spectrum allocations.

"We are now consulting with Te Pūtahi Pāoho about this proposal. While there are some details to work through, this represents an important step forward in the development of Māori broadcasting", says Dr Sharples.

"Upon confirmation, this allocation will provide enhanced capacity for Māori television through a mix of standard definition and high definition channels.

In addition, Dr Sharples has registered Maori interests in spectrum for mobile technologies and alongside the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Hon Steven Joyce, will provide advice to Cabinet next year.

"This approach reflects our commitment to engage with Māori about spectrum issues," says Dr Sharples.
