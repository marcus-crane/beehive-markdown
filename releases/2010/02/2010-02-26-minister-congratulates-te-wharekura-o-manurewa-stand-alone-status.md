Associate Education Minister Dr Pita Sharples congratulates Te Wharekura o Manurewa on today's agreement with Education Minister Anne Tolley that the kura be established in its own right from the beginning of April.

"The wharekura has consistently shown that it provides high quality secondary education for its students, and I congratulate the wharekura whānau for what they have achieved," Dr Sharples said.

"The wharekura has been operating under the Board of Trustees of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Māngere since 2003. The passion and commitment they have shown in developing 21st century  secondary education in te reo Māori is an example for the rest of the country," he said.

"I understand Te Wharekura o Manurewa is working with the Ministry of Education to  build a new school on a site not far from the Manurewa Marae, where the wharekura has operated since 2003. This will be a real boost for the whole community of Manurewa," said Dr Sharples.

"I'm looking forward to visiting the whanau at Manurewa Marae next Wednesday at 11.00am, to celebrate their achievement."
