Speaking at the iPayroll Giving Service gala launch in Wellington this evening, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said he was delighted with the positive reception for the new payroll giving scheme that allows Kiwis to give simply to their chosen charities.

In congratulating iPayroll, a payroll service provider, for its work in delivering the scheme for their client organisations and businesses, he said such initiatives were very positive steps.

"I think since the payroll giving scheme was launched early last month, there has been a very warm reception from the corporate and government sectors," Mr Dunne said.

"Kiwis are generous by nature, and Kiwi employers - both in the private and state sectors - now have a way to play their part in supporting their workers' generosity."

Mr Dunne's party, UnitedFuture, has long advocated payroll giving, and the party's 2005 confidence and supply agreement with Labour included the review of tax incentives to promote charitable giving.

"The fact that we have been able to lock it in under the present Government was great, and means the concept is here to stay," he said.

The scheme took effect on 7 January, with employers now able to deduct donations from workers' pay, and reduce their PAYE tax by the appropriate tax credit, and send the donations to the employee's chosen charity.

He said the scheme was purely voluntary and was "about social conscience at the levels of both employees and employers".

It has been publicly welcomed by a number of organisations, and is also being promoted within the Public Service.

"It really is a win-win situation - as other commentators have called it," Mr Dunne said.

He said he was continuing to promote the scheme strongly and working with Philanthropy New Zealand and the Generosity Hub.
