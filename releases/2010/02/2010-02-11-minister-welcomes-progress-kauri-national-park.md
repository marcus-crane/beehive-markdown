Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson has welcomed today's decision by the New Zealand Conservation Authority to kick off the formal process that could lead to a National Park in Northland.

"The Government is excited about establishing a National Park centred on the Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville.

"The area includes the magnificent Tane Mahuta (Lord of the Forest) - New Zealand's largest known living Kauri tree - and Trounson Kauri Park, which has a dense stand of Kauri.

"It has been estimated that only 2 per cent of our Kauri remains - most of that in the forests of Northland where there are currently no National Parks," Ms Wilkinson says.

"It's great to see that there is widespread support in the surrounding communities for the next step in the process of protecting this beautiful area."

The Department of Conservation will now proceed with a formal investigation of the values of the proposed area. Its findings will then be released for public submissions.
