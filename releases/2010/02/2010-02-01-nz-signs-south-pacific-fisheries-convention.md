New Zealand today became the first country to sign a new convention to manage non-highly migratory fisheries in the high seas of the South Pacific.

Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Fisheries Minister Phil Heatley said the convention would establish the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) to sustainably manage deep-sea fish stocks such as orange roughy and bluenose, and pelagic species such as jack mackerel.

Highly migratory species such as tuna are currently managed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).

"High-seas fisheries are a valuable resource for New Zealand, and a vital source of food and income for our Pacific neighbours," Mr McCully said.

"This convention is a significant achievement for the region. It closes one of the last remaining governance gaps for high-seas fisheries, and once established, the SPRFMO will ensure fishing from western Australia to South America is subject to agreed international rules."

New Zealand has played a key role in the SPRFMO's development. The first meeting to get it up and running will be held here later this year, and the Secretariat will also be based here.

Mr Heatley said the convention established a comprehensive framework for sustainably managing South Pacific fisheries.

"It is significant in terms of maintaining economic security and stability, given the importance of fisheries to the Pacific's regional economy, and the increasing interest in those fisheries from northern hemisphere countries and pirate fishers.

"The convention has a strong environmental focus, with a range of strict controls which will ensure the long-term sustainability of fish stocks and address any adverse effects of fishing on the environment," Mr Heatley said.

Both Ministers said they had been encouraged by indications that other participants in the negotiations would sign the convention in the coming months, and looked forward to it coming into force as soon as possible.
