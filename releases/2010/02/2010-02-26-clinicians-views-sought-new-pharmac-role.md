Clinicians are being asked for their views on an expanded role for Pharmac, which was a recommendation from the Ministerial Review Group last year.  
   
The proposal suggests giving Pharmac a greater role in the purchase of hospital medicines and some medical devices.  
   
Auckland District Health Board's Chief Medical Officer Dr David Sage will be meeting with clinicians to discuss their views, and clinicians can also make written submissions by the end of March.  
   
Pharmac is currently responsible for managing DHB spending on community pharmaceuticals which people get from their local pharmacist, and deciding which hospital cancer medicines are funded by DHBs.  
   
Pharmac also helps DHBs in some other purchasing areas.  
   
The Ministerial Review Group was set up to recommend how New Zealand might improve the quality and performance of the public health system, and included some of the leading clinicians and managers from across the health sector.
