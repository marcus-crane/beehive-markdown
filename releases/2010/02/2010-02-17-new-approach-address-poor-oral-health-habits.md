The Government's reinvestment in child and adolescent oral health services is focused on teaching children and adolescents good oral health habits they can maintain for the rest of their lives, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne said today.

Responding to the Oral-B Powerbrush Survey, which showed that one in six Kiwis dislike cleaning their teeth, three-quarters don't use a daily mouthwash and one in 10 of us brush less than once a day

"This new approach involves greater focus on oral health promotion and education, not just ‘drilling and filling'," said Mr Dunne.

The current move to re-orientate school-based clinics into community-based dental clinics is aimed at increasing access to oral health services. These clinics will be open for most of the year and equipped with modern facilities. Mobile dental clinics would also be providing examination and treatment services

"The central location of these clinics and their modern facilities will help ensure that regular check-ups and treatment services are available for preschoolers, primary school children and adolescents."

 "Good oral health starts from childhood. We know that if we can spot problems through regular dental examinations and teach families about important actions to improve oral health in early childhood, we will be able to prevent tooth decay and other oral health problems later in life."

District health boards have been allocated $116 million in capital funding to refurbish some existing dental clinics, build new community-based dental clinics, and purchase mobile clinics over the next three to five years. In addition, ongoing funding for operating expenditure of up to $40 million yearly has also been made available to cover the costs of providing these community-based oral health services.

Since the programme began, several fixed-site clinics and mobile dental clinics have been launched in Ashburton, Akaroa, Manukau and Gisborne. The roll-out will continue over the next 24 months.

The Ministry of Health and DHBs are working to raise the level of preschoolers' use of oral health services: The target is to raise enrolment and overall access to free dental checks and other services to 50 per cent for 0 to 2-year-old children, and to 85 per cent for 3 to 4-year-old children.

The level of adolescent use of oral health services is also being targeted to increase to 85 per cent.

"I would encourage all parents and caregivers to take an active interest in their children's oral health. A good place to start is by visiting the Ministry of Health's ‘Lets Talk Teeth' website ([http://www.letstalkteeth.co.nz](http://www.letstalkteeth.co.nz/)), which provides information on accessing free dental services and also simple oral hygiene tips that families can use at home."

"Developing good oral hygiene habits and the early identification of problems are crucial to a lifetime of healthy teeth," said Mr Dunne.
