Agriculture Minister David Carter has congratulated the Wool Taskforce on its report [*Restoring Profitability to the Strong Wool Sector*](http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/sectors/fibres/wool.html), released today.

"The report asks the right questions and identifies strategies to restore profitability to a sector that has been in decline for decades," says Mr Carter.

"Everyone knows that the only way to raise price is to raise demand. Rather than generically marketing New Zealand wool, the report says the industry needs to work across the supply chain to boost demand for clothing, carpets and other wool products.

"The Taskforce makes it clear that this will only come about through unity and leadership, essentially having one voice for the sector.  I'm encouraged to hear this challenge from a group formed from within the industry."

Mr Carter established the Taskforce and called for the report following the ‘no' vote on Wool Levy payments in October 2009.

He says that, given the group had only four months to address 40 years of decline in the sector, there was a surprisingly strong level of consensus across the Taskforce.

"I congratulate the Taskforce for delivering a quality majority report to such a tight timeframe.  It has done everything I asked of it.

"I am conscious that previous reports on the wool industry have dropped like a stone, and I don't want to see that happen with this one. It is now up to the industry, and its leaders to ensure it doesn't," says Mr Carter.
