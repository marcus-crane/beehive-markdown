I have today repaid to Ministerial services the sum of $151.90 spent by me on the Ministerial credit card on 2 September 2009 for lunch with electorate staff in Christchurch.

I accept this expenditure falls outside the determination of what is Ministerial business.

Regarding the other three expenses outlined in today's Dominion Post, these all fall within the definition of Ministerial business.

The largest expense of $1109.37 was for four nights accommodation and dining at the Seaview Lodge and Restaurant in Tonga, where I was attending the Pacific Energy Ministers' Meeting. The merchant name for credit card transactions at the Lodge is the restaurant.

I have now returned my Ministerial credit card so there can be no future confusion over what is and is not Ministerial business.

I accept I have made a mistake and I have apologised to the Prime Minister.
