New Zealand's next Ambassador to the United States will be the Rt Hon Mike Moore, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

"Mike Moore will bring a huge amount of experience to this position," Mr McCully said.

"As a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation and co-chair of the US-NZ Partnership Forum, Mr Moore is the best possible candidate for this important role.

"New Zealand is working closely with the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, in Afghanistan, on the challenges of climate change, non-proliferation and efforts to counter terrorism.

"The United States has also agreed to join the Trans Pacific Partnership free trade negotiation. This will be a major focus for Mike Moore as Ambassador, working with the US administration and Congress, as well as business interests, as negotiations get underway."

Mike Moore served as Prime Minister in 1990. He was Minister of External Relations and Trade from 1988-90 and Minister of Overseas Trade and Marketing from 1984-90. He led the international effort to improve trade rules and access as Director-General of the World Trade Organisation from 1999-2002.

He takes up his appointment in July-August 2010, succeeding Roy Ferguson, who is returning to Wellington.
