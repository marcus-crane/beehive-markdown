The Foreign Ministers of Fiji and New Zealand, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola and Murray McCully, confirmed they met in Fiji today. 

"This meeting continued our efforts to strengthen staffing at our missions in Wellington and Suva," Ratu Inoke Kubuabola said.

Mr McCully described the discussion as "fruitful and respectful". 

Mr McCully also confirmed Ms Mere Tora had arrived in Wellington to take up the position as First Secretary and Acting Head of Mission at the Fiji High Commission in Wellington.

Ratu Inoke Kubuabola advised Mr Phillip Taula would arrive in Suva in early March to take up the position of First Secretary and Acting Head of Mission at the New Zealand High Commission.

Ministers Kubuabola and McCully said they remained committed to maintaining their dialogue and to ensuring both countries had effective diplomatic representation in each country.
