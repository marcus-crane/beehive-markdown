Hon Rodney Hide, Minister of Local Government, welcomed the release today of the Auckland Transition Agency Discussion Document *Auckland Council local boards*.

"The document shows how we put the local back into local government. It sets out the decision making powers, roles and responsibilities of the local boards in the new Auckland council structure and seeks public feedback.

"Local boards will provide unique local representation and allow the local residents to take responsibility for a range of activities in their community. These include overseeing the management of local facilities like swimming pools and parks, community programmes and local services such as refuse collection and graffiti control. I am pleased to see that the ATA is suggesting that the Auckland Council could delegate responsibility to local boards for regulatory functions such as liquor controls," says Rodney Hide.

He says local boards are an integral part of the representation structure that will make Auckland greater.  "The local boards will complement the mayor and councillors elected from across Auckland.

"They are also a new entity in local government. They are not community boards. They are more significant and will operate independently of the Mayor and Auckland Councillors. 

"For the citizens of Auckland local boards will be an important gateway into the work of local governmentin the region.  Local Boards will contribute to the development of regional strategies, policies and plans, propose bylaws. They will also contribute to the oversight of Council Controlled Organisations," says Rodney Hide.

Local Boards will be operating from day one of the new Auckland Council structure. Each Board will have a budget and specific decision-making powers.

"Because local boards will be a key link between local communities and the Auckland Council responsible for regional issues I am strongly encouraging people to have their say. It will help make Auckland greater," says Rodney Hide.
