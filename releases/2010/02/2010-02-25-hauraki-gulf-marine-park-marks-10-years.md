New parks and private land are to be added to the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park to mark its 10th anniversary, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson announced today.

The new additions feature over 300 parcels of land in Waitakere City Council coastal parks and reserves bordering the Waitemata Harbour, from Whenuapai in the north to Kelston in the south east.

Forest and Bird have also signalled they wish to have three of their reserves on Waiheke Island vested into the park.

Anniversary festivities, to be held on Saturday on Motutapu Island, are a great opportunity to celebrate both these new additions and the marine park itself as a significant natural asset on Auckland's doorstep, Ms Wilkinson says.

"This marine park is enjoyed by so many New Zealanders, not just Aucklanders. Its conservation values are unique and it is fantastic to see the continued work being done to ensure future generations can enjoy it.

"Thanks to pest control and eradication programmes an increasing number of islands are pest free sanctuaries, providing safe homes for some of our rarest native species.

"I would like to congratulate the Hauraki Gulf Forum for the work it has done to encourage the inclusion of more reserves in the park and thank the Waitakere City Council and Forest and Bird for actively becoming involved."

The marine park consists of 1.2 million hectares including marine reserves and more than 50 islands within the Gulf, the most well known of these being Tiritiri Matangi, Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands, Great Barrier Island, and Kawau Island.

It includes public conservation land as well as areas of public land administered by local councils and private land that has been vested in the park.
