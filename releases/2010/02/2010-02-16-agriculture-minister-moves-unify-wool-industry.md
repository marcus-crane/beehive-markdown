Agriculture Minister David Carter is to appoint an independent expert to work on forming a single body for the New Zealand wool industry.

A meeting today of 35 sector leaders agreed to adopt the recommendations of the Wool Taskforce report *Restoring Profitability to the Strong Wool Sector.*

This included a proposal to form a ‘single voice' to act on behalf of the industry.

"There was robust discussion at the meeting but everyone agreed that this was a vital first step in ensuring the future of the strong wool sector," says Mr Carter.

"The group agreed unanimously that the answer to this doesn't lie with any of the existing organisations, but rather with a clean slate approach.

"I will be seeking an independent convenor who will begin the task of unifying an industry that has been fragmented for far too long.  I appreciate that this will not be an easy task and I urge all sectors of the industry to engage constructively in this process.

"Today's meeting saw an encouraging step forward and I am hopeful that this marks the beginning of a new chapter for the New Zealand wool industry," Mr Carter says.
