Eight regional winners and eight runners-up have been announced from hundreds of entries to the Ministry of Health's breastfeeding photo competition.

Associate Minister of Health, Tariana Turia, congratulated all of the people who sent in photos for the competition which celebrates breastfeeding, and in particular breastfeeding in public.

Mrs Turia said, "It's great that hundreds of mums showed their support by entering photos. They are sending a strong message to other women that breastfeeding is an entirely natural part of life- and indeed as the photos show, enables a beautiful connection between mum and baby."

The competition is part of an initiative to support and celebrate breastfeeding, which includes the display pictures of women from across New Zealand breastfeeding in public. The visuals are displayed in bus shelters, shopping malls and Warehouse stores, and in women's magazines.

Mrs Turia said, "The intimate connection between mother and child that is created in breast-feeding is a very special experience.   The photo competition has been a really great idea to express this precious relationship".

The regional winners and runners-up were selected by public vote, and will receive a prize pack and vouchers.   There were 364 entries to the competition, which attracted over 5000 votes.

"Our winning photos include mums breastfeeding on the beach, watching the sun set, and relaxing on deck chairs in a lake."

"Breastfeeding gives baby a great start in life, and it's what's best for mum too," ended Mrs Turia.
