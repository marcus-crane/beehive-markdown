Environment Minister Nick Smith and Local Government Minister Rodney Hide today released the findings of independent reviews initiated in October last year into the performances of Environment Canterbury and the Far North District Council.

"These reports were initiated as part of the Government's broader agenda of taking a more active role in the performance of local government on resource management issues. The two councils performed poorly in the 2007/08 survey of resource consenting processes," Dr Smith said.

Mr Hide said: "The review of Environment Canterbury was broadened to include Local Government Act issues in response to a joint delegation of Canterbury Mayors seeking wider Government intervention."

Dr Smith said he was pleased the Far North District Council, while having performed poorly in the past, had made an impressive effort to lift its game.

"Significant changes have been made by the Mayor, Council and its Chief Executive to their resource management process that has resulted in a much improved performance.  We see no need for further Central Government involvement but I encourage the Council to progress the minor additional improvements identified in the review. I commend the Council for the efforts it has made to fix what has been a serious problem in the Far North for a long period."

Dr Smith said the report on Environment Canterbury was concerning and challenging. 

"It is difficult for the Government to ignore the unanimous conclusions of the four reviewers and the major issues they raise about its capacity to manage water in Canterbury."

Dr Smith said the Government recognises water issues in Canterbury are of national significance.

"Changes are needed to address water quality concerns, processes for allocation and provision for storage. Our response to this report will need to be aligned to the important work programme of the Land and Water Forum and the Canterbury Water Management Strategy."

The Ministers said the Government had not formed a view on the major changes proposed in the report. 

"We will be consulting with Environment Canterbury, Canterbury Mayors, Ngai Tahu and key water stakeholders before making any decision. Our considerations will be mindful of the recommendations for urgent intervention but also of the huge significance to the long-term well being of Canterbury of these proposals," the Ministers said.

Dr Smith and Mr Hide expressed their thanks for the positive way the two councils had engaged with the review process and for the professional job undertaken by both review groups.
