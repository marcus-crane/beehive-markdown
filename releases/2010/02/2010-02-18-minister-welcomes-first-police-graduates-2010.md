Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed 38 new Police officers in the first graduating Cadet Wing of 2010.

Ms Collins joined family and friends to celebrate the graduation of Wing 260 at the Royal New Zealand Police College at Porirua.

She said the graduation marked the beginning of a challenging and rewarding career for the new officers.

"It takes a special type of person to be a Police officer. There are few jobs that ask people to put themselves in the path of danger so that the public may be safe," Ms Collins said.

"Last year confidence in the Police increased to 79 per cent, which puts them among the most trusted professions in New Zealand.

"Yet no organisation can rest on its achievements. The Police have an obligation to the public to be constantly evaluating how they can do things better and respond to new and existing crime trends more effectively."

Ms Collins said it would be increasingly important for Police to take a broad approach to community safety.

"This doesn't just mean catching criminals, although that will always be the Police's main priority, but also a strong focus on crime prevention and community policing," Ms Collins said.

Police trainees undertake an intensive 19-week course at the college.

All of today's graduates will be posted to frontline roles as they begin a two-year probationary period.
