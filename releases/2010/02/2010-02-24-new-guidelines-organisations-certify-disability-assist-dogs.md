Organisations wishing to seek authorisation to train and certify disability assist dogs now have a set of guidelines to follow.

A disability assist dog is trained to help people with disabilities and may enter and remain in places where other dogs are prohibited to go.

There are currently a limited number of organisations listed in the Dog Control Act 1996 that can certify a dog trained to assist (or a dog in training to assist) a person with a disability.

Local Government Minister Rodney Hide says the guidelines will make sure the organisations training the dogs are approved and suitable.  "Disability assist dogs provide support twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, at home, at work and out in the community.  The partnership between owner and dog is based on trust, and we need to be sure the organisations training these dogs are competent and trustworthy.

"These new guidelines will require organisations to show that they are viable, of high quality and accountable to their clients.

"After talking with the Minister for Disability Issues, I can recommend new organisations to be authorised under the Act.  This will help to ensure that people whose disabilities fall outside the scope of existing approved organisations can get a disability assist dog."

Minister of Disability Issues Tariana Turia says, she has been greatly impressed in observing the dogs in action.  "These dogs provide mobility assistance for people with physical disabilities and are an enormous source of strength for disabled persons and their whanau.  I welcome the initiative from the Local Government Minister to ensure these guidelines are in place."
