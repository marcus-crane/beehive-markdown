"Fresh Start legislation targeting the country's most persistent, serious young offenders with a range of tough new measures has now become law," says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

"Intervening early to divert these young people from a life of crime could save taxpayers from the $90,000 a year it costs to house an adult in jail."

"Early intervention is a proven prevention method," says Ms Bennett.

 The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families (Youth Courts Jurisdiction and Orders) Amendment Bill passed its third and final reading this morning.

 The bill, aimed at the worst 1,000 young offenders provides greater Youth Court powers, including extending jurisdiction to 12 and 13 year olds and tougher, more effective sentences.

 "This Bill gives Youth Court judges the ability to determine what's needed to change the behaviour of our most serious youth offenders, and order them to follow through on it," says Ms Bennett.

 The reforms include doubling the maximum residential sentences to six months, with twelve months supervision and increasing supervision with activity orders to six months with another six months supervision.

 Military activity camps for the most serious repeat young offenders will teach self-discipline, respect and responsibility, with mentoring, parenting and drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes to address the causes of offending.

 "The Army has been incredibly successful in preparing thousands of young adults for work and training with its Limited Services Volunteer (LSV) programmes. We know young people respond well to the mix of teamwork, self-discipline, responsibility and pride delivered by soldiers," says Ms Bennett.

 Fresh Start will cost $84 million over the next three years.

 "This Government's commitment to frontline youth justice services, better equips judges with the tools they need to deter young offenders from a life of crime," says Ms Bennett.

 Police will be able to refer 12 or 13 year olds who commit very serious crimes to Youth Court for the first time.

  "New Zealanders have long been appalled at our inability to hold the very small number of children, who commit serious crimes, properly to account". 

 "We have the opportunity with this investment to make a real difference in the lives of young offenders.  Getting it right will have huge benefits for all New Zealanders," said Ms Bennett.
