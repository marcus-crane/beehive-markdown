MultiProof, a new streamlined National Multiple-use Approval Service for volume builders, was launched today by Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson.

"Without compromising quality and safety, MultiProof fast-tracks building consents for standard, multiple-use building designs.  It will save time and money for both consumers and builders." Mr Williamson said.

"Volume builders can now apply to the Department of Building and Housing for MultiProof approval to certify a building design for multiple use meets building code requirements."

Until now volume builders have been required to have the same design assessed and approved each time that design is used.

"That stifling process and duplication was unproductive with no benefit to the consumer or the builder. With MultiProof designs, only site-specific conditions will need to be checked by local councils, reducing the time-frame for building consent decisions from 20 days to just 10 days."

MultiProof is the first initiative from the Government's Better Building Blueprint.

Warwick Quinn, Chief Executive, Registered Master Buildings Federation of NZ Inc, described Multiproof as a great initiative.

"We welcome this streamlined consenting process for multiple-use designs. I believe we will quickly see real benefits for both the sector and our clients." Mr Quinn said.

Derek Baxter, Chief Executive, Certified Builders Association of NZ Inc said that MultiProof would remove frustration and unnecessary delays for both volume builders and their customers.

"We applaud the Government's action.  Removing the need to repeatedly have a design approved is welcome news and can only benefit our members and their clients."
