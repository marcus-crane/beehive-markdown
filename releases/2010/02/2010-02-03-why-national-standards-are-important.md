Associate Minister of Education Heather Roy today expressed her support for the Government's new National Standards, an important policy that will provide parents with much-needed information about their children's educational progress.

"The Government has responded to a request from parents asking for access to clear and plain-language reporting on their child's progress. They access information formally when it is available and informally through networks," Mrs Roy said.

"Parents have a right to the same information that is available to schools. If parents are to be active participants in their child's education, they need to have a clear idea of how their child is progressing and the quality of education their school is providing.

"Many schools already assess children well and pass this information on to parents.  However, consistency of assessment throughout the country is crucial in determining where and when students are not performing well, then to do something about it.  National Standards are needed to provide this benchmark information.

"Parents want information on their child's progress and the National Standards provide the infrastructure to ensure this is available.  The policy has drawn criticism and generated much controversy, but why should we be content with one in five young people in New Zealand currently leaving school without the literacy and numeracy skills they need to do well in life?

"Providing progress reports in plain language to parents allows them to make better-informed decisions about their child's education; it makes schools accountable for their results and creates incentives to provide quality education.

"ACT aspires to excellence in education and the introduction of National Standards is an important step toward improving levels of achievement and success in all schools.  All Parties should be striving to assist our children and young people to reach their full potential," Mrs Roy said.
