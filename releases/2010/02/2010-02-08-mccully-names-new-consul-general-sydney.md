New Zealand's next Consul-General in Sydney will be career diplomat Martin Welsh, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Mr Welsh will lead the New Zealand Government's presence in Sydney, which includes Trade and Enterprise, Customs, Police, Internal Affairs, Immigration and Tourism," Mr McCully said.

"New South Wales is an economically important state for New Zealand and holds a special place in the trans-Tasman relationship. Sydney is a major entry and departure point for holiday makers and business people crossing the Tasman each year, and is also an entry and departure point for the huge volume of the two-way trade between our countries.

"New Zealand and Australia also share strong sporting links, and promoting New Zealand's hosting of the 2011 Rugby World Cup will be a major focus of our activities in Sydney in the lead up to the event." 

Mr Welsh is currently Deputy Director of Europe Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously served in Noumea and Ha Noi.

He takes up the new position in September, replacing Sarah Craig.
