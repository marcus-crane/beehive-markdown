Internal Affairs Minister Hon Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of Miranda Burdon to the Board of the Lotteries Commission.

"Ms Burdon is an Auckland-based company director with a wide range of experience. Her background in management, marketing and sales will be a real asset to the work of the Lotteries Commission," says Mr Guy.

The Lotteries Commission's function is to provide governance of the Lotteries business - such as Lotto, Lotto Strike, Daily Keno and Instant Kiwi - in order to raise money for the community through lottery games.

"The government's aim is to maximise the return to the community from the proceeds of gambling while minimising any associated harm. Good management of the Lotteries business means more funding for valuable projects in our communities."

Distributing the funds raised by the Lotteries Commission is the responsibility of a separate entity, the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board.

Ms Burdon's appointment is for a three year term, ending in 2013.

Mr Guy has also elevated Dr Richard Janes to fill the vacant Deputy Presiding Membership.  Dr Janes has been a member of the Board since July 2009 and has extensive governance experience in the public and private sector.
