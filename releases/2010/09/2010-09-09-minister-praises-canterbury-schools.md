Education Minister Anne Tolley has paid tribute to Canterbury schools and ECE services as they attempt to get back to normal following the recent earthquake.

"Everyone is working hard to make sure the schools and early childhood centres open as soon as possible," says Mrs Tolley.

"A handful of schools opened for students today, with a few more set to open tomorrow, but many schools have indicated they will be open for students on Monday.

"Everyone concerned is doing a fantastic job in extremely difficult circumstances, with great support from the Ministry of Education.

"I also want to thank parents for showing patience, and remind families that the Ministry of Education's website, at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/) is constantly being updated with information on when schools are planning to open. This is subject to change and parents should also check with their school or Board of Trustees.

"I will be travelling to Christchurch tomorrow morning to speak to principals and teachers at affected schools and meet with Ministry staff."
