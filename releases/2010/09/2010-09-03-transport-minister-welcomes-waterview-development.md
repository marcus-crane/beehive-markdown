Transport Minister Steven Joyce says confirmation today that the application for resource consent and route designation for Auckland's Waterview Connection - part of Western Ring Route road of national significance - will be assessed by a Board of Inquiry is an important day for Auckland transport and the economy.

He says this is another big step towards unlocking the benefits that the completed Western Ring Route will bring to Auckland and the whole country.

The Waterview Connection is the first roading project to use the new national consenting process.

"The ability to make a direct application to the Environment Protection Authority under the RMA was introduced by Government last year to streamline the decision-making process on projects of national significance," says Mr Joyce.

"Today's announcement means a decision on the application will be made within nine months of public notification, with appeal rights limited to points of law.

"This is a project that's been debated for decades - I'm pleased that everyone involved will soon have certainty about exactly what's happening, when and how."

Mr Joyce says the completion of the route is essential to the continued growth and economic development in the Auckland region.

"It will also contribute to better links for business and freight between key industrial hubs in the cities of Manukau, Auckland, Waitakere and North Shore."
