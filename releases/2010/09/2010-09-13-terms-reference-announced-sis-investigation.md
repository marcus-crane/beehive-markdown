Prime Minister John Key today outlined the terms of reference for an investigation he has directed into the NZ Security Intelligence Service's processes for granting a security clearance to former NZDF employee Stephen Wilce.

Mr Wilce was appointed Chief Defence Scientist and Director of the Defence Technology Agency in 2005. He resigned from his position after questions were raised about his background.

"The State Services Commissioner, Iain Rennie, has appointed Neil Walter, former Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to undertake this investigation," says Mr Key.

"The investigation will cover the vetting processes used by the SIS regarding the granting of a security clearance to Mr Wilce in 2005, and the adequacy of those processes.

"The investigation will also examine the adequacy of the current vetting system and whether it is fit for purpose, and whether or not there needs to be any recommendations made to strengthen the system."

Mr Key says the intention is for the investigation to be completed on 27 September 2010.
