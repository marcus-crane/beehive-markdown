Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia is delighted at the number and calibre of providers who have submitted proposals to deliver Whanau Ora.

The agency responsible for implementing Whanau Ora, Te Puni Kokiri, has received 130 proposals from 347 providers wanting to deliver Whanau Ora.

Nearly 40 per cent of the expressions of interest are from provider collectives with several proposing to deliver Whanau Ora nationwide.

"I am told that the calibre of the proposals is very high and that an impressive number of provider collectives have submitted strong proposals to work collaboratively to deliver Whanau Ora," says Mrs Turia.

"The spirit of cooperation that is being demonstrated to work together in the best interests of whanau is really great and bodes well for future initiatives"

The expressions of interest also include proposals from Pacific, disability, refugee and migrant providers.

The proposals are being assessed by the Whanau Ora Regional Leadership Groups who will make a final recommendation to the Whanau Ora Governance Group.

"Whanau Ora represents a significant investment in whanau by this Government and I am excited by the interest that this innovative approach has generated in its first few months of implementation."

"It is a great sign for the future of whanau and I look forward to announcing the successful providers in October."
