Transport Minister Steven Joyce is welcoming progress towards the procurement Auckland's new electric trains.

KiwiRail has today released its Request for Proposal documentation for to the 11 companies short-listed to manufacture the 38 new electric multiple units (trains).

Mr Joyce says the process is "well and truly on track".

"KiwiRail advises me that they are very happy with how things are progressing and that they are on track to award the tender by the middle of next year and have the first trains on the ground and operational from 2013.

"While KiwiRail has made the call not to be part of the tender to build the trains themselves, they have been ensuring that all bidders are aware of the capacity and experience that exists here in New Zealand.  I would encourage all players to investigate the potential to have some of the work done here.

"I was heartened to hear that a number of bidders have already visited the KiwiRail engineering workshops.  I hope others will do the same in the months ahead."

Mr Joyce says commuter rail is an increasingly important way for Aucklanders to get to work each day.

The upgrade and electrification of the Auckland rail network will provide for more frequent trains at peak times and help to meet future passenger demand.

"New Zealand's future success is tied to that of Auckland as our largest city and largest local economy. Getting Auckland transport working well is crucial to getting Auckland growing faster and providing more jobs"

"The government's comprehensive rail and roading plan for Auckland is gaining momentum towards improving transport across the city.  Increased productivity and growth in Auckland delivers flow-on effects for the rest of the country."

The Crown has invested $1.6 billion in the development of Auckland's metro rail system, which comprises:

- $600 million for Project DART
- $500 million for the infrastructure required to support electrification
- $500 million for purchase of electric trains (government loan to KiwiRail).
