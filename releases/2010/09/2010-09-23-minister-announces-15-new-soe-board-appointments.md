State Owned Enterprises Minister Simon Power today announced 15 new appointments and 13 reappointments across 12 SOEs and two airport companies.

At New Zealand Post, Hon Michael Cullen has been appointed chair from November 1 to replace Rt Hon Jim Bolger.

"Mr Bolger has been a strong leader for NZ Post since November 2001, and I thank him for his dedicated service over that time," Mr Power said.

Dr Cullen has served on the NZ Post board since May last year, and has been deputy chair since November.

"I look forward to working with Dr Cullen to develop NZ Post's strategy to accommodate declining mail volumes and a challenging financial environment."

Board member Justine Smyth has been appointed deputy chair.

At Transpower, Mark Verbiest has been appointed chair to replace Wayne Brown.

"Mr Verbiest has significant governance experience as well as holding a number of senior legal positions throughout his career, and I'm pleased he's accepted this challenging role."

Mr Power thanked outgoing chair Wayne Brown for his service on the Transpower board since August 2006, and as chair since November 2007.

At AsureQuality, Janine Smith has been appointed chair to replace John Spencer, who is retiring at the end of his term at the end of October to focus on his role as chair of KiwiRail.

"As establishment chair, Mr Spencer oversaw the 2007 merger of AgriQuality and Asure and has been instrumental in developing AsureQuality into the successful company it is today."

Janine Smith was a director of Airways Corporation from April 1999 to April 2006, including four years as deputy chair, has served on the Kordia board since December 2003, and has been deputy chair of Kordia since November 2009.

"Ms Smith has extensive governance experience in both the public and private sectors, and I look forward to working with her to continue developing AsureQuality's strategy."

New directors on SOEs are: Hamish Stevens on AsureQuality, Rob Fisher on Genesis, John Allen and Debbie Birch on Kordia, Parekāwhia McLean on Mighty River Power, Greg Cross and Carolyn Harkess on MetService, Alan Dunn and Jackie Lloyd on NZ Post, Michelle Smith on Solid Energy, and Maury Leyland on Transpower.

"These people have a broad range of commercial experience and I expect them to make a significant contribution to delivering the Government's expectation of better commercial performance.

"The quality of the appointments highlights the Government's continuing ability to attract some of the country's most experienced governance professionals to serve on SOE boards, as well as developing the next generation of talent." 

In reappointments, Con Anastasiou will continue as chair of Airways Corporation until July next year, and John Palmer has been reappointed as chair of Solid Energy for a further three years.

Mr Power thanked retiring board members for their contributions and wished them well in their future endeavours.

Full details of the changes, which will take effect from 1 November, are below.
