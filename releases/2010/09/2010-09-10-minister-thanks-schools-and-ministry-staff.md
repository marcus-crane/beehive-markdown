Education Minister Anne Tolley has thanked principals, teachers, board members, students and Ministry of Education staff in Canterbury as they work to get schools up and running.

"While in Christchurch today I've spoken to many teachers and trustees, some of whom are rallying around their schools despite serious issues with their own homes," says Mrs Tolley.

"They are passionate about their schools and know what an important part schools play in bringing communities together.

"I saw some heartbreaking scenes, but was hugely impressed by the dedication and determination of Canterbury people as they work to get schools open for students.

"Ministry staff have played a vital role and I want to thank them for their tireless efforts in supporting schools.

"The majority of schools will be open on Monday. A few have structural problems and the Ministry is working on temporary arrangements to get students back into education as soon as possible.

"Parents can get updated information on their schools via the Ministry of Education's website, [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/) however this is subject to change and parents should also check with their school or Board of Trustees."
