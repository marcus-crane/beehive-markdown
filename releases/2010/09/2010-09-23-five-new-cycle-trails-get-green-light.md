Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has today, on World Tourism Day, announced that funding of $13.9 million has been approved for five more cycle trails under Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail project.

The Government has now approved a total of $45.6 million for a series of 18 Great Rides that will take cyclists through some of New Zealand's most iconic and picturesque country.

"All 18 trails on the New Zealand Cycle Trail project have now had their funding confirmed. This means all trails are either under construction or ready to enter the construction phase," Mr Key says.

"This is a significant milestone for the project, which has captured the imagination and support of communities around the country.

"I would like to congratulate all applicants for the immense effort that has gone into completing the planning for the trails. These five trails, together with thirteen trails already approved, are expected to provide more than 2,000km of trail once completed.

"I would also like to thank Kevin Hague and the Green Party for their continuing support of the New Zealand Cycle Trail project.

"We are investing in the New Zealand Cycle Trail to generate real and lasting economic, social and environmental benefits for New Zealand communities while building our already strong reputation as a premium tourism destination.

"The targeted co-funding for the 18 Great Rides of around $30 million also demonstrates the significant commitment of the local communities involved," Mr Key says.

The five new trails that have had their funding confirmed from the New Zealand Cycle Trail Fund are; Bay of Islands to Hokianga, Hauraki Plains, Pathway of Fire, The Old Ghost Road, and Roxburgh Gorge.
