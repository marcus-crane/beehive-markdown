On-site safety is a priority now but it hasn't always been that way and that's what makes the achievements of today's graduates in the Certificate in Construction Safety all the more important, Associate Minister for ACC Pansy Wong says.

"Workplace injuries cause pain and suffering for employees - they can affect our careers and our ability to provide for our families. It can also impact businesses through lost productivity and profits.

"And the cost of workplace injuries is huge.  Last year the cost in ACC claims alone was $443 million, up from $400 million the year before.

"The construction industry has significantly improved its safety performance, and Site Safe has made a major contribution towards that. However, there were still more than 5,000 people seriously injured at work in the construction industry and construction trades last year. This cost nearly $115 million in ACC claims and represents a great deal of pain and suffering.''

Mrs Wong says, sadly, 23 people also died working in general construction last year -23 people who were someone's child, someone's friend, someone's partner or someone's parent - which is why today's graduation is so important because the graduates now have the skills to make a difference.

She says the Government is committed to reducing deaths and injuries for all New Zealanders especially in high risk activities like building and construction but they needed the support of workplaces to help lift health and safety standards in the construction sector.

"I want to say a special thank you to Unitec and Site Safe for their efforts in making this course of study beneficial to the individuals, their families and their workplaces.

"And I congratulate the 100 plus graduates on their dedicated two years of hard study and thank them for the leadership they are exhibiting in their workplaces by promoting a culture of safety.''
