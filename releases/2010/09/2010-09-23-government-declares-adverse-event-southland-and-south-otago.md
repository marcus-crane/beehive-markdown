Storm-stricken farmers in Southland and South Otago are to get assistance from the Government.

Agriculture Minister David Carter today declared a medium-level adverse event in the area, triggering government relief measures.

The measures include funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help, welfare support, and farm management advice.

Mr Carter has been visiting affected farms in Southland today to assess the damage first-hand.

"The current situation is grim and will have a major ongoing impact," says Mr Carter. "This is one of the worst spring storms seen in decades, and as the extreme weather has hit in peak lambing season and at a critical time of year for dairy farmers the impact is severe.

"Losses of this magnitude not only impose a huge economic cost on farmers, but also significant emotional and mental stress."

Mr Carter is urging farmers who are finding conditions tough to talk to the Southland Rural Support Trust and to seek advice on planning and management decisions.

"Farming communities are the lifeblood of provincial New Zealand and the Government is fully committed to providing the right level of support," Mr Carter says.

"I have instructed MAF to provide me with regular updates on the situation.

"As a farmer myself, I have real sympathy for the pain that farmers are feeling under these conditions. There is severe pressure on Southland and South Otago's rural communities."
