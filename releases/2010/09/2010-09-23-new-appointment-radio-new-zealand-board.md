Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Tiwana Tibble to the board of Radio New Zealand (RNZ) and the promotion of Richard Griffin to deputy chair.

Mr Tibble has been the chief executive of the Ngati Whatua o Orakei Maori Trust Board since 1998.  Prior to that he was the Company Secretary and Financial Controller at the Maori Development Corporation Ltd. 

Mr Griffin, a director of a Wellington public relations company and a former RNZ political editor, was appointed to the board in May 2010.  

"Tiwana has strong financial management and governance experience and I expect he will be a significant contributor to the RNZ board," Dr Coleman says.

"I am pleased to acknowledge Richard's elevation to the deputy chair role, which has been vacant since last year.  The board now has a full complement of seven members and I believe it's well positioned for the future."
