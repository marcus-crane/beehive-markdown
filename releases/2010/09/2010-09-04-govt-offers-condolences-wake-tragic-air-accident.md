Transport Minister Steven Joyce has extended sincere condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those aboard the Skydive New Zealand plane that crashed near Fox Glacier this afternoon.

Nine people on board the Fletcher FU24 turbine powered plane were killed. It is the first aviation accident of this magnitude in New Zealand since the Air Adventures accident claimed eight lives in 2003.

Mr Joyce says he is being kept informed as information comes to hand.

"The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is leading the investigation with assistance from the Civil Aviation Authority.  My office is being kept informed.

"Details remain sketchy and it is too soon to speculate on exactly what has led to this accident occurring.

"In the meantime, my thoughts, and those of my Cabinet colleagues, are with all of those who have been affected by this very tragic event."
