Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples sets off tomorrow at the head of a delegation of Maori business and sector leaders, to visit Beijing, Shanghai and Guizhou in China.

During a week in China Dr Sharples will have meetings with Ministers in Beijing, visit the World Expo in Shanghai, meet ethnic communities involved in tourism and farming ventures, and help bless and open the massive carved waharoa (gateway) at the Baoshan Folk Arts Museum, which has been gifted by New Zealand to the people of China.

"Our delegation is calling this visit Te Ara ki Haina, because we see huge potential in Maori establishing cultural relationships in China, to open up pathways for trade and business to follow," said Dr Sharples.

"The 15 business delegates are involved in fisheries and aquaculture, farming and forestry, banking and property development, tourism, culture and the creative industries, telecommunications, science, education, health and social services.

"All of us see great potential in developing export markets, and we think Maori and Chinese share many cultural values which are relevant to us doing business in China.

"New Zealand was the first developed country to sign a full Free Trade Agreement with China. Maori culture gives us a unique profile on the world stage, and we look forward to building on that foundation, for Maori and New Zealand as a whole," said Dr Sharples.

The delegation returns to New Zealand on September 12th.
