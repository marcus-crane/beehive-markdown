Following the destructive earthquake last Saturday in Christchurch and the outlying areas, local government officers have worked tirelessly alongside other agencies to help rebuild the Canterbury community, says the Minister of Local Government, Rodney Hide.

"I would like to pay tribute to all those officers who have worked long hours, worked through the nights and supported those in need during what is a very upsetting and stressful time.

"As Associate Minister of Education, I would like to thank the Ministry of Education officials working on the ground supporting schools and early childhood services, and who look after our special needs students.

"Would also like to thank Watercare Services Limited, Auckland's water and waste water services provider who are assisting by supplying specialised equipment and personnel to support the recovery and reconstruction effort.  
   
"There is a long way to go and it won't be easy, but I would like to offer my support to all local government and education officials working on the ground in Christchurch and the surrounding regions, to the Prime Minister, Mayor Bob Parker, Mayor Kelvin Coe, Mayor Ron Keating and my ministerial colleagues.

"I will be visiting Canterbury in the near future and look forward to seeing the recovery first hand.

"All New Zealanders and especially those that have been affected by this earthquake can be proud in the way they have responded to what has been a shattering and distressing natural disaster."
