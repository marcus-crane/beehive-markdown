Prime Minister John Key says he is shocked and saddened at the sudden death of Sir Archie Taiaroa.

Sir Archie suffered a stroke at his farm in Taumarunui on Monday, and died today.

"Sir Archie's leadership was inspirational. He was a role model to young Maori and hugely influential in Maoridom," says Mr Key.

"This is a tragic loss - not just for Whanganui, not just for Maori, but for all New Zealanders.

"Sir Archie stood tall and proud and taught others to do the same.

"Our paths crossed many times, and it was always a privilege. I will miss his wisdom and his humour.

"His passing will be deeply mourned but his significant achievements and his strong and sound leadership will be his legacy.

"To Lady Martha and his whanau I extend my heartfelt sympathies.

"We have lost a man of honour and integrity whose long years of community service will be remembered with gratitude."
