Employers can now check online if job applicants are entitled to work in New Zealand, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today.

‘VisaView', a free online service, was developed by Immigration New Zealand to help employers prepare for changes to the new Immigration Act which comes into effect on November 29.

"This tool makes it easier for employers to check the visa status of migrants and prevents them from unintentionally falling foul of immigration law,'' says Dr Coleman.

"Under the new Act there are tougher obligations to ensure all workers are legally entitled to work in New Zealand. VisaView will help employers meet those obligations without having to grapple with red tape and overly bureaucratic measures. ''

Developed to comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act, VisaView checks information provided by registered employers against Immigration New Zealand's database. In most cases, the employer receives a real time ‘Yes' or ‘No' response, together with any specific work conditions that may apply.

Dr Coleman says Immigration New Zealand has been successfully trialling VisaView in recent weeks to allow employers time to familiarise themselves with the process and new obligations before the new Act's provisions come in to force.
