Whanau Ora Minister, Tariana Turia, has today praised the Office of the Children's Commissioner for their stirling work in producing the report, *Children in Care.*

"This report makes a substantial contribution to our understanding about the quality of services for children in state care".

"A key message out of the report is the vital significance of maintaining constructive relationships with the birth family".

"A poignant theme from the voices of the children was the sense of real sadness amongst so many of them; and their yearning to be reunited with their family of origin".

"It is my firm belief that no child should be placed outside of kin" said Mrs Turia.  ‘'Stranger care' is no alternative for the strength of attachment and the unique identity that is felt within the folds of one's whakapapa".

The report also emphasizes the importance of engaging with whanau, hapu and iwi; and placing value on cultural connection as integral to the wellbeing of Maori, Pasifika and children of other ethnic minorities".

I will be following up the recommendations of this report, particularly the priority accorded to research focused on the needs of tamariki and rangatahi Maori in the care system and the evaluation of kin/whanau care".

"All our children deserve the very best chance in life and meeting their needs for connections to their culture, and to their kin, is a vital factor in helping them to fulfil their potential".
