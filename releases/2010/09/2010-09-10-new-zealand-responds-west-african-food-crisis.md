New Zealand will contribute $1 million to the World Food Programme's response to serious food shortages in the Sahel region of West Africa, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Severe drought in West Africa has led to crop failures and stock losses which have put more than 10 million people at risk of malnutrition and starvation," Mr McCully said.

"The situation is accentuated by high food prices, and the fact that the affected countries are among the poorest in the world.

"New Zealand's contribution will assist international efforts to provide life-saving emergency food aid in Niger, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania."
