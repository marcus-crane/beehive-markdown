The Government will contribute up to $10 million in addition to local funding to assist with the repair, restoration and strengthening of heritage and character buildings in the Canterbury region, Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson announced today.

"The heritage buildings throughout Canterbury are an important part of the region's character and its history," the Minister said. "The earthquake caused significant damage to many heritage and character buildings. The cost of their repair and restoration will be considerable, and it is appropriate that Government assists with local rebuilding and strengthening efforts to preserve this history."

"The community places a high value on our heritage and character buildings," Mr Finlayson said. "The government shares that view, and will be encouraging further donations by its provision of matching funding for regional heritage repairs dollar-for-dollar, up to a maximum of $10 million."

Ministers and officials will work with the local councils on the best fund for the Government contribution to be made to. Decisions on allocating funding will be made by local representatives, with assistance from the Historic Places Trust.
