Social Development Minister Paula Bennett is impressed with the effort made by Work and Income staff since the earthquake and has received substantial support for the checks that were made on the elderly.

Work and Income staff have contacted 16,233 Superannuitants by phone and home visited another 706 elderly people in the days following the quake.

"It was really important to check on those elderly living alone and provide help where needed and I've been overwhelmed by the appreciation," says Ms Bennett.

Assistance continues for all Cantabrians affected by the earthquake.

"Government and non government agencies have been working around the clock to ensure people get the help they need," says Ms Bennett.

Work and Income have so far processed 2,838 emergency payments to local people, amounting to more than $359,000.

Grants have been required mostly for food, accommodation and clothing.

"Cantabrians are a resilient bunch, but right now many just need some basic essentials, which we're happy to help with," says Ms Bennett.

Employers have made 462 applications for the Earthquake Support Subsidy to help pay the wages of 2,573 staff.

"I'm really pleased employers are taking this initiative up, because it means they can get through this tough patch without losing their staff," says Ms Bennett.

Work and Income staff continue to answer calls to the 0800 779997 Government Helpline, so far more than 11,400 calls have been received.

Most of the calls are requests for advice on housing repairs, financial support and offers of help.

The New Zealand Red Cross Canterbury Earthquake Commission has been established to distribute funds raised to help victims of the earthquake.

The Government has donated $5 million to this fund.

"People who want to apply to this fund should call or visit their local Work and Income office or call the Government Helpline," says Ms Bennett.
