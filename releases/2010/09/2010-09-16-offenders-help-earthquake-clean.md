Offenders on community work are providing valuable assistance with the Canterbury earthquake clean-up, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

"The Corrections Department has a labour force of around 2400 offenders in Christchurch on community work. Around a hundred a day have done earthquake cleanup work since Tuesday this week, and Corrections expects this number to rise substantially over the weekend," Ms Collins says.

"The workers have helped Civil Defence and the region's three councils as well as the wider community. They have cleared debris in heavily silted areas such as Kaiapoi, and they have assisted some elderly people by clearing driveways so they can use their cars.

"They have done cleanup work at Wylie Park the Rose Garden and Kairaki Beach in Kaiapoi, so that families in the area can take some time out. Today they are working alongside Civil Defence and Army clearing debris from St Paul's Church in Kaiapoi.

"They have also been clearing debris from state housing in Robson Avenue in Christchurch. Tomorrow they will help clean up a school in Kaiapoi that is currently closed.

"I encourage Cantabrians needing help with earthquake-related recovery tasks, whether individuals or community groups, to contact Corrections via the dedicated contact number," Ms Collins says.
