Earthquake recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced members of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission.

The commission's establishment was a requirement of the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2010, which was passed with unanimous support through Parliament on September 14.

Its primary roles are to provide advice to relevant Ministers on how resources may be prioritised and funding allocated for the response to the Canterbury earthquake; and to provide a central contact point between central and local government in the management of the response effort.

The seven member commission will include the mayors of the Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri Districts elected after the 9 October local body elections, a representative of Environment Canterbury, Dame Margaret Bazely, and it will be chaired by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Director General Murray Sherwin.

Also joining Mr Sherwin and Dame Margaret will be earthquake engineer David Hopkins and one other appointee, who will be confirmed shortly.

Mr Brownlee said he was confident the commission would have the right mix of experience to oversee the swift and comprehensive re-building of areas affected by the September 4 earthquake.

"I would like to welcome and thank the commissioners in advance for their service in providing a vital link between the Canterbury region and central government as we manage this major recovery effort," Mr Brownlee said.
