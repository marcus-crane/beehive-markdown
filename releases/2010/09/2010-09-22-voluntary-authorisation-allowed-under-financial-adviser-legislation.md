Cabinet has agreed for regulations to be developed to allow insurance advisers and mortgage brokers to be voluntarily authorised under legislation covering financial advisers.

Commerce Minister Simon Power said a number of changes were made to the Financial Advisers Act earlier this year to clarify that people providing advice solely on insurance or credit products were not required to be authorised.

However, as a result of this change, insurance advisers and mortgage brokers expressed concern that they were no longer able to be authorised if they still wanted to be.

"Today's announcement clearly sets out the Government's aim of encouraging all financial advisers to aspire to be authorised," Mr Power said.

The regulations allowing voluntarily authorisation are likely to be passed before December.

The financial adviser regime is governed by two pieces of legislation - the Financial Advisers Act and Financial Service Providers Acts.

The Acts, which will be fully in force by July next year, require all financial service providers - including financial advisers - to be on a public register and, if they provide retail services, to belong to an approved dispute resolution scheme.

"Many mum and dad consumers have lost large sums of money because of the poor financial advice they've received.

"This regime is essential if we are to have a financial sector in which consumers and financial product providers can have confidence."
