Transport Minister Steven Joyce says the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance is progressing well with tenders being called for initial work on the Otaki to Levin section of the road.

The work being tendered includes the investigation of options and preliminary design for the 21km section of State Highway 1 between north of Otaki and north of Levin.

"The Otaki to Levin route is an integral component of the Wellington Northern Corridor which, when completed, will provide faster and safer travel, as well as enhanced journey time reliability, for motorists travelling from across the lower North Island to Wellington and the airport," says Mr Joyce.

Progress continues to be maintained on the Wellington Northern Corridor Road of National Significance.  This year we have seen the following:

- The establishment of an engineering and construction alliance for the MacKays to Peka Peka section, which is currently looking at the final route alignment.
- The commencement of design work for the Peka Peka to Otaki section.
- The release of tender documents for the investigation of the important Otaki to Levin section of the Wellington Northern Corridor.
- The Transmission Gully project on track to lodge consent applications by mid-2011.
- A scoping study started as part of the Mt Victoria Tunnel duplication project.

The Wellington to Levin Corridor is one of seven initial Roads of National Significance, which means it is a priority for investment over the next ten years.

"The completion of the new road will bring real gains through improving economic growth and productivity through more efficient movement of people and freight," says Mr Joyce.

"The release today of tender documents for the Levin to Otaki section is an important step towards getting the Expressway designed and built so that these benefits can be realised.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities."

Tenders for the Otaki to Levin section of the road will close in late October and the NZ Transport Agency should be in a position to award the tender before Christmas.
