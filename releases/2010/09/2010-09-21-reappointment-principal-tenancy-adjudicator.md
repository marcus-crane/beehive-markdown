Justice Minister Simon Power and Housing Minister Phil Heatley have announced the reappointment of Rex Maidment as the Principal Tenancy Adjudicator. 

Mr Maidment has been reappointed for a further term of 3 years from 1 November. 

The Principal Tenancy Adjudicator is an independent statutory appointee responsible for ensuring the efficient and effective operation of the Tenancy Tribunal. 

The appointment is made by the Governor-General on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Housing. 

"I'm pleased Mr Maidment has made himself available to lead the Tenancy Tribunal for a further three years," Mr Power said.

Phil Heatley said Mr Maidment's skills and experience would be invaluable.

"Mr Maidment will be able to help the tribunal manage the projected changes brought about by recent legislative amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and the new Unit Titles Act 2010."
