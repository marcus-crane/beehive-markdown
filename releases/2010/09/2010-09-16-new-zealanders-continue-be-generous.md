Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming the first *How do New Zealanders Give? Quarterly Generosity Indicators* report.

The report, launched by Auckland Central MP Nikki Kaye at a function for the 20th anniversary of Volunteering Auckland last night, looks at how New Zealanders have contributed by volunteering, or making donations of money or goods on a quarterly basis.

It also highlights volunteering hours and money donated each quarter.

"More than 30 per cent of New Zealanders aged ten years and over volunteered in 2009 - that's an incredible 1.2 million New Zealanders."

"That equates to a contribution of more than 270 million hours of formal, unpaid work for non-profit organisations, which if we were to pay them, would be valued at almost $3.3 billion," says Mrs Turia.

"It is that kind of generosity that keeps our communities strong, healthy and thriving."

The report was produced by the Generosity Hub and the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector. 

Key findings from the December quarter 2009 to March 2010 are:

- the percentage of people volunteering increased from 28.3% to 30.3%
- the median hours volunteered per month increased from 8 to10 hours per volunteer
- the percentage of people donating money was stable, decreasing slightly from 41.3% to 40.1%
- the median amount donated per month decreased from $40 to $35 per donor
- the percentage of people donating goods was stable, decreasing slightly from 16.4% to 15.7%.

"If we assign a dollar value to volunteer labour and combine this with personal donations, we can estimate that 37% of the revenue of the community and voluntary sector comes from the communities themselves," says Mrs Turia.
