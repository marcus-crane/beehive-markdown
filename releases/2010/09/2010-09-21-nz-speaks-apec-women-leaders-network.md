From an economic perspective it is essential women take their rightful places in leadership roles, Minister of Women's Affairs Pansy Wong told the 15th APEC Women's Leaders Network Meeting in Tokyo.

Mrs Wong said international research supported that having diversity on boards led to better outcomes.

The 15th APEC Women Leaders Network (WLN) Meeting comprises female leaders in all sectors including business, academia, government and civil society, from the 21 APEC economies.

Since its first meeting in the Philippines in 1996, it has strived to contribute to women's economic activities as a means to achieve gender equality.

Mrs Wong says New Zealand is often at the vanguard of women's rights.

"In 1893 we led the world as the first country to grant women the right to vote. Today, we have had two women Prime Ministers and women make up 31 per cent of the New Zealand Parliament,'' Mrs Wong says.

"New Zealand can be justifiably proud of this heritage but, although we ranked fifth in the Global Gender Report 2009, there is no room for complacency.

"117 years after winning the right to vote, only 8.6% of directors in public listed companies women. This is a start but there's definitely room for more women to become involved at this level.

"Most countries have around10 per cent of women on boards and only Scandinavian countries such as Norway, which legislate for 40 per cent of women on boards, are doing better.''

Mrs Wong says it is essential to recognise the input and the special skills all New Zealanders bring to the table.

"However, we are making good progress in some areas. Since 2004, women's participation as directors or board members in the public sector has been consistently above 40 percent.''
