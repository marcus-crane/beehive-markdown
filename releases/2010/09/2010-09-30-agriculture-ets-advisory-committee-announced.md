Agriculture Minister David Carter has appointed an eight-member strong Agriculture Emissions Trading Scheme Advisory Committee.

The committee, chaired by former MP Katherine Rich, includes representatives from the pastoral sector, research groups and Maori. 

"This high calibre committee will lend weight to understanding agriculture's role in the Emissions Trading Scheme leading up to its planned implementation in 2015," says Mr Carter.

"There is a vast body of agricultural knowledge amongst farmers, growers and industry. We need to tap into this to ensure New Zealand's response to climate change is both appropriate and achievable. 

"Specifically, the group will advise the Government on technical issues such as emissions factors, measurement and reporting, and the point of obligation," Mr Carter says.

The chair and committee will serve for a two-year period from 1 October.

- Katherine Rich (Chief Executive of the New Zealand Food & Grocery Council; former Member of Parliament for nine years).
