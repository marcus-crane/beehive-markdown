A bill intended to clarify funding of international traveller processing services at new and restarting international airports has passed its first reading in Parliament.

The Airports (Cost Recovery for Processing International Travellers) Bill addresses outstanding funding arrangements agreed with the aviation industry in 2004.

"The Bill builds on the original policy to provide a simple, clear and efficient cost recovery system for passenger clearance services," says Biosecurity Minister David Carter.

"It will enable the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Aviation Security Service and the New Zealand Customs Service to recover the costs associated with providing passenger processing services at new and restarting international airports.

"It will deliver fiscal certainty so that agencies can get the most out of every tax dollar spent.

"The Government is keen to hear industry views and I encourage submissions on this Bill during the select committee stage."

Mr Carter says the Bill addresses the problem that arises when airport companies enter, or exit then re-enter, the market for scheduled international passenger flights to and from New Zealand.

"For new and restarting international airports the Bill will allow costs to be recovered from airport companies for a fixed period of time, after which the funding regime in place for established international airports will apply - biosecurity and customs costs Crown-funded, and aviation security costs charged to airlines.

"The Bill also allows an established international airport to cease operating international services, and then restart within a ‘grace period' of six months without re-triggering cost recovery from airports.

"The current funding regime for established international airports remains unchanged," Mr Carter says.
