Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says more than two thousand people have called the 0800 779997 Government helpline so far.

Maintaining service is essential for people in need and five Work and Income Offices in Canterbury are open today to provide support.

"Work and Income is well prepared to assist anyone needing help as a result of the Canterbury earthquake," says Ms Bennett.

Five Work and Income offices in Christchurch are confirmed safe and will be open from today to provide emergency support to those who need it.

For those who can't or don't want to come in, welfare services are only a phone call away for anyone concerned about their circumstances.

This includes people who have appointments but can't make it in.

"Canterbury people can rest assured all benefits and superannuation payments will continue to be paid without disruption," says Ms Bennett. 

A further four Work and Income and one Child, Youth and Family site will remain closed due to structural damage.

The 68 staff from these sites have been redeployed from those sites to meet any influx of requests for help.

Staff from Work and Income and Child, Youth and Family are also available at the Canterbury Civil Defence Welfare Centres. 

The Government earthquake 0800 77 9997 helpline is operating 24 hours.

More than 2500 people have called the helpline (as at 7am Monday) to receive advice and referrals for other services.

"It has been pretty quiet overnight, with about 16 calls received from midnight until 5am and then a spike of 76 after that," says Ms Bennett.

Work and Income staff have also been calling the 16,000 senior citizens who live alone in the Canterbury area to check if they need help.

So far more than 10,000 seniors have been called by Work and Income staff who volunteered to help.

Those contacted confirmed that they were safe and well, but appreciated the call.

Child, Youth and Family social workers are available to anyone with concerns about child safety. 

"As we move into recovery mode, people are starting to calculate their losses and Work and Income is well prepared to provide assistance," says Ms Bennett.

"Many will require help with household goods and other emergency expenses and that's what we're here to provide," Ms Bennett.

"In some cases, it's possible to deal with requests over the phone, so people should call Work and Income's contact centre on 0800 559 009," says Paula Bennett.
