Social Development Minister Paula Bennett today released a report in Masterton, which provides a unique snapshot of local social services.

Social Services in Masterton: the views of families and whanau was commissioned by the Minister and delivered by the Families Commission.

"When I took office I was astounded to find that no one could tell me what services existed in each area and who used them," says Ms Bennett.

"This report is a snapshot of a typical town in New Zealand, which gives us some real insights into how Masterton families use social services," says Ms Bennett.

The report captures the voices of 400 local families and 33 local providers.

The findings include:

- Social services are rated highly by locals
- Barriers include transport costs and telephone tolls
- Strong preference for community-led and Maori services
- Few overlaps but some gaps in services

"While we often have anecdotal knowledge, nothing beats real evidence and this research can help us in our quest to respond to community needs better," says Ms Bennett.

The findings will aid the work the Government is doing with whanau ora and the Community Response Model.
