Support schemes are assisting Canterbury individuals, employers and community providers affected by the earthquake, says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Since announcing the $7.5 million special Community Response Fund, the Government has met with NGOs to assess the need for grants.

"I'm really impressed Canterbury's family violence agencies have decided to work together to tackle increased domestic violence," says Ms Bennett.

Agencies including Women's Refuge are to work collaboratively to address the sudden increase in violence and funding will help with telephone networking and start up costs.

Grants will also go to a range of providers to pay for accommodation, IT, equipment, blankets, bedding, and translators for new migrants.

"We've also had huge interest from employers keen to take up the subsidy support so they can pay staff and we've already committed close to $120,000," says Ms Bennett.

So far 469 employers have called about the subsidy

Further updates:

- 15,700 elderly people have been contacted out of 18,000 living alone.
- A total of 553 home visits have been made to elderly.
- The Government earthquake helpline has received 9,566 calls so far
- So far 1,585 emergency payments have gone to Canterbury people largely for food, clothing and accommodation ($198,045).

"We will continue to offer support to the people of Canterbury who are proving to be incredibly resilient and positive in the face of adversity," says Ms Bennett.
