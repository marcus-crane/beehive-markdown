Labour's employment relations spokesperson has got it wrong again, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

"The Cabinet paper Darien Fenton quoted from in Parliament today referred to policies that Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development advocated be considered as part of the Government's employment law reform package," Ms Wilkinson says.

"Treasury and MED argued we should include the ability to contract out personal grievances, changes to temporary and fixed term contracts and the reintroduction of the youth minimum wage.

"The Government disagreed and no further consideration has been given to those matters.

"Either the member's being mischievous or can't read."
