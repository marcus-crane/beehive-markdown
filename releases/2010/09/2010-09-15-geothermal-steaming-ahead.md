Geothermal electricity generation has increased to the highest level on record, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

The June 2010 quarter energy data is published in the latest edition of the Ministry of Economic Development's *New Zealand Energy Quarterly*. 

"Geothermal is a significant source of electricity generation in New Zealand, and made up over 13 per cent of total generation in the June quarter," Mr Brownlee said. 

"With a number of new geothermal projects in the pipeline, this will continue to grow."

Other highlights in this quarter's *New Zealand Energy Quarterly* include:

- renewable generation accounted for 73 per cent of New Zealand's total electricity generation for the quarter

<!--THE END-->

- gas displaced coal for electricity generation

<!--THE END-->

- the highest level on record of sub-bituminous coal production was achieved

<!--THE END-->

- petrol demand decreased two per cent and diesel demand decreased five per cent, in line with normal seasonal variations

<!--THE END-->

- the high level of geothermal electricity generation and a preference for gas over coal in electricity generation saw electricity emissions drop to their lowest level since 2000

<!--THE END-->

- the residential gas price has decreased six per cent over six months due to a big price cut from Genesis

The *New Zealand Energy Quarterly* presents quarterly statistics on the supply of major fuels, electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions, and prices to the end of March 2010.
