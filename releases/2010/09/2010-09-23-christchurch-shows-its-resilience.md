The people of Canterbury have shown remarkable resilience as they get on with the business of rebuilding says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Ms Bennett again visited Christchurch residents, community groups and employers yesterday and today to check on the changing needs and challenges they are facing.

"I'm just so impressed with the way Cantabrians are making every effort to transcend what is a very difficult situation," says Ms Bennett.

"But while some are bouncing back quickly, others face a long haul back to situation normal," says Ms Bennett.

In recognition of this, the Government is deferring changes for beneficiaries due to start next week, for those living in Canterbury to provide some breathing space.

The Social Security (New Work Tests, Incentives and Obligations) Act comes into effect on September 27.

"We've made changes to the legislation to defer the requirement for people to re-apply for their benefit after a year," says Ms Bennett.

Work and Income will also defer the implementation of the work test for sole parents and the requirement for people accessing multiple hardship payments to complete budgeting activities, using discretion within the Social Security Act.

‘This means beneficiaries in Canterbury will not face new work tests until the first of March next year," says Ms Bennett.

To date Work and Income has paid out over half a million dollars in emergency payments for families and individuals in Canterbury.

That equates to 3,894 payments totalling $547,212.

Demand for the Government's Earthquake Subsidy Scheme has seen 1,980 employers request the wage subsidy for 9,054 employees.

"The Government is totally committed to supporting businesses and we are prepared to extend the scheme if needed," says Ms Bennett.

More than $7.9 million has been committed through the Earthquake Support Subsidy so far.
