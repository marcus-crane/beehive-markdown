All Blacks and other high profile Cantabrians are providing messages of support and advice about where to go for help to people affected by the Canterbury earthquake.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says it's great some of New Zealand's sporting heroes are supporting quake victims through this tough time.

"The public messages focus on dealing with stress and anxiety, and how to help family and neighbours. They refer people to the Government help line, website or their GP.

A number of non-government organisations are also bringing in extra staff involved in counselling and other support services for Christchurch, as people come to terms with the earthquake's impact on their lives.

"Four of Canterbury's All Blacks, Richie McCaw, Brad Thorn, Kieran Read and Corey Flynn, will be voicing their support in public health advertisements starting today. Other high profile Cantabrians will appear as the campaign progresses.

"Many people will need reassurance and practical advice as to what to do and where to go to get help. Our messages are encouraging people to keep talking to family and friends, reminding people about the services that are available, and where to get support from.

The six-week campaign is being funded by the Ministry of Health.

The Government's earthquake helpline is 0800 779 997, and staff can connect quake-affected residents with the appropriate support.
