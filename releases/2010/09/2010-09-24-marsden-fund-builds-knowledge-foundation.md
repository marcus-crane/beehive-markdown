Science as a key driver of our economic growth and social development is highlighted by this year's Marsden Fund grants announced today, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp says.

"The Marsden Fund supports New Zealand's elite researchers to do work that will benefit New Zealand and expand our knowledge of the world," he said.

"Through the Marsden Fund the Government is putting $60 million into more than 100 research projects being carried out by many of New Zealand's research leaders.

"From improving our understanding of earthquakes to improving the accuracy of the testimony of children, to using computers to help people rehabilitate from strokes, these ground-breaking projects can deliver economic, environmental, social and health benefits for New Zealand," Dr Mapp said.

"This sort of investigator-driven research into new areas of knowledge can also lead to unexpected, internationally-significant discoveries that can have commercial benefits."

An example of this is a Marsden-funded Auckland University research project into the development of chicken embryos that resulted in a new wound healing gel now being commercialised by CoDa Therapeutics.

"Through the Marsden Fund the Government is also helping develop the skills and knowledge of our most talented researchers.

"For example, almost a third of the awards are for projects run by outstanding early-career researchers.  This will encourage them to continue their careers in New Zealand," Dr Mapp said.

"The Marsden Fund delivers many benefits. That is why this Government has increased investment in it.  In 2009 we increased the investment by $36 million over four years."
