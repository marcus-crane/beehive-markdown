Education Minister Anne Tolley has today officially opened the new Mission Heights Early Learning Centre in Manukau City.

The new centre, which was built with the support of $1.36 million in Government funding, will provide an additional 50 ECE places in an area of high need.

"The Government is committed to high-quality early childhood education and increasing participation for those children who are under-represented in ECE," says Mrs Tolley.

"This new centre opens up opportunities for children and families who have been missing out.

"It builds on the initial success of the Counties-Manukau Participation Project, as we target Maori and Pasifika children, and children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, who we know are the most likely to benefit from ECE.

"We want to give every young New Zealander the best possible start in life, which is why the Government is committing $1.3 billion to early childhood education in the coming year."
