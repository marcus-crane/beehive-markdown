A bill that strengthens auditor regulation was introduced to Parliament today by Commerce Minister Simon Power.

The Auditor Regulation and External Reporting Bill will require the Institute of Chartered Accountants to regulate auditors as a specialist profession, rather than as chartered accountants.

Currently, any chartered accountant holding a Certificate of Public Practice can carry out audits as long as they think they are competent to do so, and no audit-related restrictions have been placed on them.

The bill also provides for the proposed Financial Markets Authority to be responsible for auditor oversight in monitoring and reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of the institute's regulatory systems.

"A report by the Registrar of Companies identified that audit failure was a contributing factor in the finance company collapses," Mr Power said.

"That shows that self-regulation alone was not working and independent oversight was needed.

"This bill is an integral part of the Government's programme to strengthen investor protection.

"Mum and dad investors need to be confident that financial reports provide unbiased, transparent and relevant information and a rigorous independent audit is an essential part of that.

"The changes also bring New Zealand's regime into line with international norms."

The new licensing regime will apply only to major audits, such as the audits of issuers and large companies. It will not impact on audits of small and medium-sized companies and non-profit entities.

The bill also provides for consolidating accounting and auditing standards setting within a reconstituted Accounting Standards Review Board, to be called the External Reporting Board XRB for better service delivery coordination.

Mr Power hopes to have the bill enacted by May next year and for the XRB to commence operations on 1 July next year.

The auditor regulation changes will come into force on a date to be agreed with the FMA and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
