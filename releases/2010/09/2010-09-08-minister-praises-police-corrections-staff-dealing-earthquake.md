Police and Corrections staff have done themselves proud with their work following the Christchurch earthquake, some putting personal problems aside in the line of duty, Police and Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

 "I am incredibly impressed and humbled by the dedication of Police and Corrections staff I have visited in Christchurch today," Ms Collins says. "Staff whose houses were totalled in the earthquake have turned up to work, and others have rung in offering to cancel leave to help.

"Both Police and Corrections have been inundated with offers of help from staff around the country. Unrostered staff have shown up to work, and others have continued working despite their own adverse circumstances.

"It's at trying times like these that the professionalism and dedication to duty of our Police and Corrections officers really shines through. I am grateful to you all - you have done a fantastic job," she says.

Eighty Police from Auckland were sent to Christchurch on the day of the quake - they have now been replaced with 20 staff from Wellington, who went straight into a 12 hour night last night. They will in turn be replaced with staff from other districts in coming days.

"One of the vital Police tasks has been managing restricted zones and cordons, to ensure public safety. We are also grateful for the support of Defence with this task - 80 Defence staff per shift have helped with cordons, and the army has provided catering and transport assistance."

Corrections staff have also been busy - probation officers have been getting out and about checking on offenders. Thirty staff from Auckland and Otago prisons have gone to Christchurch to help with the transfer of prisoners from Christchurch Mens and Womens prisons.

"These temporary relocations were necessary because of safety issues related to lack of water pressure and earthquake damage," Ms Collins says. "All prisoners from Christchurch Womens have now been shifted to Auckland. Yesterday 90 prisoners from Christchurch Mens were shifted to Otago, and by the end of today more than 300 prisoners are expected to have been moved to North Island prisons by RNZAF Hercules aircraft.

"The prisoner relocations will allow some staff to take time to be with their families and deal with any earthquake impacts on their homes. They richly deserve that opportunity," Ms Collins says.
