Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia has today released the Code of Funding Practice.

The Code will assist government agencies and community organisations to build better funding arrangements through working together to address issues such as managing risk and negotiations, high compliance costs, accountability, shared outcomes, monitoring and reporting.

"I'm delighted that we have this Code which can assist government agencies and non-profit organisations to work together when using public funds to benefit communities.

"My interest has always been on achieving better outcomes - and I am sure that this Code will help to keep the focus on making that difference evident.

"We are keen to try new ways of delivering funding and contracting with service providers so that families, whanau and communities reap the benefit," says Mrs Turia.

"The Code contains criteria and good practice examples including the need for respect, transparency, open communication, flexibility and accountability and how these can be put into practice."

The Code of Funding Practice complements the Treasury Contracting Guidelines and the Office of the Auditor-General's Good Practice Guide for funding arrangements.

"I would particularly like to thank all the contributors from the community and voluntary sector and government agencies that helped develop the Code."

"Although the Code is voluntary I will be talking with my Ministerial colleagues to encourage them to read it and ensure their agencies use it," says Mrs Turia.
