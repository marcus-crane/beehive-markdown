The launch of the first of the Matangi Trains on Thursday September 9 has been welcomed by the Acting Minister for Disability Issues Pansy Wong.

Mrs Wong says the trains are designed to be accessible to and make life easier for people with a disability.

"The trains are about giving people with a disability the sort of access other people take for granted.

"The design was finalised following a robust consultation period by the Greater Wellington Regional Council in late 2008 ensuring the new train would meet the needs of disabled people.''

Mrs Wong says the multi-function low floor area had been designed to accommodate wheelchairs and mobility scooters and had under floor ramps which folded out on to the platform. There is also a hearing loop for the hearing impaired.

"The Government aims to make a difference for people with a disability and I think these trains will go a long way towards helping us achieve that.

"We want to ensure disabled people can live in their own homes and access their community.

"We need to make sure every New Zealander has the opportunity to reach their potential.''

Mrs Wong says 48 new electric trains are being built for Metlink, Greater Wellington's public transport network. The entire fleet is expected to be operating by the end of 2011.
