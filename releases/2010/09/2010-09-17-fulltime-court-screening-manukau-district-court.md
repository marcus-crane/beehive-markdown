Minister for Courts Georgina te Heuheu has announced that everyone entering the Manukau District Court will be subject to fulltime security screening as from today.

This comes two weeks after fulltime electronic screening was rolled out at the Auckland District Court.

"The screening has been made available through the $9 million allocated in Budget 2009 and includes equipment and extra personnel," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"The screening at the Auckland District Court has been well received by court attendees and those working at the courts including judges and lawyers."

"In the first week up to 2,000 people were screened each day and nearly 50 items were temporarily surrendered, including pocket knives, screwdrivers and scissors."

The screening, which requires court attendees to walk through a metal detector and have their bags x-rayed, applies to everyone except judges and uniformed police officers.

Fulltime security screening will be rolled out at the Christchurch courthouse at the beginning of next month.
