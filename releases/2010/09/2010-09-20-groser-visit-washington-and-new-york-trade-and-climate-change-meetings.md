Trade Minister and Minister Responsible for International Climate Change Negotiations, Tim Groser, will meet with senior members of the US Administration and attend an international climate change meeting when he travels to Washington and New York from September 20-25.

"My visit comes at a time of significant progress in relations between New Zealand and the United States.  Both governments are committed to strengthening cooperation, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where we have shared political and economic interests", Mr Groser said.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations are expected to be a focus of Mr Groser's visit, which will include meetings with US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Members of Congress and a coalition of businesses interested in the negotiations.

"The TPP is a new strand in the US-New Zealand relationship.  We are working to make it the key platform for economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region."

Mr Groser will also participate in the Coalition of Services Industries Global Services Summit, where he will join a panel discussion on services trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.  While at the Services Summit, Mr Groser will also meet with Craig Emerson, the new Australian Minister of Trade and Lord Leon Brittan, recently appointed trade adviser to UK Prime Minister David Cameron. 

Following the Washington visit, Mr Groser will travel to New York where he will take part in a select meeting hosted by Mexico's Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa, to prepare for the next major international climate change meeting in Cancun in December.

"This meeting is well-timed to support the Mexican presidency in its preparation for the December meeting, and give the political direction needed to secure a positive outcome from the meeting".

In New York, Mr Groser will also meet high-level New Zealand trade and business contacts in the areas of climate change, environment and mobile technologies, to develop relationships and opportunities for New Zealand companies.
