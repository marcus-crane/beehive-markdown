Cantabrians whose chimneys have been significantly damaged by the recent earthquake will be able to replace their old log burners or open fires with a new, efficient heater and the cost will be covered under their claim to the Earthquake Commission, Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"Our first priority is to help people get their houses back to normal and ensure they have the basics they need, including heating," Mr Brownlee said.

"But we have an opportunity here to fix old, inefficient heaters that contribute to Christchurch's air quality issues, so we are offering those affected families a new, efficient heater and covering the cost through the Earthquake Commission.

"It's more cost effective in most cases to decommission or remove a damaged chimney and install an efficient heater than it is to repair or rebuild it.  And it is a bonus for the people of Canterbury if we can actually improve houses in the clean up process.

"This is a voluntary programme - homeowners are entitled to have their chimneys fixed if they don't wish to participate in the scheme - however I expect it will prove popular with many Cantabrians who've suffered chimney damage in the earthquake," Mr Brownlee said.
