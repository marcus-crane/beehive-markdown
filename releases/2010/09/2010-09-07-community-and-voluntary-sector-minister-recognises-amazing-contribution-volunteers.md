Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Tariana Turia, has expressed her heartfelt appreciation to the volunteers, friends and families who have so willingly expressed the hand of manaakitanga in supporting the communities of Otautahi.

"People throughout Canterbury have shown when the going gets tough, the tough get going - putting aside their anxieties and fear, to give their time, skills and energies to others" said Mrs Turia.

"It has been wonderful to see the way people have stepped up to the mark, in their own way.  Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu has set up their facebook page to provide the space for whanau to send messages of support; youth groups have also used Facebook to get mobilised - setting up work teams to clear the streets of silt and rubble".

"And of course the amazing contribution of volunteers in formally organised groupings such as Civil Defence Centres, the Welfare Centres, and the Red Cross has been seen in the long hours of dedicated efforts".

Mrs Turia was particularly enthusiastic about the local time-banking scheme in Lyttelton.  Ten percent of Lytteltonians have signed up to the challenge of checking on the elderly, providing drinking water, helping the Fire Brigade and creating that necessary central space for people to come together.

"Time Banking is a wonderful concept that grows self-help by trading skills in a community. Members of a Time Bank share their skills with other members within the community and are given time credits for the work they do. They can then "cash-in" the credits they gain to get the services and support they need".

"This is a great example of community resilience and the generosity of spirit that helps everyone to get through the trauma of events as they have unfolded, in the wake of the Otautahi earthquake" said Mrs Turia.
