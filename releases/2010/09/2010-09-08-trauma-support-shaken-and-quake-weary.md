Minister for Social Development, Paula Bennett has pledged $2.5 Million for trauma counselling to support Canterbury's shaken and quake weary residents.

"We're on day five now and it's clear people are tired and feeling the effects of Saturday's earthquake, so we're making help available," says Ms Bennett.

"Children and adults alike have been deeply affected by the quake and the equally traumatic aftershocks," says Ms Bennett.

"Many have lost homes and livelihoods and this free support is about giving them the tools they need to cope with this loss and start again," says Ms Bennett.

Organisations are currently increasing their capacity and an additional 34 counsellors will be on the ground from today. This is just the beginning. 

The additional counsellors will come from a wider network of providers including Relationship Services, Salvation Army and Victim Support.

"The likely demand for this support and the intensity of the support needed is only starting to emerge," says Ms Bennett.

"But this government is committed to providing Cantabrians with the help they need to get back on their feet," says Ms Bennett.
