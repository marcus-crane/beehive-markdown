Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced the delegations for new Associate Education Minister, Rodney Hide.

"Mr Hide will have responsibility for special education, independent schools and possible Public Private Partnerships for building and maintaining some new school property," says Mrs Tolley.

"I look forward to working with Mr Hide as we give every single young New Zealander the opportunity to reach their potential."

Rodney Hide says he welcomes the opportunity to work in education.

"I am especially looking forward to supporting the Education Minister, who is working hard putting the interests of all students first and foremost," says Mr Hide.
