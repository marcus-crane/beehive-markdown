This past year has seen primary sector innovation receive its biggest funding injection in decades thanks to the Government's Primary Growth Partnership (PGP), says Agriculture and Forestry Minister David Carter.

Speaking on the first anniversary of the innovation fund, Mr Carter said the Government has so far committed $164 million to a total government-industry spend of $368 million.

"This is concrete proof of the Government's drive to lift economic growth through investment in primary sector innovation," says Mr Carter.

"When the PGP was launched in September last year, the aim was to transform great ideas into research, development and ultimately products, jobs and growth.

"The calibre of the five partnerships announced is testament to this goal. They have all come through a robust approval process and every New Zealander stands to gain as the economic spin-offs from these programmes will be significant.

"Thanks to the collaborative government-industry approach for the PGP, we have relevant projects underway in our dairy, sheep and beef, wool, forestry, and arable sectors.

"The investment of $368 million so far is an outstanding start to the Primary Growth Partnership initiative, and with more business cases coming forward, we are now realising the full benefits of this collaborative commitment to research and innovation," Mr Carter says.
