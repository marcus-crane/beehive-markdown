Police Minister Judith Collins has this morning officially commissioned Lady Elizabeth IV, the Wellington Police Maritime Unit's new state-of-the-art vessel.

The $3.5 million catamaran was built in Whanganui by Q West Builders and replaces the 21 year-old Lady Liz III, which is well past her use-by date.

"The Lady Liz IV gives the Wellington Police Maritime Unit a capability never seen before in the Capital. Police will have vastly improved capacity to save lives at sea, and to apprehend offenders," Ms Collins says.

The new vessel is equipped to allow Police and other Government agencies like Customs and Fisheries to intercept and board other vessels at sea.

"Lady Liz IV can zip across the water at between 27 and 32 knots, enabling her to reach victims or intercept vessels much faster. She can act as a mobile Police station if necessary. She can generate her own power and drinking water, and has food supplies for a full crew for a week, allowing her to stay at sea for extended periods as required.

"This provides a huge capability improvement for the Wellington Police Maritime Unit - Lady Liz IV has a range of 450 nautical miles, covering an area including the Marlborough Sounds, Wairarapa Coastline, Kapiti Coast, Tasman Bay, Whanganui, Castle Point and Kaikoura.

"Lady Liz IV continues the long and proud history of service by Lady Liz vessels in the Capital. I am delighted to commission her, and I'm sure she will extend the Lady Liz tradition of sterling service," Ms Collins says.
