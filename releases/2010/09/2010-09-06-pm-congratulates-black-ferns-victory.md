Prime Minister John Key today congratulated the Black Ferns on their achievement in winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive women's Rugby World Cup title.

The Black Ferns clinched victory over England earlier this morning 13-10 at Twickenham.

"The Black Ferns have won the last three women's Rugby World Cup tournaments, and winning a fourth title is unprecedented.

"This is a huge achievement for the Black Ferns team, and New Zealand rugby," says Mr Key.

"I'm sure all New Zealanders will join me in congratulating the team.  This shows the strength of women's rugby in New Zealand.

"I will be writing to coach Brian Evans, captain Melissa Ruscoe, and the team on behalf of the Government to offer our congratulations and best wishes."
