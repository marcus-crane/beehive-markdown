Two kiwi eggs that survived the Canterbury earthquake in their incubator at Christchurch's Willowbank Wildlife Reserve are getting ready to hatch, right as New Zealanders prepare to celebrate Conservation Week, says Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson.

"One of the rowi chicks has already been nicknamed Richter and could emerge from its shell anytime between now and Sunday.

"These new arrivals will no doubt bring a welcome smile to the faces of so many people who need it after a torrid week," Ms Wilkinson says.

"It's also perfect timing as we gear up for Conservation Week, which kicks off on Sunday.

"Over 150 community events are being hosted all over the country to encourage New Zealanders to get involved in conservation.

"On Sunday Auckland Zoo will be hosting a family day; while in Wellington there will be an opportunity to swap your worst weed for a native plant.

"At the same time there's a tree planting planned at Kaiteriteri in Abel Tasman National Park and the Motu Kiwi Creche is having a working bee in Gisborne.

"New Zealanders love their country and Conservation Week provides mountains of opportunities to learn more about our natural heritage and take part in conservation projects.

"I would encourage everyone to take part in a local event over the next week."
