New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Niue will be businessman and former MP Mark Blumsky, who is currently involved in tourism development work on the island, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1974, which adds a special bond to a important relationship founded on strong personal links and shared historical ties," Mr McCully said.

"New Zealand and Niue are working closely together to help realise the island's full tourism potential, and in recent months Mr Blumsky has been leading the industry development project that was agreed as part of New Zealand's assistance programme for Niue."

Mr Blumsky has a strong business development background and is currently director of the Capital Development Agency.

He was a Member of Parliament from 2005-2008, and Wellington Mayor from 1995-2001, and has held a number of directorships, including the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, Positively Wellington Tourism, Wellington International Airport, and Incubators New Zealand.
