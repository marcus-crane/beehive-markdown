Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Telecom and the Crown for the 111 service.

The Government initiated an inquiry into 111 emergency calling service following disruptions to the service earlier this year.  Development of the MOU with Telecom is an important step towards improved governance of the service.

"The focus of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is on the reliability of the 111 service.  It brings together the main elements of Telecom's 111 roles in a single overall agreement.  It clarifies Telecom's responsibilities and provides for greater transparency of Telecom's performance," says Mr Joyce. 

"The Government will have increased scrutiny over Telecom's management documentation for the 111 system and Telecom will provide the Government with regular reports on key service measures for 111 calls."

The next step is to determine the long-term governance model for 111 service. This will be developed by the Crown in consultation with emergency service providers, telecommunications industry service providers, and Telecom.

"The MOU is also a good foundation to plan long-term arrangements," says Mr Joyce.  "It provides for improved coordination of planning for the 111 service and sets out a timeframe for a cooperative review of governance of the 111 service by the end of this year."

"It's pleasing Telecom and others in the telecommunications industry have indicated a willingness to work cooperatively in developing a coherent long-term governance solution for 111 service."
