New Zealand made a significant contribution to Allied victory in the Battle of Britain, Germany's first major defeat in the Second World War, Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins says.

Today is the 70th Anniversary of Battle of Britain Day, when the Royal Air Force defeated the German air force, the Luftwaffe, over English skies.

"New Zealanders made up the second largest number of foreign aircrew involved in the Battle of Britain, and Air Vice-Marshal Sir Keith Park, a New Zealander, was responsible for the fighter defence of London and southeast England.  His leadership and tactical brilliance was central to Britain winning the battle," Ms Collins says.

"Today we recognise the service of 127 New Zealanders who fought in the RAF during the Battle of Britain.  We honour the 20 Kiwi airmen who lost their lives, and we are grateful for the sacrifice made by all as they fought successfully to prevent German victory."

Germany and her allies had successfully occupied several countries in Europe during the early months of the Second World War, and Britain stood virtually alone to face the German attack.  They launched their aerial assault in July 1940, and continued to bomb British cities throughout the war.

 "New Zealanders who fought in the Battle of Britain were up against a deadly foe. Our pilots and air gunners in the RAF Fighter Command faced an enemy with nearly four times the number of aircraft, and they resisted daily attacks on Britain for months on end."
