Health Minister Tony Ryall today thanked the hundreds of Canterbury health workers who spent the weekend treating and caring for the earthquake struck people of Canterbury and those staff who are continuing the work this week.

"I know that many staff had their own homes damaged by Saturday morning's earthquake - some quite badly - but they put patients' needs - and the needs of Canterbury people - ahead of their own and went in to work like the professionals they are."  

"Today people throughout the health sector from primary GP clinics to Christchurch hospital and everything in between - are back at work even though they too will have suffered the impact of one of New Zealand's worst earthquakes," Mr Ryall said.

"It's been heartening to see how all health services have pulled together to support each other and the community - from GPs and nurses in primary care, to public, community and environmental health workers, the aged care sector, all hospitals and pharmacies as well as emergency services and Healthline."

The Health Minister also acknowledged and thanked radiographers and lab staff who cancelled their scheduled strike action at Christchurch hospital to lend a hand.

"Both the Ministry and myself are in regular contact with the local health authorities who are doing a very good job."

Mr Ryall said a medical officer of health and five health protection officers from Wellington flew into Christchurch this morning to assist.  They will be there till Thursday and a team from Auckland is being organised to replace them, should that be required.

Six defence force personnel specialising in environmental health flew from Linton (near Palmerston North) and Whenuapai to Christchurch today to assist.

A water sanitation specialist engineer, contracted to the Ministry of Health has also flown into Christchurch this morning and will be working to support Environment Canterbury with their assessment of damage and remediation work required.

"And other health staff from around the country have offered to relieve Canterbury health workers over the next while," said Mr Ryall, "those offers are being considered."

Mr Ryall asked that people carefully heed public health messages over the next days and weeks including:

- Boil water for three minutes before drinking, brushing teeth or washing/preparing food.
- Use as little water as possible to flush your toilet if you have water.
- Remember hand washing stops diseases spreading.
- Look after each other - keep in touch with families, friends and neighbours and support each other.
- Avoid contact with sewage. Don't gather fish or shellfish in the sea or from Canterbury rivers.
- If you are unwell with a minor injury or illness and need medical assistance call your General Practice or nearest after hours surgery. Please keep the Emergency Department for emergencies only.  If you need an ambulance dial 111.
