Landlords, tenants and others involved in the rental property market need to be aware the Residential Tenancies Amendment Act (RTAA) 2010 will take effect from October 1 2010.

This Act updates legislation that has governed the residential rental market since 1986.

With so many Kiwis choosing to rent their homes it was essential that a solid legislative framework be provided for the rental market says Minister of Housing, Phil Heatley.

Key changes to the Residential Tenancies Act included clearer and fairer process for terminating tenancies, introducing new financial penalties for tenants who harass neighbours and extending the powers of the Tenancy Tribunal.

"We wanted to strike a balance that offers tenants and landlords equal protection under the Act," says Mr Heatley.

Other changes that clarify the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants under the RTAA include amendments to the rules for letting fees, absent landlords, notices to remedy breaches of the Act and unlawful acts.

The Department of Building and Housing will offer a range of advice, information and education services through its website and contact centre, to help its clients get to grips with the RTAA. 

Landlords and tenants with questions about the changes should visit [http://www.dbh.govt.nz/rta-review](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/rta-review) or phone 0800 TENANCY.

The Department is responsible for providing advice, information and education services that help people in the building and housing market to participate with confidence and resolve their disputes in timely and cost-effective ways.
