Health Minister Tony Ryall today expressed sadness at the passing away last night of Taranaki District Health Board Chair John Young ONZM.

"John Young's passing is a great loss. He made a considerable contribution to health services for the people of Taranaki," said Mr Ryall.

"Mr Young contributed significantly to the Taranaki community - he held roles and memberships on many government and professional bodies, including former Chair of Kiwi Co-op Dairies, Director of the New Zealand Dairy Board, and Chair of the Port Taranaki Board, as well as spending almost nine years on the Taranaki District Health Board." 

Mr Young was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) in the New Year's Honour List 2010.

"I would like to express my sympathy to John's family at this sad and difficult time. He will be greatly missed," said Mr Ryall.
