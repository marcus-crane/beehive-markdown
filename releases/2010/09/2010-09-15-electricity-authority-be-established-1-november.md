Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee confirmed today that the Electricity Authority will be established on 1 November 2010.

Mr Brownlee said the Electricity Industry Bill will be passed through its remaining parliamentary stages next week, but the original date of 1 October for establishment of the Electricity Authority was no longer feasible.  

"Since the Canterbury earthquake my priority, and that of the government as a whole, has had to be the region's earthquake recovery effort," Mr Brownlee said. 

Final details that support the establishment of the authority are yet to be progressed.  These include the Electricity Industry (Enforcement) Regulations, the Electricity Industry Code, the Authority Board members, and the authority's budget.  

"Passing the Bill next week but delaying its commencement date until 1 November means we can have orderly implementation of its provisions, in particular the establishment of the Electricity Authority and the new regulations and code governing the operation of the electricity market," Mr Brownlee said.

Establishing the Electricity Authority is one of the measures adopted by the government to improve the performance of the electricity market. 

The authority will be responsible for promoting competition, reliable supply and efficient operation of the electricity market for the long-term benefit of consumers.
