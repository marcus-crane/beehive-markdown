Minister of Commerce, Simon Power, leaves for Australia this afternoon where he will be the first New Zealand Minister to meet members of the new Australian Government.

Mr Power will meet with Minister of Finance and Deregulation Penny Wong, Attorney-General Robert McClelland, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury.

"This trip emphasises the Government's commitment to achieving a single economic market with Australia," Mr Power said.

"This is an excellent opportunity to underscore progress on a number of outcomes identified in last August's Joint Statement of Intent between the two Governments, in particular the continuing harmonisation of the regulatory systems around the broader business environment."

"In the current economic climate it's critical we work together towards a truly single economic market which will benefit both countries by reducing business costs and increasing productivity and innovation."

In addition, Mr Power will take the opportunity to meet with Australian businesses and regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Agency in Sydney, and the Productivity Commission in Melbourne.

"I hope these meetings will provide further insights into how the Australian regulatory environment has evolved to better inform the financial sector reform underway in New Zealand."

He will also visit major economic and financial institutions, as well as legal and consulting firms to seek their views on the financial sector reforms.

Mr Power returns to New Zealand on Thursday.
