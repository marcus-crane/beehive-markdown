Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today confirmed that the Government is committed to tightening up on people other than parents claiming child support for children who have left the family home.

"There have been cases in the media recently where troubled teens have left the family home, completely against the will of their parents, and set up with all sorts of people, supposedly as their carers, who then claim child support," Mr Dunne said.

"Clearly, there have been instances where this has been abused, and parents put in the totally unacceptable situation of having child support demanded of them when they don't even have the fundamental belief that their child is safe, well and cared for.

"I instructed officials to make particular reference in the *Supporting Children* discussion document to this issue, and to look at ways to tighten it up.

"It is a situation that needs to be dealt with in this consultation process, and parents will quite rightly have very strong views on it," he said.
