More five and 12 year old Kiwi children are now free of tooth decay compared to 2007 says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"The Ministry of Health and DHBs have been working hard to fix oral health services for children," says Mr Ryall.

"The latest oral health figures show that our children's dental health has improved greatly over the past two years.  

"Until recently, we had been seeing more severe dental decay in children, especially in the highest needs populations, but that situation is improving."

Mr Peter Dunne, Associate Health Minister with the responsibility for oral health says the Government has so far invested $40 million in new buildings and mobile dental clinics for our children and will be investing a further $80 million over the next two years.  

"To support this investment the Government is spending over $140 million this year on child and adolescent oral health services, which is a 16 per cent increase from last year," says Mr Dunne.

"18 per cent more pre-school children are now enrolled for DHB dental services compared to 2007 - we can attribute some of that increase to the turnaround success of the B4School health check and Well Child/Tamariki Ora programmes."

20,000 more adolescents are accessing free oral health care through their local dentists, which is a 12 per cent increase since 2007.

"This is an excellent effort and showcases private and public systems working together to improve the health of our community," says Mr Ryall.

"There were some obvious problems that needed fixing and we are on our way. The waiting list for enrolled children waiting to see a dental therapist has nearly halved since 2007, which is a significant achievement given the changes the service has been going through in the last two years.  

"These changes will see DHBs focusing on preventing oral disease and not just on drilling and filling.

"Oral health is fundamental to general health and the well-being for everyone.  Research shows that high levels of dental caries in childhood predict greater oral disease levels in adulthood. Therefore promoting good oral health in young people has benefits over a lifetime" Mr Ryall says. 

It is World Oral Health Day on 12 September.
