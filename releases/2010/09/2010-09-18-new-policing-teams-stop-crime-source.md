Neighbourhood Policing Teams will help tackle crime at its source, by preventing wrongdoing before it happens, Police Minister Judith Collins says.

"The first six of 16 Neighbourhood Policing Teams planned for the Counties-Manukau District are already making a real difference in preventing crime.

"Each team usually includes a sergeant and up to six constables, and works with the same vulnerable neighbourhood of 2-3000 people for up to five years. They are highly visible, working at grass-roots level to build good relationships aimed at nipping crime in the bud. They are dedicated to their task - they can only be diverted to other jobs when the need is very high," she says.

Speaking at an event marking the formal launch of Neighbourhood Policing Teams in Counties-Manukau, Ms Collins noted the strong community response to the extra Police presence in the district.

"There's been positive feedback from the Mayor, councillors, business groups and the community. They all welcome the high number of Police on foot patrols in the area and the security this provides.

"Counties-Manukau has traditionally had an unacceptably high crime rate, and the Government is responding - by the end of October, 291 of our promised 300 new Police recruits for the District will be in place.

"As Police Minister, I'm proud that in these tough economic times, this Government has prioritised extra investment in safety and security for the people of this region.

"Neighbourhood Policing Teams are an important part of reducing crime in Counties-Manukau. We aim to roll the Teams out nationally to other high-needs neighbourhoods from 2012," Ms Collins says.
