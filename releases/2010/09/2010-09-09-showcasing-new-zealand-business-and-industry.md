As we mark the milestone of One Year To Go until Rugby World Cup 2011, New Zealand businesses and industries are gearing up to showcase themselves to the world.

Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully says hosting one of the world's biggest sports events gives New Zealand a great opportunity to show the world all the things we do well.

"As a small trading nation dependent on our ability to attract tourists, sell our goods and create partnerships, the chance for the world to notice us must be grabbed with both hands," he said. 

"We're developing a wide-ranging sector showcasing programme which ensures that happens. We're working with New Zealand industries and businesses to build the programme. Industries from food and wine to renewable energy, film, fashion and marine manufacturing have built events to show their innovation and creativity."

Mr McCully says a couple of good examples of industries rising to the challenge are the wine industry and the marine industry.

New Zealand Winegrowers are creating a series of special wine festivals and VIP dinners to fit in with the tournament schedule around the country.

The Marine Industry has moved the Auckland International Boat Show, one of the most recognised boat shows in the Southern Hemisphere, from its usual March dates into the Rugby World Cup tournament window. Next year it will be held from September 15-18 at the new Viaduct Marine Events Centre on the Auckland waterfront.

"This sort of thinking will ensure that once the teams have packed up and gone home, New Zealand continues to benefit from hosting the Rugby World Cup for many years to come."

The REAL New Zealand Showcase programme is being developed by the New Zealand 2011 Office and will be officially launched next month.
