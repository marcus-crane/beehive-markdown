The Minister of Māori Affairs, Hon Dr Pita Sharples, today announced the appointments of Sarah Reeves and Judge Heemi Taumaunu as Judges of the Māori Land Court.

"Sarah Reeves (Te Atiawa) and Judge Taumaunu (Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu) have ample skills and experience to undertake the role of Judge, and they will complement the current Bench of the Māori Land Court," said Dr Sharples.

"Sarah Reeves is an experienced lawyer, primarily in the in-house legal environment, and will bring to the Māori Land Court valuable commercial and property law skills and experience," he said. 

"Judge Taumaunu has held a District Court warrant since January 2004, operating out of the Waitakere District Court. He has had a significant leadership role in the development of the Rangatahi Court, and he presides at the first Rangatahi Court established at Te Poho Rawiri Marae in Gisborne.

"While acting principally as a Māori Land Court Judge, Judge Taumaunu will also continue his work with the Rangatahi (Youth) Court and therefore hold warrants for both the District Court and Māori Land Court.  

"The bond between the people and their whenua is central to all Māori, and the Māori Land Court recognises and supports this," said Dr Sharples.

"I am certain that both will make fine Judges of the Māori Land Court and I congratulate them both on their appointments," he said.
