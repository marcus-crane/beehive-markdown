Agriculture Minister David Carter says he is heartened by the generosity of Canterbury farmers pitching in to help their earthquake-hit neighbours.

Mr Carter visited farms west of Christchurch yesterday where between 100 and 150 farm properties have suffered severe damage in the earthquake.

"In true Kiwi spirit many of these farmers are not only dealing with damage to their own properties, but they're also helping out their neighbours.  Dairy farms are sharing generators to get cows milked and I heard of one shed designed for 400 cows milking 2000 over a 24-hour period.

"It is really heartening to see rural communities pulling together to help each other through such a tough time." 

Mr Carter says he is very grateful for the generosity of Fonterra in donating $1 million to the local Mayoral Relief Fund and supporting dairy farmers in the region.  He also thanked Federated Farmers for coordinating local assistance.

"Many farms are still without electricity, and may be for several days, but our Rural Support Trusts are providing help where they can, particularly in restoring stock water systems.

"It will be some time before the full extent of damage to rural properties is known, but the main focus at this stage is to have essential infrastructure up and running as soon as possible," Mr Carter says.
