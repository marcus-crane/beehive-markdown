The Government has invested $10.8 million in developing new apple and pear varieties, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp announced today.

"The pipfruit industry plays a large part in the food-based science sector. It is crucial to the New Zealand economy," he said.

"The pipfruit industry is New Zealand's second largest exporter of fresh fruit. In 2009 it earned $396m from 68 countries and this investment will further strengthen our commercial advantage over our competitors."

The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology has committed the money over seven years to a research partnership between Prevar Ltd and Plant & Food Research, with Prevar Ltd investing a further $10.8 million.

The Foundation's investment is the second in the pipfruit research consortium, and will fast-track the breeding and commercialisation of new apple and pear varieties.

The pipfruit project is the latest in a series of significant research projects in primary industry with substantial Government support. Others include the Radiata Pine Breeding consortium that seeks to produce high-value products through improved pine genetics; the Zespri consortium that seeks to develop new kiwifruit varieties, and the Ovita consortium that seeks to increase sheep industry competitiveness.

Dr Mapp said the public-private partnership investment model has been particularly successful in the primary sector, where industries are well established and well organised.

"The research consortia model means that industry takes a lead in drawing the solutions they need from the research sector.

"This increases the transfer of knowledge and technology to industry groups which, in turn, increases the level of innovation among research users, and the competitiveness of the industry on a global scale."
