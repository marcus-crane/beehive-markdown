Police Minister Judith Collins today paid tribute to Police who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

Speaking from the Republic of Korea on Police Remembrance Day, Ms Collins commended the bravery and dedication of Police who put themselves on the line to protect the public and rule of law.

Since 1890, 29 Police officers and traffic officers have been slain in the line of duty in New Zealand. Police Remembrance Day is held annually to honour the fallen.

"The Police are our first line of defence against violence, catastrophe and uncertainty. Every day Police officers face danger in the pursuit of a safer community," Ms Collins said.

"Today we remember those Police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while performing their duty.

"My thoughts go out to the families, friends and colleagues of those who have fallen and who will forever live with their loss.

"While we can be thankful that no Police officers were killed in the line of duty in New Zealand in the last 12 months, we must not forget the risks that our Police officers face each day.

"Today we remember those who have fallen, and recognise the efforts of the almost 12,000 Police men and women who are currently serving our community."
