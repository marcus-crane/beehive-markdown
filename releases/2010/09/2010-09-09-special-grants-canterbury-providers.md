Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has announced a special $7.5 million Community Response Fund for social service providers in Canterbury.

"Canterbury's community organisations are doing a great job in incredibly difficult circumstances," says Ms Bennett.

"But they can only do so much with the resources they have," says Ms Bennett.

"We want to ensure that these groups can continue to provide vital social services and cope with increased demand," says Ms Bennett.

The Canterbury earthquake fund will provide one-off grants of between $5,000 and $10,000 to community-based social services in the region.

Funding can be extended to service providers outside of normal providers as long as they are earthquake related and focussed on the well-being of the community.

Administration will also be simplified to speed up the application process. 

"We are cutting the red tape to get resources on the ground as quickly as possible," says Ms Bennett.

"MSD are meeting with Canterbury NGOs now and we are proposing to have the fund available from Monday 13 September," says Ms Bennett.

"The well being of Canterbury residents is a priority for this Government," says Ms Bennett.

"This additional funding will help ensure they are getting the support they need" says Ms Bennett.
