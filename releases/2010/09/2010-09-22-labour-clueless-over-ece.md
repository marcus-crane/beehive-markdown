Education Minister Anne Tolley says Labour MPs should check their facts before misleading the public yet again over early childhood education.

"Sue Moroney claims the Government has tried to hide funding changes," says Mrs Tolley.

"So either she doesn't know or is choosing to ignore the fact that all changes were released as part of Budget Day documents. Whatever the reason, it's not a good look for Labour's spokesperson on this issue.

"If Ms Moroney can be bothered acquainting herself with the facts, the information is available at: [http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010/ise/v2/ise10-v2-pia-educ.pdf](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010/ise/v2/ise10-v2-pia-educ.pdf)

"To further help her, the relevant section is on page 36, row 4.

"These changes will not see services having their funding reduced. This refers to money set aside by the previous government, which was operating under a very different economic environment, for planned future funding increases.

"In fact, we are providing an additional $46.7 million cost adjustment over four years to help providers meet increasing costs.

"Under Labour, there was a cost blow-out in ECE which saw funding treble, while the number of children taking part increased by less than one per cent.

"That's why this Government has to try and control the unsustainable rising cost of ECE, while reprioritising funding to ensure that Maori, Pasifika and children from lower socio economic backgrounds have the chance to benefit from it.

"We are committed to high quality early childhood education, which is why the Government is investing an additional $107 million in ECE in the coming year, bringing the total funding to a massive $1.3 billion.

"But we must make sure that this money is invested wisely, to ensure it benefits as many children as possible, rather than the ‘spend and hope' mentality of the previous Government."
