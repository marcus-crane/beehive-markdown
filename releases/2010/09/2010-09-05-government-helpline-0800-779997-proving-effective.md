Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says more than a thousand people have called the Government's earthquake helpline for assistance.

The **0800 double seven - triple nine - seven** helpline has been operating since 4pm yesterday.

Staff answering calls have provided advice and referrals for 1,070 people affected by yesterday's massive earthquake.

"People are calling for advice on what to do about damage to their homes, to ask if it's safe to travel and people outside of Canterbury are calling to check on family and friends there," says Ms Bennett.

The helpline, coordinated by the Ministry of Social Development's Work and Income service, will run 24 hours a day.

People calling the helpline can get information on income support, housing options, health issues, community assistance, clean-up and how to contact any other services people may need.

"Last night our helpline staff had a call from a frightened elderly woman living alone. Staff went and got her so she could be cared for at the local Civil Defence welfare centre," says Ms Bennett.

The devastation means work places have been compromised and it will take some time before those buildings can be checked. 

In the meantime Work and Income and Child, Youth and Family staff will be operating out of all the Civil Defence welfare centres in Christchurch providing emergency assistance to people.

As soon as the Work and Income and Child, Youth and Family offices have been structurally assessed as safe, those premises will open.

All standard appointments for Work and Income and Child, Youth and Family in Christchurch sites for this week have been cancelled. 

Benefits and superannuation will continue to be paid to people regardless. 

Anyone requiring emergency financial assistance can phone the **Work and Income contact centre 0800 559 009**. 

Child, Youth and Family Duty Social Workers are available to respond to any concerns around child safety. 

People required to attend Family or Youth Court or Family Group Conferences will be contacted personally about arrangements.

"There's been tremendous coordination between agencies and I expect this to continue as we focus on a well managed and responsive recovery effort," said Paula Bennett.
