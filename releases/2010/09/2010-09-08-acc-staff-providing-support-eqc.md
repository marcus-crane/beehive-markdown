Twenty ACC call centre staff have been assigned to support the Earthquake Commission in managing the rush of earthquake claims, ACC Minister Nick Smith announced today.

"The Earthquake Commission's toll free 0800 DAMAGE number has been inundated with calls and extra support was needed," Dr Smith said. "The 20 ACC staff have received training on managing enquires, on how to use EQC's web-based claim forms, and will be manning the phones. Calls will be diverted from the EQC hotline to ACC's call centres.

"ACC call centre staff are ideal for this support role. This is a sensible reallocation of Government resources to support those affected by Canterbury's earthquake. ACC is confident it can maintain its claims services throughout the country while providing assistance to the EQC at this time of need.

"This is an initial response. ACC may have further capacity for claims management support for the EQC and this is being further explored."
