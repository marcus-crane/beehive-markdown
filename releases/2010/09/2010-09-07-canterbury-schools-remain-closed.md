Schools and ECE services in the Christchurch, Waimakariri and Selwyn areas will remain closed until the weekend, Education Minister Anne Tolley has confirmed.

"The Ministry of Education has advised that there are still serious health and safety issues following last weekend's earthquake," says Mrs Tolley.

"There are also reports of further structural damage as a result of last night's aftershocks, which means that schools which have already been inspected will have to be reassessed.

"We want to have all schools and ECE services operating normally as soon as possible, but our first priority must be the safety of students and staff.

"Boards need to be confident that their school is structurally sound, that damage to buildings or grounds has been assessed, that potentially hazardous areas are cordoned off and that a safe supply of clean water can be assured."

The Ministry's emergency call centre is providing ongoing advice to boards and principals on 0800 225580.

Guidelines for parents and teachers on how to help children and young people cope with any potential emotional difficulties have been published on the Ministry's website at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/)

Property inspections will continue this week and further updates will be provided when more information becomes available.
