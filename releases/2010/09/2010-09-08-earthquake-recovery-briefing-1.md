**First steps for property owners**

I've just come from a meeting with the Earthquake Commission, GNS scientists, the insurance industry, and local and central government officials where we discussed how all parties can work together to reach consensus on the re-building of Christchurch from a geo-technical, regulatory and planning point of view. 

This is an epic task and it's clear that leaving repairs and re-building to be managed under existing rules and regulations won't serve the people of Canterbury well.  However, it will take time to come up with solutions.  Our progress in the days ahead will be updated at these briefings.

**Website**

A huge amount of useful information has been generated since Saturday but it's important that people have one place to go for answers to their questions, and to ask questions. 

Today we've launched a website that will centralise all information on the quake - both the immediate civil defence actions and recovery operations I'm overseeing.  The site is [www.canterburyearthquake.govt.nz](http://www.canterburyearthquake.govt.nz/).  You should head to this site for the latest news on where to seek help and what's being done to help.

**Wage assistance**

As at 1.30pm today the Government's earthquake helpline had received 99 calls from employers interested in the Earthquake Support Subsidy. 

We will know how many employees this will involve once they complete and return their application forms.  Work and Income is confident that most, if not all, of these employers will meet the criteria to access the earthquake support subsidy. 

The first round of approvals will be confirmed with the Christchurch Chamber of Commerce tomorrow and payments released.

**EQC inspections**

I know there are people in suburbs like Bexley, Dallington, Hornby and one or two others who would like to have received a fuller audit of the damage to their properties from Earthquake Commission engineers or someone else. 

 I can tell you that help is on the way, with extra engineers due in the city over the coming days.  The team of EQC will rise to 43 by Friday.  EQC field offices will be progressively opened from Friday, with the intention of having at least 10 offices, each staffed with loss adjustors, estimators, engineers and support staff. 

Assessment of the damage is progressively moving from the broad to the narrow.  We are aware of your plight and assessors are on their way.

**Water repairs**

Watercare has marshalled much-needed resources to come to Christchurch from Auckland and elsewhere.  Hydrotechs, which contracts to Watercare, will drive the three specialist vehicles and five crew to Christchurch, arriving late tomorrow night (Thursday) - a hydroblaster, a vacuum loader and a CCTV truck. 

They will report to City Care at the Bromley Wastewater Treatment Plant and work under City Care's direction.  Accommodation and catering for these crews will be provided at the Burnham Military Camp.  Watercare has offered to provide any other resources that we have available, on an as required basis.

Also, nationwide water services company Drain Surgeons is also sending three vehicles from Auckland - a domestic drain unblocker, a flushing truck and a CCTV van - to complement the vehicles they already have in Christchurch:

I'd also like to acknowledge the water resources from other companies and local bodies that stepped up immediately and are already working with City Care.

**Inland Revenue**

Inland Revenue has pledged to assist Canterbury customers concerned they might have tax or payment issues they need help with, including a disaster response phone line.  Inland Revenue will take a sympathetic and realistic approach with businesses trying to get back on their feet and reopen their doors. 

The Inland Revenue Disaster Response line is 0800 473 566.  There are also moves to give tax credits to individuals and tax deductibility to companies that donate cash to earthquake relief.

**Social services**

We know victims are struggling to cope with the aftermath.  As you may have heard, the Minister for Social Development, Paula Bennett, has secured $2.5 million extra funding to bring in trauma counsellors from around the country. 

We will have 34 extra counsellors by today.  That number will continue to grow as we fly more in. Relationship Services, Salvation Army and Victim Support are the main agencies the government is dealing with.  Earthquake victims can phone 0800 RELATE or the government helpline 0800 779 997.

**ACC assistance**

ACC has assigned 20 call centre staff to support the Earthquake Commission in managing the rush of earthquake claims.  The Earthquake Commission's toll free 0800 DAMAGE number has been inundated with calls and extra support was needed.
