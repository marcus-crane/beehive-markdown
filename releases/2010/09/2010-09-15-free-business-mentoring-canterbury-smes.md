Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee today announced an additional economic support package for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Canterbury region.

"There are more than 300 experienced volunteer business mentors standing by throughout the Canterbury region to provide guidance to small-to-medium businesspeople as they get back on their feet after the quake.

"Business Mentors New Zealand has waived the $100 (plus GST) registration fee for mentoring, so if you're struggling to get momentum in the wake of the earthquake I encourage you to pick up the phone and seek help," Mr Brownlee said.

The months ahead will potentially be the toughest many business people had experienced, Mr Brownlee said.

"It is important that businesspeople know they are not alone and that experienced help is at hand."

**About Business Mentors NZ**

Business Mentors New Zealand was established in 1991. It is funded largely by patrons from the private sector, with additional support from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.  It provides a voluntary mentoring service to businesses that have fewer than 25 staff.

Business Mentors NZ currently has a pool of over 1,600 mentors throughout New Zealand. Mentors are volunteers and are not paid for their time, although they are reimbursed for expenses. One-on-one mentoring offers the most practical assistance to the development and growth of the small business sector in New Zealand.
