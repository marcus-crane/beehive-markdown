Courts Minister Georgina te Heuheu today unveiled two pou installed in the atrium of the North Shore District Court. 

The four metre tall pou were commissioned by the Ministry of Justice and gifted to the court by inmates at Paremoremo Prison who had participated in a carving programme. 

The programme was developed as part of a Department of Corrections initiative focussing on positive steps towards prisoner rehabilitation and release.

"These pou reflect New Zealand's unique bicultural make up," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"The skill and talent of the carvers, who I have yet to thank, has produced a superb expression of Māori culture, which is central to this court and our wider justice system." 

"The placement of the pou in the atrium of the court reflects this," Mrs te Heuheu said.

An increasing number of buildings around the North Shore including libraries and schools have been the recipients of artwork created by inmates.
