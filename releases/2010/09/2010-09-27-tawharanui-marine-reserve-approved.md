A new 400 hectare marine reserve is to be established in the Rodney district after a successful application by the Auckland Regional Council, Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson and Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Phil Heatley announced today.

"Tāwharanui is a remarkable coastal area and is renowned for its beauty and unique geology. It's incredibly popular for swimming and snorkelling," says Ms Wilkinson.

"The diversity of fish and other marine life, along with extensive reefs, also make it an ideal site for scientific research.

"Tawharanui will become New Zealand's 34th marine reserve, 35 years on since the first reserve was established at Cape Rodney."

The approximately 400ha reserve will replace the Tāwharanui Marine Park. The boundaries will be slightly different, with the new reserve to be approximately 18ha larger than the existing park.

The area has been a no-take fishing zone since the marine park was established in 1981.

Mr Heatley says the site was deserving of reserve status.

"Tawharanui is a fantastic site and after working my way through the application it was clear that it met the criteria for a marine reserve."

Once a survey plan has been carried out, a recommendation will be made to the Governor-General for an Order in Council to formalise the creation of the new marine reserve.
