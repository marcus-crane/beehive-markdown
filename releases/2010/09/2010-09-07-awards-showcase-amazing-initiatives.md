Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is congratulating the recipients of the Dynamic Community Learning Awards 2010.

**Circus Kumarani** from Dargaville have been recognised for their circus skills classes that help build confidence and break down barriers to learning for disabled people.

"I have seen first hand the innovative social arts model Circus Kumarani uses and was inspired by their commitment to Northland and the work they do with youth."

**Flax Roots Whanau** from Rawene in the Hokianga have been recognised for the training they provide in low budget documentary film making which has led to employment opportunities and the creation of the annual Short Film Festival in Rawene.

"Flax Roots Whanau has a strong community based tikanga component that has had extremely positive social and economic impacts for the Hokianga community."

Mrs Turia says the awards celebrate community learning and demonstrate the quality of education programmes that help strengthen communities.

"The awards recognise excellence, innovation and the excitement that comes from adult and community education."

"One of the criteria of the awards is that the initiatives help to promote active citizenship and strengthen the whanau and community and both winning initiatives clearly demonstrate this," says Mrs Turia.

"We all know that our lives are made immeasurably better by the people around us who use their diverse knowledge, skills and capabilities to make a difference."
