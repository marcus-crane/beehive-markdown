Justice Minister Simon Power and Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the 16 members of the new Immigration and Protection Tribunal.

The independent tribunal is being established under the Immigration Act 2009 to consider all immigration, deportation, refugee, and protection appeals in New Zealand. 

It will be supported by the Ministry of Justice and will commence on 29 November.

"The tribunal has a critical role to play in New Zealand fulfilling its international obligations and it will maintain and build on the very strong reputation of the existing appeal bodies. It also consolidates and streamlines the immigration appeal process,'' Dr Coleman said.

Currently, immigration appeals are heard by four separate appeal bodies: the Removal Review Authority (RRA), the Residence Review Board (RRB), the Refugee Status Appeals Authority (RSAA), and the Deportation Review Tribunal (DRT). 

The members of the tribunal are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, in consultation with the Minister of Immigration, for a term not exceeding five years.

Members must be lawyers who have held a practising certificate for at least five years or have other equivalent or appropriate experience. 

"The 16 members appointed bring a high level of expertise and experience in immigration law," Mr Power said.

Of the 16, Allan Mackey, David Plunkett, Melissa Poole and Martin Treadwell have been designated as deputy chairs.

Judge Bill Hastings was appointed as chair earlier this year.
