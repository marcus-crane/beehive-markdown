Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed Transpower's announcement of a new smart grid project to help relieve pressure on the upper North Island electricity system at times of high demand.

"This will provide some much-needed headroom in the region's electricity system," Mr Brownlee said.

"I'm encouraged to see Transpower and businesses working together to find innovative ways to manage demand pressures and to develop the transmission grid cost-effectively."

The project will use intelligent smart grid technology, which allows electricity supply to participating businesses to be adjusted remotely, under agreed conditions.

"This technology can be quick and cost-effective, and it heralds an important step towards how electricity demand might be managed in the future," Mr Brownlee said.

"Through the use of smart technology, New Zealand domestic consumers will in the future be able to have greater control over their electricity usage at any given point in time.  This project involves the use of technology that will help enable such applications."
