Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says a favourable review of his Ministry's performance is a credit to the Chief Executive and all the staff.

"A government review panel has found that Te Puni Kokiri's delivery on key priorities, as well as its core business, has overall been of a high standard. That is a great result, given the range of tasks that Te Puni Kokiri is asked to do," said Dr Sharples.

"The review notes that Te Puni Kokiri has responsibility to advise on whole of government interests, the full range of policy functions, a network of regional offices and satellite units. It is also engaged in many inter-agency exercises, works to a number of ministers and has many stakeholders.

"Te Puni Kokiri is like a mini-government, in fact. These days in Aotearoa, every issue is a Maori issue - across the whole of society, the economy, the environment, national development and international relations.

"Te Puni Kokiri and its predecessors have come in for unfair criticism in the past. I know, because I used to be a critic. The review refers to steady improvement and impressive leadership, and as Minister, I see the work that Te Puni Kokiri does behind the scenes, and the quality of the advice I get every day on every subject before the Cabinet.

"Thanks to Te Puni Kokiri, I go into meetings well-briefed, to advocate for Maori in the best interests of the country.

"I think this is a day for all Maori to pause and acknowledge the work of Te Puni Kokiri, whose management and staff maintain their professionalism as employees of the Crown without losing their passion and commitment for Maori development," said Dr Sharples.
