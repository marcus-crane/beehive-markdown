Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today confirmed that Inland Revenue will offer Southland and South Otago taxpayers its usual adverse event assistance as the area recovers from the impact of brutal snow storms. 

"In particular, I have instructed Inland Revenue to show discretion on late income equalisation deposits and early withdrawals for farmers." Mr Dunne said.

"As we are doing with the Canterbury earthquake situation, we are again looking to have Inland Revenue show some flexibility when people have issues with late filing and payment of tax because of this situation," he said.

"It is about looking to have Inland Revenue work with a local community that is under stress because of natural disaster and recognise that they have a lot on their plate right now.

"Where possible, Inland Revenue will use its discretion to ease the immediate tax burden while farmers get back on their feet," Mr Dunne said.

Further details will be available in Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz/) next week.
