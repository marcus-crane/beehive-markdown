Two bills that are critical to rebuilding investor confidence in New Zealand's financial markets passed their first reading in Parliament today.

They are the Financial Markets (Regulators and KiwiSaver) Bill and the Auditor Regulation and External Reporting Bill.

The Financial Markets (Regulators and KiwiSaver) Bill establishes a new super regulator for financial markets by consolidating the functions currently fragmented across the Securities Commission, the Ministry of Economic Development, including the Government Actuary, and the NZX.

The FMA will also have significant new powers including the ability to enforce duties of issuers, directors, auditors, trustees and others involved in financial markets when it's in the public interest to do so, and the Government will have the ability to make regulations preventing products from being structured to avoid being supervised by the FMA.

"In recent years, confidence in the financial sector has been damaged by a large number of serious corporate collapses, particularly the 61 finance industry failures since 2006, putting at risk around $8.5 billion of investors' money," Mr Power said.

"I see the FMA with its culture of visible, proactive, and timely enforcement as being critical to rebuilding that confidence."

The bill also strengthens the management of KiwiSaver schemes by making fund managers, rather than trustees, primarily responsible for the accuracy of their prospectus, investment statement, and advertisements.

The changes will also require trustees to be responsible for supervising managers, and allows regulations to be drafted to require retail funds to report periodically, as the default funds currently do.

A discussion document on the framework for periodic reporting is expected to be released for public feedback shortly.

The Auditor Regulation and External Reporting Bill will strengthen the regulation of auditors who carry out issuer audits and consolidate the setting of accounting and auditing standards into a new body, the External Reporting Board.

"Self-regulation alone is no longer enough to give investors confidence that financial reports are robust, unbiased, transparent, and accurate."

"I want to emphasise that the Government cannot, and will not, legislate to remove investment risk, because with risk comes return.

"However, the Government can legislate to ensure the financial sector is well regulated to ensure investors can have confidence in it."

The bills have been referred to the Commerce Select Committee for further consideration and are expected to be reported back to Parliament early next year.
