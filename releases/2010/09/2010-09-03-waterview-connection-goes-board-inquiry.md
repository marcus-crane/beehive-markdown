Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the decision to refer the New Zealand Transport Agency's proposal for the Waterview Connection Project to an independent Board of Inquiry under the new national consenting process.

"The Waterview Connection project linking State Highway 20 and State Highway 16 is the largest infrastructure proposal that has ever been lodged under the Resource Management Act," Dr Smith said.

"After receiving the NZTA application and the recommendation from the Environmental Protection Authority, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson and I have decided that an independent Board of Inquiry, chaired by an Environment Court Judge, is the most appropriate way to decide the outcome of this nationally significant roading proposal.

"The Government wants a robust and fair process while ensuring the decision is made in a timely way. We want to prevent the sort of debacle that occurred with the Wellington Inner City Bypass where consents took more than 15 years. That is why we reformed the RMA last year to provide for this streamlined process.

"The major change from the reforms is the consent is processed by the EPA, determined by a Board of Inquiry within nine months and that subsequent appeals of decisions are limited.

"This huge project, incorporating 54 resource consents easily meets the threshold of the national consenting process. It involves 5 km of new state highway including tunnelling and surface roads to complete Auckland's Western Ring Motorway. The Conservation Minister has an important role because the project involves reclamation of tidal saltmarsh and marine space involving the Hauraki Gulf and Motu Manawa (Pollen Island) Marine Reserve."

The Board of Inquiry will be chaired by experienced Environment Court Judge Laurie Newhook, and board members include resource management consultant Ross Dunlop, civil engineer and Franklin District Councillor Susan Jackson, barrister Alan Dormer, and consulting engineer Gerry Te Kapa Coates.
