The Government has appointed an experienced rural emergency coordinator to oversee recovery efforts on quake-damaged farm properties in Canterbury.

Allan Baird will work with the newly-established Regional Rural Recovery Group which is led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and involves representatives of Fonterra, Dairy NZ, Beef & Lamb NZ, Federated Farmers, Irrigation New Zealand, the Insurance Council, banks and several other rural sector organisations.

Mr Baird is a Trustee of the Mid Canterbury Rural Support Trust and has been involved in rural emergency response activities since the 1973 South Canterbury snow storm.

Agriculture Minister David Carter says Mr Baird's appointment will ensure coordination across a wide range of organisations involved in the rural recovery effort.

"This will give the Government a clearer picture of the extent of damage to properties and will help us assess what support farmers need," says Mr Carter.

"Allan Baird comes from a solid rural background and is an experienced operator with adverse events like snow storms and floods."

Mr Carter joined the Prime Minister and several senior Ministers on a visit to rural properties yesterday and said that although damage appeared severe in many places it is too soon to assess the scale because many irrigation pipes and systems are underground.

"The focus has been on getting essential infrastructure on farms up and running.  Now we need to scope the extent of damage so we can determine what assistance may be required," Mr Carter says.
