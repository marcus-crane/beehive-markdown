Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming a social services report that shows that focussing on whanau potential and restoring self belief is the way forward.

The report, Social Services in Masterton, was commissioned by Social Development Minister Paula Bennett and undertaken by the Families Commission.

Mrs Turia says the report reinforces the recommendations made in the Whanau Ora Taskforce Report, which set out options for improving support services for families across New Zealand and led to the implementation of Whanau Ora.

"I believe that whanau have the capability and collective capacity to overcome the challenges they face and will take responsibility if empowered to do so.  This report now confirms that view.

"Whanau Ora will see families less reliant on state agencies and agencies acting as a facilitator rather than a fixer," says Mrs Turia.

"By building on the strengths of the entire whanau, it will require agencies to work together in better and smarter ways to support whanau and families.

"I am confident that Whanau Ora has the potential to help all families, right across New Zealand and am very excited that in October we will be announcing the successful Whanau Ora providers."
