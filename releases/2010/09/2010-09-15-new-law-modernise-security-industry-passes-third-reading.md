A bill to modernise the regulation of the private security industry has passed its third and final reading in Parliament tonight.

Associate Minister of Justice Nathan Guy says the Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Bill will significantly improve the regulation of the private security industry.

"The industry is currently regulated by an Act which is 36 years old and well out of date.

"Private security personnel play an important role in protecting the safety of the public. It can involve dangerous and difficult situations so it is important that people are properly regulated and suitable for the role.

"Under the new law the licensing regime will be extended to a wider range of security roles. Crowd controllers, such as bouncers in pubs and personal guards will require a licence or certificate of approval for the first time.

"A dedicated enforcement body called the Complaints, Investigation and Prosecution Unit will be established to investigate complaints and prosecute offences against the Act. This will be run by the Department of Internal Affairs who have considerable expertise in regulation and enforcement. 

"The Bill also increases penalties for non-compliance and changes the licensing cycle changes from an annual process to every five years, which will reduce unnecessary costs and regulation.

"Overall this bill strikes the right balance between regulatory costs, risks and public safety. "

Following Royal Assent the bill is scheduled to come into force on 1 April 2011, to allow time for a code of conduct and training requirements to be drafted.
