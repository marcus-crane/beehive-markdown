Associate Minister of Education Hon Rodney Hide today expressed sadness at the sudden passing of  Patricia Avenue Specialist School Principal Jill Weidenbohm yesterday.

"The principal of Hamilton's Patricia Avenue School for 12 years, Jill was an outstanding leader and a tireless champion for better outcomes for children with special needs across the education sector," Mr Hide said.

"She was regarded with sincere affection and admiration by her board, staff, students and their families.  She was dedicated to the wellbeing of students and families, regarding everyone as part of her team and was thoughtful in her recognition of their contribution. 

"Jill leaves behind a huge legacy at Patricia Avenue.  Her vision and leadership have contributed to the recognition of Patricia Avenue School as a leading specialist school in New Zealand as acknowledged by the Education Review Office. 

"Jill, and her contribution to special education, will be greatly missed.  My sincerest condolences go out to her family and loved ones," Mr Hide said.
