Education Minister Anne Tolley says the vast majority of Canterbury schools and ECE services are set to open tomorrow, just over a week after the devastating earthquake.

"Principals, teachers and trustees deserve a huge amount of credit for making sure their schools will be open for students," says Mrs Tolley.

"213 state, integrated and independent schools have been affected. All but nine are scheduled to open tomorrow, with most of the remaining schools likely to open later in the week.

"Following updated structural information, we now know that two schools have suffered serious damage.

"The Ministry of Education is working closely with these schools - Halswell and St Paul's - to ensure that temporary arrangements are in place this week for students.

"358 of the 388 affected ECE centres have so far notified the Ministry that they will be open tomorrow.

"Parents should visit the Ministry of Education website at [www.minedu.govt.nz](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/) and contact their school for updated information, or contact their ECE provider.

"The Ministry will continue to work closely with schools and ECE services to ensure they have all the support they need.

"This will include advice on trauma management and property issues, while a pool of relief teachers is available for schools that need extra help."

Schools can contact the Ministry call centre for help and advice on 0800 225580.
