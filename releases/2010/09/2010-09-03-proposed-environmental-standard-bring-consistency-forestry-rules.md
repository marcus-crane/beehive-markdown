A proposed National Environmental Standard to provide consistency to how district and regional councils manage plantation forestry has been released today by Minister for the Environment Nick Smith.

"Plantation forestry is important to New Zealand. Not only does forestry contribute significantly to our economy, it is also an integral part of New Zealand's efforts against climate change," said Dr Smith. "Unfortunately the way district and regional councils regulate this activity has developed in an ad hoc manner causing unnecessary costs and inconsistent environmental protection.

"It does not make sense that some forestry activities require consents in some areas but not in other council jurisdictions. These additional consents add tens of thousands of dollars in compliance costs.

"Forestry is a long term investment of up to 30 years requiring certainty and consistency.  We want to get a simpler resource management framework in place with clear environment rules so as to encourage growth and investment.

"The consultation on these proposals pilot a new online innovation in engaging the public.  An online discussion forum enables the public to simultaneously connect on the standards and read input from others.  The results will help inform Government on the standards, as well as involve evaluation of this new approach to consultation.

"These proposed standards are part of the Government's broader resource management reforms of proper, stronger central Government direction on environmental protection and reducing compliance costs for industry."
