The Waikato District Health Board is getting more Government funding, employing more health professionals and delivering more health services than ever before.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "Since the election, the Waikato DHB has over 30 more Doctors, 300 more nurses, and 80 more allied health professionals.

"These people have delivered 700,000 procedures, assessments, education contacts, ED visits and community and home visits, and the increases since the 2007/08 year:

- Inpatient discharges up by more than 7,000
- Outpatient attendances up nearly 40,000
- Emergency Department (ED) attendances up nearly 9,000
- Elective surgeries for more than 2,000 extra patients
- Breast screening up 6,500
- Rural and community visits up 17,000

"Waikato has made strong gains in the first full year of the revised health targets, particularly shorter stays in EDs up from 67 per cent to 81 per cent, and better help for smokers to quit improving from 39 per cent to 67 per cent.

"This DHB has also spent well over $10 million on new equipment and facilities, while work continues on a major campus redevelopment.

"The achievements are a credit to the hard working staff who are doing well for the people of the Waikato DHB area, and sound financial management," Mr Ryall says.
