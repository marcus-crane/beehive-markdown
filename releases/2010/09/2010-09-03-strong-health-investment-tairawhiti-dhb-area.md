Health Minister Tony Ryall says the Tairawhiti District Health Board (DHB) has posted big improvements in key services over the past year.

"Tairawhiti beat its target of 1,987 elective surgery discharges for the year actually delivering 2,010," Mr Ryall says.

"Immunisation is also a particular success story, looking to increase from 75% of two year olds being fully immunised to 80% and actually achieving 85%. This is a tribute to the primary care teams managing immunisation.

"Extra mental health funding has been invested in child and adolescent drug and alcohol services, including three more fulltime staff working in this area."

Other highlights from the year include:

- Implementation of a $1.6 million patient management IT system
- Building a $900,000 community health facility for people with chronic conditions
- Refurbishment of an oncology room in the children's ward
- The three year programme to improve school dental services completed in two years
- A purpose built day rehab facility which has reduced pressure on hospital beds and gets patients home sooner
- 25% of Tairawhiti DHB's workforce is now Maori
- New collaborative programmes treating people in community settings reducing pressure on the emergency department.

"Tairawhiti DHB has received a $12 million increase in funding from this Government, and we can see more patients are getting more services, and significant results have been achieved in the Health Targets.

"This is the result of great teamwork at Tairawhiti DHB, and the staff should be well pleased with what they have achieved so far," said Mr Ryall.
