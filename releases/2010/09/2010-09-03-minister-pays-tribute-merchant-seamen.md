The hard work and sacrifice of New Zealand merchant seamen during WWII made an important contribution to Allied victory in 1945, Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins said today.

"Today is Merchant Navy Day, marking the service of several thousand New Zealanders who served as civilian volunteers in the merchant navy during the Second World War.

"Merchant ships delivered troops, military equipment and vital supplies of food, fuel and other raw materials to the Allied war effort.  The merchant navy's work was so essential that it was considered to be the fourth service, alongside the army, navy and air force.

"These brave civilian volunteers ensured that crucial supplies were delivered to our Allies. They faced constant dangers of enemy attack from the sea and the sky, and endured harsh maritime conditions in the icy Atlantic and the searing heat of the Pacific.

"More than 130 New Zealand merchant seamen were killed, seven New Zealand merchant ships were sunk as a result of enemy action, and more than 100 merchant seamen were taken prisoner.

"Today we remember the Kiwi volunteers who served in the Merchant Navy.  We also pay tribute to those New Zealand merchant seamen who lost their lives whilst serving their country.  Their work helped ensure Allied victory in 1945, and for that we are eternally grateful," Ms Collins said.
