Agriculture Minister David Carter is this morning visiting farms west of Christchurch damaged in yesterday's earthquake.

Mr Carter, accompanied by Selwyn MP Amy Adams, is visiting a wide area of the region including Hororata, Glentunnel, Sheffield, Darfield, Dunsandel, Lincoln and Tai Tapu. Mr Carter has also been through parts of Banks Peninsula this morning.

"We are mainly concerned about farms still without electricity which will be dealing with stock water issues as well as other problems with farm operations. I've had reports of about six dairy sheds with structural damage, but I am also hearing of about 50 or 60 farms in the epicentre area that could be affected," says Mr Carter.

"Reports of damage to essential farm infrastructure are our major concern.

"We want to talk to some of these farmers in the area so we can assess what assistance can be provided.

"Many farmers will already be pitching in to help their neighbours which is a typical response in rural communities when events like this happen.

"I am also grateful for the quick response from the rural community and Fonterra in providing fresh water supplies for Christchurch residents," says Mr Carter.
