The final of four funding rounds of the Marine Energy Deployment Fund has opened for applications, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"The fund has been successful in stimulating interest and investment in testing the potential for marine energy in New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.

"New Zealand has a world-class wave and tidal energy resource, which will provide us with another form of renewable energy in the future."

The funding is provided to applicants that can demonstrate the capability to deploy wave and tidal stream energy devices in New Zealand.  A total amount of $880,000 is available.

The successful applicant or applicants will need to meet a number of criteria, including a strong likelihood of their technology being commissioned.

The closing date for applications is Monday 29 November 2010.
