Government funding to expand PlunketLine to 24/7 for parents has seen the service answer nearly 27,000 more calls in the 2009/10 year than it did two years previously.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said, "In the first full year of Government funding to support PlunketLine's 24/7 operation, $3 million was provided and 96,290 calls were answered.

"That is an increase of 39% from the 2008/09 year.

"The National government promised to fund PlunketLine 24 hours a day, seven days a week as part of its election campaign. These call numbers show that the $3 million annual grant was money well spent for New Zealand parents and children," said Mr Ryall.

PlunketLine provides parental support and a wide range of advice about child development and behaviour.

The PlunketLine number is 0800 933 922.
