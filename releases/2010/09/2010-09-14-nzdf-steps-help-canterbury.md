Defence Minister Wayne Mapp has praised the work of the Defence Force after the Canterbury earthquake.

"They are doing a great job. All three services have stepped up to help people and the authorities deal with the earthquake's aftermath," Dr Mapp said.

Dr Mapp and Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae visited Christchurch last Friday. Their visit included briefings at Burnham Military Camp and the naval facility HMNZS Pegasus in central Christchurch.

"Lt Gen Mateparae and I talked to many of the soldiers involved from the 3rd Land Force Group based in Burnham, and naval personnel from Pegasus. We were highly impressed with their willingness to do whatever it takes to put things right. They feel privileged to be able to help.

"I am very proud of what they have done, and continue to do. They can be relied upon to take on the work required and get it done to the highest standard," he said.
