Transport Minister Steven Joyce is urging Kiwis to stay safe on the roads this Labour Day weekend.

"Holiday weekends mean extra busy roads and this is the first we've had for some months. Please be patient and avoid unnecessary overtaking. It's important to drive to the conditions and don't take risks."

"I know Police will be out in force this long weekend helping to make sure we drive safely. I'm urging everyone to use care and commonsense when on the roads," says Mr Joyce.

Last year, 8 people were killed and 132 were injured on New Zealand roads during Labour weekend.

"The government is working to introduce a significant number of initiatives from the Safer Journeys road safety strategy to help lower our road toll.  These include raising the driving age, reducing alcohol limits for young drivers and repeat drink drivers, and improving the safety of motorcyclists.

"But to significantly reduce the numbers of people killed and injured on our roads we all need to take responsibility and make safety a top priority."

"Take care, stay safe and have a great Labour Day weekend."

The official holiday period for begins at 4.00pm today (Friday 22 October) and ends at 6.00am on Tuesday 26 October. Holiday road crash statistics are available on the Ministry of Transport website: [www.transport.govt.nz](http://www.transport.govt.nz/)
