Health Minister Tony Ryall has given Capital and Coast DHB the green light to start work on modernising its mental health unit, Ward 27.

"Ward 27 does not currently meet national health and disability standards and it is running out of space.  It needs significant remodelling and earthquake strengthening - and I am pleased to approve this multi-million dollar project," says Mr Ryall.

Capital and Coast plans to split the unit into male and female wards - with two clinical areas, an acute inpatient ward and a transition unit for patients who are nearly ready to move back into the community.

"The upgrade will make Ward 27 more secure and user friendly for patients and their families."

Work will be funded by Capital and Coast and is scheduled to begin immediately, and take around 18 months to complete. Current patients will be accommodated elsewhere in the Wellington region during the refurbishment.
