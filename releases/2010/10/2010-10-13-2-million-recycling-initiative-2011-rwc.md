Environment Minister Nick Smith today launched a $2 million programme to install hundreds of public recycling bins around New Zealand in preparation for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

"The Government is determined that in hosting the largest event in our history, we minimise the impacts on our environment," Dr Smith said.  "We also want to ensure the visiting 85,000 rugby fans and 2,500 international media have an experience that matches our 100% pure brand.

"The programme involves installing more than 700 Love NZ recycling facilities for glass, plastic and cans at stadia, fanzones, main streets, airports, railway stations, bus terminals, campsites and popular tourist attractions in each of the 12 regions hosting Rugby World Cup games. 

"The programme will get under way in early 2011 with the 17 nationwide More FM winery concerts and at the Super 15 rugby matches, with an associated advertising campaign to get New Zealanders into the spirit of the Love NZ recycling initiative.

"This Love NZ initiative is being funded by $1.6 million from the Government's Waste Minimisation fund and $440,000 from the Glass Packaging Forum.  My hope is to attract a further $1 million from councils and industry in the 12 regions hosting the games to enable more recycling facilities to be installed and I will be writing today to Mayors to try and secure this additional support."

"These Love NZ recycling facilities and the investment in changing social attitudes to make recycling the norm will be a lasting legacy after the 2011 Rugby World Cup."
