The award was presented today by the Prime Minister John Key. The award recognises outstanding acts of bravery by a Police officer.

Inspector O'Leary rescued two children from a burning van after a road accident near Taupo on 24 April last year. He was off duty at the time.

"Faced with an incredibly dangerous situation, Inspector O'Leary put aside his own safety to rescue two children," Ms Collins said.

"As horrifying events unfolded, Inspector O'Leary took control and did everything in his power to save lives. 

"If it wasn't for his bravery and his cool-headed commitment to duty, the toll on that terrible night would have been higher.

"It is reassuring to know that officers such as Inspector O'Leary are out there every day keeping the public safe.

"I congratulate him on this award.  His courage is an inspiration."
