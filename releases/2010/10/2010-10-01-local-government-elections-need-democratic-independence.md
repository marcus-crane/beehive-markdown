Minister of Local Government Hon Rodney Hide today reminded MPs that they are prohibited from using resources provided to them as a Member of Parliament to endorse candidates in local government elections.

"It is vital to maintain local government's democratic independence and to act in accordance with New Zealand's important democratic principles," Mr Hide said.

"As such, individual MPs should not use their taxpayer provided resources to influence local government elections in any way.  
   
"Today I have referred a Member to the General Manager of Parliamentary Services for using Parliamentary resources to promote candidates.  I would like to take this opportunity to caution other Parliamentarians against such inappropriate behaviour," Mr Hide said.
