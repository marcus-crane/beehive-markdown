Foreign Minister Murray McCully and his Indonesian counterpart Marty Natalegawa  have launched an Indonesia-New Zealand Friendship Council during  Mr McCully's bilateral visit to Jakarta.

"The Council brings together a group of key individuals  in Indonesia who will use their influence to help strengthen our bilateral relationship," Mr McCully said.

"Indonesia is a crucial relationship for New Zealand both bilaterally and as a leader within ASEAN.  It is also  our eighth largest trading partner, and there is scope for greater cooperation in education and geothermal energy, as well as in agriculture.

"We need to make sure we realise the potential of this relationship, and I believe the Friendship Council can help us do that," Mr McCully said.

Patron of the new Council will be former Indonesian Foreign Minster Hassan Wirajuda, and its  chairman will be former Indonesian Ambassador to New Zealand Amris Hassan.

The majority of the Council members will be Indonesians who are leaders in a range of sectors included business, government, and universities. Three New Zealanders based in Jakarta will also be members, along with Ambassador David Taylor. 

A New Zealand chapter of the friendship Council will be established at a later date.
