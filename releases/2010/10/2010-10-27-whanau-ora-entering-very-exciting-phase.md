Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia says Friday's announcement of the successful providers is a very exciting time for Whanau Ora.

Mrs Turia says the positive and enthusiastic feedback she receives on a daily basis about Whanau Ora is reinforcement that people are embracing an approach that is long overdue.

"In fact, I'd have to say, that the only criticisms that are being aired seem to come from one quarter.

"The Labour Party had nine years to implement innovative policy that would benefit families and build on the strength of whanau.

"Instead of being the voice of doom and gloom perhaps they should embrace the excitement that this approach is generating," says Mrs Turia.

"Already we have seen Whanau Ora generate strong collaboration between providers to express their interest in delivering this innovative approach.

"I am in no doubt that this strong collaboration will gather momentum and that over time we will see whanau empowered to take control over their future.

"Whanau Ora represents a significant investment by a Government which has never been so bold. It is a great sign for the future development opportunities for whanau."

The announcement of the successful providers will be made at Takapuwahia Marae in Porirua at 11am.
