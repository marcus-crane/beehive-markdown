Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has announced the membership of the Māori Statutory Board, appointed under the Local Government (Auckland Council) Amendment Act 2010.

"This Board has been established to represent the interests of mana whenua and mātāwaka (residents who affiliate to tribes outside the region) in advising the new Auckland Council." said Dr Sharples.

"I am pleased to welcome such high-calibre people to the task," he said.

"Although their function is to advise the Council, they are not part of the Council structure, but independent advocates. The were appointed by an iwi selection body, comprising a member nominated by each of the mana whenua organisations within the Council's district.

"The iwi selection body was convened by me, but it followed its own procedures in making their selection.

"I thank the selection body for fulfilling this task, for the benefit of all Aucklanders, and I wish the new Board all the very best in ensuring that the voice of Māori from throughout Tāmaki Makaurau is heard and reflected in the actions of the new Auckland Council." said Dr Sharples.
