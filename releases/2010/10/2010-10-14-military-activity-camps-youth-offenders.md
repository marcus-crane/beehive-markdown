Fresh Start legislation is now in force with the first round of youth offenders attending a Military Activity Camp as directed by Youth Court judges.

"The first intake of young offenders are learning self-responsibility, discipline and doing some serious physical activity," says acting Social Development Minister Judith Collins.

The eight-week MAC camps, concept tested over the last year are now in effect following the implementation of legislation on 1 October 2010.

"This Government is serious about dealing with this country's worst young offenders and I can tell you, this is no holiday camp," says Mrs Collins.

At camp young people rise at 6.30 each morning, presenting themselves clean and in uniform, ready for a day of structured activity including school classes, drills, chores, fitness activity, life skills and individual work.

Programmes will also help young people address the causes of offending with mentoring, literacy and numeracy skills and drug and alcohol rehabilitation.

"We're holding serious and repeat young offenders to account with tougher sentences and we're working more intensively to address the causes of their offending to keep them out of jail," says Mrs Collins.

There are ten young men from around the country in the current MAC intake and the average age is 16 years old.
