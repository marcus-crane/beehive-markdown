Prime Minister John Key will leave on Thursday to attend the 5th East Asia Summit in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, on 30 October.

Mr Key will join leaders from the 10 ASEAN countries at the EAS, where they will discuss key regional and international issues with other EAS Heads of Government and Heads of State. 

He will also visit Ho Chi Minh City to strengthen trade and commercial links, and promote New Zealand firms' activity in the region.

"The EAS has an ambitious role including fostering dialogue between states, and promoting cooperation in political and security issues," says Mr Key.

"East Asia is leading the global recovery. For the first time, the major East Asian countries have a political influence which is commensurate with their economic power."

New Zealand also welcomes Russia and the United States, which are attending this year's summit as prospective EAS members and Special Guests of the Chair.

This visit builds on the successful trip by Mr Key to Viet Nam in July, and the later signing of a joint Action Plan by foreign ministers where both countries stated their intention to deepen the bilateral economic, commercial, investment and trade links.

The EAS includes the 10 ASEAN countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam) together with China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. 

Mr Key will be accompanied on the visit by Foreign Minister Murray McCully.

The Prime Minister returns to New Zealand on Sunday.
