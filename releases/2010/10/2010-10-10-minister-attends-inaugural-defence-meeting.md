**ASEAN + 8 nations meet in Hanoi**

Defence Minister Wayne Mapp is on his way to Hanoi for the inaugural ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM+8) in Hanoi this week.

Dr Mapp said the new meeting is strongly supported by both ASEAN and non-ASEAN countries.

"It is a significant development in the regional security architecture. It will build confidence amongst the members, and enhance their understanding of each others' national defence and security policies. In this way we can develop a shared understanding of the region's collective security challenges.

"We will also be discussing opportunities for practical co-operation between countries," he said.

**Building science co-operation**

As Minister of Research, Science and Technology Dr Mapp will travel to Japan and China after the Hanoi meeting for formal Research, Science and Technology visits.

"Japan is among the top-ranked OECD countries in research and development, and our RST relationship with them has grown significantly over the past 10 years. This visit provides the opportunity to build on that.

"Our RST relationship with Japan is set out in the New Zealand-Japan Science and Technology Co-operation Agreement (STCA) signed last year. My Japanese counterpart and I will open the first meeting of the Joint Commission of the Agreement in Tokyo this week."

In China he will meet with Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang, to announce projects within the New Zealand-China Strategic Research Alliance. The Alliance was launched in July by the Prime Minister and Chinese Premier Wen Jiaobao, and commits $2.4 million to support bilateral research over the next three years.

The Minister will also host a science function at the New Zealand World Expo Pavilion in Shanghai, recognising the strong science links between New Zealand and the Shanghai Municipality Academy of Science.

Dr Mapp returns to New Zealand next Sunday.
