The lowest annual inflation rate in more than six years confirms that cost of living increases have generally been low and real wages are gradually increasing, Finance Minister Bill English says.

News today that annual inflation was just 1.5 per cent in the year to September also confirms that Phil Goff is plainly wrong when it suggests New Zealanders were better off under Labour.

"The facts speak for themselves," Mr English says. "When Labour left office, the economy was deep in recession, annual inflation was 5.1 per cent - with no compensation for anyone - and real after-tax wages were falling.

"By contrast, annual inflation for the year to September stood at only 1.5 per cent. This is the lowest annual figure since 1.5 per cent inflation in the year to March 2004 and the last time it was lower was in the year to December 1999.

"Not only are price increases significantly lower across the board under National, but real and after-tax wages have increased. *\[see attached table]*

"The tax package this month will leave the vast majority of New Zealanders better off, with incentives to save and get ahead under their own steam.

"Beneficiaries, superannuitants and Working for Families recipients have received immediate compensation for the GST increase and workers across all income groups have received a tax cut.  Nearly three quarters of income earners now have a top tax rate of 17.5 per cent or less.

"All Labour can do is reconfirm that it stands for tax increases, higher debt and looser controls over inflation. That's a desperate recipe for leaving hard-working Kiwis worse off," Mr English says.
