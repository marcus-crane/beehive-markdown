Suggestions for a different approach to the delivery of social and state housing are to be considered by Government.

In April, a group of social housing experts, the Housing Shareholders Advisory Group (HSAG), appointed by Housing Minister Phil Heatley and Finance Minister Bill English, made 19 recommendations it believed would deliver the most ‘effective and efficient' delivery model for state housing services.

Mr Heatley says HSAG's findings and its 19 recommendations build a clear case for change.

"The current state housing model is not providing for those most in need. Despite record levels of investment, waiting lists remains static with around 10,000 people urgently needing a home," says Mr Heatley.

"I am very concerned about those families on the waiting list who are in significant need while HNZC is currently maintaining thousands of old houses of that are the wrong size, often in the wrong areas and many of which are occupied by tenants who could rent privately."  
 

"Among other recommendations HSAG suggests HNZC is empowered to focus on the ‘high needs' sector; that the Government actively develops participation in the affordable and social housing market by third party providers of community housing; and that we find effective ways to move state tenants who are better able to provide for themselves towards housing independence," he said.

Following the delivery of the initial HSAG report, Mr Heatley and Mr English asked the group to undertake further engagement with key stakeholders in the community housing sector. The feedback the group received following a series of engagement meetings and hui throughout the country has now been put forward for consideration by the Government.

Mr Heatley says the Government will carefully consider the final submissions of community housing stakeholders and the Housing Shareholders Advisory Group (HSAG) before making any major changes to the way social housing is provided.

"I want to make it very clear the elderly, the infirm and the vulnerable will not be adversely affected by any changes," says Mr Heatley.

"If the Government were to adopt new policies, such as the introduction of reviewable rentals, it is likely these would be introduced for new tenants entering the system first," he said.

"I would once again like to take the opportunity to thank Alan Jackson and the other members of HSAG who have worked so hard to deliver the report and stakeholder feedback in such a short time. Their effort and the quality of the information provided by the group is a testament to its passion for social housing."

A copy of the HSAG report as well as the Summary of Stakeholder Feedback and the Implications of the Stakeholder Feedback can be found on the Department of Building and Housing website. [http://www.dbh.govt.nz/vision-for-social-housing-nz](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/vision-for-social-housing-nz)
