Community groups will now be able to access funding to kick start their environmental projects thanks to the Government's Community Environment Fund, Environment Minister Nick Smith announced last night.

"The Community Environment Fund will help community groups all over the country initiate practical programmes that will improve New Zealand's environment," Dr Smith said.

"The Community Environment Fund has arisen following a review by the Ministry for the Environment, which has seen the merger of the Environment Centres Fund, the Sustainable Management Fund and the RMA Education and Advisory Fund. The funding review concluded a single fund would work more effectively as there were crossovers between applications. Provision has also been made for multiple-year funding recognising that many environmental projects take more than a year and require stability of funding.

"There will be two opportunities each year for community groups to apply for funding of between $10,000 and $300,000. The initial allocation is $2.1 million this financial year growing to $3 million in future years as existing commitments phase out. Applications for the first round of funding close on 14 February 2011 and the second round opens in June 2011.

"The Community Environment Fund of $3 million a year will sit alongside the more specialist Waste Minimisation Fund of $12 million a year, the Environmental Legal Assistance Fund of $800,000 a year and the Contaminated Site Remediation Fund of $1.8 million a year.

"This reformed grant programme is more orderly and efficient. It will ensure we get the most economical gains from the funds available."
