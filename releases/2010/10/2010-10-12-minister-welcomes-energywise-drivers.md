Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the drivers and crews of the 2010 AA ENERGYWISE Rally to Parliament, saying the rally has important messages for consumers.

"The car you choose makes a real difference to how much you will end up spending on fuel over the years, and the numbers can be substantial.

"Consumers can also make a real difference to their fuel bill by following some sensible, fuel-efficient driving techniques," Mr Brownlee said.

Drivers in the fuel efficiency rally aim to complete the four day North Island route spending as little as possible on fuel, including road user charges.  The rally passed through Wellington today on the second day of competition.

Mr Brownlee says most families will spend about the same amount of money on fuel for their vehicles as they do on energy for the whole of their homes. 

"On top of that, cars account for about eight per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions, and the total transport sector accounts for roughly 20 per cent.

"Anything we can do to reduce the amount of fuel we use to get from A to B helps bring this figure down."

There had been a steady improvement in the fuel efficiency of modern cars as the manufacturers pushed to better the performance of their vehicles, Mr Brownlee said.

"New Zealanders are buying fewer new gas guzzling vehicles, with sales of the highest carbon-emitting segment of cars down by 41 per cent in the two years from June 2008."

The two-yearly AA ENERGYWISE Rally is organised by the AA, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), and Gull Petroleum New Zealand.

The overall Supreme Winner is the vehicle that costs the least to complete the 1,780 kilometre route - including both fuel and road user charges.

In the last rally the supreme winner - the Honda Civic Hybrid - took out the competition by using just over $110 to complete the entire route.
