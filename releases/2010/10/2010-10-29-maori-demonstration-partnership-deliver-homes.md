Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today inspected land in Tauranga where a Maori Demonstration Partnership (MDP) funded project will deliver ten new kaumatua housing units.

Mangatawa Papamoa Block Incorporated (MPBI) successfully bid for MDP funding last year. It is about to about to begin the first stage of a housing project that it hopes will eventually deliver 30 homes on Maori freehold land in the Mangtawa Papatawa area.

MPBI was allocated $2.17 million, around 40 percent of the total funding required to build the first stage of the project in 2009/10.

Mr Heatley says it is great to see MDP funded projects getting off the ground.

"This is yet another example of how the Government can work with third-party providers of social housing to stretch funding to provide even more homes. In this case the fact that the homes are being built on Maori land, which can be difficult to find commercial funding to develop because of multiple ownership issues, is another bonus," he says.

"I understand that MPBI is negotiating with the local polytechnic and building contractors to provide employment and training opportunities for at least ten students, this is yet another plus," he said.

"In this case the MDP funding provided by the Government is not only going to provide ten homes for elderly Maori, but it is also stimulating the local economy providing work for builders as well as practical training which could help ten young people get a head start," he said.

MDP started as an initiative from Te Au Roa, HNZC's Maori strategy. The Government recognised the need to partner with Maori around housing issues, especially those relating to Maori land. HNZC then sought the Governments approval to use a portion of the Housing Innovation Fund to support MDPs.

Four groups, MPBI, Te Runanga o Te Rarawa, Te Runanga o Ngati Awa and Ngati Hine Health Trust, were successful in their efforts to secure funding last year. Funding applications for 2010/2011 are currently under consideration.
