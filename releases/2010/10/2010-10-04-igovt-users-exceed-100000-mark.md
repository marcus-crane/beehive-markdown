The number of people using the igovt logon service has exceeded the 100,000 mark, with a huge boost coming from the Companies Office's use of the service, says Minister of Internal Affairs Nathan Guy.

"The igovt logon service allows people and businesses to use the same logon to access multiple online government services. Thirteen agencies from central and local government use the logon service, with Wellington City Council the latest to sign on.

"This is another good example of innovative technology being used to deliver better frontline services for the public.

"We now have more than 111,300 separate users, which has increased by more than 16,000 last month alone.

"The next agency set to utilise igovt is the Electrical Workers Registration Board later this month.

"The government is planning to introduce legislation allowing people to use igovt to identify themselves when changing their electoral roll details online, expected to be up and running by the 2011 general election. The next step after this is to allow first-time voters to enrol using the igovt identity verification service."

The Department of Internal Affairs is currently investigating ways of extending the igovt services to the commercial sector.
