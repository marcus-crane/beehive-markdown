Health Minister Tony Ryall says more than 400 women with breast cancer have started the 12 month course of herceptin treatment, since this Government began fully funding the treatment, at the end of 2008.

"The monthly treatment volumes have increased from 19 in December 2008 to 234 in June this year.

"These numbers are expected to plateau. As more women start the treatment, others will be finishing their course.

"National promised funding for 12 months of herceptin as part of the last election policy. It gives patients and their doctors the option of two herceptin drug treatment regimes for fighting the disease.

This month is Breast Cancer Action Month, and the government supports raising awareness of what is the most common of cancer for women.
