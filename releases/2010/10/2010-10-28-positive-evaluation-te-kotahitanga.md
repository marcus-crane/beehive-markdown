Education Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Education Minister Dr Pita Sharples say that an evaluation of the professional development programme, Te Kotahitanga, shows it improves motivation and teaching for Maori students. 

Te Kotahitanga, which supports teachers to raise achievement among Māori students, is currently being used in 49 English-medium secondary schools throughout New Zealand.

"This Government is absolutely committed to raising educational achievement among Māori students," says Mrs Tolley.

"Te Kotahitanga is an important part of that goal. Along with improving results, it works with teachers to create culturally responsive learning environments, and this evaluation shows it is working.

"It also highlights increased job satisfaction and motivation among teachers, which is extremely positive," says Mrs Tolley.

The Government has invested almost $20 million in extending Te Kotahitanga to an additional 17 schools, allowing 7,000 more Māori students and 900 more teachers to be involved in the programme.

The Victoria University evaluation, released today, examined data from 22 Te Kotahitanga schools from 2004 - 2008, and is the first external evaluation of the programme.

"Te Kotahitanga recognises the importance of culture for learning, and helps teachers to improve practices, expectations and beliefs about Māori students," says Dr Sharples.

"Te Kotahitanga shows that if teachers expect their students to succeed - they will! It turns around generations of Maori under-achievement at school, which was blamed on Maori students and their whanau.

"Teachers, principals, board chairs, parents and facilitators were overwhelmingly positive about the design of Te Kotahitanga," says Dr Sharples.

"They said teachers had improved their classroom teaching and learning for Māori students.

"They also reported improvements in attendance, participation, motivation, and engagement."
