Agriculture Minister David Carter met on Friday (NZ time) for over an hour with HRH The Prince of Wales at Balmoral Estate in Scotland to discuss the ‘Campaign for Wool' of which the Prince is Patron.

"The Prince of Wales is a champion of the efforts of Commonwealth farmers to grow wool and restore profitability to the sector, and this was a significant opportunity to discuss increasing the demand for wool recognising its qualities as a naturally renewable and sustainable product," says Mr Carter.

"The Prince's campaign mirrors the New Zealand Government's efforts to get our strong wool industry back on track.

"His Royal Highness is a passionate advocate for wool and was keen to hear about all the efforts that are being made to ensure consumers understand the benefits of this wonderful, natural and sustainable fibre."

"I have promised to keep him informed of our progress and I know he will do whatever he can to help."

"After some tough years, prospects are beginning to look up for the wool sector, and this meeting was another important step in that process," says Mr Carter.

"Traditionally it has been a fractured industry but this has changed with the recent formation of the Wool Group, led by Colin Harvey, which is now working hard to unify the sector and restore profitability to sheep farmers," concluded Mr Carter.
