Management of waterways and native flora and fauna near farm land will be improved as a result of a funding boost for the New Zealand Landcare Trust, Environment Minister Nick Smith announced today at the premiere of the film Water Whisperers Tangaroa in Takaka, Golden Bay.

"I'm really pleased to be able to double the Trust's funding to $800,000 a year," Dr Smith said. "This will enable the Trust to expand and grow its successful land management work. This includes support for landcare and community based groups, fostering research and providing land management training. 

"The benefit of the New Zealand Landcare Trust's work is well illustrated by the success in improving water quality in the Aorere Catchment in Golden Bay - a captivating and positive story told in the film Water Whisperers Tangaroa. The Government wants to expand the Trust's work in empowering rural communities to take ownership and resolve local environmental problems.

"Improving our fresh water resources are shared goals of this Government and New Zealand Landcare Trust.  The recent work of the Land and Water Forum has highlighted what happens on our land directly affects our waterways, so everything we do to encourage best practice land management means positive results for our fresh water.

"Since it was established in 1996, the Trust has worked with hundreds of farmers and landowners to review and improve their land management practices.  As a result, waterways have been protected, trees planted, pests controlled, and native flora and fauna has flourished. 

"This Government is serious about improving the quality of New Zealand's fresh water - one of our most precious environmental and economic resources. The way forward rests with successful partnerships like the New Zealand Landcare Trust founded by Federated Farmers and Fish & Game."
