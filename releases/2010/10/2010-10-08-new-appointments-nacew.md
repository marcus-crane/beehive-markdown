Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson today announced four new appointments to the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW) and the reappointment of two members.

The new members are Traci Houpapa, Galia BarHava-Monteith, Susan Peterson and Ranjna Patel.

Chair Pauline Winter has been reappointed to the Council, as has Dr Anne Meade.

"NACEW is an important advisory body advising of trends, issues and opportunities," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The new appointments will introduce some important new perspectives and add to the expertise I am retaining on the Council."
