A new initiative to promote high productivity among New Zealand businesses will be set up by the Government, Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson announced today.

"The High Performance Working initiative will provide a pool of $1 million annually that will fund specialist business consultants to help firms increase their productivity," says Ms Wilkinson.

"This will involve seeking greater collaboration and feedback from managers and employees on how they believe they can utilise their skills and time more effectively.

"Achieving greater employee engagement and developing sound workplaces practices is crucial to growing a successful business.

"Industry bodies, trade organisations and regional business networks will be closely involved in delivering this support. I particularly want to acknowledge the Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand for their assistance in setting this initiative up.

"Increasing productivity is crucial to New Zealand's economic success and this is another step in the Government's programme to lift our economic performance."

Department of Labour officials are now developing operating guidelines for the new initiative.  When these are completed, expressions of interest from potential industry partners will be invited in November 2010.
