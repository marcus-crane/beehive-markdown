Justice Minister Simon Power and Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Grant Pearson as the chair of the Immigration Advisers Complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal. 

Mr Pearson has been appointed for a term of three years. 

The appointment was recommended by the Minister of Justice, in consultation with the Minister of Immigration, and the warrant was signed by the Chief Justice, on behalf of the Governor-General, yesterday.

"The chair is a specialist position which requires the right mix of legal and immigration experience, so finding the right candidate took some time," Mr Power said.

"Mr Pearson's knowledge of immigration law and experience as a decision-maker in immigration appeals will be welcome in the new tribunal."

Mr Pearson is currently a partner at Duncan Cotterill specialising in litigation and dispute work. He is a former member of the Residence Removal Authority and the Refugee Status Appeals Authority.  He was the deputy chair of the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal from 1999-2001.

The tribunal consists of a chair, who considers matters about immigration advisers referred to it by the Registrar of Immigration Advisers. It also hears appeals against decisions of the Registrar. 

It is established by section 40 of the Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007. The Act came into force in July 2008.

‘'Mr Pearson's experience ticks all the boxes required for this position, especially his handling of sensitive cases involving migrants and refugees. He has the legal background and immigration experience which makes him a good fit for chair,'' Dr Coleman said.
