Health Minister Tony Ryall is concerned that the Diabetes Get Checked programme is not reaching enough of the people it is designed to be helping.

Mr Ryall says, "In the 2009/10 year, 55 per cent of people diagnosed with diabetes had their free annual check. While this is a high, the Get Checked programme does not appear to be connecting well with the people for which it is intended.

"Better Diabetes and Cardiovascular Services is one of the Government's six national Health Targets, and we want to see better diagnosis and management of diabetes.

"The Ministry of Health has appointed a National Clinical Director Diabetes, Dr Brandon Orr-Walker, who is Clinical Head of Endocrinology and Diabetes at Middlemore Hospital.

"One of Dr Orr-Walker's first activities in the new role is to fix the seemingly poor uptake of services for people with diabetes."

"The Government recognises that diabetes is a growing problem, and we want to make sure that the treatment and management programmes that we are paying for are delivering good results.

A recent report by the Office of the Auditor General also had suggestions on how DHBs might think about improving their diabetes services.

About 200,000 New Zealanders have been diagnosed with diabetes, but estimates indicate a substantial number of people may be unaware they have the disease.  Type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity, is the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease. However, rates of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are increasing, particularly in children.
