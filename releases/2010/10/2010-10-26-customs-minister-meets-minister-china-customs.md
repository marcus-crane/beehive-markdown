In a meeting today Customs Minister Maurice Williamson and his Chinese counterpart, Minister Sheng Guangzu have acknowledged the good work to date in implementing the New Zealand - China Free Trade Agreement.

"In the first year of the Free Trade Agreement's implementation, New Zealand's exports to China increased by almost 60 percent", Mr Williamson says.

"China is now our second largest trading partner and for the growth in our exports to continue Customs processes at the border need to be as efficient as possible," he says.

The Ministers noted their desire to treat the Free Trade Agreement as a living agreement, and encouraged the two Customs administrations to continue to work together to improve the efficiency and security of trade between our countries.

During his visit, Mr Williamson will also visit China Customs' detector dog training centre in Beijing, visit the New Zealand pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo, speak to students at a Customs College in Shanghai and speak with New Zealand businesses trading with China.
