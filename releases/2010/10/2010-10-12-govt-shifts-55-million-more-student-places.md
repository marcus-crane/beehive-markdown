The Government will fund almost 3,000 more university student places over the next two years in response to high demand for full-time tertiary study, Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

"Cabinet this week decided to invest a further $55m to create more undergraduate places for young people in universities in 2011 and 2012," Mr Joyce says.

"This is good news for students and their families. It's also good news for the wider economy as the very significant increase we expect in the number of university graduates from 2013 will help create a strong platform to support future economic growth. 

"The funding will provide another 1580 places next year and 1315 in 2012 above current projected funding levels. It follows 765 new university places the Government already announced in the Budget for 2011.

"The number of full-time places funded in universities next year will be the highest ever at about 119,000. This is over 7,000 more than in 2008. Across the core tertiary sector there will be about 16,500 more full-time equivalent places than in 2008.

"The Government was already expecting graduate numbers to be about 20 per cent higher by 2013 than in the 2000s and this extra funding will increase that even further."

The availability of extra funding for university places comes from changes announced last week to lift the performance and accountability of industry training organisations as well as reprioritise underspending in the area.

"In the current economic environment it is critical the Government gets the most out of every dollar spent. This shift in funding is part of this Government's push to get higher productivity out of the more than $4 billion we spend on tertiary education.

"It also reflects the nature of the economic cycle. As New Zealand recovers from recession there remains strong demand for full-time degree study and less demand for industry-based training. That trend will likely start to reverse again over the next few years. We are committed to keeping a close eye on these trends and responding to the training needs of New Zealanders," Mr Joyce says.

 

**Questions and answers**

**How will this funding shift affect full-time university student numbers?**

The extra $55 million funding will provide 2,895 more undergraduate degree places across the next two years. This will push total funded equivalent full-time university student numbers from the previously forecast 117,337 in 2011 to 118,917. This is an increase of 6.4 per cent on the 111,753 equivalent full-time university students in 2008. Across universities, polytechs, wananga and private training organisations funded core places in 2011 will be about 16,500 higher than in 2008.

**What is the total funding for universities in 2011 going to be now?**

Total funding to New Zealand's eight universities will be about $1.38 billion.

**How will the funding be allocated?**

TEC is currently discussing with each university how it will allocate this funding, with final decisions expected in early November.

**Why is the extra funding only for 2011 and 2012?**

Forecast demand is higher over this period due to people choosing to upskill through university study in the current economic environment and a demographic blip in the number of school leavers.

**Where does the extra funding come from?**

The funding comes from an underspend in industry training in 2010 due to economic conditions, an anticipated underspend in industry training in 2011, and the impact of funding changes announced last week.

**Why has the funding only been directed to undergraduate level?**

The Government is responding to increased demand - primarily at under-grad level. The Tertiary Education Strategy is clear that 18-25 year olds and Maori and Pacific students are a priority which is why this funding is targeted at full-year students in that age group.

**What will these changes mean for industry training?**

Funding for industry training has almost trebled over the past decade. Since 2009, more intensive monitoring has shown that we can gain efficiencies and better achievement by focusing more tightly on results. The changes do not affect funding for Modern Apprentices. We expect that as the economy improves, there will be an upswing in trainees as more businesses invest in education and training.
