Foreign Minister Murray McCully leaves on a four-day trip to Indonesia and Malaysia later tonight. 

In Indonesia the Minister will take part in the third Joint Ministerial Commission with his counterpart Marty Natalegawa.

"A key area of discussion will be ways to strengthen New Zealand's already close relationship with Indonesia, with education, defence cooperation, and geothermal energy leading points for discussion," Mr McCully said.

The Minister will also meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Foreign Affairs Advisor, and former Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda, and launch a new Indonesia-New Zealand Friendship Council. 

Mr McCully's visit to Malaysia will involve meetings with Foreign Minister Dato' Sri Anifah Hj Aman, and International Trade and Industry Minister Dato' Mustapa Mohamed.

"The visit will reaffirm New Zealand's long-standing and friendly relationship with Malaysia, which is built on strong links at many levels, as well as increasingly integrated economies, thanks to the Free Trade Agreement which entered into force on August 1.

"Indonesia and Malaysia are also founding members of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), and New Zealand is fully committed to a close working relationship with ASEAN, particularly in promoting the development of wider regional integration," Mr McCully said.
