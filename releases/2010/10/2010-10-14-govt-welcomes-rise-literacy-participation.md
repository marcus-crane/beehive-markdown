Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed a new report that shows the number of adults participating in courses that include literacy and numeracy skills has more than doubled since 2007.

The Tertiary Education Commission today released a report Getting Results in Literacy and Numeracy which outlines progress being made in teaching literacy and numeracy as well as priorities for future work.

"Improving New Zealanders' literacy and numeracy is critical to economic growth. Internationally-recognised research shows New Zealand is one of many countries that has a large number of adults who lack the literacy and numeracy skills they need to participate fully in the modern economy," Mr Joyce says.

"The Government is focused on making sure adults have access to learning that includes essential literacy and numeracy skills.

"This report shows that polytechs, wananga, private training establishments and industry training organisations are increasingly showing they can improve students' literacy and numeracy while they are enrolled in their everyday courses and qualifications.

"Since 2007, the number of adults who participate in programmes that include a literacy and numeracy skills component has more than doubled.

"By 2013, most entry-level tertiary courses will include literacy and numeracy skills and we expect that 100,000 people will be participating in these programmes.

"This is a very effective way of ensuring students gain the skills they need to work in an increasingly complex economic environment," Mr Joyce says.
