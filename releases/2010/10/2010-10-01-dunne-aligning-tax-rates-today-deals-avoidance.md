The aligning from today of the top tax rate and trust rates will be a major tool in stopping tax avoidance that has been a "$5 billion revenue hole begun when Labour hiked the top tax rate in 1999", Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says.

Mr Dunne said "the most disastrous tax decision in the last decade" was the previous government's decision to hike the top tax rate in December 1999.

"That caused a huge explosion in the use of trusts for income-sheltering purposes, costing around $300 million a year in revenue foregone.

"That is $2.7 billion lost over the last decade as a consequence of Labour's envy tax. But it gets worse.

"A lot has been said about loss attributing qualifying companies and how they have become another diversionary tactic along the way.

"The growth in loss attributing qualifying companies in the same period has been over 240 percent.

"We now have in the order of 130,000 loss attributing qualifying companies in New Zealand.

"The value of their tax losses is now $2.3 billion, which is 400 percent higher than it was at the start of the decade.

"If we put those two figures together, we can draw the reasonable conclusion that the net consequence of Labour's hiking of the top tax rate in 1999 has been a $5 billion revenue hole for the New Zealand taxpayer."

"Today we take a significant step to addressing that, and creating a fairer tax system overall," Mr Dunne said.

The main tax changes that have come into effect today are:

- Personal income tax rates cut across the board leaving 72 per cent of taxpayers facing a top rate of 17.5 per cent or less.
- Drop in the tax rates on investments in multi-rate PIEs.
- Reduction in the resident withholding tax rates on interest in line with personal tax rates.
- Increase in the rate of GST from 12.5 to 15 per cent.
- Immediate increase in New Zealand Superannuation, Working for Families and benefit payments by 2.02 per cent to compensate for the rise in GST.
- Increase in Government Superannuation Fund annuities.
- Increase in New Zealand Superannuation payments.

As well, for the 2011/2012 tax year, which could be as early as tomorrow for some companies, the company tax rate falls from 30 per cent to 28 percent.
