New Zealand's next Ambassador to Italy will be career diplomat Dr Trevor Matheson, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

Dr Matheson will also be cross-accredited to Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Malta, and the Republic of Cyprus.

"New Zealand's relationship with Italy is an important one - not least because of its status as a G8 economy and a founding member of the European Union," Mr McCully said. 

"We are both strong supporters of the United Nations system; we have worked closely on Antarctic issues, and have been in many of the same peacekeeping theatres, including Afghanistan.

"Our relationship is reinforced by New Zealand's Italian community, and a healthy level of tourism with has potential to grow further, especially given Italy's involvement in next year's Rugby World Cup."

Until recently, Dr Matheson was New Zealand's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and has previously been posted to Geneva, Canberra, and the Cook Islands.  He takes up his posting in Rome in February, replacing Laurie Markes.
