Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples applauds the spirit of co-operation among all the parties involved in bringing Whanau Ora to fruition.

"We have iwi kainga, Government Ministers, the Governance Group and Regional Leadership Groups and representatives of service providers all coming together today to mark this important milestone," said Dr Sharples.

"The turnout of people to the hui shows they understand the importance of working together to make this kaupapa succeed," he said. "This is a testament to the vision and leadership of the Minister in Charge of Whanau Ora, Tariana

Turia, and I am proud to be her colleague."

Dr Sharples noted the role that Te Puni Kokiri plays as the lead government agency, saying his department had a strong track record in community and whanau development.

"Oranga Whanau and Kaitoko Whanau are two programmes that follow similar principles to whanau ora," said Dr Sharples.

"We already have over 70 dedicated people working at community level, to help families deal with many interconnected, and often complex, social issues. They help the whanau devise their own plan, and then mobilise support from government and non-government agencies.

"We have kuia visiting young mothers and fathers, to encourage and teach them how to get their families established and running smoothly, the way they raised their own families," said Dr Sharples.

"Many of the community groups involved in Kaitoko Whanau and Oranga Whanau are also part of the collectives that will deliver Whanau Ora. I am sure the experience they have already gained will benefit the Whanau Ora programme, and the same goes for the Te Puni Kokiri staff who have been running these whanau development programmes," said Dr Sharples.
