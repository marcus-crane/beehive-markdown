Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee today announced the members of the new Electricity Authority.

The Electricity Authority will be established on 1 November 2010, replacing the Electricity Commission under the provisions of the new Electricity Industry Act 2010, which came into force on 5 October.  The Electricity Authority will be responsible for promoting competition, reliable supply and efficient operation of the electricity market for the long-term benefit of consumers.

Dr Brent Layton, a former senior fellow and chief executive of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, has been appointed as chair.

Dr Layton also chaired the Electricity Technical Advisory Group, which undertook the review of the electricity sector last year, and has just completed chairing the Electricity Authority Establishment Board, which has overseen the transition from the Electricity Commission to the Authority.

Other board members are Susan Paterson and Elena Trout who, along with Dr Layton have been appointed for terms of five years, and David Bull and Roger Sowry, both of whom are Electricity Commission board members and have been appointed for 18 months.

"The appointments bring a strong mix of skills and experience to the Electricity Authority as well as providing for continuity between the work of the commission, the Electricity Authority establishment team and the new authority," Mr Brownlee said.

The establishment of the Electricity Authority is one of 29 measures the government is implementing to improve the performance of the electricity market.

The Electricity Authority will be an independent Crown entity under the Crown Entities Act.  Its key functions are:

- making and administering the rules governing the electricity industry through an Electricity Industry Participation Code;

<!--THE END-->

- monitoring compliance with the code and other provisions in the Electricity Industry Act and regulations and take enforcement action;

<!--THE END-->

- undertaking market facilitation measures such as education and providing guidelines, information and model arrangements;

<!--THE END-->

- industry and market monitoring, and carrying out reviews, studies and inquiries into matters relating to the industry; and

<!--THE END-->

- contracting for market operation services and system operator services.
