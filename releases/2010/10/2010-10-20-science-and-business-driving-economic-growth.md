High-quality research and cutting-edge business development will form a winning partnership in the Government's new Technology Transfer Voucher scheme, says Research, Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp.

"Research and development is a key driver of economic growth. Technology Transfer Vouchers provide businesses with a tool to get more knowledge and technology from the science sector and build success in the marketplace.

"The smart application of science and technology will accelerate business growth. The voucher programme creates a tool to enhance the necessary connections between the science and business sectors," he said.

 "It is crucial that we get the best out of our scientific research, to support the business growth and innovation which will benefit all New Zealanders."

Dr Mapp announced the six research organisations who will lead the first phase of the voucher programme at WelTec's Petone campus today. They are:

- The University of Auckland
- Industrial Research Limited
- The University of Canterbury
- Auckland University of Technology
- The University of Otago
- The Wellington Institute of Technology

"We are making a start with these six organisations. More will be brought on board next year," the Minister said.

The programme is one of the new R&D initiatives announced in the May Budget. The vouchers enable businesses to access research services and expertise for a specific R&D project. They are targeted at businesses that have limited or no in-house R&D capability of their own.

The programme, run by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, will provide a business with 50 per cent funding to redeem with one of the six research organisations.

Businesses will be able to apply for a voucher from the Foundation from 1 November.

**Technology Transfer Vouchers: how they work**

In the May 2010 Budget, new funding of $20 million over the next four years was announced to set up Technology Transfer Vouchers. Five million dollars is available in the 2010/2011 year.

The objective of the voucher programme is to bring more technology and knowledge from the science sector to the business community.

Vouchers will provide a business with 50 per cent funding to enable access to research services and expertise from accredited publicly funded research organisations for a specific R&D project.

Voucher values may range from a minimum of $100,000 to a maximum of $1 million. It is expected that most vouchers issued will be in the $100,000 to $200,000 range - with matched co-funding required from businesses. For example, if a business receives a voucher worth $200,000 then its contribution is also $200,000, making $400,000 available for purchase of R&D from a research organisation.

Vouchers will only be awarded to businesses with limited or no  in-house R&D capability, and with well defined problems or ideas that will benefit from the R&D expertise and services in a research organisation.

The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology will administer the new voucher programme. It will be welcoming applications from businesses for vouchers from 1 November this year. The Foundation will assess these applications and award vouchers to suitable businesses.

Businesses with a Technology Transfer Voucher will be able to redeem these with one of the selected research organisations, to tap into knowledge and expertise in the science sector.
