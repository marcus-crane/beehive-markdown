Education Minister Anne Tolley will travel to the UK and France between 29 October and 8 November, and will vice-chair the meeting of OECD Education Ministers in Paris.

The OECD meeting will focus on tackling the effects of the economic crisis on education, matching skills to new needs, equipping effective teachers for the 21st century and reinforcing the social benefits of education.

"This meeting will give us the opportunity to showcase the New Zealand education system, and to learn from the experiences of other countries," says Mrs Tolley.

"As Vice-Chair I will also have the opportunity to shape the direction of conversations at the meeting, and from there the ongoing work that is agreed upon."

Mrs Tolley will be responsible for co-chairing a high level public policy forum, and will also take part in the consultations with the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) and Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC).

In addition to the OECD meeting, Mrs Tolley will meet Ministers and officials in London and Edinburgh and visit a number of schools.
