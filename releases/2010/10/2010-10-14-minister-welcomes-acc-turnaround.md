ACC's marked improvement in performance is welcomed and puts the scheme on to a path of financial sustainability, ACC Minister Nick Smith says.

ACC's Annual Report for 2009/10 tabled in Parliament today shows the net liability has reduced from $12.8 billion in 2008/09 to $10.3 billion. This follows losses of $2.4 billion in 2007/08 and a further $4.8 billion in 2008/09.

"This positive result is a real credit to ACC which has worked hard to improve rehabilitation rates and better control costs," Dr Smith said. "The turnaround also reflects the recovery in international investment markets, a drop in claim numbers, reversals of unfunded scheme extensions introduced in 2008 and increased revenue from more realistic levies.

"The $2.5 billion improvement in ACC's books does not represent a cash surplus but a reduction in debt. With liabilities still exceeding assets by $10.3 billion, it is going to require many years of tight financial management to close this gap and meet the legal requirement of full funding by 2019.

"New Zealanders should welcome this positive turnaround as ACC's massive losses of previous years negatively impacted on the country's finances and threatened the sustainability of the scheme. These improvements give confidence to all New Zealanders that we can afford quality care if they have an accident and that we will not need significant levy increases to keep the scheme afloat."
