Foreign Minister Murray McCully heads to Brussels this evening to attend the eighth Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) along with Deputy Prime Minister Bill English.

"This is an historic occasion for New Zealand, as it is the first time we will be taking a seat at the top table of a meeting of Asian and European leaders," Mr McCully said.

"ASEM is a biennial summit that brings together Heads of State and Ministers from 46 Asian and European countries. The President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the Secretary-General of ASEAN also participate.

"Leaders will discuss a broad range of issues including global and economic governance, sustainable development, security, and people-to-people links.

"New Zealand's membership of ASEM is recognition of the strength of our friendships, and the importance of our ties with both Asia and Europe. It is also further enhances our position as a natural link between Europe and Asia, two parts of the world in which we move with familiarity and enjoy close, long-standing relationships," Mr McCully said. 

New Zealand will be joined by Australia and Russia as new participants at this year's summit, which is being held in  Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.
