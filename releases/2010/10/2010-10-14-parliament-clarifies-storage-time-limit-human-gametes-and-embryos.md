Justice Minister Simon Power is welcoming the passing last night of a law to give people clarity on how long they can store their human sperm, eggs, and embryos.

"This amendment makes it clear that the law on the 10-year storage limit starts from 22 November 2004, the date of the original act, or from when storage began, whichever is latest," Mr Power said.

"This means that gametes and embryos stored before 2004 can be stored until November 2014, because the law is not being applied retrospectively."

Mr Power said the Human and Reproductive Technology (Storage) Amendment Act was needed after a legal opinion questioned the common understanding of the 2004 legislation.

"The legal opinion raised concerns that the 10-year limit started from whenever human sperm, egg, or embryo was stored, meaning any person who had stored for more than 10 years was breaking the law.

"Making the rules as clear as possible is important because in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) has been used in New Zealand since 1983 and now results in about 900 IVF babies born each year.

"If fertility clinics have clients who wish to extend storage beyond 2014, they will require approval from the ethics committee before the 10-year storage limit is up."

The Minister of Health, Tony Ryall, has asked the Advisory Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ACART) to develop guidelines for the ethics committee to decide applications for extended storage. 

Once the guidelines have been finalised, applications for extended storage can be submitted to the ethics committee.
