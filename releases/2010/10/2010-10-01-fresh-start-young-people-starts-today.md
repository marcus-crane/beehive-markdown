From today, the National Government's Fresh Start package provides a new approach for serious youth offenders and at-risk young people.

"We have to intervene early to make a real difference to at risk young people," says Minister of Social Development Paula Bennett.

The legislation, aimed at the worst 1,000 young offenders provides greater Youth Court powers, including extending jurisdiction to 12 and 13 year olds and tougher, more effective sentences.

"Vitally, we have given Youth Court judges the ability to impose greater interventions to deal with the root causes of offending," says Ms Bennett.

The Youth Court has new powers under Fresh Start to issue a range of compulsory orders, with longer interventions such as mentoring and drug and alcohol programmes along with tougher, more effective sentences.

Youth Court jurisdiction has been extended to include 12 or 13 year olds accused of serious offences

Youth Court Judges have the option of placing young offenders on nine different programmes from military style activity camps to mentoring, parenting and alcohol and drug rehabilitation programmes.

"This Government is committed to making a real difference to the lives of risk young people," says Ms Bennett. 

"We have given Youth Court judges the power to issue new orders which tackle the root problems of youth offending," says Ms Bennett.

"Fresh Start recognises that to turn these young lives around, we have to treat each situation as unique and find solutions that fit the person," says Ms Bennett

"Rather than fitting them to the solutions available," says Ms Bennett.

Fresh Start will cost $84 million over the next three years.
