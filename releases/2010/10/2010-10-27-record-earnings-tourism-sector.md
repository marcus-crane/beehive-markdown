Spending by international and domestic tourists increased to $22.4 billion for the year ended March 2010, Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman confirmed today.

The latest government figures show spending by international tourists in New Zealand increased by 1.6 percent, or $150 million, to $9.5 billion. Domestic expenditure rose to $12.9 billion, a 2.5 percent increase on the previous year.

‘'These record figures are very encouraging for the tourism sector and shows the industry has weathered the economic downturn well,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'Many countries have experienced a decline in international tourism over the past 18 months, but we have bucked the trend. With the Rugby World Cup next year, the sector will grow even further so things are really looking up.'' 

The increasing number of Australian arrivals was the major contributor to the growth in international expenditure. A report earlier this year also showed New Zealand's international arrivals are expected to increase by 6.8 percent in 2011 to 2.7 million visitors

‘'The Government continues to actively support the sector with an additional $30 million in Budget 2010 for tourism,'' Dr Coleman says. 

‘'This follows on from an extra $20 million for Tourism New Zealand last year.  This report shows that investment is already paying dividends.'' 

Other key findings from today's report show tourism generated $1.7 billion in GST revenue and adds $61 million a day to the New Zealand economy.
