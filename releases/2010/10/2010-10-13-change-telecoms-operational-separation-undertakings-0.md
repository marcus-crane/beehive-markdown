Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has approved a variation to Telecom's operational separation undertakings, which came into force in March 2008.

On 24 May 2010, Telecom sought a fourth variation to its operational separation undertakings within the context of the Government's Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative.

"Following a review by the Ministry of Economic Development, which included a call for public submissions, I wrote to Telecom's chief executive Dr Paul Reynolds indicating that I was not prepared to accept the variation as originally proposed," says Mr Joyce.

"However I indicated I was prepared to approve a number of changes to the undertakings, subject to Dr Reynolds' acceptance of certain conditions.

"Dr Reynolds' has since provided a revised proposed variation that addresses all the conditions, and I have informed him that I have approved the proposal.

"I believe these changes will serve the best interests of consumers and also allow Telecom to develop services and systems that are consistent with changes being brought about by the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative," Mr Joyce says.

The final agreed revised undertakings are available, along with background on Telecom's request, at [www.med.govt.nz/operational-separation/variation4](http://www.med.govt.nz/operational-separation/variation4).
