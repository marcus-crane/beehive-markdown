Earthquake recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has congratulated Fletcher Construction on its appointment by the Earthquake Commission to run its Canterbury earthquake project management office.

The office will coordinate and manage building repairs valued at approximately $10,000 up to $100,000. 

The project management approach allows the EQC to swiftly deliver high standard repairs while controlling costs.

"I'd like to thank all parties who tendered for this vitally important role, and congratulate Fletcher Construction on being chosen to coordinate the moderate to serious repairs necessary on about 50,000 homes in Canterbury.

"That such a comprehensive tender process has been managed so swiftly is a credit to the Earthquake Commission, and that Fletcher Construction will have people on the ground from Monday is great news for the many people whose homes suffered damage in the quake.

"I'm confident Cantabrians will benefit from the strength of a major construction firm managing the process, while local builders will get a fair share of the work.

"For residents to be able to see project management sites set up in their suburbs and builders getting on with the job will come as a great relief I'm sure," Mr Brownlee said.

Claims for damage above EQC's cap of $100,000 plus GST will be handled by commercial insurers in accordance with their policies.
