Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced the establishment of an independent taskforce on early childhood education (ECE).

The taskforce will review the effectiveness of ECE spending, propose innovative ideas about learning and report to the Minister in March 2011.

The investment in early childhood education next year will total $1.3 billion.

"It's vital this money is well spent to ensure the greatest number of children gain access to ECE and fully benefit from it," says Mrs Tolley.

"The previous Government's ECE cost blow-out saw funding treble but the number of children in ECE grew by less than one percent," says Mrs Tolley.

"We owe it to New Zealand children to do better than that, particularly for our Maori and Pacific children and those in lower socio-economic backgrounds," says Mrs Tolley.

"We are determined to reach those children and families who need it most and to give every single child the best possible start in life," says Mrs Tolley.

The taskforce will:

- undertake a full review of the value gained from Government investments in early childhood education

<!--THE END-->

- consider the efficiency and effectiveness of current ECE expenditure and possible improvements for Māori, Pasifika, and children from low socio-economic backgrounds

<!--THE END-->

- develop innovative, cost effective and evidence-based ways to support children's learning in early childhood and the first years of compulsory schooling

<!--THE END-->

- make recommendations to Government about proposed changes to funding and policy settings for early childhood education, and the costs, benefits and risks
