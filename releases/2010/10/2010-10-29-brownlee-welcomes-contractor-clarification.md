Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the passing of The Employment Relations (Film Production Work) Amendment Bill.

"The passing of the bill confirms that the Hobbit movies will be made in New Zealand, ensuring the income streams of thousands of New Zealanders.

"This is great for the Wellington region, and these very large productions will have positive implications for many other New Zealanders.

"The legislative clarification is also a signal to investors throughout the world that New Zealand is a place that values the creative industries, and we expect to see a steady flow of further investment in the years ahead."
