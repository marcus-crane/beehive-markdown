The Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully and the Minister of Justice Simon Power are welcoming the election of Justice Lowell Goddard to the United Nations Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture.

Justice Goddard, who is the chair of the Independent Police Conduct Authority, was elected in Geneva this morning (New Zealand time).

"We are delighted that Justice Goddard has been elected to this important body," the Ministers said.

"We were pleased to support her candidature and are confident she will achieve a great deal during her term of service."

Fifty-five countries, including New Zealand, have signed up to the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT), which establishes the subcommittee.

By doing so they agree to grant the subcommittee unrestricted access to their national facilities.

Subcommittee members play a vital role in preventing torture throughout the world, inspecting places of detention, and making recommendations and observations concerning the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. 

States are required to examine the recommendations of the subcommittee and enter into dialogue with it on possible implementation measures.

**Background**

Justice Goddard was made a judge of the High Court in 1995. She was Deputy Solicitor-General between 1992-1995.

The Independent Police Conduct Authority considers complaints against the Police and oversees their conduct. The authority has been designated under the OPCAT to monitor conditions of detention and treatment of detainees in Police custody in New Zealand.
