Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, John Key, today unveiled the plans for Queens Wharf for next year's Rugby World Cup celebrations.

"For six weeks next year Queens Wharf will be a hub of activity for our international visitors and New Zealanders.  It will be a place where we watch rugby games, enjoy live music and festival events, wow international guests and media with views of Auckland's stunning harbour, and showcase the best of New Zealand with displays and events."

The redeveloped Queens Wharf will feature landscaped open areas and a multi-purpose temporary facility named The Cloud.   Shed 10 will also be refurbished and remain on site.

The Cloud will be able to hold almost 6,000 people and will be used for concerts and festival events, as a fan zone during RWC matches, and for showcasing and hosting.

The mezzanine space at the harbour end of The Cloud will be used as an international media lounge and for VIP hosting. 

The Cloud will also host a Tourism New Zealand i-Site, where trained staff will help to promote the REAL New Zealand festival and regional and national tourist attractions.

"This is an exciting design, which alongside developments in the Wynyard Quarter will do a great job opening up the Auckland waterfront to the public and the 85,000 overseas visitors that will travel here for the Rugby World Cup.

"Queens Wharf will be at the heart of the celebrations next year. The facilities on the wharf will not only enable the public to enjoy the games in a unique atmosphere, but offer live events and a great venue to showcase the best of New Zealand."

Mr Key says redevelopment work is already underway and on schedule to be finished in time for the Rugby World Cup.

Queens Wharf will be open every day from late morning throughout the 45 days of the Rugby World Cup.
