Disability Issues Minister Tariana  
Turia has today welcomed the release of the *Start Strong Draft Framework for*  
*Action* report.

Mrs Turia says it is important that  
the Government understands what the priority areas are for them and how  
government agencies can work with disabled children and their families to better  
deliver services and provide support.

"Children regardless of abilities need  
the very best start in life and families knowing where they can access support  
and assistance is very important.

"Sometimes this assistance can come  
from family and friends and at other times from caring people in the  
community.

"Seamless service provision is very  
important as is integrated support systems," says Mrs Turia. 

"I acknowledge the Start Strong report  
as giving much needed information to the Government agencies, non-government  
agencies and families."
