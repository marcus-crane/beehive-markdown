Transport Minister Steven Joyce today released a new report which looks at several current issues in the sea-freight industry from an economic perspective.

The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) report - commissioned by the Ministry of Transport - looks at the merits and likelihood of three possible future scenarios for international freight services:

- Hubbing New Zealand's international trade through Australia.
- Having two main container ports in New Zealand.
- A reduction in ship operators servicing the New Zealand market.

"The report considers each against the status quo and concludes all are marginally less beneficial to the economy than the natural evolution of the ports sector," Mr Joyce says.

"It also concludes there is likely to be strong competition in the shipping industry over the next few years as the global economy takes time to recover from recession.

"The report proposes that the best approach for Government is to leave final decisions in the hands of shippers and let ports react to those with their own investment decisions. That is consistent with the Government's view.

"Attempts to pre-empt future likely market developments are unlikely to produce better results for the economy. The best role for Government is to ensure the right price signals are in place and land-based infrastructure such as roads and rail can meet the needs of the freight industry as it evolves.

"NZIER's report adds to the debate about maritime transport, and I look forward to further discussions with the industry to reach a common understanding of its likely future," Mr Joyce says.
