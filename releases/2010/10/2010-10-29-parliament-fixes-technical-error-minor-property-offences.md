Parliament today passed an amendment to the Summary Proceedings Act to address a technical error which has resulted in the misclassification of approximately 46,000 minor property offences since June 2008.

Justice Minister Simon Power said the misclassification, which arose out of an amendment made in June 2008, was identified in a recent case in the district court. 

"The amendment was intended to make some minor property offences purely summary offences to be heard by a judge alone.

"However, it technically did the opposite, meaning offences such as shop-lifting and theft from a vehicle became purely indictable offences, requiring trial by jury."

The offences affected are those where the value of the property does not exceed $500, and are punishable by no more than three months' imprisonment.

"The misclassification meant many of these proceedings could have been challenged in court because they were tried by a judge, when technically they should have been tried by a jury.

"Leaving the June 2008 amendment as it was could have resulted in convictions challenged and nullified before the appellate courts, and had high cost and resource implications because future proceedings would have had to have been tried by a jury."

Mr Power said the technical error does not undermine the fairness or appropriateness of the convictions.

"The amendment means these minor offences will now be tried, as intended, by a judge alone, as well as validating the proceedings that have already occurred."

A long-term solution will be included in the upcoming Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill, which aims to abolish the terms ‘summary' and ‘indictable', along with the overly complex system of offence classification.

The Government intends to introduce the legislation before the end of the year.
