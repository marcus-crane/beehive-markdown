Māori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says the Waitangi Tribunal report on te Reo Māori tackles a vital issue of great concern to Māori people - the future of the language.

"Our reo is a key marker of our identity as Māori people," said Dr Sharples. "In the words of Sir James Henare: Ko te reo te mauri o te mana Māori."

"Since the Tribunal's report on the Te Reo Māori claim in 1986, the cultural landscape has been transformed by the efforts of Māori communities to revitalise their reo," he said.

"But we are not out of the woods by any means, and this report makes that fact absolutely clear. The Tribunal was prompted by the serious concerns of claimants, to turn what is in fact a chapter in the broader WAI 262 report, concerning the rangatiratanga of taonga generally, into a mini-report on te reo Māori," he said.

"The Tribunal also advanced the publication of this chapter to assist the Ministerial Review Panel, which I established in July this year to review the Māori language strategy and sector.

"I really appreciate the Tribunal's thought, and I can say their report identifies many of the same concerns that led me to establish the independent review panel," he said.

"The Tribunal's report underlines the importance of Māori communities in revitalising the language, and that Māori ownership of the Māori language strategy is crucial to its success. Māori are key players in the revival process, and the support of the Crown is essential," said Dr Sharples.

"As Minister of Māori Affairs, I accept responsibility for the Crown's role in the survival and development of te reo Māori. I am sure the government can do more, and do it better, to support te reo Māori and the communities who are the kaitiaki of their reo," he said.

"I look forward to reading the report in more detail, and considering the Tribunal's findings. The Tribunal itself notes that this is in effect a provisional report, and has called for responses from the parties to WAI 262.

"Because of that I will not be commenting in detail on the report's findings at this stage. I also do not want to pre-empt the findings of the independent review panel," said Dr Sharples.
