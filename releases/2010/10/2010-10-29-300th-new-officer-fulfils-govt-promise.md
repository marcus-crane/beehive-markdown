Police Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the 300th additional Police officer to Counties-Manukau, and said that extra Police in the district were having a positive impact on crime.

Ms Collins visited Counties-Manukau Police District Headquarters in South Auckland to mark the milestone and to meet the district's newest Police officers.

"The Government pledged to put an extra 300 officers on the frontline in Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010. This week, we have seen the fulfilment of that pledge to the people of this district," Ms Collins said.

"Nothing deters criminals like plenty of Police on the beat. Increasing the numbers of frontline Police in Counties-Manukau has not only put more officers into neighbourhoods, but it has enabled Police to try new strategies to reduce crime.

"A number of new initiatives, such as Public Safety Teams and Major Crime Teams, were launched late last year and I'm advised that the impact on crime was immediate."

In the 2009/2010 fiscal year, recorded crime in Counties-Manukau dropped 3.3 percent.

"These reductions in recorded crime reflect the tremendous work by staff in  Counties-Manukau," Ms Collins said.

"This is an encouraging sign; however we won't be taking the pressure off the criminals anytime soon. There is still a lot of work to be done."

The 300th new officer in Counties-Manukau is Simon Wallis, aged 28. He started work on Tuesday and will be based at Manurewa.

"I would like to welcome Simon to Counties-Manukau. He will be part of a highly visible, highly trained and highly motivated Police service that is pushing back the influence of criminals in this district," Ms Collins said.

As well as the officers in Counties-Manukau, an additional 300 extra frontline officers will be deployed around the rest of the country by the end of 2011.
