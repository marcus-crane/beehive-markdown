The Screen Production and Development Association (SPADA), Actors' Equity, and Council of Trade Unions representatives met today, in a meeting facilitated by Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee.

It was a useful and productive discussion.

The parties have agreed to work together to update the conditions of engagement for performers in the New Zealand screen production industry.

The parties believe this process will help to ensure New Zealand remains an attractive screen production environment.

No further comment will be made.
