Canterbury community organisations will be able to use a special emergency fund to move to new premises if their building suffered serious earthquake damage.

The Government initiated a special $7.5 million round of the Community Response Fund to cover the costs of increased demand on Canterbury community organisations last month.

Acting Social Development Minister Judith Collins has now announced the fund has been broadened so community organisations can draw on it to relocate premises.

"We checked with community organisations in Canterbury and found that 15% have badly damaged buildings and need to move," says Ms Collins.

"This funding will mean those organisations can do whatever they need to continue providing services to the community," says Ms Collins.

The $7.5 million Fund is an extension of the Government's Community Response Fund that was set up nearly two years ago to help family support services cope with the recession.  

"Already nearly 60 organisations have applied for the new funding with over $500,000 granted so far," says Ms Collins.

Organisations can apply for the Fund through [www.familyservices.govt.nz](http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/). 

Alternatively, they can call 0800 777 100 and request an application form which will be sent to them.
