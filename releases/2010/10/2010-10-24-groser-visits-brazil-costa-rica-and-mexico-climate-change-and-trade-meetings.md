Minister of Trade and International Climate Change Negotiations, Tim Groser, will travel to Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico from 24 October - 6 November, to attend a range of climate change meetings and fulfil a trade-related bilateral programme.

In Brazil Mr Groser will attend and deliver the keynote address at the  renowned International Food and Agriculture Trade Policy Council (IPC) forum, examining the linkages between climate change and the trade and agriculture agenda.  

He will also undertake a bilateral programme, promoting further trade and business links between the two countries.  Mr Groser will be leading a delegation of New Zealand business leaders who will be in Sao Paulo, the commercial engine of the Brazilian economy.

"Brazil is an economic powerhouse," said Mr Groser. "There is enormous potential for New Zealand businesses in Brazil." 

"I want to help demonstrate to Brazil that, in addition to our dairy and agri-technology expertise, New Zealand has world-class capability in a number of niche areas of manufacturing and design." 

Brazil's economy is worth US$1.97 trillion.  It is projected to become the world's fourth largest economy by 2050.

"Brazil is a global player on a number of international issues that matter to New Zealand, such as climate change and the World Trade Organisation negotiations," said Mr Groser.

In Costa Rica Mr Groser will attend an informal climate change dialogue, before travelling on to Mexico to attend a preparatory meeting ahead of the major UN Climate Change meeting to be held in Cancun in December.  The meeting will convene select, key Ministers responsible for climate change and aims to prepare the ground for the Cancun negotiations.

"These meetings will cover the most important issues to the negotiations," Mr Groser said. "It is important that we consider the steps we may be able make at Cancun, at a political level."
