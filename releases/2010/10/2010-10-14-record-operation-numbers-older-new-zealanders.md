93,000 New Zealanders over 65 received the surgical operations they needed in 2009/10 - 10,500 more people than in 2007/2008. This includes elective and urgent acute surgery.

"That's a 13% increase in the number of older New Zealanders getting the operations they need since the National Government took office," says Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"And we are fixing the health system by providing more services for older New Zealanders," Mr Ryall says.

"After a damning Auditor General's report of rest home auditing under the previous government, this Government saw the need for urgent improvement - and we acted quickly."

"We have introduced spot auditing of rest homes, auditing the auditors and publishing audit reports online so that older New Zealanders and their families can make informed choices.

"We are also funding an extra $88 million over two years to improve the quality of nursing supervision in rest homes and to increase aged care subsidies.

"Family members caring for older New Zealanders at home can get more of a break now the government has funded an additional $5 million a year for respite beds. We are also boosting funding for hospices by $60 million over four years.

"The government has given Age Concern an extra $200,000 to expand their Accredited Visiting Service into all district health boards - this valuable service aims to improve the health of older people living in the community by reducing social isolation and loneliness."

"Having good social networks has been identified by older people themselves as one of the "Big 4" most serious issues facing them. The other three issues they say are attitudes, income and health - and Aged Concern has welcomed the Government's further strengthening of health services in the last budget."

Mr Ryall says that District Health Boards are spending more on home support for older people assessed as needing it, and they're planning to spend more again next year. This year around 75,000 people have received home support - around 15, 000 of them came on, and around 15,000 stopped receiving it.

"We are already making significant improvements to health care for older New Zealanders but practical, ground breaking studies like our recently commissioned and completed Aged Residential Care Review will better inform our planning for the future of aged care," Mr Ryall says.

The ARC Review was a collaboration between aged residential care providers, DHBs and the Ministry of Health and describes future demand and capacity over the next ten to twenty years.
