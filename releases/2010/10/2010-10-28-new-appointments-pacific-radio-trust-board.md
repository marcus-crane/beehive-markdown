Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today announced the appointment of Sandra Kailahi and Uluomatootua Saulaulu Aiono to the National Pacific Radio Trust board. 

Sandra Kailahi is a presenter and producer with TVNZ 7 news. For 11 years she was a part of the TVNZ Tagata Pasifika team and in 1993 helped establish Radio 531 PI.

Ulu Aiono is the founder of a software company and chairs the Pacific Island Chamber of Commerce and The Peoples' Centre Trust. Mr Aiono is also a member of the Auckland Regional Economic Development Forum and a council member of the Auckland University of Technology.

Mr Aiono and Ms Kailahi were appointed for three years from 1 October 2010.

‘'The new board members have a good mix of business and journalism experience and that will add good value to the board,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'I would also like to thank outgoing trustees Ken Williams, Maureen Passmore and Jeannie Pera for their work.''

Today's announcement follows the appointment earlier this year of chartered accountant Willy Johnston to the board for three years. Mr Johnston is a member of the Unitec Business Advisory Board. He is also involved with numerous community groups including the Samoan Sports Association.

The National Pacific Radio Trust is responsible for maintaining the national Pacific radio network which includes Radio 531pi and the Niu FM Radio Network.
