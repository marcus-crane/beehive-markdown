Canterbury business owners and managers will have access to fully-funded training to help them recover from the effects of the recent earthquake, Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee announced today.

"We know from feedback that businesspeople are seeking access to information and advice to assist in the recovery process, which is why we are setting aside $100,000 to fund specific training workshops for businesses in Christchurch city, the Selwyn district and North Canterbury during the next six months."

The training will be jointly organised by the Canterbury Development Corporation and the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce, and delivered by training providers throughout the region.

"The aim is to help businesses return to normal trading as soon as possible and set them up for future growth," Mr Brownlee said.

"It will also provide a way for businesses to use existing relationships and form new networks that will help the region recover.

"The training will be available to the owners or managers of any Canterbury business which is commercially trading.  The first workshops are expected to start on October 20."

Three-hour training workshops will cover aspects such as managing cash flow, debt recovery and credit management, retaining customers, destination marketing, and collaboration techniques.

Funding for the training is being made available through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, the government's economic development agency.
