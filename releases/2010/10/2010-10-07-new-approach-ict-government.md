Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a major new framework for the government's use of information and communications technology (ICT) today.

"*Directions and Priorities for Government ICT* sets the policy direction for the government's use of ICT and requires Ministers, chief executives and officials to work together to better manage this investment.

"ICT is a $2 billion spend for the government and any savings or efficiencies this move creates will make a real difference down the track.

"We want to ensure that taxpayer money is invested wisely and that we get value for money. A 2008 survey found that much of this ICT spend is fragmented and duplicated.

"It's important that government agencies coordinate their planning, purchasing and delivery of ICT services. This is an important way of achieving better services for the public and reducing costs through reuse and economies of scale.

"Cabinet has agreed that *Directions and Priorities for Government ICT* will replace the 2006 eGovernment Strategy, and implementation will begin immediately.

"Responsibility for this programme, including the functions of the Government Chief Information Officer and the strategic leadership of ICT, will transfer from the State Services Commission to the Department of Internal Affairs."
