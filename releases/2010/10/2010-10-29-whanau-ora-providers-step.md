Acting Minister for Social Development Judith Collins welcomes the announcement of 25 successful Whanau Ora providers.

"These providers from across New Zealand will be charged with effecting transformative change among whanau and families," says Ms Collins.

Whanau Ora contracts will be focused on results, meaning providers will be held accountable for what they achieve with Government funding.

"We're offering integrated contracts to these providers, allowing them to focus on helping families, not filling forms out and ticking boxes," says Ms Collins.

Whanau Ora aims to transform social service delivery in order to respond to the needs of whanau as a whole, rather than individuals. 

To do this, providers will need to work collaboratively with each other, government agencies and with families and whanau.

"This Government recognises millions of dollars have been poured into high-needs families over the years without making a substantial difference, so now we're doing things differently," says Ms Collins.

"Whanau Ora is just one of many Government initiatives to empower families to take more responsibility for their own development," says Ms Collins.
