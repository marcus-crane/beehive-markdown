The by-election for the seat of Mana will take place on Saturday 20 November, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

"As Labour MP Winnie Laban has given notice, her resignation will be effective from Friday 15 October. I have been advised it is appropriate to now set a date for the by-election," says Mr Key.

"This means that Writ Day will be Wednesday 20 October. The last date for candidate nominations to be received will be Wednesday 27 October, and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Thursday 9 December 2010."
