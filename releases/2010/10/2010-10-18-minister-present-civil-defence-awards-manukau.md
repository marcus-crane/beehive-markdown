The Civil Defence awards are designed to complement existing awards, including New Zealand royal honours and mayoral awards.

"Emergencies will happen to communities - we don't know when or where, but we know that they will strike," says Mr Carter.

"The earthquake in Canterbury is a reminder of just this fact, and serves to remind us that we can't eliminate risk completely. However Civil Defence volunteers play an integral and extremely important part in responding to such events.

"I am delighted to be making the presentations to these Manukau volunteers who are all receiving long service awards. All these people have made significant contributions and deserve recognition at a national level," says Mr Carter.

Mr Carter introduced the awards October 2009, to recognise the work done by volunteers and career personnel in Civil Defence.
