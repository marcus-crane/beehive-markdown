Trans-Tasman travel becomes easier today as SmartGate begins operating at Christchurch International Airport, Customs Minister Maurice Williamson says.

Mr Williamson today officially launched SmartGate for trans-Tasman passengers arriving at Christchurch International Airport.

SmartGate is a kiosk and gate system that uses face recognition biometric technology and the information stored in a microchip inside e-passports to perform the identity check usually conducted by a Customs officer.

The system, officially opened at Auckland Airport in December last year and at Wellington Airport in June and has been used by 420,000 travellers.

"This high level of uptake highlights how incredibly successful the SmartGate system has been since it was launched just over ten months ago," Mr Williamson says.

"The third stage in the implementation of SmartGate will provide more travellers the opportunity to use this exciting technology. More than 50 percent of eligible passport holders are already using SmartGate in Auckland and Wellington."

"It allows Customs to focus important resources on higher-risk passengers and operate more efficiently."

Mr Williamson says SmartGate is part of a wider Government work programme to streamline travel between New Zealand and Australia.

"We are very pleased with the early success of SmartGate and the very effective joint effort which the Australian government and other border agencies have lent to that success."

SmartGate is expected to begin operating for departure processing at Auckland Airport by the end of this year.
