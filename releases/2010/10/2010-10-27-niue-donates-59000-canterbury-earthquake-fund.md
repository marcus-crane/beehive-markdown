Niue has today donated $59,000 to the Canterbury Earthquake Fund, Associate Finance Minister Simon Power announced.

The Premier of Niue, Toke Talagi, presented the cheque on behalf of the people of Niue to Mr Power on the eve of the annual Pacific Forum Economic Ministers' Meeting in Niue.

Mr Talagi said he was humbled but delighted to be able to make such a donation.

He said it was important that Niue made the contribution from its own funds, and therefore the Niue Philatellic and Numismatic Company provided the Government with an additional contribution to the very generous funds raised by the community at large.

"The people of Niue have a close affinity with New Zealand and we wanted to help the people of Canterbury as they recover from the earthquake," Mr Talagi said.

"There are not many of us but we wanted to do something."

Mr Power said he was grateful for Niue's gesture.

"This is extremely generous coming from such a small population in the Pacific.

"I can assure the people of Niue that this money will help make a difference to the recovery of Canterbury.

"It is extremely generous and won't be forgotten."
