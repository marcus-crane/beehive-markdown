Agriculture Minister David Carter today congratulated the four South Island projects and one North Island project, on their successful applications to the newly expanded Community Irrigation Fund.

Mr Carter says the projects will gain nearly $2 million \[$1,896,120 GST inclusive] to help fund technical design work for irrigation schemes.

"The effort and cost required to get a local water storage or irrigation scheme underway is considerable, and in many cases, too burdensome for communities to carry, Mr Carter says.

"Yet it is reliable water storage and irrigation that is the foundation for success in New Zealand's rural communities.

"That's why the eligibility criteria for accessing the Community Irrigation Fund was widened in July of this year to include technical design work.

"By contributing to the cost of robust design work, the Government is supporting the development of assets that will help unlock the economic growth potential of irrigated agriculture and horticulture.

"The Community Irrigation Fund is about helping local communities and regional councils to first identify their own solutions to water storage and irrigation challenges, and supporting them to implement those solutions.

"However, this Government is also clear that its support for irrigation is not a case of development at any cost.

"Each of the successful applicants has demonstrated sound environmental standards and processes which means these projects will provide wider benefits to all water users.

"This government is focussed on boosting primary sector growth and water is an obvious creator of wealth, growth and productivity for the primary sector and New Zealand as a whole," Mr Carter says.

The five projects include:

- Maungaroa Irrigation Scheme, a new scheme in eastern Bay of Plenty that will pump and pipe water from the Kereru River to Te Kaha ($181k);
- Lee Valley Community Water Augmentation Storage Dam, a new in river dam in the Upper Lee River to service the Waimea Plains, Tasman ($995k);
- Hunter Downs Irrigation Scheme, a new scheme in South Canterbury distributing water from the Waitaki River via canals, pipes and pump stations ($276k);
- Mayfield Hinds Irrigation Scheme, Rangitata, upgrade of canal system to pipes ($158k);
- Ashburton Lyndhurst Irrigation Scheme, Rangitata, upgrade of canal system to pipes ($286k).

All sums include GST.
