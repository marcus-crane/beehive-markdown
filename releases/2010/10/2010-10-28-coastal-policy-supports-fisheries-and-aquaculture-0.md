Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Phil Heatley has welcomed the new New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (NZCPS) announced today by Conservation Minister, Kate Wilkinson.

The NZCPS sets out policies on coastal issues which impact on aquaculture and fisheries, including the protection of biodiversity and water quality, management of coastal hazard risks and a requirement that Councils recognise the potential value of aquaculture.

Mr Heatley says he is pleased the NZCPS aligns with the Government's objectives for aquaculture by recognising the importance of sustainable aquaculture development for economic growth.

"The fact that Councils and decision makers must now recognise the potential value of aquaculture and plan for it where appropriate, will undoubtedly help us to grow this valuable industry," says Mr Heatley.

"Inclusion of an aquaculture-specific policy sends a clear signal to councils they must consider the potential of aquaculture and recognise aquaculture's contribution to regional and national economies," he says. 

"Protecting biodiversity and water quality is also critical to fisheries and aquaculture development," he said.

The recently established Aquaculture Unit will be working with regional councils to help them plan for aquaculture.
