Health Minister Tony Ryall and Associate Minister Peter Dunne say there are more dental staff delivering front line public health services, and fewer pre-school and primary school age children are waiting for their scheduled appointments.

"In 2008, 20 per cent of pre-school and primary school age children were overdue for their scheduled appointments. This is expected to be 11 per cent by the end of this year.

"The Government's efforts in this area are starting to see benefits for more young New Zealanders.

"The total number of front line dental therapists and assistants employed by District Health Boards has increased by more than eight per cent between 2008 and 2009.

"The actual numbers have gone from 820 to 889, and DHBs are still recruiting.

Peter Dunne, the Associate Health Minister with responsibility for oral health, says fast-tracking the DHBs' oral health business cases has given this part of the public health service great momentum on the workforce and infrastructure fronts with the extra staff and new facilities. 

"And we are seeing improvements. Between 2008 and 2009, the number of pre-school and primary school aged children whose check ups were overdue has come down from 21% to 17%. And more progress will be made this year."

Mr Ryall say "The Government's investment in child and adolescent oral health means increasing numbers of pre school and primary aged school children and adolescents get access to good dental care, and we are seeing improvements."
