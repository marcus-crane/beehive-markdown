Drug treatment services for the Southern region were boosted today with the opening of an expanded residential service at Dunedin's Moana House.

The new wing, opened by Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman, will house six new residential beds for the treatment and rehabilitation of methamphetamine users. It increases the number of beds in the alcohol and drug treatment programme to 17.

The extra beds are being funded through the $23 million the Government has invested over three years in additional methamphetamine treatment services.

This will provide 60 new residential beds for P users across New Zealand. All the beds are expected to be full by November.

‘'It's important that people who are ready to quit can access the help they need,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'This Government has already launched a comprehensive plan to reduce the harm from methamphetamine, involving various Government agencies such as Police, Customs and the Health sector.

The $23 million for methamphetamine treatment services is in addition to the $111 million already spent on publicly funded addiction treatment services in the last financial year.

‘'Funding treatment services is a key part of the Government's fight against P. We need to increase capacity and provide better routes into treatment. That is why providers like Moana House are getting extra resources to continue their good work,'' says Dr Coleman.

‘'Moana House offers rehabilitation programmes for male offenders and the residents have an extensive history of drug and alcohol abuse. Providing rehabilitation for methamphetamine users with criminal backgrounds can help break the cycle of crime and abuse that P inflicts on people and communities.''

Moana House has been offering drug and alcohol residential programmes since 1987. The programme focuses on psychotherapy, work skills training and education. Moana House is also supported by the Department of Corrections and the Southern District Health Board.
