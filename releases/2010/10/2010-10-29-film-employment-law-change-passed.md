The security of workers in the film industry and The Hobbit in New Zealand has been secured with the passing of the Employment Relations (Film Production Work) Amendment Bill into law, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

"This law provides certainty to the film industry in New Zealand, an industry that is worth $2.8 billion to our economy. The two Hobbit films alone are worth $670 million.

"It clarifies what is already widespread industry practice - that actors, crew members and other production personnel in the film industry who sign on as independent contractors are just that, independent contractors. If they sign on as an employee, they are an employee," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The Government gave serious thought to how it would respond to the threat posed to the entire New Zealand film industry. While this is a direct response to ensure The Hobbit is filmed here, it is also in response to the fact that had we lost The Hobbit our reputation as a filming location would have suffered hugely.

"This Government was not going to let that happen. We were not prepared to see thousands of Kiwi jobs disappear and we were not prepared to see the hard work of the many talented New Zealanders who built our film industry from scratch put at risk.

"The passing of this Bill allows film workers and producers to get on with what they do best - making movies.

"I would like to thank Act, United Future and the Maori Party for their support and for recognising that this legislation will preserve the livelihoods of thousands of New Zealanders."
