Minister of Local Government Hon Rodney Hide today announced his intention to clarify the application of the Auckland Regional Council Trades Waste Bylaw to ensure certainty for those in the Auckland wastewater industry before the integration of Auckland's wastewater services into a single system on November 1 2010. 

"The Auckland Regional Council Trade Wastes Bylaw 1991 regulates the discharge of trade wastes into the Auckland Council wastewater system.  The Bylaw - administered by Watercare Services Limited - sets the charges needed to recover the costs from those discharging trade wastes," Mr Hide said. 

"The Government has directed Watercare to continue to administer and enforce the Bylaw for a transitional period after the integration until the Auckland Council makes a new regional trade waste bylaw. 

"As part of the new reforms, Watercare will assume control of local wastewater networks.  At present, all charges for local wastewater networks are collected locally by councils or their water subsidiaries.  These charges will become part of Watercare's revenue from November 1. 

"Concerns have been expressed by trade waste users that Watercare will double charge once it assumes control of local wastewater networks.  This stems from the belief that there is a conflict between Watercare's obligation under the Bylaw to recover all costs, and the intent of the Auckland law reform legislation, under which the Bylaw remains in force.

"It was never the Government's intention for the integration of wastewater services in Auckland to result in double charging.   

"That's why I am recommending that Regulations be made to ensure that the costs that may be recovered under the Bylaw do not include those related to the local wastewater networks transferred to Watercare on November 1. 

"This will assist Watercare and its trade waste customers to pursue a settled and productive relationship and to continue to function as a critical part of Auckland's economy," Mr Hide said.
