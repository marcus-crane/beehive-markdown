Health Minister Tony Ryall says the National-led government wants strong and supportive families and communities, taking responsibility for themselves and each other.

Speaking at the announcement of successful Whanau Ora providers in Porirua today, Mr Ryall said the Government wanted to turn around the 'five cars up the driveway' syndrome where families were confronting multiple agencies each working on one or two issues with separate family members. 

"We want social services to stop operating in silos when dealing with individuals and their issues, in isolation from what might be happening elsewhere in their lives or their family."

"Whanau Ora is about the integration of health and social services around families and whanau. It's a major step change in how we support families to support themselves," Mr Ryall says.

"They will build support services around those needs so that families can take responsibility for themselves in a safe and supportive community."

"The Government is putting more control in the hands of families and communities because we trust them."
