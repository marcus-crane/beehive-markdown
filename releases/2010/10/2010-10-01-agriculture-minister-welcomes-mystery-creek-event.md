The launch today of a major national equine industry event is a welcome addition to the Mystery Creek calendar, says Agriculture Minister David Carter.

Mr Carter has congratulated the National Fieldays Society on its launch of ‘Equidays', a three-day event planned for Mystery Creek in Hamilton later next year.

"From young children learning to ride through to eventing and racing, New Zealanders have a real love for horses.  This event is a wonderful opportunity to showcase our whole equestrian industry.

"Mystery Creek is already home to the largest agribusiness exhibition in the Southern Hemisphere, the National Agricultural Fieldays, which contributes over $500 million annually to the New Zealand economy and more than $300 million in direct sales.

"The success of Fieldays has helped put New Zealand agriculture on the international map.  A dedicated equine industry exhibition is an exciting addition to the Mystery Creek events programme," says Mr Carter.
