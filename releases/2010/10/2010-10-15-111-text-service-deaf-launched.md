A new system that enables deaf and hearing impaired people to contact the emergency 111 service by text was launched by Police Minister Judith Collins in Auckland today.

Police have installed new technology that enables texts to be received and responded to by their communications centres.

Should the texter need fire or ambulance, their details will be sent to those services the same way they would for a normal 111 call.

The system went live today and will be available to deaf or hearing impaired people who have registered for the service with Deaf Aotearoa and Police.

"The vast majority of New Zealanders take a lot of comfort from knowing that in an emergency, help from Police, fire or ambulance is just a three-digit phone number away," Ms Collins said.

"Our deaf and hearing impaired community has, until now, had a more challenging time summoning help, particularly if they are not at home.

"Traditionally, they have used deaf faxes and tele-typewriter phones to contact emergency services.

"These are still used but are not ideal in today's mobile environment, as they rely on the person being at home if they have an emergency.

"I am delighted that those New Zealanders who are deaf or hearing impaired can now have quick access to emergency services no matter where they are."

Associate Minister for Disability Issues Pansy Wong said: "I congratulate the New Zealand Police for making things easier for the deaf community during an emergency by working with Deaf Aotearoa to improve accessibility.

"This is a good example of embracing new technology to enhance accessibility for people with impairment."

Already around 500 people have expressed an interest with Deaf Aotearoa in accessing the service.
