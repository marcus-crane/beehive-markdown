The Government has announced that Justice Grant Hammond, a judge of the Court of Appeal, will be the next President of the Law Commission.

"I'm pleased that such a distinguished judge and lawyer is set to lead the commission," the Minister Responsible for the Law Commission, Simon Power, said today.    

Justice Hammond will begin his term on 1 December, and replaces Sir Geoffrey Palmer who is standing down as president after five years.

"Justice Hammond's experience will stand the commission in good stead as it refocuses its priorities on black letter law."

Mr Power also announced the appointment of law professor Geoffrey McLay as a member of the commission for a term of five years, beginning 1 December.

"Professor McLay's diverse areas of legal expertise will make him a valuable addition to the commission and its wide-ranging work programme."

Mr Power paid tribute to Sir Geoffrey Palmer.   

"Sir Geoffrey has made a significant contribution to the commission both through his leadership and the wealth of knowledge and experience he has brought to the role.

"I thank him for that input."

Mr Power also acknowledged the contribution of Val Sim, who completed her three year term with the commission earlier this month.
