The work of the New Zealand Police contingent in Afghanistan has earned high praise from local Police and officials, said Police Minister Judith Collins who has been in Afghanistan for the past four days.

Currently a team of three officers is helping train the Afghan National Police.

Speaking from Dubai, Ms Collins said that while the New Zealand Police contingent was small, its work was highly valued and highly regarded by local Police and officials.

"The team has earned a reputation for its professionalism, its ability to connect with Afghan people and its ability to get the job done," Ms Collins said.

"While in Bamyan I met Deputy Governor Haji Kazimi and the Deputy Provincial Chief of Police, General Qudsi, both of whom were generous in their praise of the work by New Zealand Police."

Ms Collins said it was good to see the challenges faced by the Police contingent first hand, and to get feedback from local officials.

"The task facing our Police in an area that has seen recent conflict is considerable. However, they are making an enormous contribution by developing the skills of the local police force and helping Afghanistan build a more peaceful and stable future."

While in Afghanistan Ms Collins visited Bamyan Regional Training Centre, Nayak Police Station, where she met with the District Chief of Police, General Nekpay. 

Meetings were also held in Kabul with NATO Senior Civilian Representative, Mark Sedwill, the European Special Representative, Mr Vygaudas Usackas, Acting Head, EUPOL, Dr Karin Mueller and Lt Gen William Caldwell, Commander of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan. 

Ms Collins, who is also Minister of Veterans' Affairs, travelled with the Chief of Defence Force, Lt Gen Jerry Mateparae and visited New Zealand troops at Bamyan Army Camp and in Kabul.
