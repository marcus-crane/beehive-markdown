The Government is consulting on a proposal from New Zealand Post to make two minor changes to the Deed of Understanding between the Government and the company.

The Deed of Understanding is an agreement between New Zealand Post and the Crown which sets out certain price, service and social responsibilities New Zealand Post must provide.

Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says the proposed changes are minor in nature and will not impact significantly on the postal services provided to New Zealanders.

If agreed, the changes would:

- Allow postal delivery workers to have a four-day holiday break where the Christmas and New Year statutory days fall on a Saturday. This is a time of year where postal volumes are not high and many other workers are taking holiday breaks.

<!--THE END-->

- Clarify the terms on which New Zealand Post is obliged to provide services to other postal operators.

Mr Joyce says he encourages all interested parties to have a say on the options in the discussion document so the Government can ensure any changes to the Deed of Understanding work as effectively as possible.

The discussion document on the proposed changes to the postal Deed of Understanding is available on the Ministry of Economic Development's website at [www.med.govt.nz/postal-deed](http://www.med.govt.nz/postal-deed). 

Submissions can be made by email to [postalpolicy@med.govt.nz](mailto:postalpolicy@med.govt.nz) by **5pm Thursday 21 October 2010**.
