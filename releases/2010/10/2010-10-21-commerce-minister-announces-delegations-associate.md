Commerce Minister Simon Power has announced the delegations for new Associate Commerce Minister John Boscawen.

"One of Mr Boscawen's main delegations will be the oversight of the Commerce Commission as ownership Minister and of ongoing operations of the Commerce Act," Mr Power said.

"I look forward to working with him as the Government continues its reforms of regulation in the business sector to promote competition, support efficient business transactions, and increase participation in New Zealand's markets."

Mr Boscawen's other delegations are:

- Responsibility for trade remedies and responsibility for the administration of the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988 and the Temporary Safeguard Authorities Act 1987.
- Responsibility for the administration of the Imports and Exports (Restrictions) Prohibition Order No 2 2004 including the implementation of the Basel Convention and the Waigani Convention, and the implementation of the OECD Council Decision C (2001) 107/FINAL (all concerning the trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes), and the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and administration of my other responsibilities under the Ozone Layer Protection Act 1996 and Regulations.
- Responsibility for the National Contact Point responsible for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct.

Mr Boscawen said he welcomes the opportunity to work in the Commerce portfolio.

"I'm keen to add my business skills to help promote the Government's reforms in the commerce area."
