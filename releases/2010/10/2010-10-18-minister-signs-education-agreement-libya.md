Education Minister Anne Tolley today signed an agreement with Libya's Secretary for Education and Science Research, Dr Abdulkabir Fakhry, to strengthen and increase New Zealand's educational and science engagement with Libya.

"Libya has added New Zealand to a list of only five countries eligible to receive Libyan government scholarship students," says Mrs Tolley.

"Conservative estimates are that New Zealand stands to receive more than 300 fully-funded Libyan students every year, worth up to $30 million annually."

"Libya is an emerging education market for New Zealand. It is a nation coming out of a period of international isolation, and ready to re-engage with countries like ours. 

"This means the number of Libyan students studying overseas is on the rise and many New Zealand education providers see great potential in increasing engagement with Libya."

The agreement, signed today in Wellington, is the first Government to Government Memorandum between the two countries, and will also create opportunities for New Zealand consultancy firms to gain access to contracts within the Libyan education sector.

"There are many opportunities for New Zealand as we see Libya becoming increasingly interested in improving the quality of its higher education institutions," says Mrs Tolley.

The agreement outlines the basis for New Zealand's engagement with Libya over the next five years in the educational and scientific fields at both the compulsory and tertiary sectors.

Collaboration could include joint research projects, joint academic programmes and student and faculty exchange, particularly in the science, technology and medical fields.
