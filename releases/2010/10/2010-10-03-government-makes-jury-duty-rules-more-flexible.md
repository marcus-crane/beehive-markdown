**Government makes jury duty rules more flexible**

People will find it easier to carry out jury duty under changes which come into effect tomorrow, the Minister of Justice, Simon Power, and the Minister for Courts Georgina te Heuheu said today.

The main change will allow jurors to apply to defer their jury service to a more convenient time within 12 months of the original summons date.

"We need to make it as easy as possible for people to take part in this important civic duty," Mr Power said. 

"Making the system more flexible is expected to improve overall juror attendance and reduce the number of excusals granted."

In 2009, some 62 per cent, or 199,760, of the 321,832 people summoned for jury service were excused, and a further 21 per cent, or 67,938, failed to attend. 

Mrs te Heuheu said jury districts will be extended from 30 to 45 kilometres from a jury trial courthouse. 

"Extending jury districts and the eligible jury pool means people are less likely to be frequently summoned, particularly in smaller areas."

The Ministry of Justice has also developed a website to improve information available to jurors and the public: [www.justice.govt.nz/services/jury-service](http://www.justice.govt.nz/services/jury-service). 

The information jurors receive when summoned and while at court has also been updated to ensure it is easily understood and widely accessible.

Meanwhile, the ministry is preparing advice to the ministers on what changes should be made to ensure jurors' personal information is not used inappropriately.

"I'm looking hard at whether jurors' addresses are essential information that needs to be included on juror lists and hope to make an announcement in the near future," Mr Power said.

**Questions & Answers:**

**What do the changes mean for potential jurors?**

The introduction of a deferral process means jurors will be able to apply to attend jury service at a time that best suits their availability and lifestyle. It is anticipated that most people who currently apply to be excused (for reasons such as employment commitments) will have their call-up deferred under the new process.

Extending jury districts and the eligible jury pool means people are less likely to be frequently summoned, particularly in smaller areas.

Jurors and the public will also have easier access to a range of information about jury service and what being a juror involves. Jurors will be able to complete response forms online and get up-to-date information about what may be required of them during a trial.

**Will the deferral process mean people can just be excused at a later date?**

People who have their jury service deferred to a later date are able to apply to be excused at their next summons. However, excusals from jury service should be seen as an exception rather than the norm.

**How many people are summoned for jury service each year?**

In 2009 some 321,832 people were summoned for jury service.  Of those, 199,760 were excused from attending and 67,938 failed to attend (and were not excused). 

Figures for 2008 and 2007 are below:

**2007**

**2008**

**Number of people summoned**

348,006

358,865

**Number of people excused**

222,519

221,032

**Number of people who failed to attend (but were not excused)**

70,394

81,372

These figures are expected to reduce over time following the introduction of the deferral process.

**Are there plans to raise juror fees?**

Jury service can have an impact on jurors' day-to-day lives and their income which is why assistance is provided through the payment of fees in recognition of them carrying out their civic duty.  Although this does not replace usual income, jurors can expect to receive full payment for any additional expenses such as childcare and transport costs.

**How satisfied are jurors who serve in our courts?**

The Ministry of Justice is continually looking at ways to improve the juror experience.  This includes monitoring and reviewing feedback received through the annual Juror Satisfaction Survey, including feedback on juror fees and information and service provided to jurors. 

The latest results of the survey show a 90% satisfaction rate from jurors who serve in our courts.  Since 2008 the Ministry has been responding to juror feedback and this is reflected in the increase in the results over the past three years, from 86% in 2008 to 90% in 2009 and 2010. These results show a high quality of service provided to jurors throughout the trial process.
