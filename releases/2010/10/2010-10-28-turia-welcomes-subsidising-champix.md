Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia is welcoming today's decision by Pharmac to subsidise Champix, a medicine that treats nicotine addiction.

"Nicotine is one of the strongest addictions and we want to ensure those who are ready to quit smoking have as many options and as much support as they need to conquer their dependence on tobacco."

Mrs Turia says while Champix has been available for some time, today's decision removes the barrier of cost, making it much more accessible for those struggling to give up smoking.

From 1 November, Champix (varenicline tartrate), will be fully funded on prescription from GPs and available to those who have tried and failed to quit using traditional patches, gum or lozenges on at least two different quit attempts.

It will also be available to those who found Zyban or Norpress unsuccessful in helping them to quit. 

"People from all walks of life are dying every day from smoking related diseases.  For those who've tried to quit but have so far been unsuccessful, this is excellent news."

"The health of our families, whanau and community is paramount and we need to do everything we can to deter people from smoking," says Mrs Turia. 

"This Government is determined to tackle an issue that affects the health of most New Zealanders in one way or another."
