Environment Minister Nick Smith today launched the New Zealand Waste Strategy at the WasteMINZ Conference in Auckland, giving a strong emphasis on reducing the harmful effects of waste and improving the efficiency of resource use.

"Our Bluegreen approach is about using financial incentives and working collaboratively with industry to improve New Zealand's management of waste" Dr Smith said.

The Minister also made two further announcements on waste funding at the Waste Management Institute of New Zealand's annual conference in Auckland today. West Auckland company Tyregone Processors Limited received $300,000 to expand its plant to process more than 2000 tonnes of used tyres a year and the Bay of Plenty Regional Council received $100,000 to expand a vermicomposting trial to deal with organic waste.  Vermicomposting uses worms to turn organic waste into high nutrient compost diverting waste from landfill.

The Minister also signalled today the Government's support for industries that voluntarily collaborate to solve a particular waste problem.

Under the Waste Minimisation Act's product stewardship scheme, the Minister today accredited Refrigerant Recovery New Zealand Ltd's programme for the safe collection and destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants.  He also accredited the Agrecovery Foundation's rural recycling programme for a new scheme for recycling used farm plastic agrichemical containers and safely disposing of hazardous agrichemicals.

"I encourage other industries that have product stewardship schemes to get them accredited as it not only brings environmental and economic benefits, but it demonstrates corporate social responsibility," Dr Smith said.

"These new initiatives dealing with used tyres, used agricultural chemical containers, ozone depleting chemicals and biowaste reflect the Government's strong focus on dealing with the harm caused by waste."
