Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson today announced the appointment of Dr Arthur O'Leary, and the reappointment of Andrew Hazelton, to the Chartered Professional Engineers Council, for terms of three years.

"Dr O'Leary is a highly experienced structural and civil engineer with an international career that has spanned 40 years. He is a leader in his field and his specialist advice is sought and respected internationally by his peers", says Mr Williamson.

Dr O'Leary was nominated by the Institute of Professional Engineers, and replaces Viv Kloosterman, who decided not to seek reappointment.

"Ms Kloosterman has served on the Council since 2003 and I thank her for her valuable contribution, her time and willingness to share her expertise," says Mr Williamson.

Mr Hazelton has been a member of the Council since May 2003. A partner in a specialist construction law firm, he has significant litigation, arbitration and adjudication experience in construction and engineering issues.

"I am confident that his expertise in relation to handling the Council's appeals will continue to be valuable", Mr Williamson says.

The Council is established under the Chartered Professional Engineers of New Zealand Act, and regulates the New Zealand engineering profession. It is responsible for reviewing and approving the rules containing the Chartered Professional Engineering Standards, and hearing appeals on registration.
