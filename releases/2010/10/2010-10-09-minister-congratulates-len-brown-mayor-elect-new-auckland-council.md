Minister of Local Government Hon Rodney Hide today congratulated Len Brown on becoming the first elected Mayor of the new Auckland Council.

"Mr Brown ran a very successful campaign and this was reflected in the polls today.  I wish him all the best in his new role, and look forward to working with him to ensure that Aucklanders get the best from their new Council," Mr Hide said.

"I believe the Auckland Governance reforms have created a Council that Aucklanders can be proud of.  The reforms also generated an unprecedented level of public awareness of local government elections nationwide.

"Preliminary election results are being released throughout the country and the initial indications of voter participation show an overall increase in votes cast compared to 2004 and 2007.  It's great to see a big boost in interest in Local Government. 

"In Christchurch, voter turnout was high with over 50 percent casting their vote. This is a fantastic result considering the difficult period Christchurch has been through and I would like to congratulate Mayor Bob Parker on his election for another term. 

"Votes are still being counted throughout the country and not all results are in; however, I would like to congratulate all those who have been successfully elected, or re-elected.

"I also wish to thank all those who participated in the local government elections.  By casting our votes we are ensuring our communities get the Councils and District Health Boards we have chosen and that will act in our best interests," Mr Hide said.
