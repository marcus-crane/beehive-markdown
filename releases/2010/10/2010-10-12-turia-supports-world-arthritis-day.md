Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia is encouraging New Zealanders to support World Arthritis Day by taking the time to better understand the impact of this incurable disease.

"Having experienced the pain of psoriatic arthritis for the last twelve years I have some understanding of what many might describe as living with broken glass in your joints."

"Approximately 530,000 New Zealanders of all ages are living with at least one type of arthritis," says Mrs Turia.

"There are over 140 different types of arthritis, of which osteoarthritis, rheumatoid and gout are the most common."

"One of the most distressing statistics is the years of healthy life lost - more than 25,000 New Zealanders will not work in 2010 due to arthritis."

Earlier this year Mrs Turia launched the Arthritis New Zealand report ‘*The economic cost of arthritis in New Zealand in 2010'.*

"The report provides us with solid data to demonstrate the extent of the prevalence of this disease."

"The financial costs of arthritis in New Zealand are estimated to be a massive $3.2 billion, with $695 million of this specific to health sector costs."

Health sector costs cover hospital services, specialist services, general practice, pharmaceuticals, allied health and aged care, research and a broad range of health administration and resources.

The theme for this year is *Let's work together* and Mrs Turia says it is important that people with Arthritis are given every opportunity to work and live independently.
