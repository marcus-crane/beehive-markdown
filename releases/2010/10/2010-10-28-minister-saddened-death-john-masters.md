Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins has extended her condolences on behalf of the New Zealand veteran community to the family and friends of New Zealand's inaugural ANZAC of the Year, John Masters ONZM MC, who died today.

"I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of this inspirational New Zealander. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends," Ms Collins said.

"As a soldier, a commander and a campaigner for the rights of New Zealand soldiers affected by Agent Orange, Lieutenant Colonel Masters served his country with distinction and worked tirelessly for his fellow servicemen and women.

"He was deeply respected and admired throughout the armed services, the veterans community and the wider community. He exemplified the ANZAC spirit of courage, comradeship, and compassion.

"His passing reminds us of the debt we all owe our veterans for their bravery and their sacrifice."

In 1965, Lt Col Masters rescued a wounded Ghurkha soldier under heavy fire in Borneo, earning the Military Cross.

He later served as a commander in Vietnam. Once back in New Zealand he campaigned for those affected by Agent Orange.

He was heavily involved in Rannerdale War Veterans home in Christchurch and was instrumental in raising money to allow the home to stay open and to be upgraded.

He was the recipient of the first Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA) ANZAC of the Year Award last April.
