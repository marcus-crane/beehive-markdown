"Owners of damaged Canterbury homes and buildings should be able to choose licensed practitioners to work on their properties", Maurice Williamson, Minister for Building & Construction said during a visit to Christchurch today.

"Large numbers of Canterbury builders, tradespeople and designers are now applying to become licensed building practitioners.  The Government is pulling out all the stops to help them through the process.

"Local merchants and industry associations have stepped in to help run clinics with the Department of Building and Housing in and around Christchurch. It is great to see the industry working together this way.

"About 200 people applied to become licensed building practitioners last week.

"Licensing aims to give owners confidence that people who design and work on homes and buildings are competent and accountable for their work."

Licensed building practitioners are independently assessed as competent in their area of expertise (design, building, bricklaying and blocklaying, carpentry, foundations and roofing). They are accountable to an independent board.

Mr Williamson said people thinking about getting licensed should act now.

"There is no time like the present.

"For owners, using licensed practitioners provides greater certainty that homes and buildings are designed and built right the first time."
