The decision to include Pacific providers in the ground-breaking Whanau Ora programme is a move that will be welcomed as making perfect sense, given traditional Pacific approaches to wellbeing, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu says.

Mrs te Heuheu was referring to the announcement today of the successful providers in the first round of the new Whanau Ora programme.

"I congratulate Minister Turia both for Whanau Ora itself, and for her willingness to include Pacific providers in the first tranche of funding," Mrs te Heuheu said.  "This is a crucial step in developing a Whanau centred-approach to government services, and is great news for Pacific people."

"I would also like to commend the Pacific provider collectives who have been selected. They went through a fairly rigorous process and their response was always positive and encouraging," she said.

Mrs te Heuheu said Government expected all the provider collectives to contribute substantially to best outcomes for families/whanau, by delivering integrated and joined up services.

"Each of the successful Pacific provider collectives is well-placed to further those ambitions. And in what is one of the most significant features of Whanau Ora, we are trusting them to create their own pathways for doing this," she said.

Four Pacific groups are amongst the 25 provider collectives selected to offer Whanau Ora services in the first round of funding announced today.  They include two in Auckland: the Pacific Island Safety and Prevention Project and Alliance Health, Pacific Health Service and Taeomanino Trust in Wellington and the Pacific Trust in Canterbury.
