Custodial staff at New Zealand's prisons will shortly be wearing a blue uniform rather than the traditional olive green, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said today.

Ms Collins today viewed the design concepts of the new uniform for Corrections' 3400 custodial staff.

"This will be the first comprehensive review of the Corrections officer uniform since 1976," Ms Collins said.

"Most people wouldn't want to be wearing the same style of clothing they had in the 1970s. Our Corrections Officers are no different.

"Feedback from staff is that while the old uniform has performed well over the years, it is old fashioned, uncomfortable and not as functional as it could be for modern Corrections Officers.

"Corrections staff have a tough job to do, and we want them to have a uniform that is comfortable, practical and that they can be proud of.

"Providing staff with a modern and functional uniform is just another tool to help them do their job," Ms Collins said.

The new blue uniform will align the Department with the wider Justice sector as a law enforcement agency.

Staff have had extensive input into the design of the new uniform. Feedback on the design concepts has been positive.

A final decision will be made by the end of the year although it is unlikely to be significantly different from the design concepts. It is envisaged the new uniform will be rolled out in the middle of next year.

The new uniform will be provided from within existing budgets and for a similar unit price to the existing uniform, Ms Collins said.
