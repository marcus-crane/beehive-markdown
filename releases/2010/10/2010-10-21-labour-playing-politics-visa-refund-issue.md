The Labour party is making claims that do not match the facts regarding the reimbursement of overcharged visa fees to Samoan citizens, says Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman.

In Parliament today Su'a William Sio accused the Government of not taking action to reimburse Samoan citizens for overcharged visa fees. Mr Sio also released a press statement saying that $250,000 had been overcharged by Immigration New Zealand (INZ) and that the Government has not taken appropriate action to repay the money.

‘'To say that Samoans have been \`fleeced' by the Government and that the Government decided initially to take no action is simply not true,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'The facts are that due to an administrative error, from November 2005 to July 2009, Samoan citizens were not receiving a $90 discount they were entitled to on residence applications made to the Apia office. The total estimate of the amount overcharged is $117,000 - nowhere near the figure Mr Sio is claiming.

‘'Once the error was brought to the attention of INZ, action was taken to identify the people affected, write to them where possible and refund the money. At the same time, communications were issued from the Apia INZ office to the local community and on the INZ website.

‘'Mr Sio is playing politics with this, so in that context he might care to remember that the well documented problems in INZ's Apia office occurred while Labour was in Government. This is yet another legacy of the Pacific Division mess that has been left to National to sort out.''
