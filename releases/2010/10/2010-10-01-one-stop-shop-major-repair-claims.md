Earthquake recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has endorsed the EQC approach to managing the repair of the 50,000 earthquake-damaged properties in Canterbury with damage assessed between approximately $10,000 and $100,000 of value.

EQC has undertaken a selective tender to quickly put in place a company that can handle the project management of the repairs.

The "one-stop shop" will handle every aspect of the repair for claimants, including the consent process.  The role of the project management office will include:

- Handling every aspect of repairs for householders;
- Ensuring a design and build approach is taken;
- Providing quality assurance; and
- Development of a needs-based prioritisation system.

The office will also sub-contract and manage the many skilled contractors who will be required to carry out the building design, construction, repair and quantity surveying involved.

"The centralised management reduces the risk that cowboys can ramp up prices, to take advantage of the high demand", says Mr Brownlee.

"We want the repairs to be of a high standard so that Christchurch maintains the quality of its housing stock."

The selected companies have until Monday 4 October to submit their tenders. It is hoped that a project office can be operational very soon after.

Claimants will be able to organise their own repairs if they choose to. These claimants will have to ensure their repairs meet all required building and construction standards and payment will be made once EQC has received receipts and certificates for the work undertaken.

Claims above EQC's cap of $100,000 plus GST will be handled by commercial insurers in accordance with their policies.
