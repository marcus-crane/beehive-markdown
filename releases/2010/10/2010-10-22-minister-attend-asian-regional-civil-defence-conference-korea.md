Civil Defence Minister John Carter is attending the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Incheon, South Korea 25-28 October 2010.

The first conference was held after the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004. This disaster highlighted the need for risk reduction through information sharing between countries.

"Setting out emergency management strategies to promote reduction, readiness, response, and recovery coupled with community and individual awareness was paramount to lessening the impact of the earthquake in Canterbury."

"I'm looking forward to the opportunity to learn about how other nations are prepared and also passing on the lessons learned from the September 4 earthquake".  Mr Carter says.
