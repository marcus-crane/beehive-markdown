New Zealand's next Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna will be career diplomat Philip Griffiths, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Mr Griffiths will represent New Zealand at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which plays a key role within the UN of dealing with nuclear non-proliferation," Mr McCully said.

"Atomic energy and nuclear non-proliferation issues are attracting increased international attention, and New Zealand's Post in Vienna is has the responsibility of promoting our interests under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

"We also take a strong interest in other work at the IAEA, including on the transport of radioactive materials; the work of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty provisional secretariat, and oversight of the two Vienna-based export control regimes - the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement," Mr McCully said.

Mr Griffiths was most recently Director of the Chief Executive's Office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and has previously served as Ambassador to Poland, and has been posted to Tokyo, Vienna, Tehran, and Bonn.  He takes up his assignment in December, replacing Jennifer Macmillan, who will return to Wellington.
