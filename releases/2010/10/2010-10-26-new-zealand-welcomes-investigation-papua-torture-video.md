Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed an announcement by the Indonesian government of a full investigation into the apparent torture of two Papuan men by military personnel.

Graphic video images of the incident were released via the internet early last week, coinciding with an official visit by Mr McCully to Indonesia.

"I was assured by Foreign Minister Natalegawa that the Indonesian government was deeply concerned about the allegations and would investigate them thoroughly," Mr McCully said.

"The Indonesian authorities have now formally announced the investigation, and have given an undertaking that they will present the findings transparently.

"The willingness shown by the Indonesian government to openly acknowledge the incident and commit to a full and transparent investigation is a positive step.

"New Zealand will remain in close contact with Indonesia on the situation."
