Racing Minister John Carter today announced the appointment of Dr Alan Jackson to the New Zealand Racing Board's governing body.

"Alan Jackson has been appointed as a replacement member for Alistair Sutherland, who resigned his position so he can enjoy his racing involvement as an owner rather than as an administrator," Mr Carter says. 

Under the Racing Act 2003, and as a replacement member, Dr Jackson has been appointed until 31 July 2011, but will be eligible for reappointment. 

Dr Jackson recently retired from the Boston Consulting Group, having served in a variety of global leadership and management positions.  He has more than 25 years' experience in business, specialising in business strategy, performance improvement, growth and organisational effectiveness. 

"The Racing Board plays the leading role in developing policies that capitalise on the potential of the New Zealand racing industry and drive the industry's economic performance," Mr Carter says.

"Alan clearly has the skills to meet the requirements of the position, and his appointment is widely supported within the industry."

Mr Carter also acknowledged the contribution of resigning member, Alistair Sutherland.

"Alistair can look back with a good measure of satisfaction at the Board's achievements, particularly in the face of the recent economic conditions.  I am very pleased the Board has articulated a clear strategic direction for the industry.  I expect industry organisations to get behind that vision and work together for the betterment of New Zealand racing," Mr Carter says.
