The new Electoral Commission, which takes over the responsibilities of the Chief Electoral Office and the previous Electoral Commission, begins operation today.

The independent crown entity, established under the Electoral (Administration) Amendment Act, is a significant step forward in the Government's programme of electoral reform.

"The new commission will be a one-stop shop for all parliamentary electoral matters, including services to electors, voters, political parties, candidates, Parliament, the media, overseas electoral agencies, and international institutions," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"It replaces the current regime where electoral administration is divided between the Chief Electoral Officer, the Electoral Commission, and the Chief Registrar of Electors through the Electoral Enrolment Centre.

"I'm pleased the commission is up and running in time for the Mana by-election, and in plenty of time for next year's general election and referendum on the voting system."

The commission will be chaired by Justice Sir Hugh Williams QC, and Robert Peden will be Chief Electoral Officer.

Mr Power intends to ask Parliament to consider the appointment of the deputy chair of the commission in the near future.

Meanwhile, a second bill is expected to be introduced to Parliament in November to transfer the functions of the Chief Registrar of Electors to the Commission in 2012.

Electoral agency reform is being carried out in two stages to ensure transition to the new arrangements does not create a risk for the administration of the 2011 election.
