Minister of Consumer Affairs John Boscawen was today pleased to announce that the new digital strategy of the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) meets all the Government's criteria for a single portal consumers can access in the event of a dispute or complaint - ‘One Door'.

"Consumers must currently navigate their way through a myriad of bodies offering some form of dispute resolution or advice.  This poses the risk that consumers can become bewildered at the process and give up, rather than persevering to have their dispute resolved," Mr Boscawen said.

"Launched last month, the new CAB website ([www.cab.org.nz](http://www.cab.org.nz/)) provides visitors with access to information and contact details for around 40,000 not-for-profit groups and organisations throughout New Zealand.  It also outlines consumer's legal rights and responsibilities on a wide range of issues that people face on a day-to-day basis.

"The CAB provides accurate and current information on a wide range of complaints - whether the enquiry is made in person, by phone or online - and already deals with a large volume of queries.  Last year, the organisation handled more than 653,000 enquiries - the equivalent of one enquiry every 11 seconds of the week.

"The CAB has long been a familiar and trusted brand.  Its work, and the role it plays in the community, is valued and respected throughout New Zealand.  As such, it is ideally placed to offer the ‘One Door' service," Mr Boscawen said.
