Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee today announced five suppliers have been included on the panel for an all-of-government contract to supply computers to State sector agencies for a period of up to five years.

"These contracts will deliver improved service quality, make it easier for companies to do business with government and save more than $35 million over the five years," Mr Brownlee said.

"The contracts also make it easier to do business with government by cutting red tape and simplifying the process for suppliers."

Contracts have been awarded to a panel of suppliers which includes: Acer, Cyclone, Gen-i, HP New Zealand and The Laptop Company.  

"The contracts represent a blend of multi-national companies and small New Zealand-based firms.  This shows that New Zealand companies can punch above their weight and work alongside their multi-national peers," Mr Brownlee said. 

The Department of Internal Affairs negotiated contracts are part of government-wide procurement reforms led by the Ministry of Economic Development. 

Mr Brownlee said he has been impressed by the work undertaken. 

"Achieving savings for taxpayers while delivering improved service quality and fostering a strong relationship with business is a fantastic result."

This contract is the final of four all-of-government contracts let in the first year of the procurement reforms, which together are expected to deliver savings of over $115 million over the next five years.  The contracts that have been announced earlier are for office supplies, passenger vehicles and print devices.

Cabinet has asked officials to look at developing all-of-government contracts for other government purchases, including external legal services, travel, recruitment, ICT hardware and utilities.

Government currently spends around $30 billion a year on procuring goods and services.  For more details on government procurement and All-of-Government contracts visit [www.procurement.govt.nz](http://www.procurement.govt.nz/).
