Earthquake recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced an agreement on how Earthquake Commission claims over $100,000 for homes which are subject to bank mortgages will be handled.

These claims are for the most seriously damaged houses that will take some time to repair. The overarching goal of the agreement between the banks and the EQC is to ensure rebuilding goes ahead as smoothly as possible.

The agreement ensures that homeowners are not financially disadvantaged by changes to their mortgage resulting from an EQC payout.

"Banks are to be congratulated for working with us to support the people of Canterbury," says Mr Brownlee.

"Between when the EQC money is paid out and when it is spent on repairs, bank customers will get the benefit, either in the form of reduced interest on their mortgage, or interest earned if they choose to put it on deposit.

"Banks will also absorb the early loan repayment costs when customers' mortgages change as a result of an EQC payout," says Mr Brownlee.

The key elements of the agreement with banks on claims over $100,000 are:

- Where a property has a mortgage, EQC will pay the bank or mortgage holder the customer's EQC entitlement once an assessment of damage has been completed by EQC or the insurer.
- While waiting for the repair bills to come in, customers can apply the EQC money against their mortgage (reducing their interest burden) or place it in a deposit account (earning them interest).
- If customers use their EQC money to pay off a mortgage, the bank would then re-advance those funds against the mortgage once bills start coming in up to the amount received from the EQC.
- For fixed interest loans, this will be at the existing rate, until the end of the original period - available from at least when the loan is fully drawn.  For floating rate loans, this will be at the prevailing market rate.
- For fixed interest loans, the banks have agreed they will absorb the early repayment costs where loans were reduced or paid off by EQC payments.
- If customers put their EQC money into a deposit account, the account would be subject to the bank's control, to ensure it is spent on rebuilding. The bank would release that money for the rebuilding work once bills start coming in.

"This is a solution that will benefit all parties and gives certainty to Cantabrians that their homes can be rebuilt," says Mr Brownlee.
