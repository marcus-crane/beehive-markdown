Today's announcement of the successful Whanau Ora providers and the launch of the Whanau Integration, Innovation and Engagement Fund is an exciting time for whanau and families, says Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia.

"The calibre of the proposals was very high and we now have 25 successful providers who are committed to working collaboratively to deliver this innovative approach to engaging whanau and families.

"I am in no doubt that this strong collaboration will continue to gather momentum and that over time we will see more and more whanau empowered to take control over their future.

"I am extremely proud to be the Minister responsible for implementing such bold and innovative policy.

"I am particularly excited that the Whanau Integration, Innovation and Engagement Fund will support whanau and families to implement their plan for overcoming the challenges they face.

"This could include developing a whanau plan, training programmes or services to meet the plan's objectives or developing and providing information and resources for whanau and families," says Mrs Turia.

The $6.6 million Fund will be open to Whanau Ora providers as well as non-government organisations including iwi, hapu, runanga, whanau trusts and marae committees.

Applications will be assessed by the Whanau Ora Regional Leadership Groups and more information and an application can be found on [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/).
