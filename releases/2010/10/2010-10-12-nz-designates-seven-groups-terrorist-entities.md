New Zealand has designated a further seven international terrorist groups under the Terrorism Suppression Act, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

The entities are: Indian Mujahideen, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the military wing of Hamas (Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades), the Real Irish Republican Army, the Continuity Irish Republican Army, the New Peoples Army/Communist Party of the Philippines, and Hizbollah's military wing (The Islamic Resistance).

"These designations help implement our international obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, which is aimed at preventing the activities of terrorists," says Mr Key.

"All seven of the entities have carried out various terrorist acts, including the indiscriminate killing of civilians.

"As a result of the designations, any assets held by the groups and found in New Zealand either now or in future will be frozen, and it will be a criminal offence to deal with property, or make property or financial services available, to the entities. 

"Other support such as fundraising, and recruiting or harbouring terrorists is a criminal offence in New Zealand, regardless of whether a group is designated as a terrorist entity or not.

"These designations are not a response to domestic terrorist threats in New Zealand.  They form part of the Government's support for the building of an international bulwark against terrorist activities, wherever they might occur.

"The Government is determined that New Zealand not be used to support terrorist activities," says Mr Key.

To date New Zealand has designated under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 nearly 500 terrorist groups and individuals listed by the UN, and four other terrorist entities not already listed by the UN.  These are: Al-Shabaab (Somalia), ETA (Spain), FARC (Colombia) and PKK (Turkey).
