Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of Murray Jack to the Securities Commission.

Mr Jack has been appointed from October 15 for a term of nine months or until the Financial Markets Authority has been established.

He replaces Liz Hickey who stepped down from the commission in April.

"Mr Jack's background and practical expertise in accounting and auditing will be of great benefit to the commission," Mr Power said.

**Background**

**Murray Jack** has been chief executive of Deloitte, Wellington, since 2005. He joined the firm in 1976 and was made a partner in 1987. He has been involved in the development of the proposed auditor oversight regime and related regulatory issues. He is a board member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and is actively involved in the governance of accounting and auditing matters. 

**The Securities Commission** is an independent crown entity under the Crown Entities Act 2004, and is established under the Securities Act 1978. The commission is New Zealand's main statutory regulator for the securities and investment industry. 

In April this year, the Government announced the creation of the Financial Markets Authority. It will be an independent crown entity, which will consolidate the powers and functions of the existing Securities Commission, some of the functions of the Registrar of Companies and the Government Actuary, and some of the regulatory roles of the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). The FMA is expected to be up and running in the first quarter of next year.
