Health Minister Tony Ryall is encouraging New Zealanders to support Breast Cancer Action Month.

The New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation initiative is a challenge to raise awareness of breast cancer in the month of October.

"This Government is committed to raising awareness of breast cancer and assisting women receive the treatments options they need," Mr Ryall says.

"Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer for women and I encourage women over 40 to register for regular mammograms, and for those aged between 45 and 69 these are free through BreastScreen Aotearoa.

"National promised before the last election that we would fund a full 12 month course of the breast cancer drug Herceptin, and we put that in place within 100 days of taking office. Between taking office and the end of June this year, over 400 women have begun a 12 month Herceptin treatment course.

"As part of the Government's continued investment to provide additional elective procedures, in Budget 2010 we included an additional $8 million over the next four years earmarked for breast reconstruction surgery for women who had been culled from this waiting list previously.

Look out for Pink Army volunteers on Friday 8 October as part of the Pink Ribbon Street Appeal.
