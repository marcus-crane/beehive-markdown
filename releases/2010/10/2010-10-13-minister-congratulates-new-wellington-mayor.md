Minister of Local Government Hon Rodney Hide today congratulated incoming Mayor of Wellington Celia Wade-Brown, and wished her well for her first term as the civic leader of New Zealand's vibrant capital city.

"In her three terms as a Wellington City Councillor, Celia has been tireless advocate for environmental and other causes, and I look forward to working with her in her new role," Mr Hide said.

"I also wish to acknowledge the hard work of outgoing Mayor Kerry Prendergast, with whom I worked closely in her capacity as Vice President of Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ).

"Mayor Prendergast achieved much in her nine years at the helm of the Wellington City Council (WCC).  During her three terms she played a vital role in WCC's economic development strategy and had a special interest in Wellington's arts and culture scene.

"Mayor Prendergast's shoes will be hard to fill but, having seen the energy and dedication that she displayed as a Councillor, I have no doubt that Celia Wade-Brown will rise to the challenge," Mr Hide said.
