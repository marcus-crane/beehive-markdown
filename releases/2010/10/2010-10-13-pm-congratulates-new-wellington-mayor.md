Prime Minister John Key congratulates new Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown following today's announcement that she has been elected to lead the city.

"I'm looking forward to getting to know Celia and working with her on the issues our capital city faces," Mr Key says.

"I'd like to wish her all the best in her new role."

Mr Key is also paying tribute to outgoing Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast, who has led the city passionately for the past nine years.

"Kerry has been great to work with and I'd like to acknowledge her huge contribution to Wellington city during her time as Mayor," Mr Key says.

"I wish her all the best as she enters a new chapter in her life."
