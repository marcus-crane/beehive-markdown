A new national policy statement will give councils clearer direction on protecting and managing New Zealand's coastal environment, including our top surf breaks, says Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson.

"The Government made a commitment to deliver more national guidance on implementation of the Resource Management Act," Ms Wilkinson says.

"The New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (NZCPS) 2010 that I'm recommending does that."

The NZCPS sets out policies on coastal issues including protection of outstanding natural features and landscapes, planning for subdivision, use, and development, protection of biodiversity and water quality, and management of coastal hazard risks.

Ms Wilkinson says the new statement will replace the NZCPS 1994 and is more specific about how some matters of national importance under the RMA should be protected from inappropriate use and development. Key differences include:

- Direction on protection of natural character, outstanding landscapes, biodiversity and nationally significant surf breaks.
- Stronger requirement to identify where water quality is degraded and should be enhanced.
- Direction on maintenance of public access to and along the coast, identifying walking access as the basic priority and better management of vehicles on beaches.
- Updated policy on the management of coastal hazard risks.

"The emphasis is on local councils to produce plans that more clearly identify where development will need to be constrained to protect special areas of the coast.

"This new statement supports positive planning for growth. I have also included policies specifically on aquaculture and ports. Councils and decision-makers are directed to recognise the potential value of aquaculture and plan for it in appropriate places.

"They are also required to recognise the importance of ports in the national transport system and plan for their development."

Ms Wilkinson says she appreciated the hard work of the Board of Inquiry, chaired by Environment Court judge Shonagh Kenderdine, which conducted a public submission and hearing process on a draft NZCPS statement released in 2008.

"The Board provided invaluable advice on this very challenging area of resource management and the new statement owes a great deal to its work."

The new Coastal Policy Statement will be officially gazetted next Thursday and come into force on December 3. Until then, the NZCPS 1994 remains in effect.
