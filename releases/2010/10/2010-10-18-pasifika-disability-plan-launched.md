A national plan to improve access to support services for Pacific disabled peoples will be launched by Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia at Parliament today.

The Faiva Ora National Pasifika Disability Plan sets out Government priority focus areas for Pacific disability in the next three years.

The report looks at improving the training and career path for Pacific disability workers, ensuring support services meet the needs of Pacific disabled people and their families and increasing the number of services delivered locally in the community.

"This plan is about putting in place the priority actions and the outcomes to support Pasifika peoples to live in their own homes, to participate in their communities, and to live their lives free from the barriers that might otherwise have held them back."

"Faiva Ora will improve the way Pacific disabled peoples get information and help ensure they get the right support services when they need them."

Mrs Turia will also launch a new resource about Ministry of Health funded services, a career booklet and the new Pacific Disability Leadership Group.

"I am confident that the outcomes of Faiva Ora will enable Pacific disabled peoples and their families to have more control over decisions affecting them so that they can live fulfilling lives."
