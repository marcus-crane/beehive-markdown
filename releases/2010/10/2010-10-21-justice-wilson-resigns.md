Acting Attorney-General Judith Collins announced that Justice Wilson today resigned as a judge of the Supreme Court.

The resignation takes effect from 5pm, 5 November 2010.

Ms Collins has Attorney-General responsibilities as they specifically relate to complaints concerning Justice Wilson.

The terms on which the Judge has resigned are:

- His existing entitlements, which include untaken sabbatical leave and retiring leave. The exact amount has not yet been calculated.

<!--THE END-->

- One year's salary, of $410,000, which will be taxable.

<!--THE END-->

- The Crown will pay Justice Wilson's solicitor-client costs which to date have been calculated at $475,000.

The Crown is liable for his reasonable legal costs under the Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Judicial Conduct Act  2004.

"I believe this is the best outcome under the circumstances. It resolves an unprecedented situation in New Zealand's legal history," Ms Collins said.

"To proceed with this case would have caused incalculable damage to confidence in the judiciary.

"Allowing the situation to continue would have meant considerably greater costs being paid by the taxpayer in relation to Justice Wilson's salary and legal fees, for an indeterminate time into the future."

The Judicial Conduct process will cease following Justice Wilson's resignation.
