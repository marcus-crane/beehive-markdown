Regulations come into force today that reverse a Labour Government decision to require hundreds of household products like washing powders and household cleaners be sold in child-resistant plastic containers.

"Banning washing powders and household cleaners from being sold in cardboard packaging or refill packs was over the top, costly for consumers and bad for the environment," Environment Minister Nick Smith said.

"The regulations approved in June 2006 required from 31 December 2010 low toxicity households cleaners and washing powders only be sold in child-resistant containers. This effectively banned cardboard containers, handy plastic scoops and refills for trigger nozzle packs. Products that would have been banned in their current form include Persil, Surf, Cold Power, Napisan, Spray'n'Wipe, Handy Andy, Mr Muscle, Friend, and Toilet Duck.

"Child safety is important but these regulations went too far. Household cleaners only had to have the toxicity of salt or lemon juice to require child resistant containers. There is no evidence of serious injury of children from these products. The Government is retaining the regulations for the more toxic household chemicals and concentrated dishwashing powders that could cause serious injury.

"This decision of the Environmental Risk Management Authority is supported by the Ministry of Health and the child advocacy group Safekids New Zealand. It is also consistent with regulations in Australia, the United States and the European Union and would have created expensive compliance problems for New Zealand industry.

"Labour's regulations would have added more than $20 million a year to household costs each year and 30 million extra plastic bottles to the waste stream.  I am advised it would also have put jobs at risk at domestic powder factories including 330 at Unilever in Petone undermining New Zealand's international competitiveness.  

"This commonsense approach to regulations by National is about reversing Labour's Nanny State, containing the cost of living and saving jobs."
