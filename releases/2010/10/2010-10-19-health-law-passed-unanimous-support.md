The New Zealand Public Health and Disability Amendment bill has passed its third reading in the House of Representatives - with unanimous support from all parties.

"The changes represent a major drive for better quality and value for money in the public health sector," said Health Minister Tony Ryall.

"They enable greater national and regional cooperation, and will reduce duplication and bureaucracy."

The bill follows recommendations by the Ministerial Review Group last year including:

- amendments that require DHBs to work collaboratively to meet national, regional and local service needs;
- a new planning framework supporting DHBs to plan across the sector at national, regional and district levels
- provision for the Minister to direct DHBs on how administrative, support and procurement services should be obtained and who must provide these services
- provision for the Minister of Health to direct all DHBs to support government policy on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the public health services
- dispute resolution measures to support DHBs to work collaboratively;
- a new independent Health Quality and Safety Commission and :
- amendments to enable elected DHB members to be appointed to other DHB boards.

"We inherited a fragmented public health system ill placed to cope with the significant financial and clinical challenges facing it.  There has been too much duplication that has led to poor regional and national performance and a track to financial crisis" said Mr Ryall.

"These changes will enable us to improve efficiency and have better frontline health services," said Mr Ryall.
