Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today acknowledged receipt of the Te Reo Maori chapter of the Waitangi Tribunal's report on the Wai 262 claim.

The Waitangi Tribunal has issued this chapter to inform the Review of the Māori Language Strategy that is currently underway. It has not indicated when it will release the full Wai 262 report.

"We appreciate the intention of the Waitangi Tribunal in releasing the Te Reo chapter ahead of the full report," said Mr Finlayson, who is leading the development of the whole of government response to this report. "We look forward to receiving the full Wai 262 report in due course, which will conclude the 20 year inquiry into this claim."

"The government is committed to considering the report in its entirety," Mr Finlayson said. "It is important to take the time to develop a considered response to this substantial claim. The Review of the Māori Language Strategy is scheduled to be completed in mid 2011 and this chapter will help inform that work."
