Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce will lead a trade delegation to China this week in a bid to further build the presence of New Zealand companies in the rapidly growing Chinese ICT market.

"China's ICT market is vast. They have more than 420 million internet users, 823 million mobile phone users, and 277 million mobile phone internet users," Mr Joyce says.

"The Chinese government has placed great emphasis on developing their high-tech sector and New Zealand companies are well placed to respond to opportunities arising from the rapid growth of China's telecommunications industry.

"This mission aims to help further develop long-term, sustainable relationships with key Chinese agencies and companies operating in the ICT sector.

"It also builds on bilateral ICT cooperation between the New Zealand and Chinese governments and supports the Arrangement for Cooperation in the Information Technology and Communications sectors, signed by our two countries in April 2009," Mr Joyce says.

The delegation will visit Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen from 17-22 October.

It is the sixth ministerial-led mission to the Shanghai 2010 World Expo this year.

Senior management from some of New Zealand's leading ICT companies are represented on the mission, including 2Degrees Mobile, 4RF Communications, Datacom Services, Mako Networks, Mobile Mentor, Mobilis Networks, Navman Wireless, Open Cloud, Orion Health, Pingar LP, Tomizone and the New Zealand ICT Group.

During the mission Mr Joyce will meet with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and key telecommunications companies in Beijing, spend a day at the World Expo and address a Kiwi Expat Association (KEA) function in Shanghai and visit Huawei's research and development facility in Shenzhen.

Mr Joyce leaves for China tonight so he can take part in meetings with tertiary education groups ahead of the ICT trade mission.
