The Government is highly unlikely to agree to any levy increases following the ACC Board's public consultation process, ACC Minister Nick Smith says.

"The Government is very conscious of the financial pressure families and businesses are under and believes there is no justification for increasing ACC levies at this time," Dr Smith said.

"The turnaround in ACC's finances means the solvency of all accounts is improving and the issue is now down to how quickly we get to full funding and how cautious we need to be about future projected increases."

"ACC's focus needs to be on managing costs rather than simply passing on more costs through further levy increases."

While the ACC Board is required by law to initiate a public consultation on any proposed levy changes each year, it is ultimately the Government's decision whether any changes are adopted or not.

"The Government is not of a mind to support these further increases," Dr Smith said.
