Acting Minister of Social Development Judith Collins is pleased to announce funding has been granted to 14 new community programmes to tackle youth offending. 

The Innovation Fund, part of the suite of Fresh Start initiatives, supports local solutions to youth offending, targeting young people at risk.

"We want communities to step up and find new, effective ways of dealing with young offenders in their area," says Ms Collins.

"The Fresh Start Innovation Fund is about helping communities take the lead in addressing youth justice issues locally," says Ms Collins.

These programmes are designed to teach youth offenders the value of work and help them earn back a place in their community.

There is also a particular focus on addressing the over-representation of Maori children and young people in the youth justice system.

Organisations like Canterbury Youth Development and YMCA in Gisborne, will focus on self responsibility, anger management and conflict resolution, helping young people build relationships and realise the importance of education and training.

"We can arrest the progression of youth offender to adult criminal, by putting the effort in now," says Ms Collins.

"With good ideas, passion and drive, local people can make a real difference to the lives of youth offenders in their area," says Ms Collins.

"The Innovation fund gives them the means to make it happen," says Ms Collins.

The Fresh Start Innovation fund has a $4.5million investment over four years, distributed annually through grants of a maximum $100,000 each.

Details of the 14 successful applicants for round two of the Innovation Fund can be found at [www.msd.govt.nz](http://www.msd.govt.nz/)

The third round, for 2011/2012 funding will open in February 2011.
