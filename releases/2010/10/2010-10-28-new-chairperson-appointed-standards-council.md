Commerce Minister Simon Power today announced the appointment of John Lumsden as a new member and chair of the Standards Council.

The Standards Council is a Crown entity which through Standards New Zealand develops, adopts, and publishes New Zealand standards.

Mr Lumsden has been appointed for a term of three years beginning 1 November. He replaces Richard Westlake.

"Mr Lumsden has a wealth of experience in chairing boards and brings with him successful leadership skills as previous chief executive of MetService," Mr Power said.

He also thanked Mr Westlake for his contributions to the Standards Council since 2003. 

**Background**

John Lumsden is deputy chair of Grow Wellington and a director of a number of companies including Moxie Communications Limited. He is past-president of Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce. In 1992 he was the inaugural chief executive of MetService and led its transformation from a government department to a state-owned enterprise. He has also been a general manager of Labatt Breweries in British Columbia and had various roles with Alcan in Jamaica and Canada.

The Standards Council is an autonomous Crown entity established under the Standards Act 1988. It has up to 12 members, four of whom (including a chair and deputy chair) are appointed by the Minister of Commerce. The remaining eight are appointed by the Minister of Commerce from nominations made by industry bodies.

The Standards and Accreditation Bill, which is before Parliament, proposes, among other provisions, to repeal and replace the Standards Act. If the bill is passed, all members' terms in office will be affected. The size of the council will be reduced to six members, abolishing the industry-nominated positions. The bill will also re-name the Crown entity ‘Standards New Zealand'.
