Eleven older residents of Nelson have a comfortable new home thanks in part to the Government's Housing Innovation Fund (HIF).

Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today opened Abbeyfield Mata Close. This purpose built accommodation provides 11 ensuite bed-sitting rooms, a guest room, a house-keeping unit, two lounges and kitchen/dining facilities.

The house which cost $2 million was partially funded with a $705,108 HIF loan.

"This home is a great example of what can be achieved when Government works with third party providers of social housing such as Abbeyfield," says Mr Heatley.

HIF, which is administered by Housing New Zealand, provided $20 million last year for affordable rental, home ownership and Maori Demonstration Partnership projects.

"I am really pleased with the success we have had to date with HIF loans, for every dollar we invested, we have seen three dollars worth of affordable housing delivered, Mr Heatley said.
