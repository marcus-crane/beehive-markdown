Local authorities committing to the Government's Weathertight Homes Financial Assistance Package will get their residents leaky homes fixed faster and benefit ratepayers, the Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says.

The majority of the most-affected local authorities have agreed to join the package. These represent an estimated 90 per cent of likely weathertight claims.

"Their participation will be a win for their ratepayers as well as the councils because the package doesn't require complex, time-consuming and expensive litigation, leaving more dollars to be spent on actual repairs."

"There's a 10-year time limit on lodging claims, but home owners close to the 10-year limit can ‘stop the clock' by lodging a claim now. Then they can choose the financial assistance package when it becomes operational," Mr Williamson says.

Under the package, the Government will contribute 25% of the cost of repairs and local authorities will also pay 25% if they had signed off the original work. Home owners will fund the balance.

Home owners who join must agree not to sue their council and the Government, but they will be free to pursue other parties such as builders and home designers.

"The Government has no legal liability to the owners of leaky homes, but the scale of the weathertight issue is such we are stepping in to ensure home owners have a fair solution that lets them get on with their lives," he says.

Mr Williamson said the package will give home owners a choice, but they can still go through the Weathertight Homes Tribunal process if they like.
