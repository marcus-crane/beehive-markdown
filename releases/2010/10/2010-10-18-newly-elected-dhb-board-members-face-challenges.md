Health Minister Tony Ryall has today congratulated the successful candidates now confirmed in the district health board elections.

"This is important work and I am confident we have many good people on the Boards. I look forward to working with them."

The Minister says Board members are likely to be faced with challenges in service, workforce and finance over the next three years.

"DHBs must continue to improve key frontline services in emergency departments, cancer treatment, cardiac and elective surgery. They will also need to work together more on a regional basis to secure and protect vulnerable services."

Mr Ryall says that with the recession bottoming out, there will be pressure on maintaining staff. But he says this should be helped by good increases in clinical staff numbers over the past 18 months, as well as more training places made available.

"The Government has put an extra $512 million into health this year, which is a lot of money, especially in tight financial times. And while there will be more money again next year, DHBs need to keep focusing on value for money and reducing waste." 

"I'd also like to thank all candidates who put themselves up for election."

The Health Minister will be making appointments to the Boards, as well as appointing new chairs late next month.
