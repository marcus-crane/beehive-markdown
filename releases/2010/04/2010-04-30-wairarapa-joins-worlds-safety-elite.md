Associate ACC Minister Pansy Wong congratulates the Wairarapa region for becoming New Zealand's first combined-council International Safe Community.

The Wairarapa region has become the 183rd community in the world to be recognised by the World Health Organisation as an International Safe Community.

At 2pm today, Minister Wong will attend the Safer Wairarapa Designation Ceremony in Masterton, where the District Councils and residents of Masterton, Carterton and South Wairarapa will be formally recognised for their achievement in being at the forefront of embracing community injury prevention.

"It is fantastic to see the combined Wairarapa councils working with their communities to receive this acknowledgement for keeping their residents safe from injury and harm," Mrs Wong - who has the delegation of injury prevention as Associate Minister for ACC - says.

The International Safe Community initiative is a World Health Organisation movement aimed at making communities safer through the cooperation of central and local government, the business community and non-government organisations.

The Wairarapa region has been running more than 40 local safety programmes ranging from reducing speed on the main roads to reducing sports-related alcohol abuse, many of which are showing excellent results.

 "Injury is the leading cause of death for people under 34 in our country and we all need to focus on creating a safe New Zealand. The Wairarapa region is a good example of how safety can be improved in the community," Mrs Wong says.
