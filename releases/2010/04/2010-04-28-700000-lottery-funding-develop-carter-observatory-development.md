Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant of $698,412 from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund to help the refurbishment of Wellington's Carter Observatory.

"The Lottery Significant Projects Fund grant will fund the fit-out of the Pickering Gallery and Discovery Room, including interactive exhibits and audio visual elements," says Mr Guy.

"The refurbishment will provide an improved education facility which will welcome more than 5,000 young people and teachers in the Lower North Island each year. 

"The large public turnout since re-opening shows how popular this attraction will become. It is a great asset for the Wellington region and a real destination for visitors.

"This is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Carter Observatory has recently reopened after a two year, $6 million makeover. It is New Zealand's longest-serving national observatory, opened in 1941, and is a Category II registered historic place.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and nation.

Applications that were high priorities for funding showed their project was well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation had the capability to complete the project.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
