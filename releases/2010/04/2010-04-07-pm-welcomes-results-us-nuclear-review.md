Prime Minister John Key today welcomed the results of the US review of its nuclear policy.

"President Obama today made good on his pledge a year ago to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in US security policies and set the world on a path to a nuclear-weapons-free world," Mr Key says.

"The review clearly states the long-term objective of US policy is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, and implements the first of the actions that will be needed to get there. 

"The review also recommits the United States to a strengthened global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.

"New Zealand warmly welcomes these developments, as concrete steps towards our long-held goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world."

The Nuclear Posture Review sets out US nuclear policy for the next five to ten years.  

The United States has pledged to significantly reduce the role and number of its nuclear weapons.  The US has also declared it will not use its nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states that are in compliance with their Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations.

"US commitments to not develop new nuclear weapons and to deeper nuclear-arms reductions are both very positive signals that the US is serious about creating the conditions for a nuclear-weapons-free world.

"The Nuclear Posture Review, the new START agreement with Russia, and the Nuclear Security Summit will all contribute to the momentum leading into the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in May.

"President Obama's leadership has reinvigorated the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation debate.  I look forward to discussing these issues with him and other leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington next week."
