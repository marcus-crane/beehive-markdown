Inland Revenue staff can donate money to any of 45 charities directly from their pay as the department makes payroll giving available to its employees from today. 

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne congratulated the department, saying it was especially pleasing to see public sector organisations like Inland Revenue take a strong lead in implementing the payroll giving scheme.

Staff have been invited to choose the organisations they would like to support.

"Payroll giving has already been welcomed by a number of organisations as a simple and effective way for employees and employers to support their communities in a very practical way," Mr Dunne said.

"It is also convenient and cost-effective for the charities to receive donations this way, so everyone involved wins," he said. 

Payroll giving took effect from 7 January this year.  It allows employees to have donations deducted automatically from the pay by their employer and forwarded to their chosen charity. 

In return, employees receive a tax credit each payday rather than having to wait until the end of the year to claim a rebate.  The scheme is voluntary for both employers and employees.

Mr Dunne said he had long supported the introduction of payroll giving, both as Revenue Minister and as the leader of UnitedFuture. It had been part of the party's confidence and supply agreement with Labour in the previous government.

He said he was delighted to see the scheme become a reality under the current Government.
