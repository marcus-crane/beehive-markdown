The government's *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* scheme has posted another strong month of activity, with 3,837 houses retrofitted in March, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee said today.

That takes the number of houses made warmer and drier under the scheme since it was launched on 1 July to 37,532.

"Certainly the first nine months of the scheme have outpaced projections," Mr Brownlee said.

"To have 123 houses a day receiving insulation and heating during March means nearly 4,000 families will have warmer, healthier homes for the coming winter and the years beyond."

Accredited heating and insulation installers have been kept busy during the summer months, but Mr Brownlee said there could be greater demand in the months ahead.

"Demand for the scheme is expected to accelerate into winter as some of the bigger service providers launch widespread marketing campaigns."

Of the 37,532 houses retrofitted to date 60 per cent (22,365) were low income households owned or tenanted by Community Service Card holders. 

"We expected 27,500 households would take advantage of the opportunity to make their homes warmer, drier and healthier in the scheme's first year, so to have delivered almost that number to low income New Zealanders in nine months is a great achievement," Mr Brownlee said.

*Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* is open to all New Zealanders with houses built before 2000.  For more information visit: [www.energywise.govt.nz](http://www.energywise.govt.nz/)
