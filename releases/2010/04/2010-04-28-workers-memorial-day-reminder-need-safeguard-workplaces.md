Workers Memorial Day serves as a sober reminder that New Zealand continues to lose more than one person each week in fatal workplace accidents, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

Speaking at the Working Wise Future-Proofing Health and Safety Conference in Wellington today, Ms Wilkinson noted that serious accident statistics had continued to hover around the 6000 mark each year for the past decade.

"Workers Memorial Day is about remembering New Zealanders and workers throughout the world who have been injured or killed at work.

"Too many families suffer every year through the deaths of loved-ones in accidents that are largely preventable.

"There is a lot more emphasis being placed on health and safety now and it is incredibly heartening that we are seeing a lot of progress in this area.

"High risk industries like construction, forestry and agriculture are stepping up and taking their responsibilities seriously.

"They appreciate that a safe and healthy workplace means a safer and more productive workforce.

"But there is a lot of room for improvement and the Government will continue to work with businesses and unions to foster a strong workplace safety culture."
