The government has commenced the tender process for participation in its $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative.

Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce says around half of rural households are coping with dial-up speeds, which is "totally unacceptable" in the 21st century.

"The Rural Broadband Initiative will boost connectivity and growth in rural areas," says Mr Joyce.

The government's rural broadband targets are that, within six years:

- 93% of rural schools will receive fibre, enabling speeds of at least 100Mbps, with the remaining 7% to achieve speeds of at least 10Mbps.
- Over 80% of rural households will have access to broadband with speeds of at least 5Mbps, with the remainder to achieve speeds of at least 1Mbps.

Mr Joyce says the first contracts to provide fast rural broadband are expected to be signed by the end of the year." 

Today's call for expressions of interest is the first stage in a two-stage tender process.  Its purpose is to seek expressions of interest from potential suppliers or consortia of suppliers of broadband infrastructure to inform a Request for Proposal (RFP) stage from August 2010. 

The EOI will assist the prioritisation of candidate regions, the development of minimum open access requirements and service specifications, and will inform a better understanding of the types of technologies used to connect rural communities.

"Tender participants will be expected to at a minimum provide the provision of fibre connections to  93% of rural schools, meet the needs of rural users and broadband access seekers for the foreseeable future, and ensure equivalent and open access infrastructure," says Mr Joyce.

"The government will also consider proposals that would upgrade voice service infrastructure to remote rural users at the same time.

"The government recognises the impact that the ageing remote rural voice infrastructure has on these communities, and where the economies of scope and scale justify the government contribution we will look at it.

"The government anticipates interest in the tender to come from telecommunication infrastructure and wholesale bandwidth providers, lines companies, and community organisation in partnership with strategic investment partners and technology suppliers.

"I encourage rural communities to think proactively about how they might involve themselves in this step-change development for their communities."
