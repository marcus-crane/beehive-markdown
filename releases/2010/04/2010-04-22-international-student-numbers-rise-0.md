A significant increase in international student numbers will bring real gains to both the economy and the tertiary education sector, says Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce.

Ministry of Education figures released today show a 6% increase in international fee-paying student enrolments compared with 2008. 

There were a total of 93,505 international fee-paying students studying in New Zealand in 2009.

Mr Joyce says the increase is a clear indication that there is a high level of demand for New Zealand education and reflects the work of the sector and the government to raise the profile of New Zealand as a provider of world-leading education services.

"New Zealand has the capacity to increase these numbers further and, with numbers now rising, it's also time for us to look at widening the scope of our international education activities.

"It's essential that we maximise our opportunities in this area and that we are able to compete with other countries for international students in a sustainable way.

"International education contributes more than $2 billion to our economy each year - continued growth will bring real benefits in terms of economic growth and the money available to allow our tertiary institutions to grow."

There was 10% overall growth in revenue from international fee-paying students during 2009, totalling $664 million.

The Ministry of Education considers there will be further growth in international enrolments in 2010, based on projections of global student demand, the level of student visa approvals, and recent advice from providers.
