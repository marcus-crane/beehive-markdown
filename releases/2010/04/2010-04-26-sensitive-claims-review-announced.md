Minister for ACC Nick Smith today announced the panel and terms of reference for an independent clinical review into ACC's new approach to managing sensitive claims.

"Last October ACC changed its approach to managing sensitive claims in response to more than four years research work from Massey University into best practice clinical guidelines," Dr Smith said. "These guidelines were launched in March 2008 by the previous Government.

"These changes have never been about costs savings. I have repeatedly stressed to the corporation that the focus must be on delivering to victims of sexual abuse or assault that have a mental injury the best help available to achieve a timely and successful recovery.

"I have been very hesitant as a politician to interfere in clinical decisions but acknowledge the changes have caused controversy. That is why I have initiated this independent clinical review to ensure best possible practice in this sensitive area.

"The members of the review panel have the necessary skills and experience to bring a fresh and independent perspective to this difficult area of ACC's work. I expect the group to report back to me by July.    

"The review panel is to be chaired by former Mental Health Commissioner Dr Barbara Disley and includes clinical psychologist Clive Banks, consultant Ruth Herbert and psychiatrist Professor Graham Mellsop."
