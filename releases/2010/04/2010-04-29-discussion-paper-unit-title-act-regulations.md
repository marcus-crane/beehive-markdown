Housing Minister Phil Heatley has today released a discussion paper on proposed regulations to support the new Unit Titles Act.

"The new unit title legislation provides much more clarity around how a unit title development works.  The legislation also has the flexibility to allow unit owners to make their own decisions about how their development is run," Mr Heatley says.

Parliament passed the new Unit Titles Act on 1 April 2010.  The Act repeals and replaces the Unit Titles Act 1972, which had become outdated and inadequate as a legal framework for the ownership and management of unit title developments.

"Although we've passed the Act, the provisions are not yet in force.  Before that can happen we need to prepare some regulations to support the new requirements in the Act," Mr Heatley says.

Mr Heatley says the first part of that process is to give people the opportunity to have their say on draft proposals.

"This discussion paper outlines proposals for regulations, and I would like to hear from the public about how they may affect you or whether you have any other ideas for the regulations."

Further information, including the discussion paper, is available at [www.dbh.govt.nz](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/) or by phoning 0800 242 243. 

Submissions on the discussion paper close at **5pm on Thursday 10 June 2010.**
