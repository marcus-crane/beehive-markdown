Prime Minister John Key has expressed shock and sorrow at the deaths today of three Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel in an Iroquois helicopter crash near Wellington.

Mr Key is in Gallipoli for Anzac Day to commemorate the 95th anniversary of the landings by Australian and New Zealand forces there.

"I was informed early this morning of the crash," says Mr Key.

"I am shocked and saddened by this tragic event.  My thoughts are with the families of the victims, the family of the injured man, and the entire New Zealand Defence Force.

"To have this happen when the helicopter was heading to Wellington for an Anzac Day flypast is an absolute tragedy.

"I am sure that all New Zealanders will join with me in offering the families of the victims, and the Defence Force, our deepest condolences."
