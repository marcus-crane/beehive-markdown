The B4 School Check health programme for four year olds will continue, following a review requested by Health Minister Tony Ryall.

The review was called for following very poor performance by DHBs. Some DHBs were forced to pay back money for services not provided.

Mr Ryall says, "The number of children being checked has jumped markedly since the middle of last year, when the Government warned that the programme would be stopped if checks didn't increase. Now, overall levels are tracking to target for most DHBs."

"We still have some concerns about the delivery of the programme. The aim is to see 80 per cent of high needs four year olds in 2009/10 but it appears DHBs will only see half of that number."

"It is also concerning that 15 per cent of the before school checks were completed after the child started school."

"A Ministry of Health audit has also found that only two in three children referred to specialist services were actually seen by that service."

"The Ministry will be requiring DHBs to ensure more high needs children are checked and more is done to ensure that the children referred on to specialist services are actually followed up."

The B4 School Check includes comprehensive health and development questionnaires, height and weight measurements, hearing and vision testing and a check of children's oral health.
