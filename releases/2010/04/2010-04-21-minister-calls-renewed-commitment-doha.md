New Zealand, represented by Trade Minister Tim Groser, was among agricultural-exporting countries assembled in Uruguay today calling for recommitment to the World Trade Organisation's Doha Round of negotiations.

Cairns Group members, comprising 19 agricultural-exporting countries, urged all WTO Members to continue engaging at the ministerial level to provide the political guidance needed to bring the Doha negotiations to a successful conclusion. 

"We understand and share the strong sense of frustration felt around the world at the slow pace with which the WTO negotiations are moving forward.

"We are making great progress in advancing New Zealand's trade agenda through free trade agreements. However, the reality is there is no substitute for the WTO. The basic political message from Cairns Group Ministers is there is unfinished business here of global importance."

Mr Groser was joined in Uruguay by President of Federated Farmers, Don Nicholson and New Zealand's Special Agricultural Trade Envoy, Alastair Polson who participated in a meeting of Cairns Group farm leaders held in parallel with the Ministers' meeting.

Tomorrow in Montevideo, Mr Groser is due to meet with the recently- inaugurated President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and several Ministers from his Government.
