For many years Parent to Parent New Zealand has contributed too many positive outcomes for families by providing exceptional support services, says Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia.

This week is the organisation's annual awareness week.

"Parent to Parent is an organisation that focuses on supporting parents and whanau of people with disabilities."

"Their unique information and matching service has ensured that parents receive support that is personalised to their specific needs," says Mrs Turia.

"Speaking to another parent that has already travelled this path is another source of valuable support and understanding at a time when families can feel isolated and bewildered raising a child with special needs."

Another unique aspect of the Parent to Parent is the support they give siblings. SibSupportN.Z is a programmed designed for the non disabled siblings aged 8 -18 years.

The workshops are an opportunity to share issues, feelings and make friends with others who understand.

The 2nd Generation SibSupportN.Z is designed for adult siblings who often advocate for the adult disabled sibling in their day to day needs.

"Earlier this week I heard Paralympian Peter Williams say ‘it's not hard just different' when you have a disability and Parent to Parent goes a long way to helping people to understand this."
