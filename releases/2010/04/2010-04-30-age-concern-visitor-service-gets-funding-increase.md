The Government is supporting the expansion of Age Concern's Accredited Visiting Service, which will be expanding into all District Health Boards.

The Accredited Visiting Service is a service for older people, which has been operating for over 20 years with the aim of improving the health of older people living in the community by reducing social isolation and loneliness.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "An extra $200,000 will see the service expand into Tairawhiti, Taranaki, West Coast, South Canterbury and Bay of Plenty District Health Board areas."

"The Accredited Visiting Service matches people aged over 65 and wanting a regular visitor with a trained volunteer who will visit regularly.

Having good social networks has been identified by older people themselves as one of the "Big 4" most serious issues facing them.
