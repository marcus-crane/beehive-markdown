The warm summer months have failed to dent demand for the government's *Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* scheme, Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee said today.

Provisional data to the end of February shows 9,228 homes received retrofitted insulation and clean heating from the beginning of December to the end of February.

Since July, when the scheme started, 33,500 households throughout New Zealand have taken advantage of the opportunity to warm up their homes.

Mr Brownlee said he was extremely pleased with demand for the scheme, which was well ahead of projections.

"We expected 27,500 households would take advantage of the opportunity to make their homes warmer, drier and healthier in the scheme's first year, but demand has seen us surge past that number in nearly half the time."

Of the 33,500 homes retrofitted so far, 60 per cent were properties occupied by low-income tenants.

*Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart* is open to all New Zealanders with houses built before 2000.  For more information visit: [www.energywise.govt.nz](http://www.energywise.govt.nz/)
