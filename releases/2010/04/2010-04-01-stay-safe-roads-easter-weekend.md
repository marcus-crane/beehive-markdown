Transport Minister Steven Joyce is reminding road-users to take care on the roads over the Easter break.

"Holiday weekends mean a lot of extra traffic on the roads. Please use common sense and be mindful of other road users," he says.

The Official Easter holiday period runs from 4.00pm today until 6.00am on Tuesday 6 April.

Last year over the Easter holiday period 7 people died on our roads and 191 were injured.

The current provisional road toll for 2010 stands at 101 - 4 lower than at the same time last year.

The government continues to work on improving New Zealand's road safety through its Safer Journeys road safety strategy to 2020.

"We are currently working to progress measures for improving the safety of younger drivers and reducing the impact of alcohol on our road toll. But to make significant progress in reducing the level of death and injury on New Zealand's roads we all need to take responsibility for road safety."

"Stay alert, drive to the conditions and don't take risks. A little commonsense will go a long way to ensuring this is a safe and happy Easter.
