Associate Tourism Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman today announced the release of new research to help operators and Regional Tourism Organisations boost business through more targeted marketing to domestic travellers.

"Domestic tourism contributes $12.4 billion a year to the economy. The government acknowledges how important the industry is and this research will help strengthen it,'' Dr Coleman says.

"The Ministry of Tourism's domestic segmentation research project has identified eight distinct domestic travel segments and provides profiles and recommendations on how to market to these holiday makers.

"Two thirds of New Zealanders want to spend more time travelling around their own country and this research will help the industry to get more Kiwis holidaying at home.''

Previously little was known about the profile of the New Zealand domestic traveller. The research adds a wealth of new knowledge identifying who these travellers are and how to reach them.  This is invaluable information for the industry.

A series of national workshops are starting next week to help Regional Tourism Organisations and operators tap into the research material.
