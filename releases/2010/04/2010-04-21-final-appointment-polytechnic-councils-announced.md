Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce today announced that Suzanne Snively is the final Ministerial appointment to the Councils of Wellington Institute of Technology and Whitireia Community Polytechnic.

"I am delighted to have a person of Suzanne Snively's skills agree to continue her work within the polytechnic sector;" says Mr Joyce.

Suzanne Snively is the current Deputy Chair of Whitireia Polytechnic, as well as being a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Wellington.

"In making this appointment, I took into account the other Ministerial appointments to both Wellington Institute of Technology and Whitireia Community Polytechnic," says Mr Joyce.

"The government is keen to encourage Polytechnics to work together in a complementary way and this cross-appointment will encourage that.

"The government wants to see strong and committed Councils, who are able to respond to challenges the sector is facing, as well as being able to look at areas where their work complements each other."

The appointment of Ms Snively means that all Ministerial appointments to Polytechnic Councils are finalised. From 1 May new Councils will be in place at all 20 polytechnics around New Zealand.
