Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has today announced Ministerial appointments to the new councils of all 20 polytechnics.

The changes to councils come with the introduction of the Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Act, which requires new polytechnic councils to be appointed by 1 May 2010. 

The 78 appointments comprise 33 existing council members and 45 new appointees.  A further two appointments will be made in due course.

As well as four Ministerial appointees, each new council is to have four members appointed by the polytechnic's council. 

A number of cross-appointments have been made to geographically related councils.  The most significant of these are in the Wellington area where three Ministerial appointees sit on the boards of both Whitireia Polytech and Weltec.

"The government is keen to encourage Polytechs to work together in a complementary way and the cross-appointments we have made will encourage that," says Mr Joyce.

Mr Joyce says he is impressed by the experience that these council members will bring to the governance of polytechnic councils. 

"These appointments will help strengthen the performance of the polytechnics which play such a vital role in our educational and economic future.

"This means the polytechnics' current councils are able to decide their non-ministerial-appointed members based on their knowledge of the needs of their communities and the issues they face.

"The Act equips polytechnics with the potential for strong and effective councils that are well placed to respond to the challenges faced by the sector in a tight fiscal environment.

"Councils will need to address the call of the Tertiary Education Strategy for greater efficiency and improved educational and financial performance to deliver the best possible return on the public investment.

"An important first task for the new councils will be to participate in the process for the development of polytechnics' next round of Investment Plans for 2011.

"I look forward to working with councils to ensure their students meet the future skill needs of New Zealand," says Mr Joyce.
