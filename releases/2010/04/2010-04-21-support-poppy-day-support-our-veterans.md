Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins has urged all New Zealanders to support the RSA's Poppy Day street appeal on Friday.

"The RSA Poppy Day appeal is a tangible way to directly assist veterans who have served this country," Ms Collins said.

"Every year, tens of thousands of New Zealanders wear the poppy to honour these brave men and women, and to help support the RSA's welfare services."

Since 1922 Poppy Day has been the RSA's most important fundraising  appeal of the year. More than 200 RSAs from Kaitaia to Bluff will take part and are hoping to raise more than $1 million. 

The proceeds of the appeal help fund specialist medical appointments, hospital and home visits for veterans, glasses, hearing aids and essential dental work.

"The Poppy Day Appeal enables the RSA to provide invaluable assistance for our veterans and their families. I would urge all New Zealanders to support their good work on Poppy Day," Ms Collins said.

Ms Collins will commemorate ANZAC Day at Gallipoli, attending the Dawn Service, the New Zealand National Service and the Australian National Service.
