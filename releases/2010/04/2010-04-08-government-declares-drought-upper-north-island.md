Drought-stricken farmers in Waikato and the Rodney, Papakura and Manukau districts are to get assistance from the Government.

Agriculture Minister David Carter today declared the areas as medium-level drought zones, triggering government relief measures. Drought was declared in Northland in late January.

The measures offered include tax assistance for farmers under the Income Equalisation Scheme, farm management advice, welfare support and funding for Rural Support Trusts to provide help.

"The current situation in the upper North Island is grim and there is no immediate relief in sight," says Mr Carter. "Without adequate rain, it is likely that farmers in Northland and Waikato will be facing feed shortages going into winter, so now is the time to prepare."

Mr Carter is urging farmers who are finding conditions tough to talk to their local Rural Support Trust and to seek advice on planning and management decisions.

"Farming communities are the lifeblood of provincial New Zealand and the Government is fully committed to providing the right level of support," Mr Carter says.

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff are continuing to monitor the dry conditions in other parts of the country, particularly Otago, and are working with Rural Support Trusts, Regional Councils and Federated Farmers and other industry bodies.
