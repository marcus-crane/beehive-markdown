Five hundred days from the start of Rugby World Cup 2011, six All Black greats have signed up to help the Government make the most of the opportunity of hosting one of the world's biggest sports events.

Rugby World Cup Ministers Murray McCully and Gerry Brownlee hosted an event at Parliament today to mark the ‘500 days to go' milestone, and unveiled two of the Government's leverage programmes: the New Zealand 2011 Ambassadors, and the New Zealand 2011 Business Club.

"In 500 days the biggest event New Zealand has ever hosted kicks off.  An estimated 85,000 visitors will come here, and billions will be watching on television.  Our challenge is to make the most of that attention:  to showcase what we do well as a country; to build and strengthen business relationships, and to attract tourists," Mr McCully said.

"The Government is thrilled to have secured the high-powered support of Jonah Lomu, Sean Fitzpatrick, John Kirwan, David Kirk, Andy Haden, and Andrew Mehrtens to help meet that challenge.

"There are no better ambassadors for our country during the Rugby World Cup than All Blacks legends, and it is outstanding that these six are donating their time and considerable profile to support the Government's efforts to promote New Zealand.

"Jonah, Sean, and John are already working with the NZ2011 Office and government agencies overseas to promote New Zealand as a great place to visit and do business.

"They've attended recent events in France, Italy, and Hong Kong, where they talked with business executives and industry leaders about what 2011 means to this country and what New Zealand, as a small trading nation, has to offer.

"A programme of events for the next 500 days is being developed, including a major promotional effort with David Kirk in Australia on the eve of the September Bledisloe Cup match, and to coincide with the "one year to go" mark.  

"Australia will provide the most visitors during the Rugby World Cup, and we have an opportunity to promote New Zealand from a tourism and business perspective in that important market.  As the only All Blacks captain to have held the Webb Ellis trophy aloft, David Kirk will bring something special to our promotional efforts in Australia where he also has a strong business profile," Mr McCully said.

"I am grateful for the willingness of our new NZ2011 Ambassadors to donate their time in this way.  We are determined to make the most of the promotional opportunities that the next 500 days offer New Zealand, and they will make a fantastic contribution."
