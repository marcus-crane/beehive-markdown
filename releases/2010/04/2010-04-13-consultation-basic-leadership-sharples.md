The Minister of Maori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples says he is looking forward to attending the consultation hui on the Foreshore and Seabed in Gisborne.

"I look forward to meeting with Maori, to hear their views on the options put forward," said Dr Sharples.

"The Government is working with the Maori Party to restore Maori customary rights and access to justice, unlike Labour's Maori MPs who worked with their government colleagues to abolish them," he said.

"Repeal of Labour's Foreshore and Seabed Act will enable the spectrum of customary rights that were unilaterally trampled on by the previous Government to be restored.

"Right now it's up to Maori to say what rights they want recognised. I want to hear their views kanohi ki te kanohi, rangatira ki te rangatira. It's called consultation."

"But Labour's Mr Jones doesn't seem to understand these kinds of basics. Basics that overlook tikanga. Basics which contravene Maori rights when Labour rammed through the Foreshore and Seabed Act in 2004 without consulting Maori. And basics when it comes to leadership", said Dr Sharples.
