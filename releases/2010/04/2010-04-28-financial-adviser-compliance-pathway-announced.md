Commerce Minister Simon Power tonight announced that financial advisers will be given extra time to fully comply with the new financial advisers regime.

He made the announcement at the Institute of Financial Professionals New Zealand annual awards in Auckland.

The pathway will still require all financial advisers to be registered under the Financial Service Providers Act and to have become a member of an approved dispute resolution scheme by 1 December of this year.

However, they will then have until June 30 next year, when the regime comes into effect, to complete any required training and have applications for authorisation and qualifying financial entity status processed by the Securities Commission.

"I have listened to the concerns of the industry about the importance of their being enough time for individuals and companies to go through the authorisation and education process.

"The industry has advised me this will give sufficient time for these elements to be completed**.**

"This regime is essential if we are to have a financial adviser sector which mum and dad investors and investment product providers can have confidence in."

Mr Power said he expected to make further announcements soon on the treatment of advice to wholesale clients, generic advice often issued by institutions rather than individuals, and how the regime deals with group corporate structures. 

**Q & A's**

**What will Financial Advisers have to do by December 2010 to comply with the regime?**

All financial service providers, including financial advisers, will have to be registered and be a member of an approved dispute resolution scheme. Financial advisers will also have to have submitted their applications for authorisation (or in the case of a QFE, have submitted their applications for QFE status) and started undertaking any training necessary.

**What will Financial Advisers have to do by June 2011?**

Financial Advisers wanting to provide financial advice on securities or wanting to provide financial planning services will have to have completed all necessary training and be authorised by June 2011. Similarly organisations seeking QFE status will have to be approved by June 2011. Any entity or individual wanting to provide advice after this time will need to do so in full compliance with the law.

**When will the Financial Service Providers (Pre-Implementation Adjustments) Bill and the Code of Conduct for Financial Advisers be finalised?**

It is expected that both the code and the bill will be finalised by July this year. Once the regime is in place, it is expected that advisers will be able to begin engaging more actively with the regime.

**How will the ‘pathway to compliance' impact on other financial service providers?**

Financial service providers who do not provide financial advice will need to be registered and be a member of an approved dispute resolution scheme by December 2010. If a financial service provider is not registered or has not become a member of a dispute resolution scheme by this time, they will not be permitted to continue providing those financial services.
