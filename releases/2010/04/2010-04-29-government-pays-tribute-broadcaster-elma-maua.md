Radio broadcaster Elma Maua was a leader in her field of journalism and a trailblazer for Pacific Island people generally and will be greatly missed, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Georgina te Heuheu said today.

Ms Maua, a former sports editor of Radio New Zealand International, died yesterday after a long illness.  She was 61.

"We offer our sincere condolences to Elma's family and friends and to her colleagues and contacts who spread around the world.

"I want to acknowledge Elma's courage particularly during her period of illness and her achievements as a professional journalist.  She was an inspiration to others, including those in the Pacific Islands community," Mrs te Heuheu said.

Elma Maua was born in the Cook Islands and was among the earliest Pacific Islands journalists in New Zealand.  She worked for Radio New Zealand and Niu FM.

In 1999, she worked in the Cook Islands Prime Minister's Office.

She is survived by five children.
