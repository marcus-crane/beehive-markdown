Students will have strong performances in individual courses recognised from next year across all NCEA levels says Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"This will provide extra motivation for students as well as clearer information for parents, employers and tertiary institutions," says Mrs Tolley.

"Students will now be able to gain Excellence or Merit endorsements in individual courses at NCEA Levels 1-3, in addition to Certificate Endorsement.

"Their strengths in individual courses will be formally recognised, which in turn will lead to much more clarity for potential employers and tertiary institutions.

"Certificate Endorsement has been effective in motivating students, and I'm confident Course Endorsement will have the same effect as we encourage our young people to reach their potential."

"Course Endorsement was to have been introduced progressively across NCEA Levels 1-3, but will now be implemented at all levels from 2011."

Students will receive an Excellence endorsement for a course if they gain 14 credits at Excellence level, while students gaining 14 credits at Merit (or Merit and Excellence) will gain a Merit endorsement.

To ensure students are capable of performing well in both modes of assessment, in most courses at least three of the 14 credits must be from internally assessed standards, and three from externally assessed standards.
