Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia is inviting public feedback on a draft Code of Funding Practice.

The Code will assist government agencies and community organisations to work together to build better funding arrangements.

It will address issues such as managing risk and negotiations, high compliance costs, accountability, shared outcomes, monitoring and reporting.

"We are keen to try new ways of delivering funding and contracting with service providers so that families, whanau and communities reap the benefit," says Mrs Turia.

Until now the main sources of guidance for the public sector on funding arrangements have been developed by the Treasury and Office of the Auditor-General.

The Code is being written to complement these existing guidance documents.

Public feedback closes on May 14 and can be made online or on a comment form on the Standards New Zealand website [www.standards.co.nz.](//194-0000000031CB8493F3BAC34CB197306E12CEEFBC070095ABAE8F587AD64C83F53567843FD3E7000001C182F900004AE95AD1510E7D4F90312CF901455C170000001C31E60000/www.standards.co.nz.)

The new Code of Funding Practice will be released on June 30.
