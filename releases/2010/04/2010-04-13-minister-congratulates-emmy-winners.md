The creators of *Reservoir Hill* have showcased New Zealand's television talent on the world stage after scooping a prestigious Emmy Award in Cannes, France today says Broadcasting Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman.

Dr Coleman extended his congratulations to the show's producers and says the award makes history after winning New Zealand's first Emmy in the International Digital category.

\`\`New Zealand's creative talent is again being recognised at the highest level. *Reservoir* producers Thomas Robins and David Stubbs take a bow. They've broken new ground in online content and have produced a world-class show,'' Dr Coleman says.

\`\`This show was a trailblazer for an online drama as viewers could interact with the main character via mobile and online messaging. I also congratulate Television New Zealand and New Zealand on Air for backing *Reservoir Hill*.''

*Reservoir Hill's* nomination was the first for a New Zealand show in the International Digital Emmy category. It was up against finalists from four other countries.

The judges said *Reservoir Hill* masterfully demonstrated how to enhance the viewers' multi-platform experience.

The show was filmed in Porirua and centred on 16-year-old Beth Connolly, played by Beth Chotes, who moved from the country to the city.
