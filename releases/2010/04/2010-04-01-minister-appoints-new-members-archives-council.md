The Minister Responsible for Archives New Zealand Nathan Guy has announced the appointment of three new members to the Archives Council.

The Council has a statutory role to provide the Minister with independent advice on archives and recordkeeping issues.

"These new members bring a range of useful skills and experience to the Council," said Mr Guy.

"The recently announced integration of Archives New Zealand with the Department of Internal Affairs will not change the major roles and functions of either agency, and I look forward to continuing to receive advice from the Council."

Dame Anne Salmond is a well known author and Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Maori Studies at the University of Auckland.

Barry Holdaway is a local guide and historian with an agricultural background.

George Reedy is a chartered accountant with an MBA and interest in Maori business development.

Existing Council members Richard Nottage CNZM (Chair), Ani Pahuru-Huriwai, Mel Smith CNZM and Stuart Strachan QSO have been reappointed for a further three year term.

"Council members have considerable experience in recordkeeping, information management and specialist knowledge - including tikanga Māori.

"I thank the previous members for their service and look forward to the input of the new Council. They have an important role to play in continuing the good work of Archives New Zealand."
