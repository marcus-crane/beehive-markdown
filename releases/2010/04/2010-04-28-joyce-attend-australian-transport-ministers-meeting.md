Transport Minister Steven Joyce will attend the Australian Transport Council meeting of Australian Federal and State Transport Ministers on 30 April in Perth, Western Australia.

The Minister attended the meeting, which happens twice annually, in May of last year and says it was a valuable opportunity to engage with Ministers on a number of issues common to both countries.

"A major focus of this week's meeting will be road safety.  New Zealand's new 10-year *Safer Journeys* road safety strategy draws a lot from experiences in Australia so it will be very useful to discuss some of the issues we face here with my Australian counterparts."

While in Perth Mr Joyce will also undertake a range of visits and meetings covering the Transport, Tertiary Education and Communications and Information Technology portfolios. 

Mr Joyce departs this afternoon and will return early on Saturday morning.
