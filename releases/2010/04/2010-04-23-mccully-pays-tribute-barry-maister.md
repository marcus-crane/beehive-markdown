Sport and Recreation Minister Murray McCully today paid tribute to Barry Maister, who is stepping down as Secretary General of the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC).

After 10 years at the helm of the NZOC, Maister is leaving at the end of this year to concentrate on his new role as a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

"Under Barry Maister's leadership, the NZOC has forged ahead as an effective, sustainable organisation that has given our athletes the best possible support at Olympic and Commonwealth Games," Mr McCully said.

"Barry has also played an important role in improving coordination between national sports organisations and other key players in the high performance sport area.   

"I wish Barry all the best in his new role on the IOC. It can only be to New Zealand's advantage to have someone of his ability on such an important body, where he is sure to make a valuable contribution," Mr McCully said.
