Plans to cater for an increasing school-age population in Rolleston and Lincoln were announced today by Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"Rolleston-Lincoln's school-age population is expected to grow by more than 2,700 students by 2026," says Mrs Tolley.

"We need to make sure we have enough schools to cater for this increase in students.

"Our first step was to open Clearview Primary School this year, which will eventually cater for up to 600 Year 1 to 8 pupils.

"More than $10 million was invested in the new school and it was needed urgently to meet demand for a primary school in Rolleston.

"Following extensive consultation with the community, we have plans in place to continue to meet increases in the school-aged population."

Plans include:

- Providing extra classrooms for schools that have an increased roll.

<!--THE END-->

- Letting state-integrated schools apply to increase the maximum number of students they can enrol.

<!--THE END-->

- Careful monitoring of population growth by the Ministry of Education, and if needed, building a new secondary school and/or primary school in the area.

"At the moment, there are enough existing and planned early childhood education providers to meet demand. We'll continue to monitor this.

"I'd like to acknowledge the many organisations, boards of trustees, and community members who took part in consultation. I am encouraged by the Rolleston-Lincoln community's dedication to education."
