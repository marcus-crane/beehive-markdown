**M**Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples says he is shocked to hear allegations that a government Minister and an official attempted to influence the outcome of a rugby match between the Maori All Blacks and the Springboks in 1956.

"Bishop Muru Walters' statement is the first I have heard of this, and I am appalled," said Dr Sharples.

"I understand Bishop Walters intends to approach me, and I look forward to hearing more details," said Dr Sharples.
