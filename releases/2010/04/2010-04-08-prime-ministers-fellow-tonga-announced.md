Prime Minister John Key has announced that Tonga's Solicitor-General, ‘Aminiasi Kefu, will be the New Zealand Prime Minister's Fellow for Tonga this year.

Mr Key says, "Mr Kefu already has strong ties with both the legal fraternity and academic institutions in New Zealand and this visit will provide an opportunity to further cement those links, as well as foster new ones.

"It is also significant that Mr Kefu's visit is occurring during a year of historic significance for Tonga.

"New Zealand is committed to supporting Tonga's democratic reform and I am pleased this visit will provide Mr Kefu with a number of public opportunities to speak about the role he is playing in this process."

The Prime Minister's Fellowship was established in 2008 as a coronation gift to King George Tupou V. It is intended to develop leadership and encourage personal friendships between key figures in New Zealand and Tonga.

Mr Kefu will visit New Zealand from 10-17 April and will meet with a range of contacts in Hamilton, Auckland and Wellington.
