Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has announced the appointment of Dr Robin Dunlop as the chair of the Engineering Associates Registration Board.

"Dr Dunlop has a high level of understanding of governance principles and has held a considerable number of senior board appointments," Mr Williamson says.

"He has demonstrated an ability to lead a board consisting mainly of representatives of nominating associations with a diverse background."

Mr Williamson also announced that David Leask has been reappointed as a member of the Engineering Associates Registration Board, after previously serving on the Board as the Institute of Measurement and Control's representative from 1992 to 2006.

The Engineering Associates Registration Board was established under the Engineering Associates Act 1961. Its primary function is to consider the competence of Engineering Technologists and approve or decline their applications for registration.

Dr Dunlop replaces Ian Shearer, who resigned his position last year to accept an employment offer overseas. Due to legislative requirements, Dr Dunlop's initial term will be until September 2010.
