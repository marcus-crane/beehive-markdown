New Zealand is contributing $400,000 to humanitarian relief for victims of the earthquake that hit Qinghai Province in China, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"Over 2000 people are dead, nearly 12,000 are injured, and tens of thousands have been left homeless by the quake," Mr McCully said.

"China has well-established disaster response systems, and launched a prompt relief operation to help survivors in Qinghai, which is a remote and mountainous region.  As a close friend and partner, New Zealand wants to support efforts to provide emergency shelter and to ensure medicine and food supplies reach those in need."

New Zealand funding will go to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to support the work of China Red Cross.

New Zealand Embassy officials will meet with the Secretary General of Qinghai Red Cross, as well as provincial officials during a scheduled visit to the capital Xining later this week.
