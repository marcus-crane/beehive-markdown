Latest figures show the number of jobs advertised online have continued to increase over the last three months says Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

The Department of Labour's Jobs Online, which monitors job advertisements on the Internet, shows listed skilled jobs increased by 8.3 percent and job vacancies overall jumped 9.5 percent between January and March.

"It's a positive sign in a labour market that while still weak, is showing signs of hope," says Employment Minister Paula Bennett.

Since we hit a recessionary low in June last year, total advertised vacancies have increased by 23.1 percent.

"This trend was evident across all regions, with particularly strong growth in the North Island," says Ms Bennett.

Jobs Online reported increases across most industries, particularly education, construction and engineering.

"These sectors are showing a significant turnaround from previous months," says Ms Bennett.

Jobs Online was launched in December 2009 and collates data from New Zealand's leading online advertisers Trade Me jobs, Herald jobs and Seek.
