Up to 100 young New Zealanders each year will be able to spend 12 months living and working in Turkey, following the signing of a reciprocal Working Holiday Scheme, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

Mr Key signed the agreement today (11.15pm NZT, 22 April) in Ankara with his Turkish counterpart, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The two Prime Ministers also signed an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement and issued a joint declaration.  The declaration outlines how ties between New Zealand and Turkey can be broadened and strengthened.

"The annual ANZAC commemorations on Gallipoli Peninsula underpin a strong bond.   We can use these historical ties to grow trade and investment between our two countries," says Mr Key.

"Turkey can become a key gateway to Europe, the Caucasus and the Middle East for New Zealand businesses.  It also has a significant and rapidly expanding market of its own. 

"New Zealand can play a similar role for Turkish businesses wishing to benefit from the fast-growing Asia Pacific market."

Tomorrow Mr Key heads to the Gallipoli peninsula where he will attend a number of commemoration services.
