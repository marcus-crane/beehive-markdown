The government is contributing $1.69 million to develop a shared research facility for seafood and aquaculture innovation that is likely to result in substantial national economic benefits, Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

Mr Brownlee said the facility, owned by the Cawthron Institute near Nelson, involves a partnership with the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, industry - including a consortium of shellfish companies who are already working with Cawthron - and other research organisations involved with seafood and aquaculture.

"The aquaculture sector has considerable potential for economic growth.  The industry goal is to grow sector sales to $1 billion by 2025.  This funding, along with other initiatives such as upcoming legislative reforms, is part of the government's commitment to that goal," Mr Brownlee said.

The centre will provide the opportunity for aquaculture companies to take a product or technique from research through to pilot scale commercial production on the one site. 

"One of the key economic issues facing New Zealand in many sectors is the need to develop new, higher value products.  This facility will help the aquaculture sector investigate and pilot high-value species and products, including enabling spat to be artificially grown onshore in commercial quantity, reducing the industry's reliance on limited wild stocks," Mr Brownlee said.

The facility will also allow greater collaboration between research organisations, education providers and industry. 

The shared research facility and associated site infrastructure is expected to cost $5.73 million, including the $1.69 million of government funding.
