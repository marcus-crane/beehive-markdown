Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that Corstorphine School in South Dunedin will close on 2 July 2010.

"The school's Board of Trustees formally requested closure in October last year, because of a steadily declining roll," said Mrs Tolley. 

"I've listened to the Board and have also reviewed population projections, which don't show any prospect for growth.

"After considering the feedback from consultation, I believe closing the school is the right decision.

"Nearby South Dunedin schools have the capacity to take Corstorphine's current students. These schools will also have access to the Education Development Initiative funding generated by Corstorphine's closure, to support students as they transition to a new school.

"It's always a difficult decision to close a school, and I appreciate the service staff and trustees have given Corstorphine School and its community over the years."

Once the school is closed in July the site and buildings will be disposed of in accordance with all statutory, regulatory and government policy requirements.
