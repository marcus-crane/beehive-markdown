Several events have been planned today to mark World Intellectual Property Day.

The events being organised through the Ministry of Economic Development's Intellectual Property Office will include a special panel discussion between Wellington secondary school students and high profile film, music and science mentors.

"These students will have a unique opportunity to discover how kiwi innovation is leading the world, and learn about the costs of misusing and abusing other people's intellectual property," Commerce Minister Simon Power said.

"World Intellectual Property Day is also a time to reflect on local successes in our creative industries.

"Avatar is a case and point. Innovative technologies at Weta Digital were responsible for Avatar's stunning visual effects which contributed millions to the New Zealand economy.

"New Zealand innovation has also contributed to world leading technological breakthroughs in a diverse range of fields from science to adventure tourism."

The Government also recognises the role it must play to create an environment that enables firms and others to engage in innovation.

To coincide with World IP Day, the Ministry of Economic Development is publishing a commissioned report examining how the IP system can encourage innovation and productivity in the New Zealand economy.
