New requirements for water efficiency labels will help consumers make informed choices about water consumption and relative water efficiency when purchasing washing machines, dishwashers, taps, toilets and showers, Minister of Consumer Affairs Heather Roy said today.

"Water efficiency labels have an easy-to-use zero to six-star rating system similar to that used for electrical appliances - the more stars an appliance has, the more water efficient it is.  The labels will also provide water consumption information based on litres per minute, cycle or flush," Mrs Roy said.

"The labels will be phased in over the next 12 months.  This new information will help consumers make better informed decisions and access benefits associated with reduced water consumption - particularly hot water consumption, which can lead to reduced energy bills.

"Being able to reduce water use lessens demand on water supply infrastructure and may avoid the need to invest in new plant or storage lakes, or to extract more water from rivers.  It is also important for those consumers who pay for water, or who have restricted supplies.

"Consumers may have already noticed the Australian water efficiency labels on products.  The New Zealand system will match that of Australia's, and both New Zealand and Australia's labelling requirements are based on a joint industry standard (AS/NZS 6400).

"As well as assisting consumers, water efficiency labelling will benefit business.  Having a scheme comparable with Australia allows New Zealand industry to sell these products in the Australian market, and is consistent with the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market initiatives

"The Commerce Commission will enforce the Consumer Information Standards (Water Efficiency) Regulations 2010 that have been made under the Fair Trading Act," Mrs Roy said.
