New Zealand's Portuguese communities will today celebrate their place in our country's heritage by adding culturally significant ribbons to Parliament's Mooring Stone.

The Mooring Stone, situated on Parliament's Galleria floor, was commissioned in 1994 as part of the These Matters of Pride exhibition, a living art work that represents migration to New Zealand since the time of Maori.

Attached to the large stone are more than 50 brightly coloured ribbons which have been added over the past 15 years by many different Ethnic communities.

"The ribbons on the Mooring Stone are a symbol of the various cultural and Ethnic strands that make up New Zealand and it is great to see our Portuguese community attaching their strand to showcase their stake in New Zealand," Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong says.

"By attaching their ribbon, our Portuguese communities are ensuring that their strand of culture, heritage and traditional fabric is being woven into our country's cultural landscape.

"Portuguese New Zealanders have a proud history in New Zealand and it is wonderful to see them adding to the Mooring Stone and to the many Ethnic communities who have added their strand and shown they are proud New Zealanders."

The ribbon hanging ceremony, organised by Amigos de Portugal, will take place at 11am and will be attended by Mrs Wong, Portuguese Consul General Dr Simeão Archer Pinto de Mesquita and members of our Portuguese community.
