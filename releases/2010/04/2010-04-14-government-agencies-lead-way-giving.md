Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia has today congratulated two government agencies for leading the way in payroll giving.

Ministry of Social Development and the Department of Internal Affairs staff are now able to make regular donations from their pay to the organisations they support.

While payroll giving changes the way that people can make donations, it also significantly changes the way organisations such as charities, sports clubs, churches and schools receive their donations.

In the past donors had to save receipts and then submit them at the end of the year to obtain their tax refund.

"Payroll giving is more convenient with donations transferred directly to organisations and donors able to get tax credits straight away," says Mrs Turia.

The Social Development Ministry currently has up to 1,500 organisations from which staff can choose to donate to and will increase that number over time.

"Schools will be next and there are potentially 20,000 donees that could benefit from this innovative way of supporting community organisations."

"I want to encourage all employers to introduce payroll giving and have asked the Ministry of Social Development to look at ways that payroll giving can be extended across the State sector and also to private sector employers."
