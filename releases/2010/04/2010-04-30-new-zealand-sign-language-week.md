Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia is celebrating New Zealand Sign Language week by formally announcing a review of the New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006.

New Zealand Sign Language Week runs from May 2 to 8.

The review will assess how government agencies are implementing the aims of the Act and suggest improvements that may be needed.

"Whether it is about cervical screening, assistance for young people or a civil defence announcement all government services, information or public announcements should be accessible to the Deaf community and that may include the use of New Zealand Sign Language," says Mrs Turia.

The review will also look at how well the right to use New Zealand Sign Language in legal proceedings is being realised, progress on the development of training standards and competencies of New Zealand Sign Language interpreters and the consultation by government agencies with the Deaf community.

The Office for Disability Issues will be involving Deaf people in planning the review prior to the consultation happening with the Deaf community, interpreters and other interested people.

"It is vital to make the Act work for the Deaf community. I look forward to the findings of the review and will report back to Parliament later this year 2010," says Mrs Turia.

On Monday, 3 May 2010, Associate Minster of Disability Issues Pansy Wong will be joining Wellingtonians in learning sign language phrases at Turnbull House, as part of events organised by Deaf Aotearoa to celebrate and promote New Zealand Sign Language week.

Mrs Wong will be joining a group of foreign diplomats and many others in learning to say phrases in New Zealand Sign Language, our country's third official language alongside English and Maori.

"New Zealand Sign Language Week is an important week in terms of educating our communities about one of our national languages, which is spoken by 24,000 New Zealanders," Mrs Wong says.

"What better way to kick it off than learning to say a few simple phrases and learning to better communicate with our deaf community?"

Mrs Wong will also join the "Line of Signers", who are lining up from the Railway Station along Lambton Quay, Wellington, to demonstrate what she has learned.

"We want to encourage all New Zealanders to participate in the week, to support our Deaf community."
