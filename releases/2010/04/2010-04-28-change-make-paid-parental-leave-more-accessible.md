A simple change to Paid Parental Leave will make it easier for self-employed parents to benefit from the scheme, says Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson.

Self-employed people have been eligible for the scheme since 2006 by submitting a declaration confirming their earnings and their self-employed status.

Currently these declarations have to be verified by a chartered accountant, or they can be witnessed by a Justice of the Peace or other person entitled to witness a statutory declaration under the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957.

Ms Wilkinson says tax advisors will now also be able to verify statements and declarations.

"I am aware that parents in rural areas or isolated communities may not enjoy easy access to chartered accountants or justices of the peace," says Ms Wilkinson.

"Enabling tax advisors to sign applications will improve their access to the assistance to which they are entitled. It will also help reduce the costs to parents of complying with legal requirements."

The change will come into effect on 1 July 2010.

Tax advisors need to be a member of an organisation that has approved advisor group status under the Tax Administration Act in order to be eligible to verify declarations.
