Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has thanked the Law Commission for its report on alcohol tabled in Parliament today.

"The report is a thought-provoking and an important contribution to the debate about how our society approaches and handles alcohol and the issues that surround it," Mr Dunne said.

The report, *Alcohol in our Lives: Curbing the Harm*, is part of the first full review of New Zealand's alcohol laws in over two decades.

"Clearly there are a lot of proposals, and some, such as raising the alcohol excise, are perhaps aspirational, but the Government will give due consideration to the entirety of the report.

"I look forward to working with my Ministerial colleagues on doing that and drawing out the recommendations that will best achieve an environment where responsible alcohol use marks the New Zealand drinking culture," he said.
