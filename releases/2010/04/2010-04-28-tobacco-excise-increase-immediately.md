Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia says tonight's passing of a bill to increase the tobacco excise will go a long way to reducing preventable deaths from smoking related diseases.

"If this legislation contributes to saving just one life then it has done its job but I am in no doubt that it will save hundreds of lives," says Mrs Turia.

"People are dying every day from smoking related diseases and I have always believed that putting up the price is a powerful tool for reducing smoking," says Mrs Turia.

"This Government is prepared to show leadership and is determined to tackle an issue that affects the health of most New Zealanders in one way or another."

"I know the increase may seem harsh to some but the health of our families, whanau and community is paramount and we need to do everything we can to deter people from smoking." 

Mrs Turia says the increases will help people to cut back but more importantly provide a strong incentive for smokers to quit and help dissuade young people from ever starting to smoke.

The new legislation will see tobacco excise increased in three steps over two years.  Cigarettes will rise immediately by 10% with a further 10% increase next January and a third increase of 10% in January 2012.

The excise on loose tobacco will rise by 24% immediately followed by the same 10% increases in 2011 and 2012 as for cigarettes.
