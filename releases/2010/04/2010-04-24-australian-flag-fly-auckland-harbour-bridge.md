The Australian flag will fly alongside the New Zealand flag on the Auckland Harbour Bridge on ANZAC day tomorrow.

Transport Minister Steven Joyce says having the flags flying together is a fitting tribute to the special relationship between the two countries born of the ANZAC spirit.

 "As a general rule we don't accept requests to have other countries' flags fly on the bridge but ANZAC day is a unique and special public day in New Zealand and I have asked the NZ Transport Agency to make it happen on behalf of the government."

Two New Zealand flags fly on the Auckland Harbour Bridge every day of the year.  The only other exception is Waitangi day when the Maori flag flies alongside the New Zealand flag to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.
