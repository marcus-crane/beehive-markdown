Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson is urging builders to have their say on proposed reforms that will impact on the way they work.

Mr Williamson told the Master Builders Federation Conference in Napier today that under proposed changes to the Building Act, builders will take more responsibility for making sure their work is up to scratch and fixing any faults.

"We need to update the Building Act, to reduce the cost and complexity of consenting, and have the people hired to do the work taking responsibility for building it right first time," he says.

"We're proposing a more balanced consenting system where for low risk work it's up to the builder to make sure the construction complies with the Building Code."

The proposed reforms also include requiring written contracts for building work that would include a guarantee and details about how disputes and faults will be remedied.

Mr Williamson says since he announced the proposed reforms at the end of February there has been a lot of discussion in the sector. 

"People have just over two weeks left to have their say on the proposed reforms, before consultation on the discussion document closes on Friday 23 April."

The proposed reforms are outlined in the discussion document, which is available on the Department of Building and Housing website at: [http://www.dbh.govt.nz/consulting-on-building-act](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/consulting-on-building-act)
