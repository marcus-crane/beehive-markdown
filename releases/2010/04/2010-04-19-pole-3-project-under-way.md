Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee has today kicked off Transpower's $672 million inter-island electricity connection project at the Haywards substation in Wellington.

Mr Brownlee turned the first sod on construction of the electrical systems and buildings necessary to increase the capacity of the inter-island link, which will deliver 1000 MW of electricity by April 2012, and 1200 MW in 2014, between the Haywards substation and the Benmore substation in the South Island's Waitaki Valley.

The high voltage direct current link, known as Pole 3, is an important step in increasing security of electricity supply, Mr Brownlee says.

"Pole 3 is one part of a much-needed broad investment programme to reinforce the national grid. 

"This new link will enable more renewable electricity generation to supply the North Island while also securing South Island demand in dry years."

Pole 3 will use modern equipment to convert electricity from alternating current, which runs through most of the country's transmission lines, to direct current and back again at the receiving end.  Direct current is used in the new link because it is more effective for transporting power over long distances.

The Pole 3 converter will replace the 45 year old Pole 1 facility, which will be decommissioned in late 2011.
