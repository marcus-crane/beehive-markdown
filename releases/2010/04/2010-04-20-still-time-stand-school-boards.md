Education Minister Anne Tolley today encouraged parents and community members to stand for school trustee elections ahead of Friday's deadline for nominations.

"School trustees can make a real difference to their school and to the local community," says Mrs Tolley.

"Being a member of a Board of Trustees is extremely rewarding, and brings responsibilities and challenges. This Government wants to give every single young New Zealander the chance to reach their potential, and school boards will make a huge contribution towards this."

School trustee elections are held every three years, and more than 100,000 New Zealanders from all walks of life have given their talents and time to serve on school boards over the last 21 years.

"The theme of this year's election is ‘Strong Leaders Make Strong Schools'. Strong leadership in our primary and secondary schools will help ensure the success of some of the most significant education initiatives of the past 20 years.

"The new curriculum, the introduction of National Standards in primary and intermediate schools, and the development of trades and service academies will all help raise achievement for young people.

"This is an exciting time to be a trustee. The Government places high trust in boards and their ability to provide strategic leadership for their school.

"I also encourage every parent to vote in the elections on 7 May, when nearly 2,500 schools will seek to fill more than 15,000 trustee places."

Nominations must be received by Friday 23 April. Those interested in standing, or making a nomination, should contact their school.
