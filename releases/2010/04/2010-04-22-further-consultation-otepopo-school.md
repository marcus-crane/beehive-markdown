Education Minister Anne Tolley has announced that further consultation is to take place over the future of Otepopo School.

"I've listened to the views of the community and have tried to find a locally-driven solution," says Mrs Tolley.

"As a result we are exploring more innovative ways of providing the best possible education for students on the current school site.

"I have asked the Ministry to consult with the Boards of Trustees at the neighbouring Hampden, Maheno and Weston schools on the option of retaining education on the Otepopo School site as a second campus of their school. The Commissioner of Otepopo School will also be invited to provide feedback on the proposal.

"If this approach is agreed upon then Otepopo School would close in its current form, with students re-enrolling at the new agreed school on the same site.

"For this proposal to work effectively it would need a long term commitment from the school taking on that responsibility. In light of this, each school board and the Commissioner may decide to consult with their communities.

"Once I have considered all the feedback I will be in a position to make a final decision about the future of education in this area."

Consultation will take place in May, with the schools scheduled to report back to the Ministry by 1 June.
