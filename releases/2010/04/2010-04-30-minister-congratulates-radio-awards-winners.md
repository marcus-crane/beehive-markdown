Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman today extended his congratulations to all the winners of the 2010 New Zealand Radio Awards.

‘'There's a wealth of talent in the radio industry and the country's finest presenters, producers and radio journalists were on show at the Radio Awards,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'The industry is competitive so to have scooped the top prize in the respective categories is a great achievement so congratulations to all the winners. The finalists also deserve praise for the making the top-three, which in itself is an impressive effort.''  

Fifty award winners were announced across a range of categories from news and sports to programming, on-air personalities and creativity and production.

In a first for the radio industry, the awards were presented in an online show.

Dr Coleman also acknowledged the Outstanding Contribution to Radio awards that were presented to Bill Francis and Brent Impey and the Services to Broadcasting Award to Kevin Black.

‘'Bill and Brent have contributed enormously to the New Zealand radio industry over the years and between them have added colour, ingenuity and real value. Kevin's run of nearly 30 consecutive years as a breakfast host is also a stunning effort and the recognition all three industry stalwarts have received is well deserved.''
