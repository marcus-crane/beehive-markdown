**Maori Language Commission appointments**

The Minister of Maori Affairs, the Hon Dr Pita Sharples, today announced new appointments and reappointments to the Board of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori, the Māori Language Commission. 

The two new members are Mr Te Awanuiārangi Black and Ms Evelyn Tobin, MNZM, JP.

Mr Ērima Hēnare was reappointed as Chair and Dr Dame Iritana Tāwhiwhirangi, DNZM, MBE and Mr Ruakere Hond were also reappointed.

"I am delighted with the overall calibre of members on this Board," Dr Sharples said.

Mr Black is a Māori medium training coordinator for Te Wānanga o Raukawa. He has previously worked as a lexicographer and in the museum sector. Ms Tobin has a strong background in Māori education. Both Ms Tobin and Mr Black are highly proficient Māori language speakers with strong credentials in Māori language revitalisation.

Dr Sharples said "I would also like to pay a particular tribute to the outgoing members of Te Taura Whiri, Hana O‘Regan and Dr Wayne Ngata, for their services over the last six years. Te Taura Whiri has lifted the profile of our language under their guidance," said Dr Sharples.

Dr Sharples is confident that the board will continue to provide strong leadership for Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.

**He mema hōu mo Te Taura Whiri i te Reo**

Kua pānui te Minita Take Māori, a Tākuta Pita Sharples, ko wai mā ngā mema hōu, ngā mema kua whakahokia anō ki te Rūnanga o Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.

Ko te tokorua hōu, ko Te Awanuiārangi Black rāua ko Evelyn Tobin.

Kua tohua anōtia a Ērima Hēnare hei Pouhere, ā, kua whakahokia anōtia a Kahurangi Iritana Tawhiwhirangi rāua ko Ruakere Hond ki ō rāua tūnga.

"Ka whakahīhī te ngākau i te kaha o ngā mema katoa o tēnei rūnanga," te kī a Tākuta Sharples.

He kaiwhakarite whakangungu rumaki Māori a Awanuiārangi Black i te Wānanga o Raukawa. I mua atu, he whakairo kupu tana mahi, i roto hoki ia i ngā whare taonga e mahi ana. He pūkenga a Evelyn Tobin ki ngā āhuatanga mātauranga Māori i roto i ngā kura. He matatau te tokorua nei ki te kōrero Māori, e mātau ana hoki ki te whakarauora i te reo.

"Me mihi ka tika ki ngā mema e whakawātea ana i ō rāua tūranga i tēnei wā - ki a Hana O'Regan rāua ko Tākuta Wayne Ngata - mo ā rāua mahi nunui i ngā tau e ono nei. I te roanga o tā rāua nei mahi mā te Runanga o Te Taura Whiri, kua tino whānui ake te whakapuakitanga o te reo," e ai ki a Tākuta Sharples.

E whakapono ana a Tākuta Sharples, ka kaha tonu te Rūnanga ki te hautū i Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori.
