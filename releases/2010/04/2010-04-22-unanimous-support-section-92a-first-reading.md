A bill that puts in place a three-notice regime to deter illegal file sharing unanimously passed its first reading in Parliament today.

"The Copyright (Infringement File Sharing) Amendment Bill sets up a fair and balanced process to deal with online copyright infringements," Commerce Minister Simon Power said.

"The three-notice process ensures that file sharers are given adequate warnings that unauthorised sharing of copyright works is illegal, at the same time as providing effective methods for copyright owners to enforce their rights.

"The bill also extends the jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal, enabling it to hear complaints and award penalties of up to $15,000.

"Copyright owners may also seek suspension of an internet account for up to six months through the District Court."

"Online copyright infringement has been especially damaging for the creative industry, which has experienced significant declines in revenue as file sharing has become more prevalent.

"The issue is a complex one and this bill is the result of extensive consultation to get it right."

The bill has been referred to the Commerce Select Committee for report back to Parliament in six months.
