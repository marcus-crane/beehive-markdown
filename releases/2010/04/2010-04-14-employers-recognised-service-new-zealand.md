Associate Minister of Defence Heather Roy today congratulated Television New Zealand for being named the 2010 Territorial Force Employer Support Council (TFESC) Employer of the Year at Parliament last night.

"Employers who allow their staff leave to serve with the Territorial Forces, and who encourage and support their employees' service to New Zealand, play a vital - yet often overlooked - role in the success of the New Zealand Defence Force," Mrs Roy said.

"Without the sacrifices and support of these organisations and individuals, we would have fewer men and women able to serve in the Reserve Forces - compromising the NZDF's ability to fulfil New Zealand's duties and obligations at home and abroad.

"This year the TFESC recognised the ongoing support that TVNZ has provided to Able-Seaman Lea Scott-Donlan, of the Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve.  Not only did TVNZ grant Able-Seaman Scott-Donlan leave with just two days notice to deploy to China aboard HMNZS Te Mana, but it also allowed him to take his camera equipment to document the experience.

"The Wellington District Command of the New Zealand Police was also recognised this year, receiving the 'Public Sector Employer of the Year' award for supporting NZ Army Territorial Force Staff Sergeant John McGrail - who has been granted leave over the past eight years to deploy to Timor Leste, Bougainville and Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, the award for 'Private Sector Employer of the Year' went to Dunedin small business Otago Business Systems for its ongoing support of senior salesman Lance Corporal Steve Aydon. Lance Corporal Aydon was recently given four months leave to serve with the peace support operation in Solomon Islands.

"It is often forgotten that the success and reputation of the NZDF does not rely solely on those who don a uniform and carry a weapon.  The TFESC awards acknowledges those who contribute from behind the scenes, and acknowledges that they also serve who stay at home," Mrs Roy said.
