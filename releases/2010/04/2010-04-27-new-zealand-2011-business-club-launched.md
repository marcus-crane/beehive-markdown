Associate Minister for the Rugby World Cup Gerry Brownlee today launched the New Zealand 2011 Business Club, an online platform to connect overseas business people interested in attending the Rugby World Cup with their Kiwi counterparts.

"The local rugby club has always been a centre of the community where business alliances are forged.  That's the flavour of what we're launching here today.  The internet gives us the capacity to replicate that club ethos online."

Mr Brownlee says the club will enable regions and businesses throughout the country to get information on the visitors coming to their area, including their business and social interests, so they can offer to host them at events and as a result learn more about how each operates in their own market.

"Many of the international visitors will be business people.  This will provide them opportunities to make business connections as well as social connections," he said.

Mr Brownlee says the New Zealand 2011 Government Ambassadors have been recruiting overseas business people to join the business club, and now local business people need to do their part in signing up to host them during the Rugby World Cup.

"The government is committed to increasing New Zealand's export base, and the Rugby World Cup is a great platform from which to better connect with potential international customers and distributors."

The New Zealand 2011 Office has been working closely with Business New Zealand and regional economic development agencies and chambers of commerce to develop its Business Engagement Programme.  New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has developed a guide to the opportunities in 2011, as well as a website to make procurement opportunities easily accessible to local businesses.

"I am encouraging all New Zealand businesses to explore the opportunities to make the most of the Rugby World Cup. Joining the NZ 2011 Business Club is a good first step," Mr Brownlee said.

**New Zealand 2011 Business Club Q&A**          

**What is the New Zealand 2011 Business Club?**

The New Zealand 2011 Business Club is an online platform connecting business people coming to New Zealand in 2011 with their Kiwi counterparts, be they in similar businesses or business sectors.  The Business Club has been developed by the New Zealand 2011 Office (Ministry of Economic Development), working with Business New Zealand and regional economic development agencies and chambers of commerce.  The Business Club is free to join for both New Zealand and overseas business people.

**How will it work?**

Overseas visitors will sign up to the Business Club through the [www.nz2011.govt.nz](http://www.nz2011.govt.nz/) website, and indicate the sort of social or business activities they are interested in taking part in while they are here.  New Zealand businesses will sign up to host events through the same website and be matched with people with the same areas of interests who'll be coming to their part of the country.

Regional economic development agencies and chambers of commerce will work with businesses in their area to develop hosting ideas and opportunities.

**If I'm an overseas business person coming to New Zealand in 2011, why should I join?**

Because it will help you get the most out of your trip.  You're coming for the rugby, but through the Business Club you'll also get to have a unique Kiwi experience, and you could make valuable business connections as well.

You'll be sent information and invited to attend events in your areas of interest with local hosts.  It'll be up to you how many you accept.  You'll be able to build up an itinerary of both Business Club and Festival events around the matches you plan to attend, and then book your travel around both.

**If I am a New Zealand business person, why should I join?**

By registering with the New Zealand 2011 Business Club you'll be able to access information on other business people planning to come here in 2011. By knowing their business and social interests you'll be able to tailor a social event you can host which they might like to attend.

The New Zealand 2011 Business Club will make the connections between guests and hosts who register, and also provide regular updates and information on events being developed around the country.

**How are you going to get overseas people to join?**

The New Zealand 2011 Office is working with a number of groups to market the Business Club and encourage business people travelling here in 2011 to join.  They include Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd, Rugby World Cup Limited and its global partners (including official travel agents), KEA (the global network of talented Kiwis and friends of New Zealand), New Zealand's trade, diplomatic and tourism posts off-shore and rugby clubs both in New Zealand and overseas.

**How do the New Zealand 2011 Government Ambassadors fit in?** 

The six New Zealand 2011 Government Ambassadors - Jonah Lomu, Sean Fitzpatrick, John Kirwan, David Kirk, Andy Haden and Andrew Mehrtens -  will work with the New Zealand 2011 Office and our trade, diplomatic and tourism posts off-shore - to help recruit people into the Business Club.  It will be part of their wider role of promoting New Zealand as a visitor destination in 2011 and ensuring New Zealand maximises the opportunities that come with hosting one of the world's biggest sports events.
