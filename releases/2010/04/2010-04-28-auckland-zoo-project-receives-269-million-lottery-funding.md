Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund of $2,694,000 towards the new Te Wao Nui visitor experience at Auckland Zoo.

"Te Wao Nui will be a modern zoo, a botanical garden, and a conservation park all rolled into one. Six different zones representing key areas in New Zealand will create an amazing journey of discovery for the 700,000 Auckland Zoo visitors each year.

"This will be a world class facility and a leader in conservation projects. Visitors to Te Wao Nui will be actively encouraged to play a role in preserving the environment once they leave the Auckland Zoo.

"This grant will contribute to the construction and fit-out of the facility, which is scheduled to be completed in January 2012.

"This is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and/or nation.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
