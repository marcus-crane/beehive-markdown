Approval has been given for Waikato DHB to add two dedicated elective surgery theatres to its $113 million redevelopment project at Waikato Hospital.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "Planning was well advanced for the new Waikato Clinical Centre when the opportunity to dedicate new operating theatres for elective surgery was identified. The DHB has grabbed that opportunity."

"The existing theatre capacity does not allow all elective operations to be scheduled when they should be, which can mean the operations need to be done privately."

There are currently 17 theatres at Waikato Hospital. By the time the Waikato Clinical Centre is complete, there will be 24 theatres at Waikato Hospital, including two theatres dedicated to day surgery, which will be operational by late 2013.

Meanwhile, the DHB has signed a contract worth around $800,000 with a local builder for the new Thames primary birthing unit.

The decision to build the birthing unit was made after a survey found more than 90 per cent of women would give birth in Thames if there was a new primary birthing facility.
