Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia **is calling on New Zealanders to support** Global Youth Services Day by recognising the contribution of young people.

"It's essential to celebrate the enormous contribution young people make everyday to the health and vitality of New Zealand communities," says Mrs Turia.

"Many young people support their community by volunteering at the marae, helping their families and supporting school, club and sports activities."

"Giving and volunteering is crucial for building strong communities and I encourage people to recognise their young people for the work they do in supporting their families, whanau and aiga."

International research suggests that people who get involved in volunteering from a young age are more likely to volunteer in later years, and data from Nielsen Media Research shows that New Zealand's young people are active as volunteers.

"I also want to thank those young people for their role in transforming our communities through their relentless energy and the leadership they show other young people," says Mrs Turia.
