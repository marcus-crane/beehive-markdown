Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says licence classes for builders and designers will reduce from six to two today, making the licensing process much simpler.

"Competent professionals will now find it easier to find the licence that is right for them. From today, there will be just one licence for design and another for site practitioners. Reducing the number of licences cuts costs, and makes licensing a whole lot easier," Mr Williamson says.

"We listened to the industry and took their feedback on board. The message was clear - the system was too complex and cumbersome.

"The improved licensing system which takes effect today complements the streamlining for qualified builders and tradespeople that I announced in February. It also completes the government's plan for streamlining builder licensing announced in August last year.

Other changes that take effect today are the introduction of a new foundations licence and new simplified application forms for tradespeople.

"Under the previous system, if you wanted a licensed practitioner to do foundations work, for example, after relocating a house, carpentry was the only relevant class. Now the people who do foundations work on a day to day basis can apply to be licensed," Mr Williamson says.

"The new rationalised and focused licence classes also mean consumers can have confidence that competent and accountable professionals are designing and building their homes. Consumers will have the necessary information, through an online register, to check on a practitioner they are looking at engaging and make an informed decision about who they use."

"It's about getting the right people licensed - but without jumping through unnecessary hoops," Mr Williamson says.
