Associate Transport Minister Nathan Guy has announced two new initiatives by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to improve the monitoring of commercial pilots with drug and alcohol issues. 

"New Zealand has a strong, safe and robust system for monitoring pilots. However the CAA has agreed to work on two initiatives to further improve public confidence, transparency and information gathering.  

"The CAA will work with the Ministry of Justice to introduce random checks on commercial pilots for any criminal convictions which have not been declared. This will be in addition to the existing check required when a pilot first enters the system, and the legal obligation they have to declare any convictions.

"Secondly, the CAA is proposing to introduce an electronic database which will enable them to more effectively gather information and monitor any trends.

"These measures are in addition to the current legislative requirements and policies carried out by airlines. This will further enhance public confidence in the system, and be cost effective.

"I'm confident that airlines take the issue of drug and alcohol abuse seriously, and that the vast majority of pilots do an outstanding job.

"The CAA will now work on implementing these measures and report back to me on progress by mid October," says Mr Guy.

**\*CAA reports on these initiatives are available upon request**

**Background Q&A**

*Who would this monitoring apply to?*

Commercial pilots only - recreational/student pilots are exempt.

*Is the current system for monitoring pilots safe?*

Yes. New Zealand has a rigorous and robust system for monitoring pilots. Before a pilot licence is granted by the CAA the applicant must satisfy the Director they are "fit and proper" to exercise the privilege. They are then subject to regular medical testing and legal obligations from the CAA and their employers.

*What does "fit and proper" mean?*

The Civil Aviation Act 1990 (section 10) sets out the criteria to be considered when determining whether or not a person is fit and proper, however there is no ‘one size fits all' standard for this and assessments are made on a case-by-case basis. The Act is available here: [http://www.caa.govt.nz/Legal\_Information/Civil\_Aviation\_Act\_1990.pdf](http://www.caa.govt.nz/Legal_Information/Civil_Aviation_Act_1990.pdf)

The criteria for the fit and proper person include:

- The applicant's conviction record for transport safety offences.
- The applicant's experience in the transport industry.
- The applicant's knowledge of aviation regulatory requirements.
- The applicant's history of compliance with transport safety regulatory

     requirements.

- The applicant's history of physical or mental health or behavioural

     problems.

Once a licence has been granted, pilots must continue to satisfy the fit and proper person test.

*How are pilots currently monitored and assessed for alcohol and drug use?*

The CAA monitors drug and alcohol use primarily through the medical certification system, set out in the Civil Aviation Act 1990. Pilots have a rigorous annual medical checkup, and past the age of 40 this is extended to twice a year.

When a pilot first applies for their license they are required to provide the CAA with reports from the Ministry of Justice in relation to criminal convictions and driving offences. Pilots are then obligated to inform the CAA of any criminal convictions.

In addition, airlines are required by law to ensure their employees carry out their duties safely and in accordance with prescribed standards. Most airlines have detailed policies and procedures on drug and alcohol abuse. Air New Zealand for example operates random drug and alcohol testing of staff. 

*How many pilots currently have drug or alcohol problems?*

Without an electronic database, the CAA cannot collate exact numbers in a short period of time. However, medical staff at the CAA say the numbers are very small. They believe the level of alcohol abuse and recreational drug use for pilots is well below that of the general population, and comparable with other nations.

Since 2000 there have been 8 prosecutions for an offence against section 46B of the Civil Aviation Act (fraudulent, misleading, or intentionally false statements to obtain medical certificate) relating to alcohol or drugs. In the same period there has been one prosecution for an offence against section 46C (failing to disclose information required by the Director of CAA) relating to drugs and alcohol.

An electronic database of medical records will make this kind of information easier to collate and monitor in future.

*How many pilots are there in New Zealand?*

The CAA has 10,242 pilots in the system, including aeroplanes, helicopters, balloons and gliders. Of these, 6,399 are commercial pilots.

*Why will the Ministry of Justice checks be random - why not check every pilot?*

Random testing will act as a strong incentive on pilots to disclose any convictions. Combined with the existing checks and balances, it will make it difficult for any pilot with an alcohol or drug to avoid detection.

*What is the difference between a Ministry of Justice check and full police vetting?*

A Ministry of Justice check reveals any criminal convictions. Police vetting is a more detailed (and expensive) procedure which involves a full check of any both criminal conviction information from the Ministry of Justice, and assessment of information held on the Police database about behaviours of a violent or sexual nature.

*Why only a Ministry of Justice check, rather than full police vetting?*

Police vetting is normally only conducted for occupations that involve regular contact with children, young people and vulnerable members of society. As pilots have less interaction with members of the public than taxi or bus drivers, this level of vetting is not considered appropriate or necessary.

*What is the difference between the standards required for a pilots license and that for a "P" endorsement i.e. bus and taxi drivers?*

Both pilots and taxi/bus drivers are subject to a medical, a fit and proper person assessment, must hold a licence at entry, and there are ongoing rules on alcohol and drug use.  Airlines are however required to monitor their employees - taxi and bus companies are not. 

*When will the electronic database and Ministry of Justice terminal be installed, and how much will they cost?*

The CAA will report back on progress by mid October 2010. The electronic database will be considered as part of the current funding review, which is set to be completed in 2011.

The Ministry of Justice terminal is estimated to cost around $20,000 (2005 estimate) and will be met out of the current financial year's budget.

*Will this cost pilots anything?*

No, CAA will collect information directly from the Ministry of Justice.

*Does this raise privacy issues for pilots?*

When commercial pilots sign their medical certificate application they give consent to CAA to seek information about them. This information is treated in the strictest confidence.

*What does the CAA's funding review involve?*

The review responds to a commitment by the CAA in the 2008/09 Statement of Intent and the Letter of Expectation from the previous Minister. The Funding Review will address the medium and longer term funding requirements of the CAA to undertake its safety role.

*What is the CAA's role in aviation regulation?*

The CAA is a Crown entity that regulates civil aviation in New Zealand.

The Minister of Transport establishes the rules that all pilots, engineers, airlines and air traffic controllers must follow to keep aviation safe and secure.

The CAA ensures that rules are being complied with and have the power to take action if they are not. They monitor safety and security performance throughout the aviation community.
