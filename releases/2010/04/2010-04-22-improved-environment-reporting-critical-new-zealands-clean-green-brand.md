Environment Minister Nick Smith today welcomed the release of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) review of the way reporting is carried out in New Zealand.

"National's 2008 election policy was to introduce a new Environment Reporting Act requiring independent five yearly State of the Environment Reports for the very reasons articulated by the Parliamentary Commissioner.

"It is telling that New Zealand is the only OECD country without a legislative basis for environment reporting.  This is inconsistent with our clean green brand and is on the Government's work programme to be rectified.

"There is also a real problem with inconsistent datasets around the country and this report rightly acknowledges efforts by the Ministry and the regions to address this problem. Over half of the 66 national datasets have been updated since the 2008 report and these include more meaningful national-scale information on freshwater, land and soils.

"Quality environmental reporting is as important to New Zealand's success as financial reporting.  It assists good decision making and helps build a reliable picture of how we are managing our natural capital.  The Government will be carefully considering the advice in this report in advancing its policy forward."
