Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia wishes to express her deepest condolences to Paralympics gold medalist Adam Hall after the sudden death of his mother today.

"My heartfelt sympathy and thoughts are with Adam and his family during this terrible time," says Mrs Turia.

"Gayle was clearly a great support to Adam and the look of pride on her face during the Paralympics will be an enduring memory that the family will treasure in the days to come.   My thoughts are with them all."
