The Government has agreed to support and take responsibility for funding a temporary entertainment facility and cruise ship terminal at Queens Wharf, Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"We are very pleased to be joining with our partners, the Auckland Regional Council, in announcing plans for a high-quality but cost-effective temporary facility which will meet the diverse needs of Auckland city during the Rugby World Cup celebrations next year," Mr McCully said.

"Having decided to put the permanent cruise terminal on hold until after the tournament, and also having listened to the strong criticism of the temporary options earlier mooted, this option provides a sound path forward. 

"The building is capable of meeting temporary cruise terminal requirements; being part of the fan zone activity, and providing a public entertainment space.

"It also features a media lounge, which will provide international media with an opportunity to be part of the waterfront festivities and to use the waterfront as an impressive backdrop for their international reports.

"Earlier temporary options involving the sheds were prohibitively expensive.  This building will cost approximately $9 million.

"Now that the Government and the ARC, as owners, have made the decision, we will work with other parties to put these plans in place.    That includes taking appropriate steps to ensure that historic values related to the wharf, including the sheds, are properly addressed.

"In terms of the future ownership and development of the wharf, the Government will engage with the new supercity and the Waterfront Development Agency immediately after the local body elections later this year," Mr McCully said.
