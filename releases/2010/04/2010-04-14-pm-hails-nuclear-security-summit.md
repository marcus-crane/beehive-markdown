Prime Minister John Key today hailed the Nuclear Security Summit as a crucial step forward in reducing the global threat from nuclear terrorism.

"This unprecedented gathering of world leaders was convened by President Obama to address the threat presented to global security by nuclear terrorism," says Mr Key.

"New Zealand is committed to playing our part to ensure that threat is never realised."

The 47 countries represented at the Nuclear Security Summit jointly released a communiqué and work plan designed to foster closer international cooperation and underline national responsibilities for the security of nuclear materials.

"New Zealand has long had an independent and principled voice on nuclear issues, and our anti-nuclear law is well known domestically and internationally," says Mr Key.

"Our participation in this summit has allowed me to underline the contribution a small country like ours can make to ensure nuclear materials do not fall into the wrong hands."

While in Washington DC, Mr Key also announced New Zealand's commitment to further funding of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Nuclear Security Fund.

New Zealand has committed almost $6 million to the Global Partnership since 2004.  One of the new projects will involve working with the United States on its Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative.
