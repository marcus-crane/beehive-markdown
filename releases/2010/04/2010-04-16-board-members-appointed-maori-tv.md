The Minister of Māori Affairs, the Hon Dr Pita Sharples, and the Minister of Finance, Hon Bill English today announced two new directors and the reappointment of Mr Wayne Walden to the Board of the Māori Television Service.

Sir Harawira (Wira) Gardiner, KNZM, and Ms Donna Gardiner are newly appointed, while Mr Walden ONZM, who has served over six years on the Board, continues his service as a board member.

"These appointments will provide leadership and guidance for the Māori Television Service as it moves into the next phase of its development," said Dr Sharples. "The appointees provide a mix of governance expertise, experience in Māori and indigenous cultural development, and business nous.

In making these announcements, the Ministers said "we would like to pay a special tribute to the outgoing members, Mr Rod Cornelius and Ms Wena Tait. They have been involved with the Māori Television since the beginning and have contributed to its growth over the years."
