Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant of $983,000 from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund to help develop Palmerston North's Te Manawa Museum and incorporate the New Zealand Rugby Museum.

"This grant to the Te Manawa Museums Trust is in addition to a grant of $500,000 last year from the Lottery Environment and Heritage committee.

"This will be a major boost to the project and is great news for the Manawatu region. The extra funding means it will be completed on time for the 2011 Rugby World Cup when Palmerston North will host two games.

"The move to better facilities is long overdue for the Rugby Museum, and the new complex will be a major attraction for visitors during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. I expect it will become an iconic tourist attraction in the years to come.

"This will help preserve much of the history of our national game for future generations to enjoy. It is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and/or nation.

Applications that were high priorities for funding showed their project was well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation had the capability to complete the project.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
