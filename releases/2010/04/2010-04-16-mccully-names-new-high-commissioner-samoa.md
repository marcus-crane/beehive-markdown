New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Samoa will be career diplomat Nick Hurley, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said.

"New Zealand greatly values its ties with Samoa.  The relationship is founded on longstanding historical and social connections and is characterised by friendship, trust and mutual respect," Mr McCully said.

"Our strong partnership, anchored by the Treaty of Friendship, encompasses substantial development assistance as well as political and trade links.  We also work closely together in the Pacific region.

"These ties were again evident in New Zealand's rapid and effective assistance to Samoa in the aftermath of the devastating tsunami which struck last year." 

Mr Hurley, currently Consul-General in Brisbane, has extensive Pacific experience. He has previously served as High Commissioner in the Solomon Islands and held postings in Fiji and the Cook Islands.

He takes up his assignment in late July, replacing Caroline Bilkey, who is returning to Wellington.
