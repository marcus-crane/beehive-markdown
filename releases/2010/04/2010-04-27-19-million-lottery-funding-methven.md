Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund of $1.9 million for the redevelopment of the Methven District Heritage Centre in the Mount Hutt Memorial Hall.

"This funding will help create an interactive exhibition on the history and culture of snow sports, and an education centre called ‘New Zealand's Alpine and Agriculture Encounter'.

"The new education centre will be unique in New Zealand and will showcase the region's alpine and agricultural history through an interactive visitor experience.

"This is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and/or nation.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
