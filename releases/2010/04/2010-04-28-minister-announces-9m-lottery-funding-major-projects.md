Internal Affairs Minister and Lottery Grants Board Presiding Member Nathan Guy has announced over $9.1 million in funding for six community-based projects through the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.

Funding has been awarded to:

- Auckland Zoo Charitable Trust: $2,694,000 for Te Wao Nui visitor experience
- Carter Observatory Trust, Wellington: $698,412 for refurbishment project
- Kauri Coast Community Pool Trust: $2,255,983 for a new pool complex (Dargaville)
- Methven Heritage Association Inc: $1,901,594 for Methven Heritage Project
- Ngāi Tahu Māori Rock Art Charitable Trust: $594,852 for Māori rock art visitor centre (Timaru)
- Te Manawa Museums Trust: $983,000 for the New Zealand Rugby Museum upgrade (Palmerston North).

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million.

"I am extremely pleased to announce this ‘make or break' funding.  Without this assistance from the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, these projects would be unable to be completed.

"These projects will significantly benefit their communities, regions and the whole nation.

"These projects show how lottery funding helps to build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

Applications that were high priorities for funding showed their project was well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation had the capability to complete the project.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
