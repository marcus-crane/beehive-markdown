The Minister of Māori Affairs, Dr Pita Sharples, today announced the appointment of Professor Tamati Reedy and the reappointment of Dr Robyn Anderson to the Waitangi Tribunal, each for a term of three years.

"I am pleased to have such high-calibre candidates being appointed and reappointed to the Tribunal. Professor Tamati Reedy has had a distinguished career in Māori affairs from a public, private and an academic perspective," said Dr Sharples.

"Dr Robyn Anderson has significant experience as a historian and is highly valued for her contribution to the Tribunal. Both appointees possess a wealth of experience and skills of great importance to the Tribunal," he said.

Professor Tamati Reedy was the former Secretary of Māori Affairs, from 1983 to 1989 and was awarded the 1990 New Zealand Medal for public service. He was appointed to the University of Waikato in 1996 as Foundation Dean and Professor to establish the new School of Māori and Pacific Development, and was awarded the title Emeritus Professor by the University of Waikato in December 2009.

Dr Robyn Anderson was first appointed to the Tribunal in 2004. She was head of the History and Pacific Cultures department at Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand from 2000-2003. Previously, she has written Tribunal reports and reports for the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. She was also lead historian for the Hauraki Māori Trust Board during its claim.

"I offer my warm congratulations to each of the appointees on their respective appointment and reappointment to the Tribunal", said Dr Sharples.
