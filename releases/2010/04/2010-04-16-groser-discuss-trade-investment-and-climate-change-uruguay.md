Trade Minister Tim Groser will visit Uruguay next week to discuss business and investment links with Latin America, international trade barriers and climate change issues.

Mr Groser will meet several Ministers from the newly-inaugurated Uruguayan Government and will also attend a meeting of the 19-member Cairns Group of agriculture-exporting countries.

"New Zealand and Uruguay have a lot in common, as small, agriculturally-focused nations with a strong belief in a liberal trading system and democratic governance," Mr Groser says.

Uruguay is also a strong supporter of the Global Research Alliance on the Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.

"Over the past five years, New Zealand companies have started making significant investments in Uruguay - especially in food-related sectors - in an effort to partner Kiwi know-how with Uruguayan economic opportunities. Our aim is to promote long-term, mutually beneficial economic partnerships between our two countries."

The main item on the Cairns Group agenda will be a call for countries to reject agricultural protectionism and recommit to the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations.

"In 2010 agriculture still remains the most highly distorted and heavily protected area of international trade," Mr Groser says. 

"As we saw during last year's global economic crisis, the need for reform has never been more pronounced. 

"For over 20 years the Cairns Group has been recognised as a leading voice in the call for the removal of agricultural trade barriers," Mr Groser says.

"This meeting is an opportunity for us to deliver a strong message against protectionism and in support of the Doha Round."

The Cairns Group comprises Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay.  The last Ministerial meeting of the Group was held in Bali, Indonesia in June 2009.

Mr Groser will be in Uruguay from 20-24 April.
