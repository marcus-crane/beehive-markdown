Agriculture Minister David Carter has announced amendments to the pricing formula for milk Fonterra supplies to other New Zealand dairy processors.

The new price for this ‘regulated' milk will be the farm gate milk price plus 10 cents per kilogram of milksolids and will take effect from 1 June 2010.

Mr Carter says the new price puts an end to Fonterra's concerns about the underpricing of regulated milk.

"A 2008 review found that the current formula allowed independent processors to access milk at a lower price than Fonterra pays its own farmers.  This was never the intention of the regulations."

The farm gate price is the average price that Fonterra pays its farmers for milk and this excludes any distributions for shareholding. 

"The additional 10 cents per kilogram of milksolids addresses the fact that independent processors can access a uniform milk supply, rather than the seasonal supply provided by farmers," says Mr Carter.

"Given a uniform supply is considerably more valuable to processors than a seasonal one, it is fair that the regulations permit a margin to reflect this."

Mr Carter added that the current review of the future of the regulations and other pro-competition measures contained in the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act is progressing well.
