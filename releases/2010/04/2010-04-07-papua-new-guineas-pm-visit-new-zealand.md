Prime Minister John Key will welcome the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Sir Michael Somare, when he visits New Zealand from 19 to 23 April.

"Sir Michael's visit will underline New Zealand's close relationship with Papua New Guinea," says Mr Key.

"We have a large aid and development relationship, enjoy defence cooperation and share commercial and business linkages.  New Zealand has also helped with security and infrastructure in Bougainville following the peace process in the late 1990s.

"I look forward to discussing with Sir Michael his views on Papua New Guinea's economic development, particularly with the new Liquified Natural Gas Project.

"As the Pacific's longest-serving leader Sir Michael's knowledge and experience of the region is invaluable."

While in New Zealand Sir Michael will also meet with Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand, business leaders, academics and members of the Papua New Guinea community in New Zealand.
