The Government has today moved to ensure victims will continue to get access to prisoners' compensation.

The Prisoners' and Victims' Claims (Expiry and Application Dates) Amendment Bill was introduced today to extend provisions in the Prisoners' and Victims' Claims Act 2005 that are due to expire on June 30.

The Act allows prisoners to claim for compensation in extraordinary circumstances where something in the system has gone wrong and other remedies are not appropriate.

If compensation must be awarded, the Act allows victims of the prisoner to claim against it, before the prisoner can get access to it. 

"The amendment bill will ensure that on July 1 victims are not locked out of this process," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

"This is a temporary measure to make sure that victims' access to prisoners compensation does not lapse between the expiry of the Act and a new bill the Government intends to introduce later this year."

"That bill will mean that when any compensation is awarded, anything remaining after the victim has claimed against it will be redirected to the Victims' Services Appropriation. It will then be used to fund additional services and entitlements for victims of crime generally.

"This bill will be another step in putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system."

Outstanding claims still exist that resulted from the Behaviour Management Regime - a highly restrictive regime at Auckland Prison between 1998 and 2004 that was found to breach prisoners' human rights.  The bill ensures that those claims will continue to be covered by the existing Prisoners' and Victims' Claims regime.
