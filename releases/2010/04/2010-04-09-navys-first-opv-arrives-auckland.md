Defence Minister Wayne Mapp was on board the Navy's first Offshore Patrol Vessel, HMNZS Otago, when it completed its maiden voyage from Australia and tied up at the Devonport Naval Base today.

Welcoming Otago into service, Dr Mapp said delivery of the OPVs has been a critical priority in Defence for the Government.

"The OPVs are a significant new capability for our Navy," he said. They can perform the full range of maritime military capability from security missions and peacekeeping to border patrol and humanitarian and disaster relief, especially in the South Pacific.

"They will be invaluable in meeting our national security responsibilities."

Otago and its sister ship Wellington were built by BAE Systems in Williamstown, near Melbourne. They are part of the seven-ship Protector fleet, which includes the multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury, and four Inshore Patrol Vessels (IPVs) delivered last year.

The OPVs can go further offshore, stay at sea longer and carry out more challenging work than IPVs. They can carry a Navy Seasprite helicopter, and will take over some of the work now done by the Anzac frigates Te Kaha and Te Mana. This will free the frigates to concentrate on their primary tasks in the Naval Combat Force.   

"Our Navy aims to be the best small-nation navy in the world.  The OPVs will add a new dimension to its ability to carry out the full range of tasks in our region," the Minister said.

The second OPV, Wellington, is due to arrive in New Zealand late next month.
