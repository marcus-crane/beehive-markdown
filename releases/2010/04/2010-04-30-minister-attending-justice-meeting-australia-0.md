Justice Minister Simon Power will be attending the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Melbourne on May 7.

The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) comprises the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, its states and territories, and New Zealand's Minister of Justice. Norfolk Island has observer status.

SCAG provides a forum to discuss and progress matters of mutual interest, and seeks to achieve uniform or harmonised action in the areas of responsibility of its members.

Mr Power will be making a presentation at the meeting on New Zealand's legal aid and electoral reforms. 

"The Australian Attorneys General are interested in these reforms and to learn from our experiences."

Projects on the current SCAG agenda include responses to organised crime, addressing indigenous disadvantage in law and justice, cyber crime, and suppression orders.

"I'm looking forward to meeting again with my Australian counterparts to see how they are developing their national and state laws in response to these issues."

Mr Power will attend the meeting on his return from Tanzania, where he is attending the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders annual summit.
