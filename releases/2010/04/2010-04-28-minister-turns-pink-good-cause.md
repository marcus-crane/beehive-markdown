Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has thrown his support behind Pink Shirt Day to help raise awareness of the link between bullying and depression.

Dr Coleman says today is a reminder that bullying is a serious problem in New Zealand and there is a link between being bullied and experiencing mental health issues.

New Zealanders were encouraged to wear pink today to show their support for Pink Shirt Day which is also being backed by the Mental Health Foundation.

\`\`We see regular media coverage on the prevalence of bullying which is backed up by international research,'' says Dr Coleman, who donned a pink shirt in support.

\`\`It's not restricted to the school yard either. A recent study found workplace bullying was also common in some sectors in New Zealand and created huge stress for victims.''

Earlier this month the Mental Health Foundation sponsored a Bullying Forum which looked at what kind of bullying is taking place, the methods of bullying that occur and what is currently being done to address it.
