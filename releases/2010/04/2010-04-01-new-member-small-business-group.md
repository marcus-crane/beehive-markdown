Small Business Minister Maurice Williamson has announced the appointment of Wellington businesswoman Hanne Andersen to the Small Business Advisory Group.

Mr Williamson says Ms Andersen replaces a member of the Small Business Advisory Group who could not take up their appointment in December.

Hanne Andersen has owned and operated Hanne Andersen Jewellery in Wellington for more than 20 years. 

Ms Andersen will be a strong addition to the Small Business Advisory Group, Mr Williamson says. 

"Her practical experience and skills in retailing and design complement those of the rest of the group, and the group remains well-balanced in terms of gender, age, and geographic representation."

The role of the Small Business Advisory Group is to advise the government on issues affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to help government agencies communicate more effectively with SMEs.   

A new group made up of small business owners from throughout New Zealand was appointed in December.  Hanne Andersen's appointment returns the membership to 10 for a term of three years.
