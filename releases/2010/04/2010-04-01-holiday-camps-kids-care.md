Children in foster care from around the country will participate in free activity camps over the school holidays says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Seven children's health camps, across the country from Whangarei to Roxburgh, kick off after Easter as part of the Government's Breakaway Holiday programmes.

"The kids get a chance to relax, play and have fun in a safe environment, while foster parents or caregivers enjoy a well earned break,'' says Ms Bennett.

The free holiday camps based in Whangarei, Auckland, Rotorua, Gisborne, Otaki, Christchurch and Roxburgh are for children aged 5 to 12 years old.

"These camps are a real highlight for kids, many of whom have had a rough start to life and it's equally important their caregivers get some time out too," says Ms Bennett.

Last year the Government invested an extra $1.5 million into Children's Health Camps annually, in recognition of the work Te Puna Whaiora do.

The Te Puna Whaiora children's health camps are part of the Government's $3 million Holiday Activity Programmes, which include 30,000 places for at risk young people.
