This Government's decision to formalise its support for the [UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/declaration.html) will help to restore New Zealand's mana in addressing indigenous rights, according to Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples.

Speaking from the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York, where he announced the decision this morning (NZ time), Dr Sharples said the UN Declaration sets standards for all nations to aspire to.

"This is a non-binding declaration, which was drafted by indigenous peoples' representatives and negotiated with state parties over more than twenty years. It recognises the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination, to maintain their own languages and cultures, to protect their natural and cultural heritage and manage their own affairs," Dr Sharples said.

"The Declaration is entirely consistent with the Treaty of Waitangi, and our statement of support for the Declaration acknowledges the central role of the Treaty in New Zealand's past, present and future. However, New Zealand was one of only four countries to vote against the Declaration.

"This was a great disappointment to Maori, and called into the question the previous government's commitment to Crown-Maori relationships based on the Treaty of Waitangi. It also undermined New Zealand's credibility on human rights in the eyes of the world," he said.

"Today's announcement restores our mana and our moral authority to speak in international fora on issues of justice, rights and peace," said Dr Sharples.

"It reflects well on the relationship between the National and Maori Parties that this Government has been able to endorse this important declaration. This is a small but significant step towards building better relationships between Maori and the Crown. I hope the same spirit of goodwill can guide us to a resolution of the foreshore and seabed issue, which has also raised concerns at the United Nations.

"I want to pay tribute to the 40-plus Maori delegates, among the many other indigenous people, who have travelled the world since 1988 to help draft the Declaration we are supporting today. This is their day to celebrate," he said.

**Announcement of New Zealand's Support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**

- 1\. In September 2007, at the United Nations, 143 countries voted in favour of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. New Zealand was one of four countries that voted against the Declaration.
- 2\. Today, New Zealand changes its position: we are pleased to express our support for the Declaration.
- 3\. In keeping with our strong commitment to human rights, and indigenous rights in particular, New Zealand now adds its support to the Declaration both as an affirmation of fundamental rights and in its expression of new and widely supported aspirations.
- 4\. Māori hold a distinct and special status as the indigenous people, or tangata whenua, of New Zealand. Indigenous rights and indigenous culture are of profound importance to New Zealand and fundamental to our identity as a nation. A unique feature of our constitutional arrangements is the Treaty of Waitangi, signed by representatives of the Crown and Māori in 1840. It is a founding document of New Zealand and marks the beginning of our rich cultural heritage. The Treaty establishes a foundation of partnership, mutual respect, co-operation and good faith between Māori and the Crown. It holds great importance in our laws, our constitutional arrangements and the work of successive governments.
- 5\. The Declaration contains principles that are consistent with the duties and principles inherent in the Treaty, such as operating in the spirit of partnership and mutual respect. We affirm this objective, and affirm the Government's commitment to build and maintain constructive relationships with Māori to achieve better results for Māori, which will benefit New Zealand as a whole.
- 6\. The Declaration is an historic achievement: the result of many years of discussions - 22 years in fact - and of hard work and perseverance by many people. I acknowledge the long involvement of Māori in the elaboration of the Declaration and the extent of their investment in its development.
- 7\. The Declaration acknowledges the distinctive and important status of indigenous peoples, their common historical experiences and the universal spirit that underpins its text. The Declaration is an affirmation of accepted international human rights and also expresses new, and non-binding, aspirations.
- 8\. In moving to support the Declaration, New Zealand both affirms those rights and reaffirms the legal and constitutional frameworks that underpin New Zealand's legal system. Those existing frameworks, while they will continue to evolve in accordance with New Zealand's domestic circumstances, define the bounds of New Zealand's engagement with the aspirational elements of the Declaration.
- 9\. In particular, where the Declaration sets out aspirations for rights to and restitution of traditionally held land and resources, New Zealand has, through its well-established processes for resolving Treaty claims, developed its own distinct approach.
- 10\. That approach respects the important relationship Māori, as tangata whenua, have with their lands and resources both currently and historically, and the complementary principles of rangatiratanga and kaitiakitanga that underpin that relationship. It also maintains, and will continue to maintain, the existing legal regimes for the ownership and management of land and natural resources.
- 11\. New Zealand acknowledges and understands the historic injustices suffered by Māori in relation to their land and resources and is committed to addressing these through the established Treaty settlement process. Many Māori groups have already benefited from the transfer of considerable land, forest and fisheries assets through negotiated Treaty settlements; many more are in the process of negotiations with the Government towards settling their claims. These settlements contribute to the re-establishment of an economic base as a platform for future development. Redress offered in Treaty settlements is, however, constrained by the need to be fair to everyone and by what the country as a whole can afford to pay.
- 12\. Further, where the Declaration sets out principles for indigenous involvement in decision-making, New Zealand has developed, and will continue to rely upon, its own distinct processes and institutions that afford opportunities to Māori for such involvement. These range from broad guarantees of participation and consultation to particular instances in which a requirement of consent is appropriate.
- 13\. In those processes and institutions, we acknowledge that our ongoing national dialogue is grounded in the Treaty of Waitangi. We further recognise that Māori have an interest in all policy and legislative matters and acknowledge the determination of Māori that custom, worldviews and cultural heritage should be reflected in the laws and policies of New Zealand. Māori have been, and continue to be, active in developing innovative responses to issues with a strong indigenous perspective and in engaging with successive governments on possible paths forward.
- 14\. We will continue that conversation within the relationship that the Treaty and New Zealand's constitution as a whole affords. Further, we will continue to work in international fora to promote the human rights of indigenous peoples. New Zealand acknowledges the ongoing process of dialogue and debate over the meanings that may be given to the aspirations put forward by the Declaration.
- 15\. New Zealand's support for the Declaration represents an opportunity to acknowledge and restate the special cultural and historical position of Māori as the original inhabitants - the tangata whenua - of New Zealand. It reflects our continuing endeavours to work together to find solutions and underlines the importance of the relationship between Māori and the Crown under the Treaty of Waitangi. Its affirmation of longstanding rights supports and safeguards that ongoing relationship and its proclamation of new aspirations gives us all encouragement and inspiration for the future.
- 16\. No reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.
