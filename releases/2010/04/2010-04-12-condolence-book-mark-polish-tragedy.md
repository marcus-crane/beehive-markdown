A condolence book has been set up in the main foyer of Parliament House in Wellington today to mark the deaths of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife Mrs Maria Kaczynska and senior Polish personalities. 

"It will be available for signing by all people in the Parliamentary precincts and the general public between 7am and 11pm Monday to Friday, and 9am and 5pm Saturday and Sunday," Acting Prime Minister Bill English says.

The New Zealand Government has expressed its deepest condolences to Poland and its people after President Kaczynski and many others died when their plane crashed on Saturday in western Russia.
