Justice Minister Simon Power today announced that the Minister and Associate Minister of Social Development will be joining him in leading the Government's response to the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence.

Mr Power made the announcement while speaking at the Working with Sexual Abuse Symposium in Auckland.

Social Development Minister Paula Bennett will focus primarily on the operational and service delivery aspects of the Government's sexual violence work.

Associate minister Tariana Turia is keen to focus on linking sexual violence with work she is already doing in the areas of family violence and Whānau Ora.

"Sexual violence and family violence are often closely linked and it's important that the Government takes a strategic oversight of both areas," Mrs Turia said.

Minister Bennett will also be responsible for conducting a stock-take of Government spending on sexual violence to establish current and long term demands for services.

"The aim of the stock-take is to identify opportunities for efficiency and effectiveness and consider future funding options to ensure the sector has greater certainty around funding," Ms Bennett said.

Mr Power also announced the reprioritisation of $1 million of Ministry of Justice funding over the next two years for sexual violence prevention education programmes.

"I'm pleased this funding has been found for these services despite tough economic times and I am confident they will make a real difference to victims of sexual violence," Mr Power said.

The three ministers also announced ongoing funding for the survivor advocate role.

"This role has proved valuable for so many survivors and their families and I'm pleased funding will continue for a further three years," Ms Bennett said

Meanwhile, the Government's response to the Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence is underway across at least 10 different agencies.

The Government with continue to work with Te Ohaaki o Hine - National Network Ending Sexual Violence Together (TOAH NNEST) as it develops its response to the Taskforce's report.

"The Government's response to the report will take more time as it is a piece of work we must get right to ensure our solution is sustainable and enduring," Mr Power said.
