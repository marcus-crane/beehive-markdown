Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant of $2,255,983 from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund to help fund the new Kauri Coast Community Pool.

"This new pool complex is a fantastic asset for the community. It has the only 50 metre pool in Northland along with hydrotherapy, learners and toddlers pools and a family area. 

"It provides a national training facility for residents and visitors, and will have health, social and economic benefits for the whole region. I hope it encourages more people to get physically active and involved in sport and recreation.

"This funding will help cover the construction costs of the project, and is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and New Zealand.

Applications that were high priorities for funding showed their project was well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation had the capability to complete the project.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
