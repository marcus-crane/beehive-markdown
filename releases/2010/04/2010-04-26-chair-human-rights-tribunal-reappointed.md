Justice Minister Simon Power today announced the reappointment of Royden Hindle as chairperson of the Human Rights Review Tribunal.

Mr Hindle has been reappointed for a further term of 12 months from 26 May 2010. 

The Human Rights Review Tribunal is established under section 93 of the Human Rights Act 1993.  It comprises of a chairperson and a panel of up to 20 members, two of whom are appointed by the chairperson for each hearing. 

The tribunal hears and determines proceedings lodged regarding the Human Rights Act, the Privacy Act 1993, and the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994, after complaints have first been dealt with by the Human Rights Commission, the Privacy Commissioner, and the Health and Disability Commissioner. 

"I would like to acknowledge Mr Hindle's leadership and contribution to the Human Rights Review Tribunal over the past eight years.  I'm pleased Mr Hindle has made himself available to lead the tribunal for a further 12 months, and I'm confident he will help prepare the tribunal for the challenges ahead," Mr Power said.    

Mr Hindle has legal qualifications from the Universities of Canterbury and Cambridge and 20 years litigation experience, principally in civil litigation.  He is an accredited LEADR mediator, and is a Fellow of the Arbitrators and Mediators' Institute.  He was the recipient of the Sir Ronald Davidson Arbitration Award in 2001, and was counsel assisting the Cervical Screening Inquiry.
