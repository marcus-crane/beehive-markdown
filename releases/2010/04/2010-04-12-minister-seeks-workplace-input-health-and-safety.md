Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson will visit workplaces around the country from tomorrow on a four-day tour to discuss the effectiveness of health and safety initiatives.

The tour will take in site visits from Whangarei down to Mosgiel involving a range of different industries through construction to food processing.

"Employers and managers on the ground are responsible for the safety of all workers and they are in the best position to judge what measures are and aren't effective," Ms Wilkinson says.

"Different industries and workplaces develop different initiatives to address risks onsite and I'm keen to talk to those with experience in this area.

"I also intend to get feedback on what direction the Government could head in following the review of the Health and Safety Strategy, which identified the need for greater co-ordination with industry bodies and management at ground level.

"Too many New Zealanders get seriously injured or killed in accidents at work and it's important that the Government and employers continue to work together to safeguard workers."
