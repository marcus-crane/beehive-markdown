Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Tariana Turia has today announced the members of the Kia Tutahi *Standing Together* Steering Group.  The steering group will oversee the development of a relationship agreement between the community, voluntary sector and the Government.

"The appointees are representatives from the community and voluntary sector and government agencies and will be tasked with developing a Relationship Agreement, which will underpin government engagement with the sector," says Mrs Turia.

"The Government places high value on the role that the community and voluntary sector plays in New Zealand.

"I am delighted with the calibre of all the appointees.  They bring a wide ranging set of experience, skills and knowledge to the table and I am confident they will deliver a relationship agreement that benefits all."

The co-chairs are Hori Awa, Chief Executive of Waahi Whaanui Trust and Don Gray Deputy Chief Executive, Ministry of Social Development.

The members from the community and voluntary sector are: Alison Broad, Lani Evans, Tania Kingi, Owen Lloyd, Dr. Kevin Moran, Pancha Narayanan, and Fa'amatuainu Wayne Poutoa.

The government agencies represented are Department of Internal Affairs, Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC), Te Puni Kōkiri, Office of Ethnic Affairs, Ministry of Women's Affairs, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.  Consultation will begin in July with a final agreement presented to the Minister for consideration in late September.
