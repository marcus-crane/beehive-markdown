Internal Affairs Minister Nathan Guy has announced a grant from the Lottery Significant Projects Fund of $594,852 to the Ngāi Tahu Māori Rock Art Charitable Trust to support the creation of a Māori Rock Art Centre in Timaru.

"The Māori Rock Art Centre will provide visitors with a virtual rock art experience, taking them on an interactive journey through time along the same paths as the people that created the rock art.

"The Lottery funding will help the Trust to raise awareness and appreciation of Māori rock art and support its long-term protection and care."

The grant will specifically fund the fabrication and installation of the Māori Rock Art Centre displays. The Centre is scheduled to be completed and open to the public in November.

"This is another example of how lottery funding helps build stronger communities throughout New Zealand," says Mr Guy.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund is targeted at large community-based capital expenditure projects with a total cost of at least $1 million that are of significant benefit to the wider community, region and/or nation.

Applications that were high priorities for funding showed their project was well designed, planned, managed, and sustainable and that the applicant organisation had the capability to complete the project.

In total, $178 million will be distributed amongst the community this year by the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. For more information on Lottery grants see [www.dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz%20/) or [www.cdgo.govt.nz.](http://www.cdgo.govt.nz./)
