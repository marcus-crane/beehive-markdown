Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully today expressed regret that Jock Hobbs has stood down as Chairman of Rugby New Zealand 2011 and the New Zealand Rugby Union due to ill health.

"Jock played a key role in securing the Rugby World Cup hosting rights for New Zealand, and he has been an outstanding chair of the tournament company, RNZ2011.

"On behalf of the Government, I extend our very best wishes to Jock and his family as he starts this difficult period of treatment.  It is our strong hope that Jock will be well enough to participate again in the Rugby World Cup 2011 programme."

Mr McCully said Deputy Chairman Brian Roche will act as Chair of RNZ2011 until the May Board meeting.

"The RNZ2011 company is making good progress, and the Government is confident that the Board and management team will remain on track to deliver an excellent Rugby World Cup tournament in 2011."
