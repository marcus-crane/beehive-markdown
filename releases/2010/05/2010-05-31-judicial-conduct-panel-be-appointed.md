Acting Attorney-General Judith Collins has accepted the recommendation of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner to appoint a Judicial Conduct Panel to inquire further into the complaints against Justice Wilson.

Ms Collins has Acting Attorney-General responsibilities as they specifically relate to complaints concerning Justice Wilson.

The Judicial Conduct Panel will comprise Justice Randerson, previously the Chief High Court Judge and now a Judge of the Court of Appeal; Justice Winkelmann, the Chief High Court Judge; and Ms Beverley Wakem, the Chief Ombudsman. 

Justices Randerson and Winkelmann are the most senior judges available who have not been direct judicial colleagues of Justice Wilson, Ms Collins said.

The Panel must include a person who is not a Judge or lawyer.  Ms Collins said the Chief Ombudsman was a suitably qualified person to fulfil this role.

The time and place of the Judicial Conduct Panel's hearings will be announced in due course by the Ministry of Justice. 

Information on the appointment of a panel is available at the Office of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner website:
