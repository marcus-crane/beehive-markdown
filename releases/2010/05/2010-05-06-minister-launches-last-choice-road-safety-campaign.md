Associate Transport Minister and Otaki MP Nathan Guy today launched a powerful road safety campaign for the Wellington region. 

Greater Wellington Regional Council are using the wrecked car of 26 year old Richard Chambers, who was unfortunately killed in a crash on the Paekakariki Hill road last year, as an educational tool in the campaign.

"The car has been given to the police by the family in the hope that its message will prevent further tragedies," says Mr Guy.

"This horrific wreck is a graphic example of what can happen when drivers make bad decisions, especially when speed and alcohol is involved.

"The power of this campaign is that it's visual. This car will provide a chilling message to young people, far more effective than any speech or lecture given by a politician.

"The government is working hard on bringing the road toll down and has already passed a new rule on cell phone use while driving, and new laws on drugged driving and illegal street racing.

"As part of the Safer Journeys plan Cabinet has approved raising the driving age to 16 and making the restricted test more difficult. Other initiatives in the pipeline include a zero drink drive limit for drivers under 20 and further consideration of the adult drink drive limit.

"All drivers need to take responsibility for their actions on the road."
