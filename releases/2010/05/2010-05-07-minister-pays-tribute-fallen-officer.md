Police Minister Judith Collins today paid tribute to Police Senior Constable Len Snee, "a good officer, a good friend and a good man" who was killed in the line of duty a year ago today.

Ms Collins joined Senior Constable Snee's family and Police colleagues to remember the fallen officer and unveil a memorial plaque at Napier Police Station.

"A year has now passed since we lost Len. Even after all this time, his death while serving the people of New Zealand remains difficult for us to grasp," Ms Collins said.

"No words can take away our sorrow or our sense of loss, but we can take this time to honour the legacy of a man deeply admired for his strength, courage and compassion, a man who led by example and did not shrink from his duty."

Senior Constable Snee, a Police officer since 1976, was killed and his fellow officers Grant Diver and Bruce Miller badly injured at a Napier address on 7 May 2009.

"Len reminded us that in an uncertain world, there are still those who are prepared to put themselves on the line, to stand up for what is right and make a difference," Ms Collins said.

"Our lives are the richer for the precious time we have these extraordinary people with us."

Ms Collins also paid tribute to every member of the New Zealand Police.

"Our Police put themselves in situations where others fear to go, and put the safety of the community, of people they have never met, before their own."
