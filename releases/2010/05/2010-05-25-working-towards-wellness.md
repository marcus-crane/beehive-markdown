Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says new evidence proving work is beneficial to health and wellbeing, underscores the need for welfare reform.

The Royal Australasian College of Physicians is launching its report *Realising the Health Benefits of Work*, in Auckland today.

The findings include:

- Working is good for health and being out of work is detrimental to health
- The longer someone is off work the less likely they are to return
- Good work can contribute to recovery from accident or illness

"It is time to address welfare dependence in this country and part of that means changing attitudes to work," says Ms Bennett.

"We must raise aspirations for New Zealanders, particularly those on benefits, or who're unwell or injured, but are capable of working," says Ms Bennett.

A Welfare Working Group is currently investigating the issue of long-term welfare dependence and the growing numbers on benefits in New Zealand.

In the ten years to March, the number of people receiving a Sickness Benefit grew by 23,663 (73%) and the Invalids Benefit ballooned by 31,681 (59%).

"While some will never be able to work and must be supported, others can be living a better life in work, which this research shows is mentally and physically beneficial, on top of the obvious financial benefits," says Ms Bennett. 

Future Focus reforms announced in March, introduce a part time work test for Sickness Beneficiaries from May next year.

The focus is on what people can do, not what they can't because research shows recovery is faster and more successful when people work towards wellness.

"A comprehensive tax package announced by the Government last week,  includes a reduced secondary tax rate, which means those on benefits who work part time will be better off each week", says Ms Bennett.
