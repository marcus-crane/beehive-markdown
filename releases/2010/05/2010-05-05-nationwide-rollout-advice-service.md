The nationwide rollout of an initiative to improve how Housing New Zealand responds to its customers has been completed today, Housing Minister Phil Heatley says.

The options and advice service has been rolled out in three phases over the last three months. It is now available in all 43 of Housing New Zealand's neighbourhood units.

"Housing New Zealand provides housing and housing-related services to those in the greatest need. The reality is Housing New Zealand is unable to house everyone who comes through its front doors," Mr Heatley says.

The options and advice service means customers will be provided with information about the private rental market, home ownership and government assistance available to help them sustain their current housing situation.

Mr Heatley says partnerships are key to the success of the options and advice service.

"Options and advice is about being smart, by joining people up with other government and non-government services or the private rental sector to provide them with a broader suite of options," he says.

"This approach means Housing New Zealand can help more people and the customer gets to make a choice about which housing option they want to pursue. In doing so, they can exercise some control over their own circumstances, making the whole experience of asking for help a positive one."

The latest neighbourhood units offering the service from 5 May 2010 are Dunedin, Wellington, Papanui, Napier, Te Kuiti, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Kaitata/Kaikohe, Mangere (Central and East and Service Centre), Takapuna and Greys Ave/Morningside and New Lynn.
