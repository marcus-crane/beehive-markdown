Environment Minister Nick Smith today announced the 27 finalists for the 2010 Green Ribbon Awards which honour outstanding contributions to protecting New Zealand's environment.

"This year marks the 20th Green Ribbon Awards. During this time more than 100 environmental champions have been awarded for their initiative, commitment and dedication to tackle environmental issues," Dr Smith said.

For the 2010 awards 143 nominations were received across 12 categories.  The categories reflect the broad range of environmental challenges that New Zealand faces and the extraordinary range of actions taken to address them. The nominations recognised individuals, businesses, communities and youth as well as larger organisations.

"The large number and diversity of the nominations is a testament to the hard work and the many different ways that New Zealanders are working to protect our environment," Dr Smith said.

The winners of each category and an overall supreme winner will be announced during an awards ceremony at Parliament on Thursday 3 June.
