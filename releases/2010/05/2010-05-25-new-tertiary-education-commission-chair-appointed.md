Sir Harawira (Wira) Gardiner has been appointed Chair of the Tertiary Education Commission for a term of three years, filling the vacancy created by the recent resignation of David Shand.

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce says he is delighted that a Chair of such high calibre will be joining the TEC Board. 

"A Chair of the TEC must have strong governance and leadership experience.  Sir Wira brings a range of perspectives and experience to the role.  I am sure he will provide excellent leadership and I look forward to working with him." 

"I also extend my thanks to Kaye Turner for her services as interim chair.  Ms Turner has been Deputy Chair of the TEC since it was established in 2003.

"Kaye has been a great caretaker and will no doubt enable a seamless transition to occur."

Sir Wira's tenure with the Commission will be for three years.
