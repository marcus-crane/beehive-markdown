Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today the appointments of Richard Griffin and Josh Easby to the board of Radio New Zealand.

Mr Griffin, a director of a Wellington public relations company, is a former Radio New Zealand political editor who has worked extensively across New Zealand's media landscape.

Mr Easby's 30-year career in print media and radio has seen him work in a range of journalism and senior management roles.

‘'Richard and Josh bring a wealth of relevant industry experience to the board. Both have worked as journalists and have carved out very successful careers in the media and related sectors,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'They both have a major contribution to make in helping Radio New Zealand develop a plan for sustaining its services into the future.

 ‘'I'd also like to thank outgoing board members Steve Murray and Sifa Taumoepeau, whose terms expired last month, for their work,'' Dr Coleman says.
