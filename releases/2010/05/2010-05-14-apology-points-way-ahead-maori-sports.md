Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples has welcomed apologies from the South African and New Zealand Rugby Unions, and has called for discussion on how to strengthen Maori sports.

"I congratulate the South African Rugby Union for a fine statement, that recognises all the people, Maori, black and white, who were prejudiced by apartheid sport," said Dr Sharples.

"I think the very comprehensive apology from the NZRU shows a genuine understanding of the situation, and recognises the failure of past rugby administrators to play a leadership role on a divisive issue," he said.

"For Maori, the reluctance of the Maori Rugby Board to apologise underlines how they have lost touch with Maori community opinion, and failed to represent Maori rugby supporters.

"Perhaps the time has come for Maori, and the nation, to reconsider an idea promoted by the late Albie Pryor, Dr Henare Broughton and others, to set up a national Maori sporting administration, to be a voice for Maori in sport, and to work alongside and in conjunction with the Maori arms of national sports organisations to advance Maori sport," said Dr Sharples.

"The reality is that sport is vital to Maori development. Sport involves young people in healthy activity, it provides training and opportunities to excel, it creates leadership roles, and in an era of professional sport, it offers careers and livelihoods in a global village.

"Sir Apirana Ngata used inter-tribal sporting competitions to foster hapu and iwi identity and whanaungatanga, and sport has been an integral part of the resurgence of Maori culture in recent times. That is why Te Puni Kokiri has funded a number of sporting programmes over the years.

"Maori sport is about whanau, and whanau is inclusive. This is not a separatist move, but would build on kaupapa Maori to unleash the full potential of Maori sport - the huge contribution of Maori to sport, and of sport to promote Maori goals. This would be a win-win for the country," said Dr Sharples.

"While this is not a Government responsibility, as Minister of Maori Affairs I would be interested to hear what people think of this idea," he said.
