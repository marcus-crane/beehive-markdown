Latest benefit figures out today show Unemployment Benefit numbers have dropped by almost 500 for the month of April.

"This is in stark contrast to the same time last year, when the number of people on the Unemployment Benefit actually increased by 4,200," says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

Maori account for three quarters of the fall in Unemployment Benefit figures.

Over the last month 4,654 people cancelled the Unemployment Benefit and went into work, 1,346 of those were Maori and 346 were Pacific Island people.

"Work and Income are having real success matching those on benefits with meaningful jobs and work opportunities keep coming in - there were 4,500 new jobs listed last month alone," says Ms Bennett.

The number of young people aged between 18 and 24 on a benefit has fallen by 379 in the last month; a trend that has continued since January.

Overall benefit figures rose by less than one percent (0.8%) to 327,462.

"The number of those on benefits is still below forecast, but we remain focussed on reducing these numbers and getting more New Zealanders into work,' says Ms Bennett.

"This month has seen a more modest decrease in Unemployment Benefit figures than previous months, which was expected," says Ms Bennett.

The number of people on the Unemployment benefit is now 59,715.
