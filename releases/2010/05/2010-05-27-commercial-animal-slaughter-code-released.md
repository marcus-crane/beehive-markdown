Agriculture Minister David Carter has today issued a new code of welfare that sets down minimum standards for the commercial slaughter of animals.

Mr Carter says the Animal Welfare (Commercial Slaughter) Code of Welfare 2010 provides clear guidelines for humane slaughter practices and should leave operators in no doubt about the standards of welfare they should meet.

The code requires all animals commercially slaughtered in New Zealand to be stunned prior to slaughter.  The code also covers pre-slaughter handling procedures to minimise stress and the use of well-trained personnel.

"New Zealand has a well-deserved reputation for animal welfare and the new code reinforces this.  It aims to encourage all those involved with the commercial slaughter of animals to adopt the highest standards of welfare," says Mr Carter.

"Pre-slaughter stunning of animals is already widely done by commercial operators in New Zealand and the new code provides for a more consistent approach.

"The code also reflects the advances made in humane slaughter methods and technology over the last four decades," Mr Carter says.
