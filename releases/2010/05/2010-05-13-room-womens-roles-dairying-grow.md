There is room for New Zealand women's significant contribution to the dairying industry to extend to greater representation at board level, Women's Affairs Minister Pansy Wong said yesterday.

Speaking at the Dairy Women's Network Annual Conference in New Plymouth, Mrs Wong said New Zealand's biggest export earner would do well to look at how women in the industry could contribute more to its future.

"The dairy industry is New Zealand's largest industry, and women make up one-third of its workforce. I believe there is a real opportunity for women to become more involved at a managerial level," says Mrs Wong. 

At the conference Mrs Wong referred to a survey commissioned by the Network, which found sexism was the single biggest barrier for women working in the industry.

"These women feel under-valued and under-utilised outside of the farm.

"I welcome the Dairy Women's Network decision to make it a top priority to find ways to break down these barriers. Women are critical to the future of New Zealand's dairying industry.  They need to be acknowledged as active contributors at all levels."

One of the three priorities of the Ministry of Women's Affairs is to get women into New Zealand's boardrooms in order to realise the benefits of diversity.
