The Government is investing $26.7 million in young people in 2010/11 by expanding the successful Job Ops programme.

The funding means the number of placements for 16-24 year olds with low or no qualifications will double from 6000 to 12,000.

"Job Ops has already kept more than 4000 young people in work, learning new skills while remaining connected to the labour market. We're determined to continue this success", Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says.

The programme was initiated by the National Government to help young New Zealanders stay in work through the recession by providing employers with a $5000 subsidy to employ young people.

"Young people are among the hardest hit in a recession because they often lack skills and experience and this scheme offers them a way through," Ms Bennett says.

The focus on helping people affected by the recession continues, with extra funding of $12.6 million in 2011/12 for Employment Assistance.

This money goes into programmes like Straight to Work, encourages employers to take on beneficiaries through skills investment subsidies and mitigates long-term unemployment through schemes like Taskforce Green.

The funding helps create extra jobs and training places for beneficiaries who need extra assistance to get jobs.

"The Government is committed to supporting New Zealanders into work and training while the economy emerges from a recession," Ms Bennett says.
