Police Minister Judith Collins today praised the success of Crimestoppers - the 0800 telephone line and website where New Zealanders can provide anonymous information about crime.

"Crimestoppers has been an outstanding success so far. In just 7 months, Crimestoppers has received almost 3,800 calls - 1566 calls have provided quality information that has been passed to Police.

"New Zealanders have shown that they value Crimestoppers as a safe and anonymous way to speak out and speak the truth about crime in their communities.

"Police, and other law enforcement agencies, are only as effective as the information they receive. I encourage people to continue to speak out against crime, without fear or intimidation," Ms Collins said.

Anonymous information about crime can be provided via the Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 telephone line or the online message form at [www.crimestoppers-nz.org](http://www.crimestoppers-nz.org/).
