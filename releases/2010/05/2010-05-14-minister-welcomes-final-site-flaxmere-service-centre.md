Corrections Minister Judith Collins today welcomed the announcement that a new site for the Community Probation Services (CPS) Centre in Flaxmere had been found.

Ms Collins says that the commitment of the Hastings District Council and the Department, along with the input of local residents, had been crucial to the success of finding the new site in Wilkes Place, Western Flaxmere.

"I would like to acknowledge the great deal of collaboration throughout this long process, including the good work of MP for Tukituki, Craig Foss who played a key role behind the scenes.

"I am pleased that the new service centre will be part of the community of Flaxmere - helping the Department to more effectively manage offenders and keep the community safer."
