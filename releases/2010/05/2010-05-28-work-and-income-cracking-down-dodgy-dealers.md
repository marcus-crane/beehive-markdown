Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has issued a strong warning to secondhand dealers - try to rip off the system and you will be caught.

"An undercover investigation has confirmed suspicions that some secondhand appliance dealers are operating unethically," said Ms Bennett.

The sting was prompted by anecdotal evidence of traders offering cash or other goods in exchange for Work and Income vouchers for essential whiteware.

"I'm disgusted some businesses are exploiting the system," says Ms Bennett.   

Nine traders were visited and five of them offered to take the vouchers and let the ‘mystery shopper' choose other items instead of those specified.

The vouchers are given to beneficiaries for essential whiteware such as a fridge or washing machine, the money is later paid back.

"It's unacceptable for traders to allow or encourage people to use that money for TVs, stereos or DVD players when that is not the purpose for those advances," says Ms Bennett.

"Such practices are dishonest and unethical," says Ms Bennett.

The names and details of the five dodgy traders identified in Work and Income's undercover sting have been passed on to Police for investigation.

"Regardless of any criminal prosecution, this sort of dodgy trading practice will not be tolerated," says Ms Bennett.

Unethical traders will be blacklisted, they will not be approved for any further payment through Work and Income and Police will be informed.

"This Government takes its responsibility to protect the benefit system very seriously," Ms Bennett said.

**Background:**

Work and Income is strengthening its operational policy to:

- require all second hand traders it deals with to be licensed by the Licensing Authority of Secondhand Dealers and Pawnbrokers
- ensure that grants will no longer be made for whiteware unless they come with a minimum warranty period of 3 months
- cease dealing with traders who undertake questionable practices
- carry out random checks on traders to ensure that our policies are being adhered to.
