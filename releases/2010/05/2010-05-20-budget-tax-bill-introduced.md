The taxation bill tabled in Parliament this afternoon introduces a package of measures announced in Budget 2010 that affects every single New Zealander and every single business in the country, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says.

"For that reason there will be a great deal of interest in the progress of the bill and in the detail of the measures it contains.  Information about how the proposed measures in the bill would work is being provided by Inland Revenue's Policy Advice Division in a special report on its website today.

"As well as the measures on personal, business and savings tax rates, the rise in GST and changes around the taxation of investment property, Budget 2010 also announced proposed changes to tighten the rules around loss attributing qualifying companies and qualifying companies as a forerunner to legislation planned for later this year.

"The release this afternoon of an officials' issues paper which seeks comment on the implementation of changes to the rules for shareholders in LAQCs and QCs is timely and will allow those likely to be affected by the changes an opportunity to provide feedback," Mr Dunne says. 

The changes will make LAQCs and QCs flow-through entities for tax purposes, similar to limited partnerships, and are intended to provide greater integrity in the tax system by removing opportunities to gain advantages through tax planning.  Submissions close on 5 July 2010.
