The Minister of State Services, Mr Tony Ryall, today announced that Learning State, the Industry Training Organization currently part of the State Services Commission, will become a separate entity on 1 July 2010.

Learning State will become Learning State Limited - a not-for-profit crown-owned company listed under Schedule 4 of the Public Finance Act.

"I am currently in the process of recruiting and appointing a Board to govern Learning State Limited, and will announce those appointments in due course," Tony Ryall said.

As part of the transition to a new entity, the position of Executive Director will be disestablished and a new Chief Executive position will be established in its place.  The State Services Commissioner will manage the recruitment process for this position, with the intention of announcing the new appointment by 1 July 2010.

In February 2010, Cabinet approved a new constitution for Learning State Limited.  The constitution sets out "the Company" as Learning State Limited, and its purpose - "to be an industry training organisation (ITO) for the public sector, as a body corporate recognised under 5(1) of the Industry Training Act 1992".
