Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed Telecom's release of the summary findings of an independent review of its XT network.

The review identified problems with the design, planning and operation of the XT network.

Mr Joyce says the government's primary focus is on Telecom's ability to provide a robust 111 emergency calling service to its XT customers.

"New Zealanders must have confidence in their telecommunications infrastructure for emergency calling.  All the mobile network operators need to take all reasonable steps to facilitate 111 calling from their networks.

"The roaming agreement they have recently developed will significantly improve the availability of 111 calling to mobile phone users when it is implemented.  It is also good to see that the telecommunications industry is signing up to the industry code of practice setting minimum standards for 111 calls.

"I will be reviewing closely the results of investigations into recent network outages to assess whether any further action is required to protect the integrity of the emergency calling system.

"Beyond that, it's obvious that there have been significant issues with the XT network.  Telecom's customers will be pleased to see the company moving quickly to improve the network's reliability," says Mr Joyce.
