The number of Police in New Zealand has grown by 350 in the past 18 months as the Government honours its promise to deploy 600 additional Police officers into frontline roles throughout the country.

Last year, the Government provided $162.5 million of operating funding over four years for Police recruitment, training, personnel costs and deployment.

The funding provided extra Police support for prosecutions, while another $20 million of capital funding was provided for accommodation and vehicles for the additional police. 

The Government promised 300 more Police on the streets of Counties-Manukau by the end of 2010 and 300 more for the rest of New Zealand by the end of 2011.

"Since November 2008, New Zealand Police numbers have grown by 350 and are on track to achieve the 600 additional officers by the end of 2011," Police Minister Judith Collins says.

"This Government is delivering on its promise of ensuring our Police are well resourced, well trained and well supported.

"Our top priority has been to increase the number of officers on the beat in our neighbourhoods, working with communities to prevent crime and more intensive policing of crime hot spots."

Last year, the Government also committed $10 million for the national roll-out of Tasers now underway. About 720 Tasers will be available to frontline Police on a case-by-case basis. About 3500 officers will be trained to use them. 

"Our commitment to more officers and tools such as Tasers will give New Zealanders greater confidence in the Police's capacity to prevent, respond to and investigate crime," Ms Collins says.
