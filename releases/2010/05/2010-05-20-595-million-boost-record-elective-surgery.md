Budget 2010 delivers an extra $59.5 million for elective surgery over the next four years, including $8 million for breast reconstruction surgery.

"We are building on our pre-election promise to deliver more elective operations for New Zealanders," Health Minister Tony Ryall says.

"Our goal was to deliver an average of 4000 extra elective operations a year in our first three years in office. We surpassed the three year goal in our first year, with over 12,000 more elective operations in 2009 than in 2008.

"And we are not easing up. Another $59.5 million over four years means more people will get surgery, and they will get it sooner than they have in the past.

"On top of this, the Government has increased funding for electives in the current year (2009/10) by $10.2 million. Of this, $4.2 million is specifically for additional cardiac surgery.

"This is an example of the Government's focus on improving priority frontline public services and demonstrates our strong commitment to healthcare, where we are spending an extra $2.1 billion over the next four years."
