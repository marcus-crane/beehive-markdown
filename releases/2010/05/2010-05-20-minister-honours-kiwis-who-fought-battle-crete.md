Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins today paid tribute to the Kiwi troops who fought at the battle of Crete, which began 69 years ago today.

On 20 May 1941, thousands of German paratroopers and glider troops invaded Crete in one of the first-ever airborne assaults. More than 7,700 New Zealand troops were part of the Allied force defending Crete.

After a fierce battle lasting 12 days the superior air power of the German forces overpowered the Allied defences.

Hundreds of New Zealanders lost their lives and more than 2,000 became prisoners of war. Some escaped from captivity and evaded re-capture by hiding in the hills.

Ms Collins says their survival was made possible due to the assistance and bravery of the local Cretans.

"The local people of Crete took huge risks to provide food and aid to Kiwi troops. The actions of those brave people, and those of the soldiers defending Crete, are still remembered and appreciated by both New Zealanders and the citizens of Crete alike."
