Climate Change Minister Nick Smith today launched two new publications providing practical guidance for local government on planning for the impacts of climate change on flooding: *Tools for estimating the effects of climate change on flood flow* and *Preparing for Future Flooding*. 

"The recent events in Southland are a timely reminder of the damage caused by flooding and it is expected that climate change will only increase the likelihood of these extreme events", said Dr Smith.

"The two publications provide good practice information and guidance to help local authorities incorporate climate change impacts into flood risk management planning."

The guidelines are the third in the series for local government on preparing for the impacts of climate change in their environmental decision making.

"This Government is committed to assisting councils with environmental management and giving them the practical tools and guidance to help them with their responsibilities," said Dr Smith.
