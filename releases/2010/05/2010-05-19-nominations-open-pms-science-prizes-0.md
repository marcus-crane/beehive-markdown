Nominations are now open for the 2010 Prime Minister's Science Prizes, worth a total of $1 million.

"These prizes are an important initiative in the Government's commitment to scientific achievement," Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp said.

"These prizes lift the profile of science and put the spotlight on the contribution our outstanding scientists and science teachers are making to New Zealand.

"Science and innovation flow into every aspect of daily life, from doctors' visits to electronic gadgetry, new discoveries and inventions," he said.

There are five prizes to be won. The top award, the Prime Minister's Science Prize, is of $500,000 and recognises a transformational science discovery or achievement which has had a significant impact on New Zealand or internationally.

The other prizes are:

- The Prime Minister's MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize: $200,000
- The Prime Minister's Science Teacher Prize: $150,000
- The Prime Minister's Future Scientist Prize: $50,000
- The Prime Minister's Science Media Communication Prize: $100,000

Nominations for the Prime Minister's Science Prize, the Science Teacher Prize and the Science Media Communication Prize close on 27 August.

The 2010 Future Scientist Prize will be awarded to the Supreme Award recipient from the Royal Society of New Zealand's Realise the Dream competition. A three-stage judging process for the Prime Minister's MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize is currently under way.
