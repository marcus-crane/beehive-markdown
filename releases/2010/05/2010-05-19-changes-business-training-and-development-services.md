Changes to government subsidised training and development services will give small businesses greater choices while providing more efficient use of government funding, Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee announced today. 

The main changes to the services provided through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) are:

- providing eligible businesses with a training and development subsidy directly through a voucher system, rather than funding third-party training providers

<!--THE END-->

- moving from full to partial subsidies for training and development services

This will mean 29 regional ‘biz Information' walk-in centres will be closed over the next six months because of the low numbers of people using them, although the services they provide will continue in other forms.

"Businesses can apply for up-skilling vouchers, which they can spend with service providers that best meet their needs," Mr Brownlee said.

The ‘biz Information' free-phone service - 0800 42 49 46 - and the business information web portal - [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz/) - will continue.

Providers of services to businesses will be part of a network being established between NZTE and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.  From the latter half of 2010 the network will provide businesses easier, coordinated access to business training and research and development funding and support.

Mr Brownlee said feedback from small to medium-sized businesses and business organisations showed businesses had difficulty finding out where to go for help up-skilling, and in determining the relevance and quality of available assistance.

"The changes will give businesses greater flexibility in their training and development choices, and will allow more providers of capability services to compete to deliver them," Mr Brownlee said.

The changes mean the Enterprise Training Programme, run by a range of organisations contracted by NZTE, will cease from 1 July 2010.
