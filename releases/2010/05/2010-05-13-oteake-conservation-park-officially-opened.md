Minister of Conservation Kate Wilkinson today officially opened the Oteake Conservation Park at a ceremony in St Bathans.

"The Department of Conservation (DOC) has been working hard to improve the conservation values and recreational opportunities in Central Otago and Maniototo areas and I'm thrilled to introduce the 65,000 hectare Oteake Conservation Park to New Zealanders for their enjoyment.

"It joins New Zealand's network of high country parks that offer amazing new recreational opportunities to the public, while protecting their special natural and historic heritage.

"Oteake lists an impressive range of recreational activities such as four-wheel-drive touring, mountain-biking, horse-trekking, tramping, cross-country skiing, fishing and hunting. Tourists will be coming here in droves to enjoy it and New Zealanders should too."

Oteake encompasses large sections of the St Bathans, Hawkdun, Ida, Ewe and St Mary ranges and is the fourth conservation park to be created in Otago.

The acquisition of a 2856 hectare block of freehold land, known as Timber Creek, in the Danseys Pass was further good news, Ms Wilkinson says.

In time, Timber Creek will be a logical addition to the Oteake Conservation Park and will provide for public access from the Danseys Pass Road, one of the main legal and formed roads adjoining the park.

The Minister also officially recognised the completion of the The Blue Lake Track, which takes visitors around the lake and into St Bathans historic gold-mining site, and the St Bathans Hall restoration. The 130-year-old mud brick hall has been substantially renovated and is now available for the community to use.

"St Bathans boasts a remarkable heritage and it is fantastic to see the community getting involved in conservation projects here. The official openings of Oteake, the restored Hall and the new Blue Lake Track are the culmination of a lot of hard work and I want to thank everyone involved."
