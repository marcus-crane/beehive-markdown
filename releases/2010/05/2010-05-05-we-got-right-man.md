Welfare Working Group member Professor Peter Saunders was chosen as an expert in his field to participate in the Group's examination of the welfare system says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

However, he is not the only Peter Saunders in existence.

Question time in the House today saw the matter arise, with a question mark over whether the right Peter Saunders was appointed to the Group.

"I can assure you, we got the right man," says Ms Bennett.

To set the record straight about any confusion there may be over which Peter Saunders has been appointed, it may help to clarify the following.

There are two men called Professor Peter Saunders.

Both studied in England, both were based in Sydney Australia at the same time and both have continued to lecture on social policy and welfare and both have written a number of books on the subject.

"This clearly creates potential for mistaken identity," says Ms Bennett.
