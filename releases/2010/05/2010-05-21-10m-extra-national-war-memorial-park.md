Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Christopher Finlayson today confirmed the government's commitment to the National War Memorial precinct at Buckle St in Wellington.

Budget 2010 commits $10 million in extra capital expenditure for development of the park in the 2013/14 year.

"The development of a memorial park is an essential next stage of the National War Memorial precinct, following the establishment of the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in 2004," Mr Finlayson said.

"We want the memorial park project done well, and we want it to be the centerpiece of New Zealand's commemorations of the centenary of the First World War beginning in August 2014."

"The park will be a destination for all New Zealanders and international visitors wanting to pay their respects, as well as a real asset for Wellington city."

"Clean-up work and interim landscaping of the site to allow public access will get underway very shortly," Mr Finlayson said.

Wellington mayor Kerry Prendergast welcomed progress on the National War Memorial precinct.

"The presence in the heart of the capital of a memorial park worthy of the people it commemorates will be a source of pride for the Wellington region, and a national treasure. These projects will enhance the city and contribute to all New Zealanders' sense of national identity," said Mayor Prendergast.

Wellington City Council is contributing $2 million to the overall cost of the project.

Mr Finlayson is working closely with Transport Minister Steven Joyce on the development. Roading options for Buckle Street, which runs through the site, are currently being considered by the New Zealand Transport Agency in conjunction with the planned transport improvements around the Basin Reserve to ensure integration with the National War Memorial precinct.
