The redeveloped courthouse at Whangarei is a fitting building for the hub of Northland's court cluster and one of which the Whangarei and wider Northland community can be proud, Courts Minister Hon Georgina te Heuheu QSO said at the official opening today.

"This is a courthouse designed to meet the current and future needs of the Northland County," Mrs te Heuheu said.  "It is a courthouse for the 21st century, modern and fit for the purpose."

"A new jury capable courtroom, combined with a new jury assembly area means those serving on juries can expect a more secure and supportive environment," she said.

"Secure witness and interview rooms, extra custodial facilities and judicial chambers, are also new features in the redevelopment."

The Whangarei combined District and High Court serves much of lower Northland.

Its redevelopment comprises a new 1173-square-metre addition to the existing courthouse and extensive alterations and refurbishment using environmentally sustainable design principles.

Latest technology for video conferencing and evidence recording has also been installed, which Mrs te Heuheu says will mean increases in court efficiency and better access to justice for all court users.
