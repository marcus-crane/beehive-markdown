The improved security environment in Timor-Leste means New Zealand can cut back the size of its military deployment there, Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said today.

The next rotation leaves tomorrow \[Wednesday 19 May] and with 75 personnel it is just over half the size of earlier rotations of around 140.

"We have increasing confidence in Timor-Leste's journey towards permanent stability," Dr Mapp said.

"The Australian-New Zealand International Stabilisation Force is one of the main international security operations in Timor-Leste. Australia reduced its commitment, by around 100 personnel, in January last year. We can now follow suit.

"While Timor-Leste still needs considerable international security assistance, the nature of its needs is changing. This means fewer New Zealand and Australian Defence personnel are required," he said.

The New Zealand Defence Force has been contributing a light infantry company to the ISF since May 2006. It has been New Zealand's largest overseas deployment for most of the intervening period.

"We have a very warm relationship with Timor-Leste, focused on providing security and development assistance, and that will continue. They still need our support, and they will have it," Dr Mapp said.
