Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today he is very pleased that Inland Revenue will be refunding donations tax credit claims in the coming week to all IR3 taxpayers who have made a tax credit claim.

Mr Dunne is pleased that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has worked on this issue so quickly to enable these refunds to be released and would ask people to contact Inland Revenue's Complaints Management Service if they encounter any problems.
