The Government is boosting funding for innovative programmes for serious youth offenders and those at risk of offending, after a flood of applications.

"Demand has far outstripped the initial funding round of $350,000 so I'm announcing another $550,000 has been found to help meet that demand," says Social Development Minister Paula Bennett.

The extra investment comes from Child Youth and Family baseline funding.

One hundred and fifteen applications were received for the funding.

"I'm really impressed with the response from communities and providers who are serious about working with troubled youth," says Ms Bennett.

"Providers have a range of innovative ideas to connect with young offenders, and address their behaviour to help turn their lives around," says Ms Bennett.

The Innovation Fund is part of the Fresh Start suite of programmes.

A key focus is to address the high numbers of young Maori within youth justice.

"Successful applicants include mentoring and early intervention and marae or camp based programmes specifically targeting young Maori as well as female offenders - these initiatives can make a real difference," says Ms Bennett.

A national selection panel chaired by Katherine Rich, met earlier this month to assess the applications and make recommendations.

A second round of funding for $1.40 million for 2010/2011 opens on June 7.
