"For the first time New Zealand has hit the national health target for immunisation. Latest statistics show that 85% of two year olds are fully immunised, and this is three months sooner than scheduled," Health Minister Tony Ryall says.

Increased immunisation is one of the Government's six health targets published quarterly. Quarter three's results published tomorrow show improvement at a national level in five of the Government's six target areas, with the remaining target stable.  

"The results show that the public health service can deliver better services for patients by focusing on the public's priorities," Mr Ryall says.

District Health Boards also made the following positive gains this quarter:

· Shorter stays in emergency departments improved nationally and in 13 DHBs  
· Access to elective surgery increased nationally and in 12 DHBs  
· Help for smokers to quit improved nationally and in 20 DHBs  
· Diabetes and cardiovascular disease services improved nationally and in 7 DHBs

Cancer waiting times remained stable. The six Regional Cancer Centres aim to provide radiation treatment for patients within six weeks of referral. By Christmas, this target will move to four weeks.

Last week Mr Ryall opened a new linear accelerator at Christchurch Hospital, and announced a new linear accelerator had been approved at Wellington Hospital.

"We are prioritising resources to improve cancer services. Much progress has been made in the past 18 months, since the time when some patients had to wait 12 weeks or more to start their treatment because of capacity problems."
