"The 2010 Budget has delivered for ethnic communities through a fairer, more incentivised tax system and a commitment to creating safer communities" says Minister for Ethnic Affairs Pansy Wong.

"The significant reform of the tax system will reward effort and work by allowing earners to keep more of their hard earned money which they can save, invest in their businesses, put towards their children's education or spend as they see fit.  In turn this will strengthen a culture of self reliance and success that has been long embraced by our ethnic communities," says Pansy Wong.

She says "New Zealand's ethnic communities are aspirational and the budget reflects that because it builds on the recovery of our economy, help families get ahead and deliver a brighter future."

Boosts to police numbers will also benefit our ethnic communities by making them safer.  "The funding for 600 extra police means we can more effectively deter crime, target criminal behaviour and ultimately make our communities safer places to live.  Our ethnic communities have become concerned in recent years at the rate of offending and the negative impacts this has."

"Business forums, inter-cultural awareness program and law and order workshops are some of the initiatives that the Office of Ethnic Affairs will continue to undertake to foster aspiration and alleviate concerns of crime in our ethnic communities", says Pansy Wong.
