The success and growth of New Zealand company Cognition Education is evidence that New Zealand's export future in the Middle East is diversifying, with the export of education services at the heart of the expansion.

Minister of Trade Tim Groser this week officially opened the new offices for Cognition Education in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the fastest growing export destinations for New Zealand firms.

"While New Zealand is still obviously extremely competitive in the fields of our traditional exports, the real story in this region is the tremendous growth in some of our non-traditional sectors such as services. There is no doubt that education is a stellar performer here," said Mr Groser.

Accompanied by members of a New Zealand business delegation, Minister Groser was welcomed by a cultural performance from the students of Umm Habiba Girl's Primary School - one of 24 schools in the Emirate in which Cognition Education are engaged.

With 170 staff in Abu Dhabi, predominantly New Zealanders, Cognition is one of nine international providers working as part of a Public-Private-Partnership in the Emirate focusing on education policy reform and implementation.

"What is so significant about the model Cognition operates is that all of the revenue from the provision of its education services is reinvested in the New Zealand system thorough the Cognition Education Trust. In essence, as the children of Abu Dhabi benefit, so do those in New Zealand," said Mr Groser.

"As we have learnt in other more established markets, the export of education is one of the most effective ways of building the links between cultures and people that underpin trade."

Minister Groser is in the UAE as part of a business mission which has also visited Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE.

"From what I have seen in the past few days, I am more convinced than ever that this region - a sophisticated hub for world trade and finance - offers tremendous opportunity for New Zealand businesses. We can not afford not to be engaged."
