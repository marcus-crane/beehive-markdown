Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson today announced the appointment of three new Members of the Employment Relations Authority and the reappointment of two others.

The new Members - each appointed to a three-year term - are Auckland lawyer Richael Larmer, Wellington employment relations adviser Michael Loftus and Auckland human resources manager Eleanor Robinson.

Two current Members, Kenneth Anderson and Vicki Campbell, have been reappointed for another four years.

Ms Wilkinson says the three new appointees bring a wealth of experience in employment issues to their new positions.

"Ms Larmer, Mr Loftus and Ms Robinson have the necessary attributes to be effective Members of the Employment Relations Authority.

"The Authority has a statutory function of investigating and determining employment relations problems, for which it has exclusive jurisdiction.

"That means Members need investigative skills and a high level of knowledge of employment law and practice in New Zealand. I don't doubt that these three new members are up to the task."

Mr Loftus' term begins on 1 June, while Ms Larmer and Ms Robinson will start on 1 July. Mr Anderson's new term begins on 7 July and Ms Campbell's on 7 December.

Ms Wilkinson also thanked current Members Paul Montgomery, Marija Urlich  and Leon Robinson whose positions on the Authority will end when their terms expire on 18 May, 30 June and 7 December respectively.
