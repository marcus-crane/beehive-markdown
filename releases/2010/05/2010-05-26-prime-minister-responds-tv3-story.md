Prime Minister John Key tonight responded to a TV3 story in relation to his blind trust.

"As is well known, after becoming Prime Minster I established a blind trust," says Mr Key.

"The trustees of that blind trust have full control of the management of all the assets not listed in my pecuniary interest register.

"I am not aware of any of the assets contained in the blind trust.  I have no rights to either acquire assets, dispose of assets, or to instruct those who manage them.  Nor am I able to be informed of what is in the trust.

"Quite appropriately, this continues to be the case.

"I set up the blind trust after becoming Prime Minister so I didn't have any conflicts of interest through my investments, and that is the case because I don't know what my investments are.

"To the best of my knowledge, the only people who can be certain what assets the blind trust owns are the trustees, and anything else is mere speculation."
