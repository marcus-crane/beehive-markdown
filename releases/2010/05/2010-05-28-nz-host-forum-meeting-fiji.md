New Zealand will host a Forum Ministerial Contact Group meeting on Fiji on Monday, Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced today.

"At last year's Forum Leaders' Meeting in Cairns, the Ministerial Contact Group was tasked with monitoring the situation in Fiji and reporting back to leaders," Mr McCully said.

The Group, established in March 2008, is chaired by Tongan Prime Minister Fred Sevele and comprises Foreign Ministers from Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Tuvalu, and Samoa.

"Following recent discussions with Prime Minister Sevele, members unanimously agreed to hold a meeting, and to invite the interim Fiji Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, to address it," Mr McCully said.

"Forum members remain concerned to encourage progress back to constitutional government in Fiji.  Monday's meeting is an important opportunity to assess developments since the Group last met in Fiji in December 2008," Mr McCully said.
