The Government has given the go-ahead for greater commercial use of the seaweed Undaria, commonly known as Japanese kelp.

The kelp was accidentally introduced to New Zealand waters in the 1980s and is widespread in many east coast ports and harbours.

"This is a commercial opportunity as Undaria is an edible seaweed which can also be used for pharmaceutical products, fertiliser and as fish food," says Biosecurity Minister David Carter.

"However, concerns about the threat Undaria poses to the marine environment are equally valid so safeguards are essential to protect our native species from any greater harvesting of the kelp."

The new rules will allow Undaria to be harvested from man-made surfaces, such as marinas, from beaches and farmed in selected heavily infested areas. Previously it could only be harvested as part of an official Undaria control programme or as a by-product of operations such as marine farming.

"As an environmental safeguard, the kelp can't be taken from natural surfaces unless it's part of a control programme," Mr Carter says. "Undaria will also remain an unwanted organism under the Biosecurity Act, allowing MAF to oversee its commercial use."

"This is an opportunity to make good use of this pest seaweed, but in a strictly controlled way. This will ensure our precious marine environment remains protected," Mr Carter says.
