A bill to reform electoral finance laws passed its first reading in Parliament today.

The Electoral (Finance Reform and Advance Voting) Amendment Bill progresses reforms only where there is broad consensus.

"If we are to have an electoral system which is fair, workable, enduring, and in place before the 2011 election, broad consensus is essential," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

The bill forms part of the Government's package of electoral reforms. The other parts include a bill to establish a new Electoral Commission, and a bill to provide for a referendum on the MMP voting system.

The Electoral (Finance Reform and Advance Voting) Amendment Bill will legislate for the [reform package](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/electoral+finance+reform+package+announced) announced in February and [several changes](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/electoral+finance+package+introduced+parliament) announced last week.

"I'm confident this bill will establish a regime that is fair and transparent to all groups and individuals participating in this vital element of New Zealand's democracy.

"Our aim is to have the bill enacted by December this year so the public and political parties can be familiar with the changes before the 2011 general election."

The bill has been referred to the Electoral Legislation Committee, which has been established to consider this bill and the Electoral Referendum Bill.

"I welcome the public's participation during the select committee process."
