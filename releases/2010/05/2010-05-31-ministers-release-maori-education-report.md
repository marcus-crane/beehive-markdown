Education Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Education Minister Dr Pita Sharples today released Ngā Haeata Mātauranga, the Annual Report on Māori Education for 2008/09.

"We are beginning to see some positive gains in Māori education, but much more hard work lies ahead," says Mrs Tolley.

"The need to step up and transform the performance of the education system for Māori is being recognised.

"Major Government initiatives such as National Standards and the Youth Guarantee will have a great effect on raising achievement, while the expansion of the Te Kotahitanga professional development programme for teachers is also making a significant contribution.

"Early childhood education also plays an important part, and new funding of $91.8 million announced in Budget 2010 for five intensive, community-led participation projects in high priority areas will directly benefit Māori families."

Dr Sharples says that the education system is doing better in certain areas for some Māori students, but that success needs to be more widespread.

"NCEA data continues to show strong patterns of achievement among Māori learners attending secondary schools where teaching and learning were done though Māori language and culture. Results show Māori-medium learners were more likely to meet literacy and numeracy requirements for NCEA Level 1 than their peers at English-medium schools.

"The number of kura kaupapa Māori, kura Māori, and kura teina has increased from 13 in 1992 to 88 in 2008.  And enrolments at bilingual schools grew by 38.9 per cent (or 2,909 students) between July 2007 and July 2008.

"Ngā Haeata Mātauranga 2008/09 highlights a broad range of activities underway to improve the performance of the system for and with Māori - in mainstream schools as well as Maori-medium settings - designed to raise achievement, increase participation, encourage te reo Māori in classrooms, and support culturally responsive practices by teachers and school leaders," says Dr Sharples. "Ka Hikitia - Managing for Success is the Government's plan of action for achieving these priorities.

"Other areas of progress for Māori learners include increased retention in school and increased participation in higher level tertiary education," he says.
