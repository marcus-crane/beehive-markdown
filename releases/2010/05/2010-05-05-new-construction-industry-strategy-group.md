Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson has welcomed the construction industry's move to establish a high-level strategy group to address industry-wide issues.

"I understand construction industry leaders have been planning to establish a body for some time and the announcement of the establishment of this group today follows considerable work on its structure and composition," Mr Williamson says.

The construction industry strategic group will initially comprise of 11 high-level New Zealand executives and will be chaired by Richard Aitken.

Mr Aitken is the chair of Beca Group Ltd, one of the largest employee-owned engineering consultancy groups in the Asia Pacific region.

Mr Williamson says the construction industry has been somewhat fragmented in its approach to the big issues facing the sector, such as lifting productivity and improving skills.

"This group presents an opportunity for the industry to present a thoughtful and united response to challenges facing the construction industry," he says.
