The Whare Oranga Ake initiative, which will help prisoners re-integrate into society using a kaupapa Maori approach, is a common-sense step towards reducing high levels of Maori reoffending, Corrections Minister Judith Collins said.

Speaking at a post-Budget breakfast organised by Te Awe - the Wellington Maori Business Network and Te Puni Kokiri, Ms Collins said the high level of Maori reoffending was one of the biggest issues facing New Zealand's law and order agencies.

"When I visit our prisons I am always saddened at the number of Maori men and women I see in there - particularly young men and women. It is an incredible, shameful waste of lives and potential," Ms Collins said.

"Many of them will have been in prison before. Within four years of being released 74 percent of Maori prisoners would have been convicted of an offence and 55 percent will be back in prison.

"If we can lower the rates of re-offending then there is potential to make a significant impact on the number of offenders in our prisons.

"The establishment of two Maori reintegration units through the Whare Oranga Ake initiative, introduced by Associate Minister of Corrections, Hon Dr Pita Sharples, is a common-sense approach that will help prisoners turn their lives around."

Whare Oranga Ake will help prisoners train for employment , find jobs, form supportive networks and cut ties with gangs.

"Dr Sharples is committed to doing something about this serious problem, and he has my full support with this initiative," Ms Collins said.

There will be two Whare Oranga Ake, one at Hawke's Bay Prison and the other in the Auckland area at Spring Hill Corrections Facility. 

On both sites, the whare will be located on prison land outside the main prison in the same manner as self-care units. The starting size for each whare will be 16 beds, eventually increasing to 32 beds.
