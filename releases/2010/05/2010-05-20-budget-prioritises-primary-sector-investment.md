Budget 2010 will fulfil the Government's goal of delivering smarter services for New Zealand's biosecurity and its primary sector.

"Funding has been reallocated to priority areas, confirming the Government's commitment to investing in pragmatic solutions for this important sector," Agriculture and Biosecurity Minister David Carter says.

Budget 2010 provides additional capital funding of $6.7 million and operational funding of $14.3 million over four years to develop a Joint Border Management System (JBMS).  This will replace ageing border clearance systems run by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and New Zealand Customs Service.

"The JBMS will improve efficiency and biosecurity protection at the border by modernising New Zealand's border management and providing a single point of entry for importers and exporters," Mr Carter says.

"The system will be a collection of shared services, hosted predominantly by Customs, to support the clearance of passengers and goods across New Zealand's border."

The Budget also confirms $45 million over four years for the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, which has so far united nearly 30 countries to work collaboratively on producing more food with fewer emissions.

"The Global Research Alliance, a New Zealand initiative, will equip our agricultural producers with the latest research, both here and overseas, on agricultural greenhouse gas emissions," Mr Carter says. "The potential for economic and environmental gains from this initiative cannot be underestimated.

"This Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand is as productive as we can be and Budget 2010 delivers real and long-lasting solutions for our biosecurity and the primary sector."
