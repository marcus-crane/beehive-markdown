Veterans Affairs Minister Judith Collins has congratulated Lieutenant Colonel Morrie Stanley, MBE (retired), who today received an Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry during the battle of Long Tan in Vietnam.

Mr Stanley was presented the citation at a function in Auckland today by Lt Col Harry Smith MC (Retired) OC D Company of 6 Battalion Royal Australian Regiment  (6RAR) on behalf of the Australian Government. The ceremony was attended by military officials, members of his former unit, veterans, family and friends.

The citation recognised Mr Stanley's actions during a fierce battle in a rubber plantation on 18 August 1966 in which 105 Australian troops confronted a force of 2500 battle-hardened North Vietnamese.

Mr Stanley was the Forward (Artillery) Observer from 161 Battery, 16 Field Regiment of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, attached to D Company, 6RAR during the Battle of Long Tan.

"Amid heavy gunfire and in driving monsoon rain, Mr Stanley directed a hail of artillery fire from US, Australian and New Zealand units down on the enemy positions," Ms Collins said.

"It was an impossible situation in which the unit faced overwhelming odds. Without Mr Stanley's courage and cool-headed commitment to duty, many Australian soldiers might never have made it out of that plantation alive.

"I congratulate Mr Stanley on this citation from the Australian Government. He is an inspiration and true ANZAC hero of whom all New Zealanders should be proud."
