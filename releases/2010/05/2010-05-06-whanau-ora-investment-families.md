Today's Budget announcement of $134.3 million for implementing Whanau Ora is an investment in families, Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia says.

The funding over four years will enable Te Puni Kokiri, the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Health to jointly implement an approach which will see families empowered to take control of their future, Mrs Turia says.

"I believe that whanau have the capability and collective capacity to overcome crisis and can and will take responsibility if empowered to do so.  This new approach will see families less reliant on state agencies and agencies acting as a facilitator rather than a fixer."

"This is a new approach and it will take time, but everyday I get feedback that this is the way forward for families who want to regain control of their future."

The money will be invested in whanau capacity and capability.

"It will also be used to help providers change their business models, train Whanau Ora practitioners and improve their IT systems."

Up to $20 million over four years will be spent on researching, evaluating and monitoring the implementation and results of Whanau Ora.

"In addition to this new funding, existing contracts will be integrated and reorganised into Whanau Ora contracts, allowing providers to focus more on the whanau that they work with, rather than on the compliance issues that come from having multiple government contracts."

"Together this represents a significant investment in the future of whanau by this Government and I look forward to the first providers getting underway."
