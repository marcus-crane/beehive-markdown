Budget 2010 invests significantly in school infrastructure to help support the Government's priority of lifting student achievement.

"An extra $1.4 billion is being invested in education over four years, and this will ensure teaching and learning environments are focused on the needs of students," Education Minister Anne Tolley says.

Budget 2010 provides $349.3 million in new operating and capital funding over four years for school property. This includes funding for building new schools and improving existing school buildings, and comes on top of Government funding of more than $500 million as part of Budget 2009.

"The Government's investment in new schools will allow us to purchase two new school sites, open three new schools in 2013 and undertake major redevelopment of one special school," Mrs Tolley says.

"We also recognise that some schools are facing problems due to leaky buildings and Budget 2010 includes $82 million for remedial work.

"A further $40 million is being invested to reduce surplus school property. This issue is a concern for some communities and our investment will mean the removal of unsightly buildings from vacant school sites.

"It will also reduce anti-social behaviour and vandalism in these areas and, in the long-term, will save Government money through reduced maintenance and security costs.

"As part of our focus on infrastructure, $48.3 million will be invested in building ultra-fast broadband under the School Network Upgrade Project and to extend the National Education Network trial.

"The School Network Upgrade Project involves progressively upgrading internal data and electrical infrastructure in schools so they can use ultra-fast broadband. Another 240 upgrades will start during the current school year.

"The National Education Network trial provides schools with access to online education content and services through a dedicated private network. Budget 2010 will allow an additional 300 schools to take part in the project.
