Transport Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed the awarding of a $6.8m investigation and design contract by the NZ Transport Agency to enable the progression of the crucial Huntly section of the Waikato Expressway - one of seven initial Roads of National Significance.

"Once complete, the Huntly section of road will improve road safety taking large volumes of through traffic out of Huntly and away from the Urupa on Taupiri Mountain, reducing journey times and increasing journey reliability between the Waikato and Auckland," says Mr Joyce.

He says the Waikato Expressway is a priority for investment because of the economic and safety benefits it will bring.

"This section of SH1 is the main southern road access to Auckland, and links New Zealand's 'Golden Triangle' of population and economic growth - Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.

"Pre-election National committed to having the Waikato Expressway completed within ten years of National taking office.  It remains a big challenge we're committed to this goal in government and we're a further step closer today.

"The contract award is an important step towards getting the Expressway designed and built so that these benefits can be realised.

"The Government is committed to lifting productivity, creating jobs and helping get our goods to market faster. Strong investment in our state highways and the completion of projects such as this will help deliver on these priorities," says Mr Joyce.

The investigation work on site is likely to begin within three months.
