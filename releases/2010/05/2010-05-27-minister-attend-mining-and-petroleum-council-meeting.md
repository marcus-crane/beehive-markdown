Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves this afternoon to attend the Australasian Ministerial Council on Mining and Petroleum Resources to be held in Melbourne tomorrow.

The Australasian Ministerial Council on Mining and Petroleum Resources consists of the Commonwealth Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism and State and Territory Ministers with responsibility for minerals and petroleum.

The council's mission is to contribute to Australia's wellbeing by promoting the progressive and sustainable development of the Australian mining, minerals and petroleum industry.  New Zealand has observer status on the council.

Mr Brownlee says that the topics for discussion at tomorrow's meeting are particularly relevant to New Zealand and the government's goal of responsibly developing New Zealand's natural resources so they contribute to greater prosperity and opportunities for all New Zealanders.

Topics for discussion at the meeting include, amongst others: the Henry Taxation Review, petroleum regulatory reform, land access and water, carbon capture and storage, and resource reporting.

"Many of the issues the council is examining tomorrow are issues that New Zealand is also considering, such as petroleum reform, land access and water," says Mr Brownlee.

"I'm looking forward to hearing how Australian states and territories are dealing with these issues," he says.

The Minister will return to New Zealand on Friday afternoon.
