Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia is applauding a new trilingual programme that promotes te reo Maori to the deaf community.

Maara Kai is a new series that helps audiences to grow and make their own produce.

"This is one of the few programmes to ever be broadcast in English, te reo Maori and New Zealand sign language, New Zealand's official languages," says Mrs Turia.

"I am delighted that this wonderful programme is not only acknowledging the deaf community as an important audience but has developed a programme that also promotes a healthy lifestyle by showing people how to grow their own kai."

"The makers of this programme are trail blazers and I would challenge more mainstream broadcasters and production companies to follow their lead."

Maara Kai is broadcast on Sunday nights at 6.30 pm on Maori Television with the series premiere broadcast on the eve of New Zealand Sign Language Week, which runs from May 2 - 8.

"What a fantastic way to celebrate the start of New Zealand Sign Language Week."
