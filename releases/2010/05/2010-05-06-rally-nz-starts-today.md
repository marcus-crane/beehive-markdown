Rally New Zealand 2010 will be officially started on Auckland's Viaduct this evening by Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee.  The government has contributed $250,000 towards the event, which is being held around Auckland until Sunday.

Rally New Zealand 2010 is round five of the thirteen rounds of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile World Rally Championship and is the key Asia Pacific round in the championship.

"The funding from the Major Events Development Fund gives Rally New Zealand a good shot at helping return the event to the FIA world calendar for the World Rally Championships," Mr Brownlee says.

The government's support will help meet some operational costs within New Zealand, and provide additional support for some of the more high profile and influential teams during their stay in New Zealand.

"We are pleased to support Rally New Zealand 2010 as an international motorsport event we're proud to host in New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.
