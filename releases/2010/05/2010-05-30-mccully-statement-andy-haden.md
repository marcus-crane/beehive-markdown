Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully met with former All Black Andy Haden today to discuss the row over his public comments late last week.

Mr McCully said the conversation focused on the use of a term that caused offence.

"The debate over the selection policies of Super 14 franchises, is not the province of the Government. However, the success of the 2011 programme, including the Ambassadors initiative, is very much our concern.

"The purpose of the 2011 Ambassador programme is to generate positive outcomes, especially in relation to trade, tourism, and investment. It is clearly very unhelpful to instead be engaged in a controversy over the use of language.

"Mr Haden accepts that his use a particular term caused offence. He has, without any prompting from me, already publicly apologized for causing offence. I understand that he is releasing a more general statement of apology today. That, as far as I am concerned, is the end of the matter.

"The 2011 Ambassadors were selected because they brought particular attributes to our 2011 programme. Most of them are based overseas, where they provide a very potent marketing force. That they undertake this work for free is greatly appreciated.

"Andy Haden's appointment is a little different in that he is New Zealand based.

"His role has been the arguably less glamorous task of connecting the range of industry showcasing activities planned for 2011 with his vast network of sporting and business leaders, especially in Australia and in Asia.

"I greatly value that contribution and trust it will be for this work, and not for the use of inappropriate language, that he comes to public attention in future," Mr McCully said.
