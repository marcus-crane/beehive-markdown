Budget 2010 will provide a significant boost to the economic prospects of Pacific people, Pacific Island Minister Georgina te Heuheu says.

The Budget provides $4.8 million in operating funding over the next four years for the Pacific Economic Development Agency (PEDA), which will significantly improve the economic wellbeing of Pacific people in Auckland.

PEDA helps people develop their business and entrepreneurship skills and is based in Auckland - the world's largest Polynesian city with two-thirds of New Zealand Pacific Island people.

"The Government is continuing to make substantial policy gains and investments in the future health and prosperity of Pacific people," Mrs te Heuheu says.

"Budget 2010 recognises the important contribution Pacific people make to New Zealand, which will continue well into the future.

"In 16 years, Pacific people will make up almost 10 per cent of our population and 12 per cent of our workforce. It's imperative that we continue to advance the economic prospects of Pacific communities for our country's economic and social future and we're doing that."

The Government will continue investing in education, health and housing, which will support families and lift the living standards of Pacific people.
