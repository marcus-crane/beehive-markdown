Maori Affairs Minister Dr Pita Sharples is very pleased that the UN Special Rapportuer on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples has accepted the Government's invitation to visit New Zealand.

"I spoke to Dr James Anaya while I was in New York, and I'm pleased to be able to say that he will visit us here in July this year," said Dr Sharples.

"He will no doubt follow up the issues reported on by his predecessor, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, when he visited in 2005. I look forward to showing Dr Anaya the advances we have made since then," he said.

Professor Stavenhagen arrived in the aftermath of the Foreshore and Seabed debacle. He recommended that the Act be repealed, and that Maori and Crown should engage in negotiation to recognise the inherent rights of Maori and provide for public access to beaches without discrimination of any kind. This process is now well under way.

"Dr Stavenhagen also recommended a constitutional review, to recognise Maori rights of self-determination based on the Treaty of Waitangi and international law. That is on the drawing board too.

"He called on the New Zealand Government to continue to support efforts to achieve a UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. After initially opposing the Declaration, this Government has now reversed its stance and publicly stated our support before the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues," said Dr Sharples.

"Recommendations for more resources for education and cultural protection, for tailored and targeted social services for Maori, and more resources to the Waitangi Tribunal are being progressed. Other issues remain, of course. Critical debate is healthy, and I am confident Dr Anaya will see good progress under this Government," he said.
