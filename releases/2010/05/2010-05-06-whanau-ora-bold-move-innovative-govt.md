Social Development Minister Paula Bennett says the social sector will benefit directly from the Government's investment in Whanau Ora.

"I am delighted that $120 million previously ring fenced as part of the Pathway to Partnership fund will be made available to social sector providers through Whanau Ora," says Ms Bennett.

"We've listened to the sector and heard their call for flexibility and innovation in helping our most vulnerable - we're delivering on that," says Ms Bennett.

"Whanau Ora is a bold new approach for Government to take, bringing real change to how social services are provided to those in need," says Ms Bennett.

"Many non-government organisations within our communities are already operating in line with the Whanau Ora philosophy, now the Government is simply backing them to do what they do best," says Ms Bennett.

The National-led Government has been working closely with non-government organisations to ascertain how best to provide social services to New Zealanders.

Social service providers have consistently asked for greater flexibility and the ability to design programmes that suit individuals and families in local communities.

"I look forward to working alongside Whanau Ora Minister Tariana Turia as Whanau Ora wraps around our most vulnerable families," says Ms Bennett.
