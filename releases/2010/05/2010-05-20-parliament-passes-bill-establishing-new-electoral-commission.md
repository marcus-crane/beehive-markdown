A bill which provides first-class electoral services through a new Electoral Commission was passed unanimously by Parliament last night.

The Electoral (Administration) Amendment Bill establishes a new independent Electoral Commission which will be given overarching responsibility to administer elections.

This will replace the current regime where electoral administration is divided between the Chief Electoral Officer, the Electoral Commission, and the Chief Registrar of Electors through the Electoral Enrolment Centre.

"The amalgamation of electoral agencies will provide improved access to electoral services as well as a more integrated, efficient, and strategic approach to electoral administration," Justice Minister Simon Power said.

The new Electoral Commission will be established as an independent Crown entity, and will take on the functions of the current Chief Electoral Officer and the Electoral Commission on October 1 this year.

"This will ensure the commission is in place in time to administer next year's general election and the referendum on the MMP voting system.

"As an independent Crown entity, the new Electoral Commission will maintain a high level of independence and impartiality for its constitutionally significant role."

A second bill will transfer the functions of the Chief Registrar of Electors to the commission on October 1 2012.

Electoral agency reform is being carried out in two stages to ensure transition to the new arrangements does not create a risk for the administration of the 2011 election.

"The establishment of a new Electoral Commission is an essential step in this Government's *wider programme of electoral reform."*
