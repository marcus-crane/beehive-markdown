Agriculture Minister David Carter is urging drought-affected farmers to plan for a tough winter and spring, despite rain falling over the country this week.

"While the rain is a welcome relief and should return soil moisture levels to normal in most areas, the full impact of the drought will last for some time yet," Mr Carter says.

"The Government recognises this and is expanding its assistance package to the Wairarapa and North Canterbury. We are also keeping the assistance in place for other affected areas."

The assistance package includes farm management advice, welfare support and funding for Rural Support Trusts. In addition, Inland Revenue will offer some flexibility within its Income Equalisation Scheme.

"This winter looks like it will be a difficult one for farmers around the country. It could be weeks or even months before there will be sufficient pasture cover to adequately feed stock, and the financial effects will be felt for some time," says Mr Carter.

"With temperatures now falling, grass growth is much slower and many farmers have already used up supplementary feed supplies.

"It's important to have a plan in place.  Do a feed budget, do a recovery plan and seek help early from the local Rural Support Trusts."

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff will continue to actively monitor the situation and work with local Rural Support Trusts, regional councils, Federated Farmers and industry bodies.
