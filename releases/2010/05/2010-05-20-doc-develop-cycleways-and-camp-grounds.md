The Government will spend more than $5 million developing new or improved campgrounds and three separate cycle trails over the next year, Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson says.

The new work has been funded from within Vote Conservation's $424 million in Budget 2010.

"Providing quality outdoor recreational facilities and opportunities is a Government priority and developing new campgrounds was part of our election manifesto.

"About $2 million will be spent improving the range of accessible, low cost camp sites as holiday destinations for visitors in both the North and South islands.

"Campgrounds in this work programme include four new sites near Rotorua, Kaikoura and the Lindis Pass, along with ongoing improvements to another three camping areas in Northland, South Canterbury and Central Otago.

"Most of the work is scheduled to be completed by next summer," Ms Wilkinson says.

The Department of Conservation is also prioritising $3.3 million of funding for three cycle trails, as part of the national cycleway network.

Work on the 75km St James trail in North Canterbury is likely to be completed by November this year. The 59km Central North Island Rail trail and sections of the ‘Mountain to Sea' route from Ruapehu to Whanganui are scheduled for completion by mid-2011.

"The development of these facilities will add to our reputation as an outdoors destination and obviously be available for the enjoyment of all New Zealanders," Ms Wilkinson says.
