**4.    Professional property investor**

Dave is a professional landlord and property investor in his 50s. Over the last 20 years, he has built up a portfolio of 25 properties. Dave's net annual profit from his rental activity, after costs of interest, repairs and maintenance and rates, but before depreciation is $112,000. After claiming depreciation of $52,000 ($1000 a week) on the buildings he owns his net annual profit is reduced to $60,000, which he pays tax on. Under the current rules, Dave can claim depreciation despite the fact that both his houses and the land they are on have substantially increased in value over time.

Under Budget 2010 tax changes, Dave can no longer claim depreciation on buildings. As a result he must now pay tax on $112,000 of annual profit rather than $60,000. Despite personal income tax cuts this increases his weekly income tax by $289.03. As he has less to spend his GST reduces by 85c a week. Overall he is $288.18 a week or $14,985.36 a year worse off.

**5.    Couple saving for first home**

Mana and Liz are a working couple in their early thirties. They have been living together for several years and plan to have children, but want to buy a house first. They have been saving for three years and are currently putting away $200 a week. They both earn $60,000 a year and earn interest on their joint savings of $1000 a year. They pay $250 a week in rent. Under Budget 2010 changes, they get a joint tax cut of $70.96 and pay an extra $30.58 in GST. That leaves them $40.38 a week better off and allows them to save an extra $2,099.76 a year towards their first home.

**6.    Domestic purposes beneficiary**

Overall she is $2.45 a week, or $127.40 a year better off.

**9. Mum and Dad property investor**

Amanda and Ben are a couple in their late 40s. They have two teenage children and a joint income of $120,000 a year - Ben earns $80,000 and Amanda, who works three days a week, earns $40,000. Several years ago they used equity in their own home to purchase an investment property. They still have a mortgage on their own home and make repayments of $200 a week.

They purchased their rental property for $300,000 and make an annual profit of $2,700 ($51.92 a week) after costs of interest, repairs, maintenance, rates and annual depreciation of $3,000. The property is now worth about $600,000.

Under Budget 2010 tax changes, Amanda and Ben get a joint personal tax cut of $73.46 on their salaries. However they can no longer claim depreciation on the building on their rental property. As a result they must now pay tax on annual rental profits of $5,700. This increases the tax on their investment income by $12.36 a week. In addition they pay an extra $37.54 a week in GST. Overall they are $23.56 a week or $1,225.12 a year better off.

**10. Business owner structuring income to claim Working for Families**

Peter lives with his wife and two children and owns a successful small business which makes a profit of $120,000 a year. His wife Jane doesn't work and they have paid off their mortgage. The business pays Peter a salary of $48,000 a year, which keeps his marginal personal tax rate at 21 per cent. The rest of the business profit is retained by a trust which owns the business. The income is taxed at the trust rate of 33 per cent, then distributed to him in the next financial year - ensuring he does not pay the top 38 per cent personal rate and reducing his tax liability by about $2,500 a year.

Because trust income is not currently counted when assessing Working for Families (WFF) eligibility, he is also able to claim $8,491.40 a year in WFF payments - leaving him almost $11,000 better off than a salary or wage-earner with similar income.

Under Budget 2010 changes, Peter gets a personal tax cut of $28.27 a week. However from April 1 next year - due to trust income being counted for Working for Families - he will no longer be eligible, meaning he can no longer claim a cent. In addition, he pays an extra $18 in GST each week. Overall he is $153.03 a week, or $7,957.56 a year worse off.

**11. High income couple with property investments**

Alex and Emily are an Auckland professional couple in their late thirties. Both have dedicated themselves to their careers and now each earn $150,000 a year. Ten years ago, they mostly invested in shares and managed funds, but as the property market took off they realised they could make large tax-free capital gains by shifting their savings into housing. They now own 10 properties which cost them $4 million. The market value of those properties is now about $6.5 million.

Rents of these properties provide a return of $769.23 a week over and above interest and maintenance costs. But Alex and Emily do not currently pay any tax on this additional income, as they are able to claim the same amount in depreciation. Under current rules they can claim depreciation at a "straight line" rate of 2 per cent of the cost of their buildings a year, despite the fact their houses and the land they are on have increased in value by about $2.5 million in recent years.

Under Budget 2010 changes, Alex and Emily get a combined personal tax cut of $235.76 a week. But because they can no longer claim depreciation on their buildings, their property portfolio now returns a taxable profit of $769.23 a week. That incurs an added tax bill of $253.84 a week. In addition they pay $89.39 more each week in GST. Overall they are $107.47 a week, or $5,588.44 a year, worse off.

**15. Foreign owned company**

A Firm International Ltd is a foreign-owned multinational group with a worldwide group debt percentage of 50 per cent. Its New Zealand subsidiary A Firm NZ Ltd earns gross profits of $8 million. It has interest expenses of $5.6 million, other expenses of $2 million and reported a net profit before tax of $400,000.

A Firm NZ Ltd has a debt percentage of 75 per cent. Under the current settings it is not subject to any adjustment under the thin capitalisation rules because its debt percentage is within the safe harbour. However, once the safe harbour is reduced to 60 per cent an adjustment will apply and A Firm NZ Ltd will no longer be able offset as much of its interest costs against tax.

As a result, its taxable net profit is increased by $1.12 million to $1.52 million. With the company tax rate at 28 per cent, A Firm NZ Ltd will have an additional annual tax liability of $313,600.
