Disarmament Minister Georgina te Heuheu has welcomed news that Samoa has ratified the Cluster Munitions Convention.

"New Zealand congratulates Samoa on its ratification of the Convention, which bans cluster munitions," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Samoa's decision is an important move and is testament to Samoa's commitment to the cause of disarmament and multilateralism.

"Samoa participated in the negotiations towards the Convention held in Wellington and it is fitting that it is showing leadership in the Pacific on this important humanitarian issue.

"I hope that other Pacific Forum members will also be in a position to ratify the Convention in the near future, and New Zealand stands ready to assist in any way it can," Mrs te Heuheu said.

New Zealand played a leading role in negotiation of the Convention including hosting a major meeting in 2008. New Zealand will participate in the first meeting of States Parties to the Convention to be held in Laos later this year.

Samoa is the 31st state to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions, following the 30th ratification on 17 February which triggered the Convention's entry into force on 1 August this year.

New Zealand was the 25th country to ratify the Convention and first Pacific Forum member to do so. Samoa is the second.
