Budget 2010 provides support in several areas for Māori business to contribute to the economic recovery and help Māori get ahead under their own steam, Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples says.

"$4.5 million of new money has been allocated to grow Māori productivity and export growth, and to support Māori innovation. A further $4.5 million has been set aside for initiatives currently being developed to strengthen and promote Māori tourism.

"The Māori asset base is concentrated in dairy, tourism, meat, wood and seafood - most of New Zealand's key export earners. There are huge potential economic returns from our $3 million investment in skills and training for Māori in the primary sector.

"Key drivers of growth for Māori in the ‘innovation economy' include the creation of knowledge and innovation, technological advances, research and development, and education and skills," Dr Sharples says.

The Government has allocated $1.5 million for Iwi/Māori partnerships with the Government to identify priorities in science.

"Māori culture offers a unique point to differentiate New Zealand's services and activities to tourists. $4.5 million has been set aside for initiatives currently being developed to strengthen leadership of the Māori tourism sector; to improve our Māori tourism product and to promote Māori tourism."

Other Budget 2010 initiatives include developing a ‘Brand Māori' to gain premium prices for Māori-produced goods exported to niche markets and support for a delegation of Māori business leaders at the World Expo in Shanghai, to be funded from existing allocations.

"I will head the delegation to the Shanghai Expo 2010 in September, to help Māori businesses enter growth industries, to increase Māori exports, and to increase the profile of Māori tourism experiences to overseas providers and visitors," Dr Sharples says.

"Māori economic growth is good for Māori and good for the nation."
