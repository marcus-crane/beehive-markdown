A report looking at ways to improve access to high cost, highly specialised medicines has been received by the Minister of Health, Tony Ryall.

Mr Ryall set up the three-person panel in May 2009.

"This report is the result of a lot of research and consultation, and I would like to thank the panel members and those who contributed to the content."

"The Government is also receiving advice on the possible expansion of Pharmac's role into areas of hospital medicines, vaccines and some medical devices as recommended by the Ministerial Review Group (MRG)."

"These two pieces of work cover some similar areas, so we will be considering all of the advice together, and making announcements before the end of the year."

A copy of the report is attached.
