The Government has announced that the new Health and Disability Commissioner is Anthony Hill, currently a Deputy Director-General at the Ministry of Health.

Health Minister Tony Ryall says, "Mr Hill will start his new role in July, after 15 years with the Ministry."

"Mr Hill has worked as the Ministry's Chief Legal Advisor, and has been a Deputy Director-General for more than five-and-a-half years."

"Mr Hill is replacing Mr Ron Paterson who retired in March. Mr Paterson also started as Commissioner with a background in law, and as a Deputy Director-General at the Ministry of Health."

"This is an important role in the health service. The Commissioner and his office deal with patients' individual problems and concerns, as well as looking at the overall performance of key parts of the system."
