Employment Minister Paula Bennett welcomes the introduction of the Department of Labour's Leading Indicator of Employment.

"This indicator can be added to the tool box for monitoring the labour market," says Ms Bennett.

The Leading Indicator of Employment is designed to give advance warning of turning points in the labour market as measured by the Household Labour Force Survey.

Drawing on information including the ANZ Commodity Price Index and the Stock Market Index, the Leading Indicator will be issued quarterly following the release of the Household Labour Force Survey.

"This tool will provide valuable information, allowing the Government to gauge the direction of the labour market and develop policy accordingly, says Ms Bennett.

"It won't be the only tool used, but it will provide another option to give us an indication of where employment trends may lead us," says Ms Bennett.
