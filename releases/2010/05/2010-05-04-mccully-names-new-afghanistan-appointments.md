Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced that New Zealand's first resident Ambassador in Kabul will be Neville Reilly, while Dick Newlands will become the first Civilian Director of the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamyan Province.

Mr McCully said the appointments were key elements in rebalancing New Zealand's commitments in Afghanistan in favour of greater civilian representation, in line with the international community's change in emphasis.

"New Zealand, along with the Afghan Government and our international partners, is in the midst of a transition period towards building the capacity of the Afghan security forces and civil administration to run their own affairs," Mr McCully said.

"Until now, New Zealand has maintained its diplomatic relationship with Kabul from Tehran, while the PRT in Bamyan has been under Defence Force command since New Zealand took over as lead nation in the region in 2003.

"New Zealand's aim is to leave Bamyan as a secure and self-sustaining part of a nation well on the road to a stable future. While the NZDF has helped keep Bamyan one of the most stable parts of Afghanistan, our aim has always been to bring the military home.

"To achieve these twin objectives, we need to increase our efforts in building up civilian capacity, including the ability of the Afghan National Police, to safeguard the peace."

Mr McCully said the civilian status but military background of Mr Reilly and Mr Newlands would be of significant benefit in Afghanistan, especially during the transition of the PRT towards an increasingly non-military focus.

Mr Reilly, a retired Brigadier, was the first commander of New Zealand's PRT in Bamyan. He was until recently Defence Attaché in Riyadh, from where he was accredited to Kabul. He previously served in Port Moresby and Jakarta, and with United Nations missions in the former Yugoslavia and Timor Leste.

Mr Newlands retired as Air Commodore earlier this year after a two-year posting to Headquarters US Central Command in Tampa, Florida. He was also Deputy Chief of Air Force, and previously served as New Zealand Defence Attaché in Washington D.C.
