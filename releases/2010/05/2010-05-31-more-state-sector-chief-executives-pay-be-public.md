More State sector chief executives will have their salaries publicly disclosed in the next State Services Commission annual report in October.

"Cabinet considers that greater transparency across the State sector is important, and publishing all Crown entity and Public Service chief executives' pay details annually in one document will contribute to that "says State Services Minister Tony Ryall.

The SSC annual report currently reports Public Service and Tertiary Education Institution chief executive remuneration as agreed by Cabinet in 1998.  At that time it was agreed that all other Crown entity remuneration would be reported in each entity's own annual report.  Cabinet's latest decision replaces the 1998 Cabinet decision.

"The additional reporting of Crown entity chief executive pay will enable the public to see a larger range of chief executive pay in the State sector , and improve accountability for this aspect of public expenditure.  It will also enable the public to make comparisons and see trends over time, by comparing successive annual reports."

Amongst others now having their salaries published in the SSC annual report will be the chief executives of District Health Boards, Housing NZ Corporation, ACC and NZQA.

The remuneration will be reported on the same basis as is currently required under the Companies Act 1993, with total remuneration of $100,000 or more in bands of $10,000.
