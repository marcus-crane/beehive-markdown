Transport Minister Steven Joyce has announced a reduction of almost $5 per passenger in the marine safety charge paid by cruise ships, which will further stimulate the already growing cruise ship industry.

The charge will decrease from $8.29 to $3.30 per passenger port call from 1 October this year.  It is possible because Maritime NZ has collected more money than anticipated, or required, from the industry.

When the charge was set in August 2008 it was anticipated that it would generate $2 million in revenue from the Cruise sector each year to support Maritime NZ's safety, regulatory and monitoring functions.  However, the increase in ships visiting since that time has led to a much higher collection of revenue of around $3.8 million for 2009/10.

A wider value for money review of Maritime NZ, which includes a full review of marine safety charges, will begin next month.

Mr Joyce says it is crucial that government services are routinely reviewed to ensure they are being delivered efficiently and cost effectively, given New Zealand's drive for faster economic growth.

"A review of Maritime New Zealand will focus on whether current funding is appropriate for the services being delivered.  It will ensure that taxpayers and industry are getting value for money."

The review was initiated by Maritime New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport to ensure Maritime New Zealand meets the government's expectation that its agencies provide value for money.

The review will be carried out by a steering group which comprises representatives from the Ministry of Transport, Treasury and Maritime New Zealand. In addition, a sector reference group will be formed and consulted with during the review.

The value for money review will include consideration of the marine safety charge.  The marine safety charge is a levy paid by all commercial vessels and is used by Maritime New Zealand to fund a range of maritime safety, regulatory and monitoring functions that benefit the sector.

In the interim, the government's focus on cost effective services is reflected in the decision to reduce the marine safety charge paid by cruise ship operators.

Mr Joyce says the cruise ship industry is an important and growing part of New Zealand's tourism sector.

"As the number of cruise ships visiting New Zealand has increased since the rates were last set, an unintended consequence is that the industry is paying more through the marine safety charge than was originally anticipated. This will be addressed before the next cruise season begins.

"The value for money review will also ensure that the rates accurately reflect the costs and risks associated with commercial shipping, and that these are applied appropriately across the industry."
