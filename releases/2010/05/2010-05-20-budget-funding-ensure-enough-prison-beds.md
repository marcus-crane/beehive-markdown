Funding of $69.3 million over the next four years will ensure there are enough prison beds to cope with the rising prison population, Corrections Minister Judith Collins says.

An additional 2270 prison beds will be needed at New Zealand prisons by 2019 due to forecast growth of more than 1200 prisoners and the decommissioning of 1055 existing prison beds.

Budget funding of $24.0 million over the next four years will progress planning for a new prison at Wiri in South Auckland, which the Government intends to be designed, built and operated under a public-private partnership (PPP).

Another $45.3 million over the next four years will be used for an additional 245 beds and associated infrastructure at Mt Eden Prison. The new beds are forecast to be in service by December 2012.

"This Government will ensure the Department of Corrections has the money to plan and build the extra beds needed to keep pace with prisoner numbers," Ms Collins says.

The PPP prison will have about 1000 beds and is expected to be in service by December 2014, subject to consents and the successful completion of an open tender process.

The $24.0 million will help fund development of the Wiri Prison PPP stage two business case, development of the expression of interest and request for proposal, and completing the tender process - including commercial negotiations and contract finalisation.

"To have a world-class corrections system, we need exposure to world-class innovation and expertise," Ms Collins says.

"A custodial PPP is an opportunity to inject new ideas and new innovations into the corrections sector to enhance public safety, improve rehabilitation and lower costs.

"International experience suggests building a new prison at Wiri using a public-private partnership will offer savings of between 10 and 20 per cent over conventional methods over the 25 to 35-year life of the proposed contract."

"Rehabilitation remains a priority for the Government. The Corrections Department will fund from its baseline over the next four years $11.2 million of operating costs required to increase the number of prisoners learning literacy, numeracy and work-based skills.
