Migrants settle into New Zealand extremely well and the vast majority find work quickly, Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman says.

New research from the Department of Labour shows over 90 percent of migrants are very satisfied with life in New Zealand and 90 percent reported they were settled after living here for 18 months.

The latest results from the Longitudinal Immigration Survey: New Zealand (LISNZ) shows that overall new migrants adjust well and begin contributing to New Zealand's economy swiftly.

‘'The survey results emphasise the contribution skilled migrants make to New Zealand. Packing your life up and shifting to a new country is a big decision to make,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'It's important to our future that migrants settle well. Migrants contribute around $1.9 billion a year to our economy, and New Zealand is competing with overseas countries to attract skilled people to bolster our workforce.''

Dr Coleman says the latest research is complemented by a Department of Labour study of migrants who arrived in New Zealand under the skilled migrant category. It found 92 percent were employed at the time of the survey and the same percentage said they had no significant difficulties in finding work.

‘'We're seeing a really positive trend with skilled migrants. They are productive, they provide employers with the skills they may not be available in the workforce and they contribute to economic growth.''  
   
The LISNZ, which began in 2005 is due to be completed later this year. It surveys the experiences of over 6000 new migrants in various stages after taking up permanent residence.
