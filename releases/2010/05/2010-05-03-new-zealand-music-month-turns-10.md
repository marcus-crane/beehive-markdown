Kiwi music fans will be turning up the sounds this month as New Zealand Music Month celebrates its 10th birthday, says Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman.

‘'Over the past decade New Zealand Music Month has steadily ingrained itself into our culture and has provided a great platform for promoting home-grown music.

‘'Ten years on it's gone from strength to strength, and it's taken local artists and bands with it for the ride. In late 2001, just over 11 percent of music played on commercial radio was Kiwi-made. Eight years later it's around 20 percent.

‘'New Zealand Music Month has played a part in that success. We are hearing more locally produced music on our airwaves than ever before and it sounds good.

‘'To the NZ Music Commission and the other organisations involved in making this month a hit, congratulations on hitting double figures. New Zealand On Air also deserves special mention for its backing and support of the many talented bands and artists which we'll be hearing more of this month.

‘'There's a feast of great music on offer from a range quality acts, so get out there and enjoy the best sounds New Zealand has to offer.''
