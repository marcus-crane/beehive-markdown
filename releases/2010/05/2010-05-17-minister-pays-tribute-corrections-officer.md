Associate Corrections Minister Dr Pita Sharples has this afternoon paid tribute to Corrections Officer Jason Palmer who died on the weekend while doing his job.

"I would like to offer my deepest sympathy and condolences to Jason's family both in New Zealand and the United States and also his colleagues at the Spring Hill Corrections Facility and the Corrections Department."

"Corrections officers are dedicated people who work very hard to ensure the smooth running of our prisons."

 "I have seen this dedication and commitment first hand after visiting Spring Hill in March and I am saddened that today they are mourning the loss of one of their colleagues," says Dr Sharples.

 "Corrections officers come from all walks of life and Jason was no exception having come to New Zealand from the United States eight years ago.  He had been a Corrections Officer at Spring Hill since November last year."

"I have been told that he was a fine young man who was held in high regard by his fellow officers, was keen to learn with high integrity and was firm but fair with prisoners."

"This is a very sad time for Jason's family, the Corrections Department and his colleagues and my thoughts are with them."
