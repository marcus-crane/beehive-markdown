Three members of the Board of the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology have been reappointed. 

Minister of Research, Science and Technology Wayne Mapp has announced the reappointment of Jim McLean as deputy chair, and Warren Larsen and Dr Tom Richardson as ordinary Board members. 

"These three experienced members will provide continuity to the Board during  a period of significant change as the Foundation and the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology are merged," Dr Mapp said.

The Government announced in March that the Foundation and MoRST will be amalgamated into a new department as part of changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Government agencies.

The terms of all Foundation Board members will continue until legislative changes are enacted.

The Foundation is the main Government funding body for science and technology.  It was established by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology Act 1990 to invest in science and technology research for the benefit of New Zealand.  Other Board members are Bryan Gould (chair), Professor Pare Keiha, Denise Church, Professor Roberta Farrell, Dr William Rolleston and Phil O'Reilly.
