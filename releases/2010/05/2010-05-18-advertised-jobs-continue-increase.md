Figures just out show a continued increase in the number of jobs advertised on the internet, including a rise in skilled jobs advertised.

Jobs Online, a Department of Labour monitoring service, found an increase of 8.6 percent in all jobs advertised online in the last three months.

"We're now seeing business confidence pick up post-recession and as a result many employers are hiring again," says Ms Bennett.

The number of skilled jobs advertised has now risen for 10 consecutive months by 21.7 percent in total and by 8.5 percent in just the last three months.

Skilled vacancies increased across almost all industries, with the biggest rises in construction and engineering (up15%); sales, retail and marketing and advertising (up11%).

"These encouraging indicators when added to the drop in the official unemployment rate to six percent; signal a labour market slowly on the mend," says Ms Bennett.

Jobs Online was launched in December 2009 and collates data from New Zealand's leading online advertisers Trade Me jobs, Herald jobs and Seek.
