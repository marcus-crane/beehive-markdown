Associate Health Minister Jonathan Coleman announced today that Dr Peter McGeorge is stepping down as Chair of the Mental Health Commission.

Dr McGeorge, Chair since January 2008, has resigned to take-up the position of Director of Mental Health at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney.

‘'Peter brought his extensive clinical expertise, sector knowledge and keen innovative thinking and style to the challenging role of Chair,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'His dedication and commitment to raising the profile of mental health issues has been one of his stand-out achievements while he was always a strong advocate for people and families affected by mental health issues.

‘'Under Peter's watch the Commission continually pushed for improving the sector and placed emphasis on doctors identifying earlier the signs of mental illness and linking people with the right support and services.

‘'Peter's been a great asset for the Mental Health Commission and I wish him all the best for the future.''

Dr McGeorge will finish at the Mental Health Commission in July.
