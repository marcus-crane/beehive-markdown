Minister for Energy and Resources, Gerry Brownlee, today congratulated the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) on winning the award for the best Government agency in the Vero Excellence in Business Support Award 2010.

The award was in recognition of the work that EECA Business does with organisations throughout the country to increase their energy efficiency and use of renewable energy.

"This government is committed to making the best of its energy resources. Helping New Zealand businesses use less energy and increase their use of renewable energy helps to strengthen our economy," Mr Brownlee said.

EECA Business estimates around $2 billion a year could be saved through better energy management and increasing the use of cost effective renewable energy.

"There is so much potential to save energy and successful businesses are the ones that focus on improving productivity and reducing waste.  Efficient use of energy is a key part of that process.

"EECA Business does great work encouraging and supporting businesses of all sizes to recognise and capitalise on this potential." 

The other finalists in this category were carboNZero, Inland Revenue and Statistics New Zealand.
