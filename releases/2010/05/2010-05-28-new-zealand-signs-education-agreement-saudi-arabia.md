Education Minister Anne Tolley and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Minister of Higher Education, Dr Khalid Bin Mohammed Al Ankary, today signed an agreement to strengthen and increase New Zealand's educational and science engagement with the Kingdom.

"Saudi Arabia is an important education partner for New Zealand," says Mrs Tolley.

"It is it now our fifth largest source of international students, worth an estimated $250 million in revenue each year. Many New Zealand education providers also have long established links with Saudi Arabia for the delivery of our education services there.

"This agreement is a significant step for New Zealand. Relationships between our Governments are a prerequisite for establishing and maintaining student numbers from Saudi Arabia, as well as creating opportunities for New Zealand consultancy firms to gain access to contracts within the Saudi education sector."

The agreement outlines the basis for New Zealand's education engagement with Saudi Arabia over the next five years in the educational and scientific fields, in both the compulsory and tertiary sectors.

Collaboration could include joint research projects, joint academic programmes and student and faculty exchange particularly in the science, technology and medical fields.
