Tamatea's Community Constable now has a permanent base following the opening of the new Tamatea Community Police Station by Police Minister Judith Collins today.

The station will be the permanent base for Constable Mike Burne, who will work closely with community groups to prevent crime and actively target crime hot spots. Constable Burne was previously based at Taradale, around 5km away.

The Tamatea station will also be home to the Napier Tactical Response team, which was previously based at Napier Police Station.

"If there's one thing you can say for certain about criminals, it's that they prefer to stay clear of places where there are healthy numbers of Police," Ms Collins said.

"This station represents the Government's commitment to a strong, permanent Police presence here in the heart of Tamatea."

Ms Collins paid tribute to the community for its help in making the new station a reality.

"Police stations are more than just a base for Police staff. They are a focal point and a source of pride for their communities, and a link between the Police and the people they serve.

"From the outset, the people of Tamatea have been a part of the team that made this building possible."

Ms Collins thanked Foodstuffs Ltd for making the site available, the Napier City Council for their support and other community groups who helped make the new station a reality.

Tamatea is the 10th Police facility opened since Ms Collins became Minister.
