Arts Culture and Heritage Minister Christopher Finlayson paid tribute to the life and career of Dame Pat Evison, who passed away aged 85.

"Dame Pat Evison was one of our most well-known and well-loved actresses for her television roles in groundbreaking series, but she was also a pioneer in New Zealand theatre," Mr Finlayson said. "She was one of the first New Zealand theatre students to receive a scholarship to study overseas, at the Old Vic Theatre School in London."

"She was also an important part of television history in this country, acting in Pukemanu, the first continuing drama series ever produced in New Zealand.

Dame Pat acted in a number of early Downstage Theatre productionsn in Wellington. Her performance in the Samuel Beckett play Happy Days was described by director Bruce Mason as the "finest event in New Zealand Theatre".

"My thoughts go out to her family, friends and colleagues at this time," Mr Finlayson said.
