The Government will invest $6.8 million over the next three years to improve the lives of people with disabilities, Disability Issues Minister Tariana Turia says.

"The initiatives announced today will see New Zealand strengthen its reputation as world leader in disability issues.

"These initiatives signal a significant shift in focusing on quality of life outcomes for disabled people and will ultimately help people with disabilities to achieve a better life," Mrs Turia says.

The initiatives, to be funded from operating spending over the next three years, include:

- $1.5 million to help promote design standards for homes that are accessible over a person's lifetime.
- $2.34 million to help promote, protect and monitor the rights of people with disabilities in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
- $3 million for a public awareness campaign to change attitudes and behaviours that limit opportunities of disabled people.

"The Government will resource disabled people's organisations to monitor disabled people's experiences and difficulties they encounter, such as with accessing government services," Mrs Turia says.

"I am very excited that we have been able to respond to a call from disabled people for initiatives that I know will have positive outcomes."
