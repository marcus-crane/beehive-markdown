Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has opened nominations for board members to sit on the soon to be established electricity market regulator, the Electricity Authority. 

"The new authority is one of the proposals to come out of last year's review of the sector.  The authority will be responsible for promoting competition, reliable supply and efficient operation of the electricity market for the long-term benefit of all electricity consumers," Mr Brownlee said.

The Authority will be established under the Electricity Industry Bill, currently before Parliament, as an independent Crown entity. 

Further information on the Electricity Authority and Board appointments is available on the Ministry of Economic Development's website at [www.med.govt.nz/electricity-authority](http://www.med.govt.nz/electricity-authority) and [www.med.govt.nz/crown-entity-vacancies](http://www.med.govt.nz/crown-entity-vacancies).
