New Zealand's next Ambassador to the Netherlands will be career diplomat George Troup, Foreign Minister Murray McCully said today.

Mr Troup will also be accredited as New Zealand's Ambassador to Denmark, Finland, and Norway.

"New Zealand has a long-standing and warm relationship with the Netherlands which encompasses a broad range of shared interests and values," Mr McCully said.

"The Netherlands has traditionally been one of our closest partners in Europe, and it is also the third-largest source of foreign investment in New Zealand.

"We also have productive relationships with Denmark, Finland, and Norway. We share similar objectives on many international issues, and enjoy growing personal contacts and economic links."

Mr Troup is currently Director of Europe Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He was most recently Ambassador to Mexico, and has previously served in Washington, and Paris.

Mr Troup takes up his assignment in August, replacing Rachel Fry, who is returning to Wellington.
