Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson says more than 350 written submissions were received on proposals to change the way building is regulated.

A discussion document outlining proposed reforms to the Building Act was released in late February followed by an eight week public consultation period before submissions closed on 23 April.

The aim of the proposed reforms is to reduce the cost and complexity of consenting and to ensure the people hired to do the work take responsibility for building it right first time and stand behind their work. 

Mr Williamson says submissions were received from a wide range of individuals and groups including home and building owners, local councils, businesses, major sector organisations and specialist interest groups.

"There was a wide range of views in the submissions received, including support for the principle of what we're trying to achieve," Mr Williamson says.

"We now need to take the time to work through the points raised in the submissions as we give further thought to the way forward."

The aims of the Building Act review are to:

- Ensure quality homes and buildings are produced through an efficient and cost-effective regulatory framework;
- Increase confidence in the building and housing market; and
- Ensure homes and buildings are built using the right skills and knowledge.
