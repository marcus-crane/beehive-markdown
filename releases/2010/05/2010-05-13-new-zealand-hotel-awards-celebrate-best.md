Outstanding achievements in the hotel sector were recognised at the inaugural Hotel Industry Conference awards in Auckland tonight.

The awards highlight the high level of professionalism and the best work practices on display in the industry, says Associate Tourism Minister Jonathan Coleman who presented tonight's awards at Sky City.

The award for Senior Hotel Executive of the Year went to Zane Boon, a Regional Manager for Accor Hospitality while Amber Margrain, Talent and Mobility Manager for Accor scooped the Outstanding Young Hotel Executive category.

The construction, refurbishment and fit-out of The Great Room secured The Langham Hotel in Auckland the Innovation in Sustainability Award. The award recognises innovation shown by a hotel in reducing its impact on the environment.

‘'Congratulations to all of tonight's winners and the finalists,'' Dr Coleman says.

‘'These awards should encourage others to aspire to similar excellence. With the Rugby World Cup bringing an estimated 85,000 visitors to New Zealand next year, and new figures showing the sector is steadily rebounding from the economic downturn, it's an exciting time for the industry.''

**Background:**

 

The *New Zealand Hotel Council Senior Hotel Executive of the Year Award*

is awarded to an executive who has worked in the industry for at least 10 years. The Award is not just about hotel performance.  It rewards a Senior Executive in the industry who has a passion for their work so great that they go above and beyond the call of duty.

The *Hospitality Standards Institute Outstanding Young Hotel Executive Award* is awarded to an executive aged under 30 who has illustrated commitment to the industry and value to their hotel.

The *Ministry of Tourism Innovation in Sustainability Award* recognizes the hotel or individual that has shown innovation above and beyond all others in order to minimize its impact on the environment.  The innovation may have the potential to change the way the hotel industry operates, and supports the *100% Pure New Zealand* brand.
