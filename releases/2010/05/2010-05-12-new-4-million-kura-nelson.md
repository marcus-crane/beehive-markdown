A new school providing education in Te Reo Māori has been established in Nelson and will open in 2012, Education Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Education Minister Pita Sharples announced today.

The kura, to be known as Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Tuia Te Matangi, will have capacity for 61 students in Years 1-13.

"This is an exciting development for the Nelson region," says Mrs Tolley.

"The establishment of the kura will mean that parents will now have an option for Māori immersion education from Te Kohanga Reo through to Year 13. 

"The kura, which will cost over $4 million to build, is set to open in Term 1, 2012 and will be located on land behind Salisbury School. Construction is scheduled to begin before the end of this year."

Minister Sharples welcomed the fact that this is the first kura in Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka to be established.

"There are many exciting opportunities ahead for the establishment board and its principal, as they develop and prepare the school for opening," said Dr Sharples.

"Like all new schools, the kura will include design elements that reflect the community.

"The establishment board of trustees, to be appointed shortly, will play a significant role in the design of the kura. It will have responsibility for appointing a foundation principal, determining school policy and governance practices, ensuring that the school reflects the needs and aspirations of its local community, and that the school is ready to operate from the start of 2012."
