Agriculture Minister David Carter has announced the Government will spend an extra $8.2 million over four years to boost animal welfare activities.

Budget 2010 allocates around $5 million for animal welfare enforcement and compliance, including doubling the number of enforcement officers and greater coordination between key organisations involved in animal welfare.

$2 million is earmarked for a major review of the Animal Welfare Act and additional support for codes of welfare and the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC).

Funding of $1.2 million over four years will also be provided to the Royal New Zealand SPCA for enforcement work.

"The Government recognises the importance of animal welfare, not only in meeting the expectations of New Zealanders but also in maintaining our strong reputation as a trusted trading partner," says Mr Carter.

"Additional funding for NAWAC and the codes of welfare process demonstrates our commitment to maintaining high standards of animal welfare.

"Most New Zealanders will not tolerate cruelty to animals and extra support for the Royal New Zealand SPCA will ensure a greater focus on enforcement.

"The additional animal welfare funding has been freed up by reallocations within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, allowing the investment to shift to where it is needed most," Mr Carter says.
