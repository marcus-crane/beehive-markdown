Communications Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the start of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) build in four more regional towns as the extension of the Government’s broadband programme continues to roll out across the country.

In January the Government announced an investment of $300 million to extend UFB to another 423,000 New Zealanders across a further 151 towns.

“Having access to fast and reliable broadband is critical to growing our regional economies and to New Zealand’s future,” Mr Bridges says.

“Over one million New Zealand households and businesses already have access to fibre. Our plan to extend UFB is now underway in 12 towns and areas, with the build starting in Omokoroa, Te Puna, Ngaruawahia and Stratford this month.

“Once the UFB build is completed by the end of 2024, approximately 85 per cent of New Zealanders will have access to speeds of close to 1,000 Megabits per second.

“This means more productive businesses, improvements to health care through video-conferencing between doctors, specialists and patients, and improved access to online resources for students and teachers,” Mr Bridges says.

Further information is available at www.broadband.govt.nz. A list of the areas that are receiving access to UFB in each region and an indication of timing for the rollout is available on Crown Fibre Holdings website here.
