The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass the Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bill through its third reading.

“Today brings Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa’s long journey to settlement to an end,” Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said.

“Reaching this milestone is a testament to the determination and mana of Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa. The settlement provides a foundation for the future prosperity and wellbeing of the iwi, hapū and whānau of Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa.”

Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki Claims Settlement Bill and Heretaunga Tamatea Claims Settlement Bill passed through their first readings during extended sitting hours today. The bills have been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.

“These bills provide important redress and acknowledge past breaches of the Treaty,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today’s progress brings these iwi one step closer to realising the benefits of settlement.”

“The number of Treaty settlement bills progressed this term demonstrates this government’s commitment to the full and final resolution of historical Treaty claims,” Mr Finlayson said. “A total of 16 Treaty settlement bills have been passed this term settling the historical Treaty claims of groups from the Far North, Taranaki, Whanganui and the Wairarapa.”
