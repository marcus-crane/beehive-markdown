Christchurch’s Retail Precinct continues to grow and attract more people to the central city, Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner.

The *Greater Christchurch Dashboard — Retail Precinct* looks at the main developments in the Retail Precinct and how the Christchurch Integrated Government Accommodation (CIGA) programme complements this growth.

“Both the ANZ and BNZ centres are now up and running, making the Retail Precinct a much more vibrant, lively place,” Ms Wagner says. 

“The hustle and bustle is set to increase with the opening of the new FreshChoice City Market in The Crossing tomorrow. 

“The Crossing, which is opening in stages, is an extensive project offering retail, hospitality, commercial space and car parking. It will also host a number of retailers new to Christchurch, including Swedish clothing company H&M and British fashion brand Topshop.

“These new offerings are completely changing the retail landscape and establishing central Christchurch as a modern and exciting shopping destination.

“The CIGA programme was a catalyst for the central city’s revitalisation, moving 1500 workers from government departments and agencies into four new buildings in and around the Retail Precinct.

The last building in the initiative, the Pita Te Hori Centre (formerly the King Edward Barracks site), was officially opened last week.

“All this development shows the Government and the private sector have real confidence in the future of Christchurch as a fantastic place to live, work and play.”
