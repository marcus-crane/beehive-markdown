The Christchurch earthquakes have had a significant impact on the make-up and distribution of people in Canterbury, Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner says.

The latest *Greater Christchurch Dashboard — Population* looks at changes in the resident population, including cultural diversity.

“As many of us who live in the region have seen first-hand, there’s been a significant population shift from Christchurch City to the neighbouring Selwyn and Waimakariri districts,” Ms Wagner says.

“And while that’s been well documented, the key is understanding how changing population trends and projected growth affect long-term planning for greater Christchurch.

“The Urban Development Indicators report and recent Greater Christchurch Monitoring Report both utilise population data to contribute to and inform long-term planning around land use, housing, consents and transport.

“The central city population is still well below 2010 levels but projects such as the East Frame, the Margaret Mahy Family Playground, the bourgeoning Retail Precinct and Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct all make the central city an increasingly attractive place to live, work and play.

“Greater Christchurch is also more ethnically diverse than it once was, with people from all over the world, particularly Ireland and the Philippines, as well as more Maori and Pacific people.

“And while many places around the country are in the midst of a ‘man drought’, Christchurch has almost 6000 more young men aged 20-29 than women of the same age.”
