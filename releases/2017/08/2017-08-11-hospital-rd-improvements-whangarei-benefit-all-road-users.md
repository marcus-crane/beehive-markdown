Improvements to the intersection of State Highway 14 and Hospital Road in Whangarei are making it easier and safer for the growing number of people moving through the area, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The improvements have involved the NZ Transport Agency, Northland DHB and Whangarei District Council working together to make it easier for hospital staff, patients and visitors to access and leave the hospital.

“The hospital is an important base servicing the growing population of the wider area and these improvements show our commitment to maintaining the efficiency of key transport links,” Mr Bridges says.

“New traffic signals are improving traffic flows for those turning into and out of the hospital, while the new signalised pedestrian crossings across both State Highway 14 and Hospital Road are improving access for those on foot.

“The upgrade is part of a series of safety and efficiency improvements on state highways through Whangarei and recognises the area’s growing population and the role the hospital plays in servicing the wider Northland area.

“The existing cycle lanes have also been extended to improve cycling connections between Maunu and the city as part of wider work on the Whangarei Urban Cycling Network,” Mr Bridges says.

A median strip has also been painted along the state highway from Hospital Road to Silverstream Road to make it safer for people coming into and out of their driveways.
