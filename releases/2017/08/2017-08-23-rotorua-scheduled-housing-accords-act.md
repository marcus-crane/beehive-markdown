The Rotorua Lakes district has been added to Schedule 1 of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas (HASHAA) Act 2013, Building and Construction Minister Dr Nick Smith says.

“There is a real will from the Rotorua Lakes Council and the Government to develop a Housing Accord to address increased pressures on the local housing market. The first step to achieving this is adding Rotorua to the HASHAA Schedule.”

Cabinet on Monday approved the move and the decision has been formally gazetted today.

“This scheduling recognises the growth pressures on Rotorua. The local economy is doing well and the population is growing at a faster rate than in decades but this is putting pressure on housing prices and availability. The advantage of a Housing Accord is that it gets the Council and the Government working together on freeing up more land, growing supply and co-ordinating support for people in housing need.

“Housing Accords have proved successful in increasing supply in places like Selwyn, Auckland, Nelson and Tauranga. They have sped up consenting for new housing developments, supported new social housing initiatives, assisted councils with infrastructure costs and facilitated joint Council-Government housing developments.

"The next step for Rotorua is negotiating a Housing Accord. The Government and Council officials are well advanced in this work. It is my ambition to conclude a Housing Accord with the Rotorua Council prior to the election.”
