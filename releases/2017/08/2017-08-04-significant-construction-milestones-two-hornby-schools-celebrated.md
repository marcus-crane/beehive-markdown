Associate Education Minister Tim Macindoe has today welcomed the commencement of the $26 million redevelopment of Hornby High School and the completion of a $3.5 million project at Hornby Primary School.

Mr Macindoe visited both schools today respectively to turn the first sod and plant a tree to mark the completion.

“The $26 million redevelopment of Hornby High School is a significant undertaking with 90 per cent of the existing school buildings being demolished and replaced with modern facilities,” says Mr Macindoe.

The redevelopment will include:

- 45 new teaching spaces
- a new administration area
- a new gym
- a new site for technology provision, as well as refurbishment of the existing auditorium and music suites
- extensive landscaping
- an integrated whare within the central courtyard.

Construction at Hornby High School is due for completion in mid-2019.

“Just down the road, Hornby Primary School now has a new administration building with an integrated library facility, staff room and a new hall. Landscaping at the school will take place over the next three months,” says Mr Macindoe.

“Hornby Primary School has an impressive track record in providing inclusive and positive learning opportunities for its pupils I know the school and contractors have worked hard to phase the project to minimise disruption to learning.”

This school is also in the process of receiving two teaching blocks, which are to be relocated from Hornby High School. These will be available to Hornby Primary School in 2019. 

“Hornby High and Hornby Primary Schools are part of the $1.137 billion Christchurch Schools Rebuild (CSR) programme, which will rebuild or renew 115 schools by 2022. In total 85 of the 115 projects in the CSR programme have either been finished, or are underway, and we are on track to have all projects completed on time,” says Mr Macindoe.

“This investment in Hornby schools forms part of the government’s unprecedented $5 million investment in school infrastructure since 2008.”
