New Zealand’s inaugural Motorcycle Awareness month, which begins today, is an opportunity to increase awareness around the risks for motorcyclists on our roads, ACC Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

“Motorcycle safety is one of the four priorities of the Government’s Safer Journeys Action Plan 2016 -2020,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Over the past decade, motorcycle travel has increased by 60 per cent, which is why we are committed to raising awareness through Motorcycle Awareness month.

“Motorcyclists should use this month to think about how they can sharpen their skills to not only lower their risk of harm, but also to ensure they make the most on their time of the bike.

 “Last year, sadly 52 people lost their lives in motorcycle accidents. Motorcycle Awareness month will play an important role in helping to reduce that number by bringing safety to the forefront of all road users’ minds.”

As part of Motorcycle Awareness month, ACC will be running a number of initiatives to help motorcyclists stay safe and improve their ride. These include:

- A Get Ride Ready campaign in conjunction with local councils which guides riders through actions to enable them to make the most of summer riding.

- ACC’s motorcycle safety programme Ride Forever is sponsoring this year’s Motorcycle Show in Auckland over September 16 -17.

- The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council’s Ride and Decide summit programme. This incorporates a number of events bringing together motorcyclists and road safety agencies to share insights and knowledge. This will result in a joint commitment to improve the safety of motorcyclists.
