Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has announced government funding for Masterton’s Shear History Trust.

“The Trust has developed a museum dedicated to the national story of sheep and shearing and this almost $23,000 will complete the final electrical fit-out stage of its new building at the Woolshed heritage centre in Masterton,” Ms Barry says.

“Its new building will enable the museum to better care for its valuable collection of exhibits telling the interesting stories of New Zealand’s shearing industry and rural life.”

“This is a small museum, run by dedicated volunteers, and it attracts about 8000 visitors a year. I am pleased the electrical fit-out will see further exhibition space developed.”

“The Woolshed heritage centre is also an active supporter of the annual Golden Shears Competition and this grant recognises the positive regional impact the close association provides,” Ms Barry says.

The funding is the sixth and final allocation from round two of the 2017 Regional Culture and Heritage Fund (RCHF).

“I established $29.5m fund in 2016 for capital projects benefitting regional arts, culture and heritage institutions,” Ms Barry says.

“They make an important contribution to the national economy by helping communities to attract the economic and social benefits of new visitors, businesses and residents to New Zealand’s smaller towns and cities.”
