New Zealand is providing $6.5 million over five years to help Cambodia develop a more sustainable horticulture industry, Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee announced today.

“As in New Zealand, horticulture is essential to the Cambodian economy,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Cambodia Quality Horticulture Initiative will help Cambodian farmers increase their incomes by diversifying into more sustainable crops and improve production and food safety.”

As part of the initiative, New Zealand Crown Research Institute Plant & Food Research will provide Cambodia with science and innovation expertise to support the sustainable production and distribution of produce to markets.

“The initiative will work closely with local partners that are supporting and sourcing produce from smallholder farmers.

“New Zealand has significant experience developing profitable horticulture supply chains, world-class food safety standards and robust quality assurance measures.

“We are pleased to be able to share this expertise with Cambodia and help its horticulture sector reach its full market potential,” Mr Brownlee says.

New Zealand and Cambodia will soon sign a Partnership Arrangement in Phnom Penh to launch the initiative. 

The initiative is part of the ASEAN-New Zealand Strategic Partnership and Plan of Action 2016-2020, which supports agricultural industry training as well as food safety and standards.

The New Zealand and Cambodian governments have a long-standing development cooperation partnership in areas including agriculture, tourism, and scholarships.
