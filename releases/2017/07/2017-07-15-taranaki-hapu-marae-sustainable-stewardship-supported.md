Taranaki-based Te Whenua Tōmuri Trust Board has been granted over $130,000 from the Community Environment Fund towards its ‘Maru Wai Matara – Kaitiaki Taiao’ project, Associate Environment Minister Scott Simpson announced today.

“The Trust will provide 12 hapū and marae with resourcing, training and mentoring in environmental monitoring and sustainable management. The hapū and marae will be matched with 12 local kura kaupapa and schools to help collect seasonal monitoring data and undertake activities such as riverside planting,” Mr Simpson says.

“The project will also help groups learn about sustainable practices such as permaculture and waste minimisation. They will develop māra kai using traditional practices, with the goal of reconnecting them to their environment through these activities.”

The Te Whenua Tōmuri Trust Board, formed in 2013, is committed to sustainable community development and well-being in Taranaki and beyond. It aims to inspire and protect communities and their natural environment through sustainable techniques.

The Community Environment Fund provides funding so New Zealanders are empowered to take environmental action. The Fund supports projects that strengthen partnerships, raise public awareness of environmental issues, and encourage community participation in environmental initiatives. Since 2010 the fund has awarded more than $12 million to environmental projects.
