More social housing is on its way across Greater Christchurch as the Government invests more for those in need, Social Housing and Housing New Zealand Minister Amy Adams has announced.

“In addition to the 163 houses we built over the last eight months, the Government is investing another $46.3 million into 145 new social houses in Greater Christchurch. It brings our total to $98.3 million for 308 new social houses for those in need,” Ms Adams says.

“Housing New Zealand has helped transform Greater Christchurch through its $350 million Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Programme, which built and repaired 5700 houses. We’ve also just completed 163 new social houses across the region, which are now being tenanted and helping people in need.

“Construction is underway on the next phase of building another 145 houses which will continue to modernise our social housing stock throughout the region.

“The new homes will be a mixture of smaller, one-bedroom homes for single people and couples without children, and homes for larger families – exactly the kinds of social housing needed to meet the demand for social housing.”

There are 25 developments across Greater Christchurch, including:

- 272-276 Worcester St, Christchurch Central, where 30 one-bedroom apartments are being built

<!--THE END-->

- High and White St, Rangiora, where 28 one-bedroom homes will be built in the most significant housing development in the North Canterbury township since the earthquakes

<!--THE END-->

- 352 Barbadoes St, Central Christchurch, where a three-level 18-unit complex will be built close to the heart of the city

<!--THE END-->

- 23-37 Eveleyn Couzins Pl, Richmond, where 14 new homes will be built

<!--THE END-->

- 1 Puna St, Riccarton, where four units will be built in the place of one old house.

“Activity will ramp up over quickly, with the first new homes to be ready in the coming months,” Ms Adams says.

“The Worcester St site I visited today is the largest single development undertaken by Housing New Zealand in Christchurch in recent years. When completed next year, 30 new one-bedroom homes will significantly help to meet growing demand for one-bedroom places.

“This is a significant development for the local community. This development and many others planned across greater Christchurch will mean more housing for our vulnerable people.

“This is all part of the Government’s investment into more social housing for vulnerable New Zealanders, and a continuation of the significant investment placed into greater Christchurch.”
