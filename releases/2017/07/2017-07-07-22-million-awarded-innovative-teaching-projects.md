The latest projects are being funded in the third round of the $18 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund (TLIF), which for the first time has been opened to teachers from early learning services to directly apply for funding.

“TLIF is about enabling our teachers from early learning through to secondary to try something new, something different and innovative to inspire children and young people in their learning.

“It’s also about ensuring that our teaching and learning practices are modern, relevant and future focused, taking the best from new methods being tried internationally alongside testing new Kiwi ideas.

“Teachers right across New Zealand are making the most of the new opportunities that digital technology and the opening up of traditional classroom spaces through modern learning environments allow, to engage children in learning in totally new ways.”

TLIF is focused on supporting projects that engage students who are Māori, Pasifika, have special education needs, or come from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

Round three involves teachers from 35 schools, 10 early childhood education services me nga kōhanga reo, and 19 Communities of Learning | Kahui Ako.

During a visit to the early childhood education centre A’oga Fa’a Samoa Incorporated in Auckland, Ms Kaye highlighted the use of digital technology in round three.

“I’m delighted that several of the projects are using digital technology to improve practices in teaching and learning” says Ms Kaye.

“Teachers are tapping into the technologies that children and young people use in their daily lives to make learning relevant and exciting.

“Here at A’oga Fa’a Samoa the teachers are going to be using digital technologies to support second language learning. Another TLIF project in will use the principles of gamification to engage students.

“Alongside using new technologies the projects in round three also have a strong focus on improving the transition for students both starting school and moving between years. For example, a project in Nelson will test an international programme for new entrants with high, social, emotional and behavioural needs.”

Other projects include:

- Using student profiles in the middle years to support improving student engagement and achievement, parent and whanau understanding and changing teacher practices.
- Teachers working collaboratively with students and whanau to redesign curriculum, building on students’ identity, cultures and languages to lift achievement.
- Using student-directed learning in science, technology engineering and maths to support boys’ writing.

“Six new projects will be led by early childhood education providers”, says Ms Kaye.

“Promoting innovation and excellence in early childhood teaching is critical, given the clear link between high quality early learning and positive education outcomes in later life.”

“All of these new and exciting teacher-led innovation projects are part of our commitment to make excellent teaching common practice in every school and service in New Zealand.”

TLIF is part of the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative to increase collaboration among teachers and schools to raise achievement for students. Today’s announcement adds to the 85 projects that have already been funded through TLIF.

The next funding round opens in November 2017.
