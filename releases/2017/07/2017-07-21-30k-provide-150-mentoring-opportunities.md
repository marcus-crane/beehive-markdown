Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $30,000 of funding towards mentoring initiatives aimed at encouraging young people to explore potential career paths, develop career-related skills and transition to successful tertiary education.

“Mentoring from a trusted advisor and confidant, who can share experiences and knowledge, can be hugely beneficial for young people to help put them on a path to success,” says Ms Kaye.

“The funding I’ve announced today will support two separate mentoring initiatives run by the Taranaki Futures Trust and Foundation First.

“The Taranaki Futures Trust works in partnership with local businesses and employers to support young people with internship experiences. The Trust will receive $15,000 to enable 100 local young people to participate in their Accelerator programme.

“This seven-week programme offers opportunities for participants to experience a range of career options, and get support from mentors to develop job-based skills that will help set them up for future success.

“First Foundation is an educational trust assisting young people who have overcome challenges or adversity to achieve academically and positively influence their communities.

“The Foundation will receive $15,000 to enable 50 young people from around New Zealand to participate in their Foundation Steps programme.

“This programme enables participants from disadvantaged backgrounds to receive support from mentors over a two-year period, with the aim of building a pathway to successful tertiary level study.”

“These investments are part of a broader suite of initiatives aimed at growing youth development opportunities in New Zealand. Over the 2017/2018 year, we want to deliver 70,000 new opportunities across the country.

“As part of my job I get to meet so many talented young people. I want more of our young people to get the chance to take part in experiences which help them realise their potential, and turn their life around or propel it in a whole new direction.”
