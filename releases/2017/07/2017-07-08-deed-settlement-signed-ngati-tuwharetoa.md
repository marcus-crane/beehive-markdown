The Crown has signed a Deed of Settlement with Ngāti Tūwharetoa at Waitetoko Marae, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Past actions and omissions by the Crown debilitated the social, economic and cultural structures of Ngāti Tūwharetoa,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today marks the beginning of a new relationship between Ngāti Tūwharetoa and the Crown.”

The settlement provides Crown acknowledgements, an apology and redress for the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Ngāti Tūwharetoa will receive financial and commercial redress of $25 million. Cultural redress includes cultural funds totalling $3,950,000 as well as the transfer of 32 properties of cultural significance to the iwi.

Ngāti Tūwharetoa’s historical grievances against the Crown include the prejudicial impacts of native land laws, the breach of obligations relating to Tongariro Maunga and environmental degradation that occurred following the construction of the Tongariro hydro-electric power generation scheme.

“We can never fully compensate Ngāti Tūwharetoa for the wrongs of the past but today’s settlement contributes to a stronger economic and culture future for the iwi.

“This is the 84th deed of settlement signed by the Crown and an important step towards completing Treaty settlements in the Central North Island and throughout New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Deed of Settlement is available online at [www.govt.nz/treaty-settlement-documents/ngati-tuwharetoa/](http://www.govt.nz/treaty-settlement-documents/ngati-tuwharetoa/).

**Notes for editors:**

With a population of approximately 36,000 people, Ngāti Tūwharetoa is the fifth largest iwi in New Zealand. Its area of interest covers most of the Central North Island region and is centred on Lake Taupō (Taupōmoana) and the Central Plateau.

Ngāti Tūwharetoa received a share of Crown Forest Land in the Central North Island valued at $203 million as part of the 2008 Central North Island Forests Iwi Collective settlement.

Within the next year, the Crown will begin cultural redress negotiations over Tongariro National Park with Ngāti Tūwharetoa and other iwi and hapū with interests in the park.
