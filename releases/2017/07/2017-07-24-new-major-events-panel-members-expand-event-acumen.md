Newly appointed members to the Major Events Investment Panel will widen its breadth of knowledge, particularly in business and events, Economic Development Minister Simon Bridges has announced.  

Three new members have been appointed - Barry Maister, a current New Zealand representative on the International Olympic Committee, Sue Paterson, former Executive Director of the New Zealand Festival and Tim Cossar, Chief Executive of Te Puia, NZ Maori Arts and Crafts Institute in Rotorua.

Sir Brian Roche has been reappointed as Chair and Dame Therese Walsh as a member.

“The Major Events Development Fund is a contestable fund in which government invests in events that generate significant immediate and long-term benefits, and align with leverage and legacy opportunities,” Mr Bridges says.

“The new members were appointed after Cabinet agreed last year to changes to the panel’s structure. The changes will increase the commercial acumen of the panel, put more focus on prospecting for major events and enable the panel to respond effectively to the events sector.”

The panel reports to the Major Events Ministers Group and recommends how to invest the $10 million per annum fund.

The panel also advises the Ministers Group on securing significant international events and growing the international reputation of significant New Zealand owned events.
