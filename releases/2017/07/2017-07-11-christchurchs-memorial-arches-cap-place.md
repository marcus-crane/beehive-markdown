The final piece of Christchurch’s architecturally designed ‘gateway arches’ is in place, signalling how close another of the city’s multi-million dollar roading projects is to completion, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

The arches and a major interchange are being constructed at the intersection of Russley Road and Memorial Avenue, near Christchurch Airport, as part of the $112 million State Highway 1 Russley Road Upgrade.

Mr Bridges says the top piece of the arches was put in place this morning with the help of a 180 tonne crane.

“The top piece (or arch cap) weighs in at 13.5 tonnes and connects the gateway arches, which now stand 27 metres above Memorial Avenue,” Mr Bridges says.

“The structure is set to become a powerful symbol for Christchurch.  It will leave a lasting impression on locals and travellers alike and it is exciting to see it in place.

“What is even more exciting is just how close the Russley Road Upgrade is to completion.

“This milestone will allow the project to complete the remainder of the interchange below the structure. By mid-August traffic will be able to travel under the new interchange and by early 2018 the whole project will be complete – months ahead of schedule.”

Mr Bridges says the Government is investing $3.2 billion into transport in the Canterbury region in the current three year National Land Transport Programme.

“The investment is focused on the November 2016 Kaikoura earthquake recovery, completing the Christchurch earthquake recovery work and continuing the Christchurch Roads of National Significance (RoNS) projects, such as the Russley Road Upgrade,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Christchurch RoNS will open up the Canterbury region and support economic development and growth. As well as making a real difference to the lives of road users by improving safety and travel times.”
