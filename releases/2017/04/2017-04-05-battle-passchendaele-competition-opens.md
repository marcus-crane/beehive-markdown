Veterans’ Affairs Minister David Bennett has launched the 2017 Battle of Passchendaele multi-media competition.

On 12 October 1917 at the World War One Battle of Passchendaele, 845 New Zealanders died, more than any other day in history. A further 2,700 were wounded.

The annual competition, open to all Year 13 students, asks students to explore what that significant day means to them though the medium of their choice.

“It is one of the bleakest days in our history and it’s important we continue to reflect on the sacrifice made in the fields of Belgium 100 years ago,” Mr Bennett says

“One way to continue the legacy is through today’s youth. I look forward to seeing students sharing their stories and experiences of remembering New Zealand’s service in war and conflict.”

The winning Year 13 student will receive a $2,000 education contribution and, along with the runner up, will travel to Belgium to attend the Battle of Passchendaele centenary commemorations in October 2017.

This year there is also a special Year 12 ‘speech writing’ category marking the centenary of Passchendaele. The winner of the Year 12 category will represent New Zealand Youth, and read their winning entry at the national commemorative ceremony at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington.

Entries close Friday 12 May 2017.
