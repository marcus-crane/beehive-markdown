Months of hard work has put Government in a good position to house those most in need in Auckland during a busy period says Associate Social Housing Minister Alfred Ngaro.

“Over the last few months I’ve been getting out and about and visiting those on the ground,” says Mr Ngaro.

“I’ve been consistently impressed with the speed and commitment of both providers and public servants. Dedication which has meant that on a couple of occasions I’ve even had meetings cancelled so they can concentrate all their efforts on delivering housing for our most vulnerable kiwi families.

“In the buildup to the World Masters Games we’ve seen a lot of concern that more people would find themselves with nowhere to stay.

“It’s true that the Games create a pinch point but proactive work means 281 families have already secured housing for the period of the games and we’ve got further options being worked through for others who might find themselves with nowhere to stay.

“These are in addition to the transitional housing places we’ve already got people living in.

“It’s a sign of how much effort goes on every day to support vulnerable kiwis that we’ve been able to support so many Aucklanders.

“Solutions will be found for anyone who finds themselves with nowhere to stay but in this pinch point period I’d strongly encourage anyone planning on coming to the area to make sure they’ve got somewhere to stay already lined up.”

Last year, the Government provided $354 million in new funding for transitional housing – the first time the sector has received ongoing, direct funding from the Government. This will support 8600 kiwis and their families every year.

“It’s really satisfying to see how Government funding and efforts are helping people in need.”
