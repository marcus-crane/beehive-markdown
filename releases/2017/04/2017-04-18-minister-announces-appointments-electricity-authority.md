Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins has today announced the appointment of two new members to the Electricity Authority.

The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity established in November 2010. 

It is responsible for governance and regulation of the electricity market and its objective is to promote competition, reliable supply, and the efficient operation of the electricity sector for the long term benefit of consumers.

Allan Dawson and Sandra Gamble have been appointed for terms of five years each commencing 18 April.

“Both Allan and Sandra have held director, chair and executive positions and will be excellent additions to the Electricity Authority.

“Allan brings extensive knowledge of the New Zealand electricity market as well as understanding of the global energy environment and its impact here. Sandra brings significant experience of working within the energy and water sectors and has insight into the critical issues facing the New Zealand industry.”

Ms Collins says the Authority will benefit from having its vacant board position filled, with its substantial work programme progressing steadily. 

There will now be six members of the Authority, with the others being Dr Brent Layton (Chair), David Bull, Susan Paterson and Hon Roger Sowry.
