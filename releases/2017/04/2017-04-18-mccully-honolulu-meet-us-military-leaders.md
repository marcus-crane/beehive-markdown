Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Hawaii today to meet with senior figures in the United States Pacific Command. Mr McCully will also meet with members of Hawaii’s political leadership, senior academics and opinion makers.

“The US Pacific Command is responsible for US military operations in over half the world’s surface,” Mr McCully says.

“Honolulu is a pivotal channel for New Zealand’s views on Asia-Pacific into Washington, D.C. and my visit is an opportunity to emphasise the value of New Zealand-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific.”

Mr McCully will also inaugurate the New Zealand Consulate-General in Honolulu, which was opened in 2014.

“New Zealand’s presence in Honolulu has deepened our connections with US military leaders and is a gateway for our engagement with North Pacific countries.”

Other areas of cooperation with the US in Honolulu include climate change, fisheries, humanitarian aid and disaster risk management.
