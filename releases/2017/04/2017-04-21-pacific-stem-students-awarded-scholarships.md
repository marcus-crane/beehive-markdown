Nine of New Zealand’s brightest and most inspiring young Pacific students have just received Government scholarships to pursue their dreams says Pacific Peoples Minister Alfred Ngaro.

This is the second year that the Toloa Tertiary Scholarships have been available.

The scholarships of up to $25,000 each are paid over three years and awarded to Pacific students studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects at a tertiary level.

“There were 53 applicants for the scholarships this year and I know that the selection panel had a really tough time narrowing it down to this select group,” says Mr Ngaro.

“These really are our best and brightest. These are students who are not only stepping up to embrace the opportunities available to them in one of New Zealand’s fastest growing sectors but also showing leadership in their communities.

“One of our students is a science mentor in South Auckland primary schools, another volunteers his time at an afterschool homework centre for Tongan youth. We’ve even got one student who has taken the things she’s learned through her study and has built three reef monitoring structures to monitor coral ecosytems in her village of Saoluafata (in Samoa).

“I’m so pleased that these scholarships are encouraging our young people to consider a career in STEM”.
