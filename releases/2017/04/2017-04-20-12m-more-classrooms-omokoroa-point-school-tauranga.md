Around $1.2 million will be invested to build three additional classrooms at Omokoroa Point School in Tauranga, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“Tauranga is one of New Zealand’s fastest growing locations, and we’re committed to providing extra capacity there to meet growing school rolls,” says Ms Kaye.

“Omokoroa Point School is situated in a fabulous part of the country, overlooking Tauranga Harbour, Matakana Island and the Kaimai Ranges.

“Nearby residential subdivisions and a recently announced Special Housing Area will have a significant impact on the school’s roll, and we’re acting now to accommodate this expected growth.

“I’d like to acknowledge local MP Todd Muller, who is a passionate advocate for the fast-growing Omokoroa community and the importance of ensuring that the local school network can accommodate the new families moving into the area.”

A feasibility study is currently underway to establish the best site for the new classrooms.

“If the site is suitable, the new classrooms may be modular buildings,” says Ms Kaye.

“Modular classrooms meet standards of modern, permanent structures but have the advantage of being very adaptable.”

Today’s announcement builds on other recent projects approved to help grow the Tauranga school network.

“Last month, Minister Parata signed an establishment notice for a new school at Pyes Pa, an $18 million project that will accommodate a roll of 650 students,” says Ms Kaye.

“Over the past 12 months, new classrooms have also been approved for Oropi School, Welcome Bay School, Maungatapu School and Matua Primary School.”

“This is about ensuring that students learn in high quality facilities, and families have access to local schools.

“Schools are a vital part of the community and where communities are showing sustained, long-term growth, we’ll make sure the local school network can support that growth.”

The $1.2 million announced today is part of the greatest spend ever on school infrastructure by a New Zealand government, which so far has seen over $5 billion committed for new and upgraded schools and classrooms since 2008.
