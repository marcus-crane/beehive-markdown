Volunteering is one of the best ways we can honour the ANZAC spirt, says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Alfred Ngaro.

‘Serve for New Zealand’, an initiative run by Christchurch’s Student Volunteer Army (SVA), in partnership with the RSA and the University of Canterbury, invites New Zealanders to pledge an hour or more of their time to give back to the community.

“Anzac Day gives us all an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifice and service our veterans and those currently serving in our armed forces have made to New Zealand,” says Mr Ngaro.

“One way we can honour that service is by giving back to our communities.

“Whether it’s spending some time with residents at a local resthome, helping a neighbour or taking part in a community project, even the smallest of gestures can make a big difference in someone’s life.

“Kiwis are an incredibly generous bunch, every year our volunteers contribute about $3.5 billion in labour. That’s a huge number and it’s something we should all encourage more of.”

To pledge to Serve for New Zealand on Anzac Day, people can register online at [www.servefor.nz](http://www.servefor.nz/).
