The Crown has signed a Deed of Settlement with Ngāti Tamaoho at Mangatangi Marae settling its historical Treaty claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Crown actions and omissions left Ngāti Tamaoho virtually landless by 1900 and resulted in socio-economic depravation, the effects of which can still be seen today,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today’s settlement provides an acknowledgement, apology and redress for the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.”

Commercial and financial redress totalling $10.3 million includes the transfer of and opportunity to purchase specified Crown property. Ngāti Tamaoho will also receive a cultural revitalisation fund of $590,000 as part of its cultural redress.

“We can never fully compensate Ngāti Tamaoho for the wrongs of the past. But this settlement marks the beginning of a new relationship between Ngāti Tamaoho and the Crown and provides the foundation for a stronger social, cultural and economic future for the iwi.

“Signing this Deed of Settlement is an important step towards settling historical grievances in the Tāmaki Makaurau region and New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said.

Ngāti Tamaoho is a member of the Tāmaki Collective. The iwi’s area of interest area spans from the Manukau Harbour to Franklin District, the Hūnua Ranges, Awhitū peninsula, the Waikato wetlands, Tīkapa Moana (Firth of Thames) and north to central Auckland including Remuera and Ellerslie.
