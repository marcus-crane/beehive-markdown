Around $500,000 will be invested to build two new teaching spaces at Witherlea School in Blenheim, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The roll at Witherlea School has been growing and this is expected to continue, so today’s investment will help the school accommodate this growth,” says Ms Kaye.

“We’re committed to providing extra capacity at schools in areas where there’s sustained population growth.

“In Blenheim, a new residential development in the south of the town and the fast-tracking of a local, long-term housing plan will contribute to the expected growth.

“The new teaching spaces at Witherlea School will be housed in a two-story building, which will be positioned to avoid any impact on outdoor recreational areas.

“The investment announced today follows on from around $2.5 million announced last year for property projects in Blenheim and Nelson.

“Whitney Street School in Blenheim is on-track to receive two extra classrooms, and a total of six additional classrooms will be built at Motueka High School and Birchwood and Stoke Schools in Nelson.

“A school’s physical environment plays a key role in supporting students to achieve their potential, which is why we’re upgrading and expanding schools across New Zealand.

“Since 2008, we’ve committed over $5 billion for school infrastructure projects, significantly more than any previous government.”

Witherlea School is part of one of the largest Community of Learning/Kahui Ako groups in the country, comprising 21 schools and the Marlborough Kindergarten Association all working together.

Communities of Learning are about increasing student achievement, through early education services, schools and tertiary providers working together to share expertise and lift the quality of teaching and learning.
