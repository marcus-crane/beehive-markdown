Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Ha Noi today to meet Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh and President Tran Dai Quang.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Viet Nam has grown markedly in recent years. Bilateral trade, political engagement and people-to-people connections are all strengthening,” Mr McCully says.

“Two-way goods trade has increased by 150% since 2009, and is now worth NZ$1.15 billion annually. The launch of Air New Zealand’s seasonal direct air service last year has seen a healthy upsurge in Vietnamese visitor and student numbers.

"Viet Nam is also a key player in ASEAN, so this visit will be a valuable opportunity to discuss developments across the Asia-Pacific region.”
