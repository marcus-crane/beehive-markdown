Associate Transport Minister David Bennett is encouraging all motorists to stay safe when travelling over Easter.

“Many of us are travelling to be with friends and family this long weekend. With the increased traffic and Cyclone Cook hitting, everyone needs to take all the steps to stay safe,” Mr Bennett says.

“Four people lost their lives on our roads over Easter last year, and their families are facing another holiday without their loved ones.

“The number of crashes on our roads is much too high, and the deaths are often avoidable. Last year, nearly 100 people died in crashes where they were not wearing a seatbelt.

“It’s these sorts of simple actions that can quite literally save your life,” Mr Bennett says.

“The Government commits significant effort and investment into making our roads safer to travel, but at the end of the day we also need people to abide by the laws that are there for their safety.”

“So don’t be an egg this Easter – we can all make our roads a safer place if we travel at a safe and appropriate speed for the conditions, avoid driving when we’re tired and make sure we don’t drive impaired by alcohol,” Mr Bennett says.

“Let’s all take responsibility for ensuring we, and those travelling with us, are buckled up,” Mr Bennett says.
