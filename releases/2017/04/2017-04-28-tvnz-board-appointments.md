Communications Minister Simon Bridges today announced a number of appointments to the Television New Zealand Ltd (TVNZ) board.

Dame Therese Walsh has been appointed as the new Chair. Dame Therese has been Deputy Chair since 2015 and a Director since 2012. She replaces outgoing Chair Joan Withers who has served on the TVNZ Board since 2009. 

“Dame Therese is a highly experienced professional director who sits on a number of public companies including ASB Bank, Air New Zealand and NZX.  Dame Therese will bring continuity and strong commercial judgement to the role,” Mr Bridges says.

Andy Coupe has been appointed to the Board as Deputy Chair. 

“Mr Coupe is currently Chair of Solid Energy and sits on a number of private and public companies. He will bring a wealth of commercial and financial expertise to the Board as well as significant governance experience,” Mr Bridges says.

Julia Raue, the previous Chief Information Officer of Air New Zealand and now professional director, has been reappointed as a Director for a further term.

Cameron Harland, Chief Executive of Park Road Post Production and Camperdown Properties, is to be appointed as a Director. He has recently completed a six year term on the Film Commission and is currently a director of Weta Workshop, Phoenix Football Club and the Chair of the NZ Story Advisory Board. 

“Mr Harland’s extensive commercial and creative industry experience will be of benefit to TVNZ,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Harland will replace Barrie Saunders who is retiring.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Barrie Saunders, and in particular Joan Withers, for their service to the TVNZ Board. Joan’s deep industry knowledge alongside her substantial governance expertise has been significant to TVNZ’s success”, Mr Bridges says.
