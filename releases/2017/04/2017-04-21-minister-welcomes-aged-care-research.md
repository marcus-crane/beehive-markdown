Associate Health Minister Nicky Wagner is welcoming new research about the care and support needs of older Maori.

In 2013, the Government invested $1.8 million in [Life and Living in Advanced Age: a Cohort Study in New Zealand — Te Puāwaitanga O Ngā Tapuwae Kia Ora Tonu (LiLACS NZ)](https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/faculty/lilacs.html) by the University of Auckland.

LiLACS NZ, the world’s first longitudinal study of an indigenous population in advanced age, is made up of a series of reports comparing Maori health needs with those of older non-Maori.

The report released today — Intervals of Care Need: Need for Care and Support in Advanced Age — includes five key findings about the care needs of older New Zealanders over the next decade.

“We know our ageing population will have a significant impact on models of care so research like this serves as an important guide for the future,” Ms Wagner says.

“It helps inform the development of local and national aged care policies and provides all New Zealanders with an opportunity to better prepare for their own health and well-being in later life.

“Last December, the Government released its Healthy Ageing Strategy, which recognises the higher care needs of some older Maori and makes commitments to reducing health inequities.

“This Government is committed to improving health and social outcomes for all older New Zealanders.”
