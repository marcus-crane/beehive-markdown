Justice Minister Amy Adams leaves for Turkey today as New Zealand’s official representative at the 102nd ANZAC Day commemorations at Gallipoli.

“The Gallipoli campaign has become a defining event in New Zealand's history. It will be my privilege to share the occasion with the hundreds of New Zealanders who have travelled across the globe to attend,” Ms Adams says.

“Gallipoli was New Zealand’s first major role in the First World War. 102 years on from the first landing, Anzac Day remains an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifice of the 2779 New Zealand killed and the 4852 wounded there.

“It’s also a time to honour all those who served in the First World War, and the other wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations for New Zealand.”

Ms Adams will attend a number of commemorative services on the Gallipoli Peninsula, including the Dawn Service and the New Zealand Service at Chunuk Bair.

“As demonstrated by the recent unveiling of the Turkish Memorial at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, Anzac Day has profound historical significance not only for New Zealanders and Australians, but also for the people of Turkey.

“Year after year, our hosts accommodate the many Australians and New Zealanders who come to see and experience what has become a special place in our countries’ shared history.”
