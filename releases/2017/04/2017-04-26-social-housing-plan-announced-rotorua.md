Associate Social Housing Minister Alfred Ngaro has confirmed plans for 117 more social and transitional houses in Rotorua.

"We’re aiming to have 37 transitional houses available by the end of the year and 80 new social housing properties over the next three years,” Mr Ngaro says.

“The properties will likely be a mixture of new builds and existing properties and we’re encouraging community housing providers to partner with the Ministry of Social Development to help us reach this ambitious goal.”

“This is a statement of intent that we take the issue of housing in Rotorua seriously and that we have a plan to address the need. We are working hard to address the current and future demands on social housing.”

Mr Ngaro inspected some of the 37 new transitional homes in a visit to the area with local MP Todd McClay today. 

“These new properties will be a welcome addition to Rotorua’s social infrastructure and the plan for 80 new social housing places represents an almost 13 per cent increase on the number we currently have,” says Mr Ngaro.

This year, the Government will spend $2.3 billion to support more than 310,000 kiwi households with their housing costs.
