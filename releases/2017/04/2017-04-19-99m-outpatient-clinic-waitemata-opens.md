Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened Waitemata DHB’s new $9.9 million outpatient clinic at North Shore Hospital.

“The new fit-for-purpose $9.9 million outpatient facility at North Shore Hospital will provide enough capacity to support future service growth over the coming years,” says Dr Coleman.

“The outpatient clinic, Kahui Manaaki, translates to ‘cluster of kindness’, which reflects key services being brought together which will help ensure patients receive better quality of care.

“The new clinic brings together specialist clinics, lab and oxygen therapy services, as well as 16 consulting rooms, and three teaching rooms.

“There is also a strong emphasis on training, research and innovation, with the clinic also bringing key academic partners together from the University of Auckland Medical School and Auckland University of Technology.

This will open up better teaching opportunities for students and staff. In particular for the DHB’s internationally recognised haematology clinicians to continue and expand their research.

“The new facility will enable North Shore Hospital to provide faster, high quality integrated care for patients.”

Waitemata is the largest and fastest growing DHB in New Zealand, currently there are 598,000 residents in the area with this set to grow by 90,000 people by 2025.

This is supported by an extra $51 million in new money this year, taking the DHB’s total funding to $1.5 billion for 2016/17. Over the last eight years the DHB has received an extra $409 million in funding.
