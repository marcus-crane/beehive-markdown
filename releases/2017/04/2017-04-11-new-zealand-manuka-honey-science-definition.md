Food Safety Minister David Bennett has welcomed the Ministry for Primary Industries’ release of a proposed scientific definition for mānuka honey produced in New Zealand.

“Overseas regulators and consumers have expressed a desire for an independent, Government-backed definition to safeguard the authenticity of mānuka honey products.

“This Government-backed definition will provide an important starting point for the industry to promote New Zealand mānuka honey in world markets,” Mr Bennett says.

MPI scientists have been working on a robust, peer-reviewed definition for three years and have put both the definition and the general requirements for export out for consultation.

“We encourage industry and producers to engage with this consultation process,” Mr Bennett says.
