Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced three appointments to the Board of Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu (Te Kura).

“Te Kura is a fantastic option for distance education, providing personalised learning programmes to students from early childhood to Year 13.

“I am delighted to see Dr Stuart Middleton staying on for a further term, and would like to welcome the newly appointed Ruma Karaitiana and Mele Wendt as members of Te Kura’s Board for terms of three years,” Ms Parata says. 

Dr Middleton and Mr Karaitiana’s appointments are effective immediately.  Ms Wendt will take up the role from 1 July following the resignation of Paul Adams.

“These appointments are a great result for Te Kura. Dr Middleton has performed well in his role, and his experience in South Auckland communities and the Pacific are highly respected.  The perspectives Mr Karaitiana and Ms Wendt will bring from Māori and Pasifika communities, as well as their experience within the education sector adds further valuable expertise to the Board.

“I would also like to thank the outgoing Paul Adams for his immense contribution to the financial and business strength of Te Kura over the past five years, and his commitment to seeing young people succeed.”
