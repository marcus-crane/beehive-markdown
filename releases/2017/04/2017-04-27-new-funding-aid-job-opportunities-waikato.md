Māori Development Minister Te Uruora Flavell has announced a funding partnership between Te Puni Kōkiri and Waikato-Tainui to support employment opportunities in Waikato.

“Māori unemployment statistics continue to be higher than other population groups.  Partnering with Waikato-Tainui to address and arrest this trend is how we make the most of our collective resource.

“This funding will have a direct impact on employment opportunities and outcomes for up to 90 Waikato-Tainui tribal members,” says Mr Flavell.

The funding announcement was made today in Hamilton at the Waikato-Tainui Careers Centre, an employment initiative set up by the tribe to support members into meaningful and sustainable job opportunities.

The Earn While You Learn programme has been part of the Career Centre’s suite of services since it opened in August 2016, and the concept has received considerable interest from other organisations.

The $100,000 of pilot funding provided by Te Puni Kōkiri will help extend its reach to other interested iwi and providers. Another $150,000 over two years will support a similar programme in Manukau.

“The programme enhances employment opportunities and pathways for Māori by brokering and delivering recruitment and placement services, providing pastoral care services and building meaningful and sustainable relationships with local iwi, tertiary providers, industry partners and social service agencies,” says Mr Flavell.
