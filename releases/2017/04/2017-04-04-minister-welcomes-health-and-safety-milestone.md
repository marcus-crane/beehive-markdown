Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse says it’s pleasing to see the responsible and measured way businesses are responding to the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.

“Today marks the one year anniversary since the biggest reform of health and safety legislation in more than 20 years and there are positive signs that both attitudes and behaviours towards health and safety are beginning to shift,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“While the reforms, of which the Health and Safety at Work Act was one part of, are still being bedded in, we are on track to meet the Government’s target of a 25 percent reduction in workplace deaths and injuries by 2020.

“Businesses and employers are more engaged with health and safety and understand that sound health and safety practices are good for business and make for a more productive workforce.

“It’s also encouraging to hear that businesses are having increasingly positive interactions with WorkSafe a year after the Act came into force.

“The WorkSafe Service Excellence Survey shows that 3 out of 4 surveyed have made changes to workplace practices after interactions with WorkSafe, and 2 out of 3 have also used WorkSafe’s health and safety guidance.

“It’s great to see businesses working collaboratively with WorkSafe to improve their health and safety practices.

“A year down the track health and safety continues to be front of mind in the workplace, and while we are starting to see a culture change in people’s approach towards health and safety, the journey is far from over.

“We must continue to focus on health and safety as a number one business priority, so that everyone who goes to work returns home at the end of the day healthy and safe.”
