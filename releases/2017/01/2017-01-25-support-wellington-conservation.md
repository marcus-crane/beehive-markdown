Volunteer work to protect the Wellington region’s special places from weeds, pests and predators will receive a valuable boost through the DOC Community Fund, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Six groups from across the region will receive more than $124,000 in grants this year.

“Community conservation is an essential part of protecting our nation’s natural beauty and we are committed to supporting them through the DOC Community Fund,” Ms Barry says.

“From the rugged hills of Wellington’s south coast to the dunes of Castlepoint, these groups are making an immediate and positive difference to the War on Weeds and our ongoing fight against predators.”

Ms Barry made the announcement on a visit to the Rimutaka Forest Park outside Lower Hutt today, where dedicated community work has helped to create a safe habitat for kiwi close to the capital city.

In addition to the regional grants, the Wellington-based Endangered Species Foundation of New Zealand will receive $40,000 for its nationwide Ambassador Club, a funding and awareness-raising network.

“This support will enable the Foundation to continue to raise its funding base and expand its work advocating for lesser-known, remarkable New Zealand native species, such as the Chesterfield skink.”

The groups to receive funding are:

- **Wellington Natural Heritage Trust** - $38,000 to support restoration of the Long Gully Bush Reserve in Karori, targeting weeds and invasive pests
- **Brooklyn Trail Builders** - $10,000 for pest control work on the Hawkins Hill trails, south of the Brooklyn wind turbine
- **Castlepoint Ratepayers & Residents Association and Te Hika a Papauma** - $33,000 to help set up a native plant nursery to grow spinifex and pingao for replanting at Castlepoint in the Wairarapa
- **Aorangi Restoration Trust** - $20,000 to develop an ongoing plan for restoration of the Aorangi Forest Park near Martinborough
- **Whareroa Guardians Community Trust** - $15,000 for wetland protection at the Whareroa Farm Reserve, Paekakariki
- **Kotukutuku Ecological Restoration Project** - $8700 for predator control work in native forest on private land near Paraparaumu.

In total, the DOC Community Fund will distribute more than $4 million in 2016-17 to organisations ranging from small community groups working across a single site to national partnersh
