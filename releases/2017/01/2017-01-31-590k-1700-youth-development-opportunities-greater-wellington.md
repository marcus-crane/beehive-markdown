Around 1,700 young people in the Greater Wellington region will benefit from collaborative investments in new youth development opportunities totalling over $590,000, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“These opportunities will offer a range of experiences in the creative sector and sports, and will involve three separate initiatives, says Ms Kaye.

The investments are being made under the Partnership Fund which sees the Government co-invest with business, philanthropic, iwi and other partners to grow youth development opportunities.

“The ‘Journeys’ programme, delivered by the Boys & Girls Institute at the Walter Nash Centre in Taita, will be supported to provide opportunities for 500 young people to develop their skills and self-worth through creative disciplines including art and music,” says Ms Kaye.

“Ignite Sport, who are based in Lower Hutt and use sport and recreation to engage and motivate young people, will be supported to provide opportunities for more than 780 young people to develop their sporting ability, and recognise the pathways necessary to succeed in life.

“Ignite Sport run a range of programmes, including leadership and ambassador programmes. They also support young refugees to make connections to their new home through sport.

“The Roxy5 Short Film Competition, delivered by the Miramar Events Trust and Capital E, will be supported to offer around 400 opportunities for young people in Years 7 to 13 to develop their creativity, capability and confidence through film-making.

“This is a chance for participants to be mentored by industry professionals and access the world-class screen technology that exists in the capital.

“These opportunities recognise there are many ways young people can discover their strengths, build confidence and grow as individuals.

“It’s fantastic that so many organisations see the benefits of investing in our young people and are collaborating with the Government to provide exciting youth development opportunities in the Wellington area.”
