Justice Minister Amy Adams has welcomed New Zealand’s return to the top of global transparency rankings.

A number of Government initiatives have helped return New Zealand to first equal in the world, along with Denmark, in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. New Zealand scored 90 points out of 100.

“This is an excellent score and New Zealanders can be rightly proud of it. While we’ve always done well in these rankings, it’s encouraging to see New Zealand reclaim the top spot – a placing we’ve held in eight of the last ten years,” says Ms Adams.

“The result reflects New Zealand’s zero-tolerance of bribery and corruption, and affirms our reputation as world leaders in this area.

“The Government takes corruption seriously and we’ll continue to work to protect New Zealand’s reputation as a fair and transparent nation to live in and do business with.”

Recent anti-corruption initiatives progressed by the Government include:

- introducing new bribery offences and increasing the penalties for bribery and corruption through the Organised Crime and Anti-corruption Legislation Act
- ratifying the United Nations Convention Against Corruption
- reviewing New Zealand’s extradition and mutual legal assistance laws to ensure they are efficient and effective
- fast-tracking the second phase of anti-money laundering reforms
- contributing to global initiatives, such as the London Anti-Corruption Summit.
