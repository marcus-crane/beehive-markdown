Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened a new cycleway in Blenheim and marked the start of another, extending the existing walking and cycling network in the region.

The $1 million Spring Creek Shared Path is complete and construction will now begin on the Taylor River Cycleway.

“These new cycleways will make walking and cycling safer, more enjoyable transport choices for residents and students, as they will be separated from the high-speed traffic along State Highway 1,” Mr Bridges says.

“Making urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice is a priority. Through our Urban Cycleways Programme, we’re accelerating key projects and helping to establish cycling as an integral part of Marlborough’s transport network.”

Prior to the opening of the Spring Creek Shared Path, the cycling network only extended from Blenheim to Grovetown, which meant residents and students at the Spring Creek and Grovetown schools had to walk or ride along State Highway 1 to access the CBD.

“The bulk of construction was completed late last year, and already the number of people travelling by bike between Spring Creek and Blenheim’s CBD has increased dramatically.

“Now that the path is officially open, I’m sure that even more people will take advantage of this safer, high quality route to move between Blenheim’s communities, especially with the new school year about to begin.”

The Taylor River Cycleway will also help to link residential areas to the CBD, extending the existing popular cycleway along the Taylor River further south and providing a safe commuting option to get over 1,700 students to school.

The projects were jointly funded by the Marlborough District Council and the Government through the Urban Cycleways Programme.

“Central and local government are working together through this programme to deliver $333 million of new cycleway projects nationwide by June 2018 - the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.”
