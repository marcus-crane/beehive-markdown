Three Community Housing Providers have been given the opportunity to present formal proposals to take over up to 2500 Housing New Zealand properties and tenancies in Christchurch, the Government announced today.

This follows an invitation in April for Expressions of Interest from Community Housing Providers interested in participating in the proposed transfer, centred on the suburbs of Shirley, Bryndwr and Riccarton.

The three short-listed respondents each bring together an experienced New Zealand registered community housing provider with equity providers that have worked on social housing and major infrastructure projects. The three providers are:

- Community Futures Christchurch, a consortium whose members are the community housing provider Trust House Limited, Whitehelm Capital Pty Ltd, and Broadspectrum (New Zealand) Limited
- Ōtautahi Community Housing Consortium, made up of the community housing provider Ōtautahi Community Housing Trust and Morrison & Co PPP GP 2 Limited
- A third consortium whose members are the community housing provider Compass Housing Services Co (New Zealand) Limited, AMP Capital Investors Limited, and Brookfield Financial Australia Securities Limited.

Finance Minister Steven Joyce said all three respondents submitted high-quality Expressions of Interest.

“Each demonstrated their capability for providing innovative and responsive services for tenants from a sound, sustainable financial base, while also delivering on the Government’s requirement to supply at least another 150 social housing places,” Mr Joyce says.

Social Housing Minister Amy Adams said the purpose of the process was to ensure that not only the social housing stock is increased and improved, but to deliver better services to tenants.

“While ownership of these properties may change, the properties will remain as social houses, just as they are now. They won’t be able to be sold off and must continue to be used as social housing. Current tenants will remain in their homes. Neither their rent or rights will change as a result of the transfer, including their eligibility for social housing,” Ms Adams says.

“At the same time we are looking for a provider who will apply fresh thinking and make a positive difference to the way tenants are supported, and properties are managed.”

Housing New Zealand will continue to own and manage up to 3300 properties across Christchurch.
