Minister of Tourism Paula Bennett today announced the appointment of Jan Hunt and the reappointment of Chris Parkin as members of the New Zealand Tourism Board.

Mrs Hunt is a director at Skyline Enterprises and Jumping New Zealand. Previously she was a Board member of the Queenstown Chamber of Commerce and worked as a General Manager at Millbrook Resort, Sky City Hotel & Convention Centre, and Millennium Queenstown.

 “The skills, personal attributes and regional tourism experience Mrs Hunt brings to the table will be of great value to the New Zealand Tourism Board,” says Mrs Bennett.

Mr Parkin has been reappointed to the board and will continue to provide a strong contribution through his extensive property management and hotel owner and management expertise. Both have been appointed for one-year terms.

“I would also like to take this opportunity to thank outgoing board member Norm Thompson for his commitment and service over his term with the Board,” says Mrs Bennett.

The New Zealand Tourism Board (known as Tourism New Zealand) is a Crown entity, responsible for ensuring that New Zealand is effectively marketed as a visitor destination in order to maximise long-term benefits to New Zealand.
