The purchase of a former motel in Gisborne is an example of the commitment Government has made to helping local Gisborne families with housing, Associate Minister for Social Housing Alfred Ngaro says.

The Eastland Motel is in the final stages of being purchased by the Government to use as transitional housing and with 19 units will be able to support 76 locals and their families a year.

“As we enter the colder winter months it’s even more important that people have access to warm, safe and dry housing which is why we’re working hard to make sure all those in need have somewhere to stay,” Mr Ngaro says.

“This motel is a great option for people and families in need. It’s centrally located and designed in a way that allows us to support people in need.

“Women’s Refuge will provide support to our families to help them get back on their feet and will continue to support people once they’ve moved into longer-term housing to help them manage that transition.

“Transitional housing isn’t just about a roof over people’s heads though. This innovative approach recognises that many of our families face other challenges and so by partnering up with great providers like Women’s Refuge we can give tailored support to our families to meet those needs in a much more effective way.

“Right across the country we’re seeing what a huge difference this Government’s investment in transitional housing is making for kiwis so it’s fantastic that we’ll be able to help even more families with this purchase.”

The transitional housing places in Gisborne are part of the Government’s plan to secure 2150 places nationwide.
