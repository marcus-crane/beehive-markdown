Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is thrilled that more than 100 residents at Minginui Village in the Bay of Plenty are a step closer to living in warm and healthy homes.

“The Māori Land Court on Wednesday confirmed the occupation and home ownership status of 57 houses in the village at a special hearing in Murumurunga Marae,” says Mr Flavell.

“The legal declaration clears the way for whānau to access support to upgrade or replace their homes”.

The Ngāti Whare Trust inherited the old forestry homes when the forestry industry collapsed in the 1980s. Due to uncertainty over the land tenure and home ownership, residents have been unable to carry out necessary refurbishments.

Mr Flavell says Te Puni Kōkiri has worked closely with the residents and the Ngāti Whare Trust to prepare for the court hearing and has also provided $130,000 to assist Ngāti Whare Trust to establish and enable a Māori land tenure and home ownership system for the Ngāti Whare village.

“This is a great example of Te Puni Kōkiri working in partnership with communities to affect tangible outcomes for whānau.”

Te Puni Kōkiri will hold a housing workshop with the Minginui residents later this month and will continue to support whānau to repair or replace their homes through its Māori Housing Network.
