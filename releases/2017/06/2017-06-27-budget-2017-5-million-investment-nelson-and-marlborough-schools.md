Associate Minister of Education Tim Macindoe has today announced that around $5 million will be invested in Budget 2017 to expand the capacity of schools in the Nelson and Marlborough area.

Minister Macindoe visited Waimea College in Nelson today to make the announcement.

“This first round of school infrastructure investment in Budget 2017 will provide a total of ten new classrooms to two schools in the area,” says Mr Macindoe.

The schools receiving new classrooms are:

- Waimea College in Nelson (around $4 million for eight new classrooms)
- Renwick School, Omaka Satellite in Marlborough (around $1 million for two new classrooms).

“Waimea College services the Richmond area which has seen substantial growth in recent times and also has a number of residential developments underway. This investment will help provide space to accommodate this growth and prepare for the College’s future.

“Waimea College also caters for a number of children who benefit from additional learning support to help them achieve educational success. The eight additional classrooms will provide safe, modern and inclusive learning environments which will help raise student achievement for all Waimea College students. 

“The two new classrooms for Renwick school will be delivered as a satellite bilingual unit at the Omaka Marae. This is a great opportunity to provide Te Reo provision for the Marlborough region.

“Today’s announcement builds on the $2.6 million invested through Budget 2016 for 8 new roll growth classrooms in the Nelson/Marlborough region,” says Mr Macindoe.

“Budget 2017 is investing $456.5 million in education infrastructure, taking our overall commitment to extending and improving our schools to over $5 billion since 2008.”

It is expected that the new classrooms will be operational before the end of the 2018 school year.

Further announcements about Budget 2017 school property investments will be made over the next few weeks.
