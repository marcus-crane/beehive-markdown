More Napier locals are closer to gaining housing with resource consent being lodged with the Napier City Council for a new 10-unit housing development in Kelvin Place, Maraenui, Associate Social Housing Minister Alfred Ngaro has announced.

“We’re hearing great things everyday about the difference that transitional housing is making to kiwis across the country and this new development will allow us to help even more people,” says Mr Ngaro.

“Our plans are for 10 new warm, dry and modern one-bedroom transitional houses. The houses have been designed for single people, couples, and single parents with infants, with site management and tenant support to be provided by the Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga and Emerge Aotearoa partnership.

“This isn't just about a roof over people’s heads. The thing that sets transitional housing apart is the support tenants receive. We know that many of our people are facing other challenges which is why they receive tailored support when living there and another three months of support once they move on to help manage that transition.

“Should consent be granted we’ll be able to help another 40 locals in Napier every year and I’m really looking forward to hearing even more stories about how this innovative approach to housing is making a difference”
