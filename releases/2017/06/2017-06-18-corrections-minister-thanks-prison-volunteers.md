Corrections Minister Louise Upston is thanking the more than 2000 volunteers who give their time to help prisoners and offenders turn their lives around.

Today marks the beginning of National Volunteer Week, when the work of more than one million volunteers in New Zealand is recognised and celebrated.

“Volunteers are an essential part of Corrections’ work to support people to change their lives,” Ms Upston says.

“Whether it is helping to improve prisoners’ reading or writing, teaching an art class, sharing life skills such as cooking and budgeting or providing cultural and religious services, volunteers are vital to Corrections’ work.

“Helping offenders to move towards a crime-free future requires the support of many. It isn’t something Corrections can do alone. Volunteers bring diversity, community perspective and connection. They also support our goal of reducing reoffending by assisting offenders rehabilitate and transition back into the community.”

Ms Upston will be presenting awards to some of the volunteers who have won Corrections Volunteer Awards at Arohata Prison on Friday.

“These are committed Kiwis who give up their time and share their skills to make a positive impact on the lives of offenders,” Ms Upston says.

“National Volunteer Week is a great time to say a big thank you to the thousands of selfless people who volunteer for Corrections and recognise their commitment.”
