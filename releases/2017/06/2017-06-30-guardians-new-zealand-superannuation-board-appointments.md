Finance Minister Steven Joyce today announced that Lindsay Wright and Philippa (Pip) Dunphy have been reappointed to the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation Board.

“As a New Zealander based in Hong Kong, current Deputy Chair Ms Wright brings an international, particularly Asian perspective, and a strong asset management investment capability, both in public and private markets, to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund,” Mr Joyce says. “We are fortunate to have someone with Ms Wright’s understanding of financial markets on the Board.”

Ms Wright is currently co-Head of BNY Mellon Investment Management Asia-Pacific and Head of Distribution Asia Pacific. She will be reappointed for a shortened term of one year as her new term commencement date could fall within the caretaker government period.  

“Ms Dunphy brings strong technical investment knowledge, deep Crown and private sector governance experience, as well as institutional knowledge of the Fund from her near five years on the Guardians Board,” Mr Joyce says.

Pip Dunphy chairs the Guardians Audit Committee. She is also Deputy Chair of Abano Healthcare Group Ltd and former Chair of Mint Asset Management Ltd.  She is to be reappointed for a shortened term of two years in order to provide more options for succession planning.

The New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 established the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, a portfolio of investments held for the purpose of helping to meet the cost of New Zealand Superannuation. The Guardians manage and administer the Fund. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund is one of the Crown Financial Institutions.
