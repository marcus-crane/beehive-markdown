Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the start of work on two sections of the Hastings iWay, part of the Government’s $333 million Urban Cycleways Programme (UCP).

“The UCP is making a real difference to cycling in the regions all around New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.

“The 18km of cycleways being delivered as part of the UCP in Hastings will provide safer, more connected routes for the growing number of cyclists in Hastings, connecting up the existing cycleway networks and linking together schools, employment areas and homes.

“I’m thrilled that work is now underway, thanks to the continued partnership of central and local government through the Programme.

“Cycling is an important part of an effective integrated transport network, it creates more vibrant and connected communities, it’s good for tourism and it’s a fun, healthy way to get around,” Mr Bridges says.

The UCP, announced by Mr Bridges in 2015, is jointly funded by the Government’s Urban Cycleways Fund, the National Land Transport Fund and contributions from local government. It is intended to make it easier and safer for people to cycle, to ensure cycling is an everyday travel choice.

Last month marked the halfway point in the Urban Cycleways Programme, with fourteen projects fully complete and twenty-two more underway.

“The Pakowhai Road and Haumoana sections of the Hastings iWay are just the latest projects to get underway in the UCP, the largest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history,” Mr Bridges says.
