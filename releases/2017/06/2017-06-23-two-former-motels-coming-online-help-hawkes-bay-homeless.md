Months of hard work is coming to fruition and benefiting local Hawke’s Bay families with another 23 short-term transitional housing places due to open in the next few weeks, Associate Minister for Social Housing Alfred Ngaro says.

Two former motels, The Clansman Motel in Hastings and the Napier Garden Motel in Napier, are in the final stages of being purchased by the Government to use as transitional housing.

“As we enter the colder winter months it’s even more important that people have access to warm, safe and dry housing which is why we’ve been working hard to make sure all those in need have somewhere to stay.

"These former motels are a great option for people and families in need. They’re centrally located and designed in a way that allows us to support people in need.

“We’ve got great providers lined up for each motel. The Salvation Army and Women’s Refuge, through their “Triple S” initiative which stands for “Safe Secure Short-term accommodation”, will provide support to our families to help them get back on their feet and will continue to support people once they’ve moved into longer-term housing to help them manage that transition.

“Right across the country we’re seeing what a huge difference this Government’s investment in transitional housing is making for kiwis so it’s fantastic that we’ll be able to help even more families with these purchases.”
