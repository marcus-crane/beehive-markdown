Police Minister Paula Bennett has announced that New Zealand Police will continue to support the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force once the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) concludes tomorrow.

“RAMSI has done a remarkable job of helping restore security and stability in the Solomon Islands, and New Zealand is proud to have been part of this regional effort to help a close friend and neighbour,” Mrs Bennett says.

“We have signed an arrangement with the Solomon Islands Government today that will allow this support to continue once RAMSI formally concludes.

“New Zealand will contribute $12.5 million from our aid programme over the next four years to provide support to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force to ensure they can maintain the gains which have been made under RAMSI.

“This support will fund the deployment of eight New Zealand Police advisers, who will help to implement crime prevention strategies, with a focus on community policing, and ultimately help ensure that stability is maintained.

“Since 2003 around 2000 New Zealand Defence Force and New Zealand Police personnel have served as part of RAMSI and we currently have 16 New Zealand Police personnel serving as part of the final New Zealand contingent.

“Most will return to New Zealand today and I would like to acknowledge all the New Zealanders who have contributed to the success of RAMSI over the past 14 years,” Mrs Bennett says.
