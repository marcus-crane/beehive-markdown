Hundreds of families in the Hawkes Bay will be helped through the Government’s social housing plans for the region, Ministers say.

“We’ve made a commitment to help New Zealanders find their feet when times are tough, and our plans for the Hawkes Bay will do just that,” Social Housing Minister Amy Adams says.

Plans for 195 social housing places and 129 short-term transitional housing places will benefit around 711 local families a year.

“Our plans for the region are a recognition that access to safe, warm and dry housing is a growing area of concern, and we’re working hard to address those demands.

“We’re on track to have the short-term transitional housing places available by the end of the year, and expect to see the new social housing places coming on board over the next three years.”

Associate Minister for Social Housing, Alfred Ngaro visited one of the newly opened transitional housing places in Hastings today.

Mr Ngaro met with staff at the Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga run property to hear about the difference that transitional housing is making in the area.

“Every day, we’re hearing stories from our frontline about the great work being done by our community housing providers to help people in need,” says Mr Ngaro.

“This isn’t just about housing. The investment of $354 million the Government made last year into transitional housing recognises that many of our struggling families are facing further challenges. That’s why we’ve partnered with some fantastic community housing providers to make sure they’re getting further help to get back on their feet – from budgeting advice to cooking lessons or parenting support.

“Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga are a great example. They’re working extremely hard to help those in our community who need help to get back on their feet which is why it’s great that we’re able to support even more transitional housing developments”.

We’ve now secured 30 of our planned transitional housing places, meaning that we’re already in a position to help 120 local families this year, with more places scheduled to open in the coming weeks and months.”
