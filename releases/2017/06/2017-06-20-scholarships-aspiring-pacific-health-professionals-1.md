Associate Health Minister Nicky Wagner is congratulating 25 tertiary students awarded Pacific Health Scholarships during a special ceremony in Porirua today.

The Ministry of Health-funded scholarships aim to strengthen the Pacific health and disability workforce by providing financial assistance to Pacific students committed to improving the health of their communities.

“Boosting the Pacific health workforce will help address the diverse needs of Pacific communities and promote better Pacific health outcomes,” Ms Wagner says.

“This year a record 190 Pacific Health Scholarships — totalling more than $1.4 million — are being awarded nationwide to students studying a range of health disciplines.”

The scholarships, which cover 80 per cent of course fees, are awarded based on academic achievement, community involvement, leadership qualities and commitment to Pacific communities.

“Many of the students receiving scholarships today may not have been able to achieve their dreams without this kind of support. I congratulate the students and wish them well for their future studies and careers,” Ms Wagner says.

The scholarships were awarded during a ceremony at Pataka Museum in Porirua this afternoon. Ceremonies have also been held in Dunedin and Auckland.
