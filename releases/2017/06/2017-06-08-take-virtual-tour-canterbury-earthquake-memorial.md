Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner says anyone who has not yet visited the Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial can now do so online with [Google Street View](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/@-43.5344702,172.6319881,3a,75y,259h,88t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-6XsSdJ_0U_w%2FWQvVLqhPWZI%2FAAAAAAABxyM%2FoQ4Yh93BhO8Pv4nxaAmb9buO-0cHWGHHQCLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F-6XsSdJ_0U_w%2FWQvVLqhPWZI%2FAAAAAAABxyM%2FoQ4Yh93BhO8Pv4nxaAmb9buO-0cHWGHHQCLIB%2Fw234-h106-k-no-pi-2.9338646-ya352.6072-ro-0-fo100%2F!7i10740!8i5370).

“Seeing and touching the memorial’s marble wall etched with 185 names is an incredibly moving experience. I urge Cantabrians, New Zealanders and tourists to visit but for those unable to do so, the virtual experience is the next best thing,” Ms Wagner says.

Street View captures the memorial through detailed 360-degree photos and enables users to move along the length of the wall, zoom in or rotate around to see the river and park space on the north bank.

“The memorial is deeply significant for bereaved families and friends, the people of Christchurch and wider New Zealand.  This virtual tour ensures the memorial is accessible to all, at anytime from anywhere,” Ms Wagner says.

“Responsibility for the management and maintenance of the memorial will soon be passed to the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, reflecting its status as a site of national significance.”
