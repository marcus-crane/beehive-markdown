Tourism Minister Paula Bennett has today announced $5.2 million in co-funding for sixteen councils around New Zealand. Councils from Queenstown to Whangarei will receive funding for 28 new tourism infrastructure projects that include include toilets, showers and parking facilities.

Projects were funded through the second round of the Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund and provide support for councils with high visitor numbers and small ratepayer bases, says Mrs Bennett.

“This funding will be a relief for these communities and will help them respond to the steady stream of visitors they are seeing. Tourism is hugely important to many of our regional economies and infrastructure is essential to harnessing the benefits of growth in the sector,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Quality infrastructure and facilities also help to ensure New Zealanders can continue to enjoy their own spaces – whether they are at home or visiting other parts of the country. This is important if the tourism sector is to retain the support of New Zealanders.

“This is the second and final round of the Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund, which will be subsumed by the new Tourism Infrastructure Fund of $100 million over four years. This new fund will also support local communities who are facing pressure from tourism growth need assistance.

“We’ve heard from industry and local government that infrastructure is their number one priority and have responded accordingly. Now I am interested in what the projects are that we can fund to support our growing and successful tourism sector.”
