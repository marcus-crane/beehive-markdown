Government commitment to housing and partnerships with local providers are helping more families in Blenheim, Associate Minister for Social Housing Alfred Ngaro says.

Christchurch Methodist Mission, in partnership with Crossroads, is now able to help 16 families a year with transitional housing after it signed a contract to manage four properties Housing New Zealand had recently purchased in the area.

Three places are now up and running with another family due to move into the fourth over the weekend.

“Three, soon to be four families, some who’d been staying in motels, have now got somewhere safe, warm and dry to stay and are receiving support to help them get back on their feet,” says Mr Ngaro.

“This isn't just about a roof over people’s heads. We know that many of our families are facing other challenges which is why they receive on-site tailored support when living there and another three months of support once they move on to help manage that transition.

“As we enter the colder winter months it’s even more important that people have access to warm, safe and dry housing which is why we’ve been working hard to make sure all those in need have somewhere to stay.

“Right across the country we’re seeing what a huge difference this Government’s investment in transitional housing is making for kiwis so it’s fantastic that we’ll be able to help even more families with these purchases and partnerships.”
