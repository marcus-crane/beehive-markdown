Science and Innovation Minister Paul Goldsmith has congratulated the 60 New Zealand graduate students, academics, artists and professionals honoured as Fulbright grantees at a ceremony at Parliament today.

“Fulbright New Zealand provides opportunities for promising graduate students to complete a post- graduate degree at an American university in areas targeted to support growth and innovation in New Zealand”, says Mr Goldsmith.

The grantees are awarded up to US$31,000 each year, towards one year of study or research in the United States.

“The Fulbright programme is important in contributing to the on-going New Zealand – United States bilateral relationship, and this link between our two countries is stronger than ever,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“It’s more than six decades since the Fulbright programme between our two countries was established and in that time hundreds of New Zealanders and Americans have studied, researched and taught in each other’s country, making substantial contributions in their fields.

“Out of the 60 outstanding grantees, thirteen have received a Science and Innovation Graduate Award which are aimed to support New Zealand’s economic, social, environmental and cultural needs, and to build international science connections.

 “The United States is one of New Zealand’s top science and technology partners, accounting for approximately 25 per cent of all New Zealand’s international science connections.  The Science and Innovation Graduate Award is designed to support the continued growth of this mutually beneficial relationship,” says Mr Goldsmith.
