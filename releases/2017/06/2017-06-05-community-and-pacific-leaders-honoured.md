The Minister for Pacific Peoples and the Community and Voluntary Sector, Alfred Ngaro, says this year’s Queens Birthday Honours list recognises the depth of leadership and commitment of those working in the community.

58 leaders have been honoured for their service, including eight from the Pacific community.

“These honours are an important, and well-deserved, recognition of people who have worked tirelessly in their communities to make a difference,” says Mr Ngaro.

“I’d like to congratulate them all.

“I’m particularly pleased to see La’auli Michael Jones has been recognised as a Knights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM).

“Most New Zealanders recognise La’auli as the most outstanding rugby player of his generation, but what they see less of is the commitment he puts into volunteering and into supporting Pasifika and Maori communities.

“Whether as Chairman of the Village Community Trust, a member of the Pacific Advancement Senior School (PASS) Board or as a coach for his son’s school rugby team; La’auli is dedicated to empowering Pacific youth and community.

“I’m proud to call La’auli a friend and proud to see his, and so many of our other dedicated leaders recognised in this year’s honours list.”
