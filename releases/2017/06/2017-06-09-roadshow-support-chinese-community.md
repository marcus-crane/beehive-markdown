Small Business Minister Jacqui Dean is looking forward to meeting with Chinese owned small businesses when the Small Business Roadshow travels to Auckland on 15 June.

“The Small Business Roadshow has been travelling New Zealand, connecting small businesses with government services,” Ms Dean says.

“There are a lot of government services that businesses can tap into and sometimes they are hard to navigate. Our aim is to increase understanding of what is available and give small businesses every opportunity to thrive and grow.

“We have had great feedback on how useful these events have been and we are delighted to bring them to the Chinese business community in Auckland.

“Co-hosting the event with me will be Member of Parliament Dr Jian Yang. Dr Yang is a tireless advocate for Chinese owned businesses and I am delighted to have his help at this event.”

As well as enjoying a wide range of speakers from across government, attendees will be able to talk one-on-one with officials and network with other businesses in their community.

“It is about helping small businesses grow and thrive, so whether they are wanting to find help to grow their business or worried about meeting health and safety legislation, tax or ACC obligations, they have someone they can talk to directly,” Ms Dean says.
