Houghton Valley School in Wellington will receive funding to build a new classroom as part of Budget 2017, Associate Education Minister Tim Macindoe announced today.

Mr Macindoe visited Houghton Valley School today to share the news with the school.

“Houghton Valley School’s roll has been increasing steadily. This new classroom will extend the school’s capacity and continue our commitment to expand the network in areas of ongoing population growth,” says Mr Macindoe.

“This additional classroom will complement work already underway at the school to remediate weather-tightness issues and provide students with modern, innovative classrooms that support students to learn and achieve.”

Today’s announcement is part of the first round of infrastructure investments being announced as part of this year’s Budget.

“Through Budget 2017 this Government is investing $456.5 million in education infrastructure, taking our overall commitment to extending and improving our schools in recent years to over $5 billion,” says Mr Macindoe.

“Last year, as part of Budget 2016, we committed around $8 million dollars of roll growth funding to the Wellington region to grow the network and directly support schools experiencing growth.”

It is expected that the new classroom will be operational in time for the 2019 school year.

Further announcements about Budget 2017 school property investments will be made over the next few weeks.
