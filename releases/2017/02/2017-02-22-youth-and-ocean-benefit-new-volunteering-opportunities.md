Around 750 young people and the marine environment from Northland to Waikato will benefit from a new $475,000 partnership providing youth volunteering opportunities with the Sea Cleaners programme, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

The programme is run by the Sea Cleaners Trust, an organisation dedicated to removing rubbish from our oceans and harbours. Since it was established in 2002, it’s helped remove over 4.3 million litres of rubbish from the sea.

“This is about supporting young people to hone skills such as leadership, planning and collaboration, while at the same time providing a valuable service for the environment and their communities,” says Ms Kaye.

“Young people on the programme will learn about the global and local issue of marine litter, and be supported to organise coastal clean-ups in their local areas.

“This is a fantastic opportunity to gain more awareness of how habits on the land can impact the marine environment, and what action can be taken to lead and promote change.”

The investment announced today is being made under the Partnership Fund, which sees the Government co-invest with business, philanthropic, iwi and other partners to grow youth development opportunities.

“The Government is contributing $75,000 towards the programme, alongside $100,000 from Visy Recycling, $50,000 from Port Nikau and $250,000 from the Bobby Stafford-Bush Foundation,” says Ms Kaye.

“Today’s announcement follows over $1.5 million of partnerships for a range of youth development opportunities announced already in 2017, which shows the partnership model is delivering great results.”
