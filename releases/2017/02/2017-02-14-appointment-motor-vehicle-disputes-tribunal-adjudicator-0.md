Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Jacqui Dean today announced a new appointment to the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.

“I am pleased to announce the Governor-General has appointed Brett Carter as a Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal adjudicator for a five-year term, starting on 15 February 2017,” Ms Dean says.

“Mr Carter’s extensive legal background and experience in fair trading, credit and consumer laws will be particularly valuable to the Tribunal, which hears disputes between consumers and car dealers or other registered and unregistered motor vehicle traders.”

Mr Carter will primarily hear cases in Auckland and the northern North Island.

Ms Dean also acknowledged the services of Christopher Cornwell, who stepped down as a Tribunal adjudicator after more than 10 years of being in the role.
