Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced $889,000 of funding grants to boost New Zealand’s resilience to natural hazards and their consequences.

Mr Brownlee says the grants are awarded from the 2017 Resilience Fund, an annual fund of $889,000 administered by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM).

Nine councils and organisations from Northland to Southland have been awarded grants this year.

“The projects include training programmes, tsunami preparedness for schools and early childhood centres, improved waste management in emergencies, and planning for specific hazards, such as a rupture of the Alpine Fault,” Mr Brownlee says.

“New Zealand’s regions are leading some of the resilience work at the coalface of Civil Defence Emergency Management, and this is an opportunity for the government to support and tap into projects that will have flow-on benefits for the rest of the country.

“This will help to improve our understanding of hazards, boost our preparedness to them, and build on the world-leading skills and expertise that New Zealand possesses.”

“The government is committed to improving New Zealand’s resilience to its natural hazards.

“Today’s announcement follows last year’s $6.2 million Budget boost for the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management to support its efforts to ensure New Zealanders are better prepared for emergencies.

“We are also developing a national public alerting system, and have recently announced an additional $3 million investment to boost Geonet’s natural hazards monitoring capability,” Mr Brownlee says.
