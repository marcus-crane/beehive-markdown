Foreign Minister Murray McCully welcomes the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó to New Zealand, who he will meet in Auckland on Friday this week.

“This visit presents an opportunity to deepen this relationship, including through discussing trade opportunities and New Zealand’s ambitions for a Free Trade Agreement with the EU,” Mr McCully says.

“Foreign Minister Szijjártó’s visit marks the growing links between our two countries. In recent years, New Zealand’s relationship with Hungary has benefited from the annual Working Holiday Scheme, where up to 100 young New Zealanders and Hungarians can live and work in the other’s country each year.”

While in New Zealand, Mr Szijjártó will officially open the Hungarian Embassy in Wellington, deliver a public speech at Parliament on the future of the EU post-Brexit, and speak at a trade forum.
