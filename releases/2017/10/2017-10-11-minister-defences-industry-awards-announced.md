“These awards recognise industry’s role in supporting Defence throughout the year and the calibre of the winners, and everyone nominated, reflect the high standards of the whole sector,” Mr Mitchell says.

The sector employs around 2,500 people, generates $125 million in wages, and $60 million in revenue, and delivers economic benefits throughout the country with hubs in main centres as well as in Whangarei, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Blenheim and Nelson, Mr Mitchell says.

Nominations for the awards covered some of the wide range of services that support Defence, including information technology, engineering and catering supplies.
