Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Andrew Little has received the Waitangi Tribunal’s report on the Ngātiwai mandate.

“The Tribunal has prepared a thorough report into the Crown’s recognition of the mandate of the Ngātiwai Trust Board to represent Ngātiwai in Treaty settlement negotiations.

“It is important that I take time to consider the recommendations, in consultation with the Office of Treaty Settlements.

“The Treaty of Waitangi settlement process is about acknowledging the injustices of the past, to fulfil the aspirations of Māori and all New Zealanders for the future.

“I thank Ngātiwai and the Tribunal for their important contribution with this report,” says Andrew Little.
