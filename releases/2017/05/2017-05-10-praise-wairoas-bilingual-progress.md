Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is congratulating Wairoa District Council after it adopted a policy to move it closer to its goal of becoming fully bilingual by 2040.

The council voted on Tuesday to support a te reo Māori policy which is designed to develop and promote the Māori language throughout the organisation.

“The council is to be congratulated for its foresight and support of te reo. They have the goal of becoming a bilingual town by 2040 and today’s vote is another step along that journey,” says Mr Flavell.

The policy aims to build positive attitudes and values about te reo among council staff so its use becomes a valued part of the organisation.

“This is exactly the kind of community-led initiative that I support and it will help create the right environment for the further use of te reo Māori,” says Mr Flavell.

“I’ve recently had discussions with Ōtaki and Rotorua becoming bilingual which have been very well received.

“The goals of Te Ture mō te Reo Māori – the new Māori Language Act passed last year - include whānau, hapū, iwi, communities and government working towards making the language a living language and this is just what Wairoa is doing.  I hope it provides the catalyst for others to follow suit.”
