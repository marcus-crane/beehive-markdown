Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner is welcoming the Regenerate Christchurch Statement of Performance Expectations tabled in Parliament today.

The Statement of Performance Expectations is compiled by Regenerate Christchurch, in collaboration with the Christchurch City Council and the Crown.

It looks at Regenerate Christchurch’s key work programmes, including planning for the Residential Red Zone, and the regeneration of the central city and New Brighton.

“I’m looking forward to working closely with Regenerate Christchurch, the council and community to ensure we get the best possible results for Christchurch,” Ms Wagner says.

“Collaboration and cooperation will be incredibly important as we continue to move from the rebuild to regeneration phase.

“Gerry Brownlee has worked tirelessly for Christchurch and made some very difficult decisions.  It’s now my turn to ensure those decisions bear fruit.

“We want to build the best, newest and most people-friendly city we can. It’s been six years but there’s still a lot of work to do. Christchurch is a real city of opportunity and I’m delighted to be part of it.”

Regenerate Christchurch Board Chair André Lovatt says the organisation has undertaken a wide range of planning and public engagement work.

“We’ve started with two of the most complex areas identified in our letter of expectations — the central city and the Ōtākaro Avon River corridor,” Mr Lovatt says.

“We’re very conscious that we need to keep moving forward as quickly as possible, and that our local community expects to see progress.”
