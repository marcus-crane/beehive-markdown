Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne announced today the Terms of Reference and independent lead for the Port Hills fires review.

“Following the February 2017 Port Hills fires, the Terms of Reference have now been approved for the New Zealand Fire Service and the National Rural Fire Authority sponsored Operational Review of the Port Hills Fire response. 

  “The Terms of Reference establish core guidelines and principles about how the Review will be carried out.  The purpose of the Review is to assess the readiness of Fire Agencies during the initial and extended responses to the Port Hills fires as well as post-incident management.

“It is also tasked with recommending any actions that will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the Fire Agencies carry out their respective statutory duties.

“This joint review approach also illustrates the coordinated and effective firefighting service we can provide to our communities when all rural and urban fire authorities become one as Fire and Emergency New Zealand on 1 July 2017,” said Mr Dunne.

The Review will be led by Alan Goodwin (Lead Reviewer), Australasian Fire and Emergency Authorities Council (AFAC).

“Appointing an independent reviewer, will help ensure the findings are objectively assessed,” Mr Dunne said.
