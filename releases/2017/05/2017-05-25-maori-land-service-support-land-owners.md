Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says $31 million of funding will be dedicated to establish phase one of the Māori Land Service.

“The Māori Land Service will usher in a new era for Māori landowners getting the support and advice they need, in order to achieve the collective aspirations they have for their own whenua,” Mr Flavell says.

The Māori Land Service will provide core services for Māori land owners. It will hold the Māori Land Registry, provide dispute and mediation services, support owner decision-making by providing governance and training, as well as providing Māori land owners with advice and support on development options.

“The design of the Māori Land Service has been informed by more than 1,000 Māori landowners, and they clearly signalled the need for it to provide advice and support on development options that align with their whenua aspirations,” Mr Flavell says.

The funding was set aside in last year’s Budget. New funding to inform Māori land owners, trustees and whānau about Te Ture Whenua Māori reforms is provided for in Budget 2017.

The historic changes proposed in Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill are the most significant changes to Māori land law in 20 years, and Budget 2017 allocates $2 million over three years to educate landowners about the new legislation.

Work will continue over 2017 to provide additional support for Māori landowners to make the most of changes through Te Ture Whenua Māori reforms. 

“It is exciting that we can support whānau to overcome barriers that have inhibited their aspirations for their whenua,” Mr Flavell says.
