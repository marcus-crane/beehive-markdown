Budget 2017 provides $36.3 million of additional operating spending over the next four years for WorkSafe New Zealand to build its capability as an effective, risk-targeted regulator, says Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse.

$17.36 million has been reprioritised from within baseline and the remaining $18.97 million is new funding from the Health and Safety at Work Levy.

“Budget 2017 recognises the work required to lift health and safety performance in the workplace,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The $36.3 million over four years will allow WorkSafe to:

- maintain the High Hazard Unit’s current inspectorate capability and capacity, enabling it to carry out both proactive and reactive activity to support business to manage catastrophic risk.

<!--THE END-->

- continue to provide effective education, engagement and enforcement activity to manage health and safety issues around the high levels of construction activity in Christchurch and Auckland

<!--THE END-->

- address operating cost pressures, ensuring WorkSafe can maintain an active presence across New Zealand.

“Budget 2017 also addresses higher regional inspectorate costs by providing WorkSafe with the necessary funding to maintain its local engagement.

“This will allow businesses and workers facing wide-ranging risks to continue to get support from their local WorkSafe office.

“WorkSafe has become a smarter, more targeted regulator and Budget 2017 will help maintain the progress WorkSafe’s been making in improving our workplace health and safety record.”
