A record number of Pacific Health Scholarships will be awarded this year, Associate Health Minister Nicky Wagner says.

The scholarship programme, funded by the Ministry of Health, aims to help build the number of Pacific people in the health and disability workforce.

“Growing the Pacific health workforce is vital for delivering appropriate and effective services for Pacific people,” Ms Wagner says.

“This year a record 190 scholarships will be awarded, totalling more than $1.4 million.

“The Ministry received 325 applications — the most in the last four years.  It’s fantastic to see the Pacific community embracing opportunities in the health sector and I’m particularly pleased to see 14 midwifery scholarships, including a mother and daughter in their first year of study at Wintec in Hamilton.”

**Background:**

- The priority workforce areas for the scholarships are medicine, nursing, midwifery and allied health.
- The scholarships provide financial assistance to Pacific students who are undertaking a course in health and disability-related studies, accredited by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) or the New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee.
- The scholarships fund 80 per cent of the total course fees and will be paid directly to the tertiary organisation of the successful applicants.
- The scholarships are awarded based on academic achievement, community involvement, leadership qualities and commitment to Pacific communities.
