Budget 2017 invests $37.2 million of operating funding to reduce the harm caused by family violence, Justice Minister Amy Adams and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley say.

$22.4 million will extend the Integrated Safety Response (ISR) pilots for another two years.

“More than 28,000 people have been supported through the ISR pilots in Christchurch and Waikato. The pilots are helping to improve the safety of family violence victims and stop family violence escalating by ensuring agencies and NGOs identify risks and intervene earlier,” Ms Adams says.

“Extending the pilots for a further two years will enable us to support thousands more families. We will also get a better picture of the nature of family violence in New Zealand so we can make more informed decisions about how to reduce the harm it causes.”

Budget 2017 also invests an additional $4 million over two years for the continuation of the E Tū Whānau Community Action Fund, and an extra $1.8 million in 2017/18 to extend the community-based Gang Action Plan pilots.

“The E Tū Whānau programme shows the role Māori leadership and community-led approaches have in preventing family violence. The programme is helping hard-to-reach whānau to reduce violence and improve wellbeing,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This programme complements the Government’s Gang Action Plan, which aims to break intergenerational gang life and reduce the social harm caused to whānau. We know that a high proportion of gang members’ partners are at higher risk of family violence and sexual violence, and that their children experience multiple incidents of abuse or neglect.

“We’re extending the community-based Gang Action Plan pilots to June 2018. A full evaluation of the pilots is expected later this year.”

The investment also includes $9 million over four years through Vote Māori Development to support whānau-centred family violence interventions.

“I want to acknowledge Minister Te Ururoa Flavell for his hard work and leadership on this challenging issue,” Ms Adams says.

“This $9 million will pilot the introduction of facilitators who will support whānau to access appropriate help to end violent behaviour and restore their relationships and cultural connections.

“The Government is focused on reducing family violence and these initiatives are part of the wider work being led by the Ministerial Group on Family Violence and Sexual Violence.”
