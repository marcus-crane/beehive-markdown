Partnerships with InOvation Trust and Te Aratika Creative will see around $144,000 invested to create up to 495 new leadership and mentoring opportunities for young people, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“Young Maori and young people with Maori whanau from across New Zealand, and young people from Gisborne will benefit from these partnerships,” says Ms Kaye.

“The partnership with InOvation Trust will support them to deliver The UnSpoken Word Youth Summit.

“This summit, which is running over four days in Waikanae, aims to help young Maori or young people with Maori whanau develop leadership and mentoring skills while tackling the important issue of youth suicide.

“It comprises three days of workshops, where participants develop ways to promote suicide awareness drawing on the performing arts, then wraps up with a performance on the final day.

“Up to 100 young people aged 13 to 18 will get to develop their leadership skills, while being supported by 20 young people aged 16 to 24 who will provide peer-to-peer mentoring.

“Participants will take actions plans developed during the summit back to their communities, so this is a great opportunity for young people to learn and grow while tackling a pressing social issue, then give back to others.

“The partnership with Te Aratika Creative will enable them to expand their Greater Than programme, which involves workshops aimed at helping young people develop skills in production, performance and event management.

“New funding as part of this partnership will support the delivery of an additional workshop in the Gisborne region.

“The Greater Than programme typically targets communities where there are limited opportunities for youth, especially in the performance and event management sphere.

“This is a great opportunity for another 375 young people to grow their skills and build their confidence through positive mentoring experiences.”

The investments in these two initiatives are being made under the Partnership Fund, which sees the Government co-invest with business, philanthropic, iwi and other partners to grow youth development opportunities.

“This approach is continuing to build new relationships and tap into the terrific passion out there to see young people grow and flourish,” says Ms Kaye.

New partnerships announced so far this year have seen around $3 million invested to provide more than 6500 new youth development opportunities across New Zealand.
