Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the launch of the NZ Lions Series 2017 education programme for schools.

“The NZ Lions Series is an iconic event, attracting over 20,000 international visitors as well as passionate support from Kiwi fans,” says Dr Coleman.

“To help get primary school students excited about this the once-in-12 year event, New Zealand Rugby is an education programme to 2,700 schools across the country.

“The programme uses information connected to the series to form part of the curriculum. It’s a fun and interactive way to bring rugby into the classroom.”

The New Zealand Lions Series 2017 will take place from 3 June to 8 July 2017, and will see the British & Irish Lions play ten matches against New Zealand opposition in seven host cities, including three test matches.

The Government has invested $3 million from the Major Events Development Fund to help the host cities show fans, both local and visiting, the best New Zealand has to offer through the Rugby 2017 Festival.

“The series provides another opportunity to deliver a distinct New Zealand flavour for our international visitors, thousands of local fans and the millions more following around the world,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government’s investment will also contribute to fanzones to enable the public to celebrate the series and showcase our passion for rugby, which will further enhance New Zealand’s reputation as a major event destination.”
