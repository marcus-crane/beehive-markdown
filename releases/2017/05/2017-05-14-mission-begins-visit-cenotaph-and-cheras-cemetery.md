A business and cultural mission to Malaysia has begun with a visit by the Minister for Māori Development Te Ururoa Flavell to the Cenotaph at the National War Memorial and to Cheras Cemetery where eight New Zealand servicemen have been laid to rest.

Mr Flavell says it is appropriate to begin his mission by paying his respects to those New Zealanders who had fought in Malaysia and to those who had fallen there.

“Our visit to the Cenotaph and to Cheras is made even more poignant because we know that at least two of the eight servicemen buried at the cemetery are Māori.”

Mr Flavell says New Zealand has recently offered repatriation to the families of military personnel buried here. 

“We want to acknowledge the great care that Malaysia has shown for the graves of our servicemen and reiterate that we will work closely with the Malaysian government to bring our personnel home. 

“I want to emphasise that this is about bringing closure to a historical issue that has affected families for many years.”

He says many Māori men saw action during the Malayan Emergency and the Confrontation period of the 1960s.

“All served their country and Malaysia with great pride and courage,” Mr Flavell says.

“I am therefore pleased that my mission this week begins with a wreath laying ceremony and a visit to Cheras cemetery to honour the sacrifices of those soldiers and honour the wishes of families who want them brought home.”
