Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says the fourth round of a multi-million-dollar fund to support community conservation projects opens for applications today.

“The DOC Community Fund was set up three years ago to distribute $26 million over four years and it continues to make a big difference for many community groups who would have struggled to do their great work without some timely financial help,” Ms Barry says.

“More than $21 million has already been awarded to 300 different projects in the first three rounds and we’re anticipating around $4.15 million will be allocated in Round Four this year.”

“Last year’s funding supported a wide range of conservation initiatives and included $1 million towards War on Weeds projects and a further million to boost community pest control projects which will support Predator Free 2050 and Battle for Our Birds.”

 “The DOC Community Fund encourages everyday New Zealanders to take ownership and lend a hand to important projects that matter to their communities,” Ms Barry says.

“Predator control and War on Weeds are high priorities for the Government and projects that focus on these two priorities are preferred for this year’s round, although all eligible applications will be considered.”

Applicants need to submit an expression of interest showing how their project fits with the purpose of the fund by 23 June 2017. Following the assessment of expressions of interest successful applicants will be invited to submit a full application.
