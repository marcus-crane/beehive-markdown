Māori Development Minister and Associate Minister for Economic Development Te Ururoa Flavell witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Miraka Ltd and its Malaysian distribution partner, Storiiu, in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

Miraka is New Zealand’s first Māori-owned dairy processor. The agreement means the company will start exporting its first own-branded consumer product.

Mr Flavell says the agreement was evidence of Māori innovating and moving products and services up the value chain, forming long-term international partnerships, and building economic value for the future.

“This is an example of Māori leading with the principle of kaitiakitānga (guardianship of the land, its people and environment) and shows the positive response this approach is receiving in international markets.

“It also shows the power of whānau collaboration and commitment. Investing in relationships and playing a long game is fundamental to Māori core values and this is an important part of any export strategy.

“I congratulate Miraka on their progress and on the contribution it is making towards lifting incomes and providing aspirational role models for other Māori exporters.”

Mr Flavell is visiting Malaysia with a delegation of seven Māori companies to raise the profile of New Zealand’s food and beverage sector.

Malaysia’s total food and beverage sales are forecast to grow to around US$21 billion in the next three years.
