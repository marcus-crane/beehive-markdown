Associate Economic Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is thrilled at the calibre of the winners of DreamBig Māori, a social media competition targeting Māori youth.

“We wanted to inspire rangatahi to think about their aspirations and economic future, and I’m blown away with the kaupapa and level of our winners’ creativity. This is a celebration of the future of Māori in Aotearoa and we should all be proud of these young rangatahi determining their own destiny,” said Mr Flavell.

The seven winners submitted a short video describing their aspirations for the future and won a day with Tammy Davis, Dr Lance O’Sullivan, Stacey Morrison, James McOnie, Robett Hollis or Lisa Carrington.

Mr Flavell said rangatahi are at the heart of the new Māori economic strategy *He kai kei aku ringa.*

*“*Our young people can design and drive their economic future. For these young people to meet our influencers, and spend a day with these inspirational leaders and mentors, is a real opportunity to connect and gain some real knowledge to reach their goals.” 

Mr Flavell made and shared his own video in which he talked about his dreams, and it has been viewed more than 8,000 times.

“I’m really humbled that our rangatahi are taking the time to watch the ramblings of this old fulla,” Mr Flavell said.

“I’m really fortunate that some of my dreams have been fulfilled – though not the dream of being a musician! But I’m now a Cabinet Minister so the thing is that you can achieve on your dreams and you can challenge your limits.”

The DreamBig Māori Facebook page has grown to more than 1600 followers. Overall the competition received 68 entries and more than 3000 votes were cast to determine the final seven winners.
