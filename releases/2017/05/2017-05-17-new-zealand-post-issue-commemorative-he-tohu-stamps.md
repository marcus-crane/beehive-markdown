New Zealand Post today issued a set of three stamps to commemorate the opening of *He Tohu*, a new permanent exhibition of New Zealand’s iconic constitutional documents at the National Library of New Zealand in Wellington.

The stamp series was launched at Parliament by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Hon Peter Dunne, accompanied Taku Parai, representing the *He Tohu* Iwi Leader Partner Group, and New Zealand Post Chair Jane Taylor.

The *He Tohu* exhibition has been developed in partnership between the Crown and Māori. The three *He Tohu* stamps are:

- $1.00 1835 He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni – Declaration of Independence of the United Tribes of New Zealand
- $2.00 1840 Te Tiriti o Waitangi – Treaty of Waitangi
- $2.20 1893 Women’s Suffrage Petition -Te Petihana Whakamana Pōti Wahine.

The stamps go on sale at New Zealand Post shops and agencies throughout the country from today, and will be available for a year.

“It’s very fitting these taonga are being launched as stamps,” says Mr Dunne.

“By their nature stamps signify connection. Sending a letter is an act of one person connecting with another. Some of us may send fewer letters these days, but the delight in receiving a hand written message, complete with a beautiful stamp affixed, has never diminished.

“Commemorating our nation’s three founding documents with stamps provides an opportunity for New Zealanders, and the world, to appreciate their historical significance, and for future generations to reflect on how we have acknowledged and shown respect for the past.

“I am certain that the *He Tohu* exhibition and these stamps will help create many more connections between New Zealanders and their nation’s history,” Mr Dunne said.

The *He Tohu* exhibition, which is free of charge and opens to the public on Saturday, 20 May 2017, is at the National Library of New Zealand in Wellington.

**Ka whakaputaina e New Zealand Post ngā panekuini whakamaumahara mō te whakatuwheratanga o te whakaaturanga *He Tohu***

Kua whakaputaina e New Zealand Post i te rā nei he huinga panekuini e toru hei whakamaumahara i te whakatuwheratanga o te *He Tohu*, he whakaaturanga pūmau hou o ngā tuhinga tūāpapa rongonui o Aotearoa i Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa i Te Whanganui-a-Tara.

I whakarewahia ngā panekuini i te Whare Pāremata e te Minita o Te Tari Taiwhenua, a Hōnore Peter Dunne, me Taku Parai nō te Rōpū Rangatira ā-Iwi mō *He Tohu*, me te Heamana o New Zealand Post a Jane Taylor.

He mea waihanga tahi te whakaaturanga a *He Tohu* i waenga i Karauna me te iwi Māori.

Ko ngā panekuini e toru o *He Tohu* ko te:

- $1.00 1835 He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni
- $2.00 1840 Te Tiriti o Waitangi
- $2.20 1893 Te Petihana Whakamana Pōti Wahine.

Ka tīmata te hokona o ngā panekuini i ngā toa New Zealand Post me ōna umanga puta noa i te motu mai i tēnei rā, ā, ka wātea mai mō te kotahi tau.

"Ka tika kia whakarewahia ēnei taonga hei panekuini," te kī a Hōnore Peter Dunne, Minita o Te Tari Taiwhenua.

"Ko te āhua o te panekuini he tohu i te hononga. Mā te tuku reta kei te tūhono te tangata tētahi ki tētahi. Kua iti haere ake pea te tuku reta a ētahi o tātau i ēnei rā, engari e kore e mimiti te hari o te ngākau i te whiwhi karere ā-tuhi, me tētahi panekuini ātaahua," te kī a Minita Dunne.

"Mā te whakamaumahara i ā tātau tuhinga tūāpapa e toru hei panekuini ka whai wāhi te iwi o Aotearoa me te ao, ki te whakamaioha i te hiranga tuku iho, hei whakaaroaro hoki mā ngā reanga e whai ake mō te āhua o tā tātau whakamana, whakaute hoki i ngā āhuatanga o mua.

"E pono ana ahau ka āwhina a *He Tohu* me ēnei panekuini kia nui ake ngā tūhonohononga ki te hītori o Aotearoa," te kī a Minita Dunne.

Kāore he utu mō *He Tohu*, ā, ka tuwhera ki te iwi whānui hei te Rāhoroi, 20 o Haratua 2017, ki Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa i Te Whanganui-a-Tara.
