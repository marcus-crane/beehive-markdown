Māori tourism operators will be able to create new employment opportunities for whānau with $10 million of operating funding over four years in this year’s Budget, Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says.

“A big driver for tourists visiting Aōtearoa New Zealand is to experience Māori culture. It is unique and sets us apart from other global destinations,” Mr Flavell says.

“I’m excited by the opportunities for Māori tourism operators and whānau employment prospects provided by the expanding tourism industry.”

The funding boost in Budget 2017 for New Zealand Māori Tourism – Te Tāpoi Ararau – will allow it to extend existing support to build the capability and capacity of Māori tourism operators.

“A programme to showcase Māori historical tour trails to be piloted in East Coast/Bay of Plenty will be funded. It will be a boost for the region and we hope tourists, both domestic and international, will take the chance to learn a little bit more about our past,” Mr Flavell says.

*He Kai Kei Aku Ringa*, the Crown-Māori economic growth partnership, recognises that regional economic development requires initiatives that are Māori-led and government-enabled. A fund of $2 million will be reallocated to help grow Māori enterprises and create more jobs in the regions.
