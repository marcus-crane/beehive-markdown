Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says today’s signing of the care and support workers’ $2 billion pay equity settlement in an important milestone.

Dr Coleman and representatives from the Ministry of Health, ACC, DHBs and Unions, along with care worker Kristine Bartlett, signed the historic settlement at Parliament today.

“The Government announced the $2 billion pay equity settlement for 55,000 care and support workers over five years in mid-April,” says Dr Coleman.

“Today’s signing of the care and support workers’ pay equity settlement is an essential step towards implementing the new wage structure on 1 July 2017.

“The signing of this agreement means that on 1 July this dedicated and predominantly female workforce will receive a pay rise of around 15 and 50 per cent. For a full-time worker, this means they will be taking home at least an extra $100 a week, or more than $5,000 a year.

“Implementation of the settlement is complex as there’s approximately 1,000 providers and 4,000 contracts that will need to be amended.

“To ensure workers receive their new wages from 1 July, unions are holding ratification meetings around the country and the Ministry of Health is holding regional meetings to help funders and providers better understand their obligations. I will also be introducing legislation to Parliament shortly.

“I would again like to thank the unions and sector associations for their constructive and positive approach throughout the negotiations over the past 20 months.”
