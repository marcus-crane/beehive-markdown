More whānau will get access to Whānau Ora support across the country with the injection of $10 million of new operating funding over four years in this year’s Budget, Whānau Ora Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says.

The funding is in addition to the $40 million boost Whānau Ora received in Budget 2016, and the $50 million in Budget 2015.

“Whānau are achieving greater outcomes through Whānau Ora, and this additional investment will support a further 2,500 whānau over the next four years to achieve their aspirations,” Mr Flavell says.

“Budget 2017 also includes $9 million of new operating funding over four years to support whānau-centred family violence interventions. We need to break the cycle of family violence, and we know whānau-centred, kaupapa-based approaches lead to positive, long-term outcomes for Māori.

“The funding will include new money to pilot the introduction of facilitators who will support whānau to access appropriate help to end violent behaviour.”

Work to help reduce suicide and self-harm among Māori youth will receive $8 million over four years, which will be used to extend funding to the Rangatahi Suicide Prevention Fund – Oranga Rangatahi.

“Those providers working to reduce suicide among Māori youth need all the help they can get, and this builds on the hugely successful work in that area in recent years,” Mr Flavell says.

Whānau living in rural communities in the Mātaatua and East Coast rohe will get better access to subsidised health services with $1 million allocated in 2017/18 to fund a Waka Oranga, mobile health clinic.

“The mobile health clinic will allow health services to be delivered closer to the homes of whānau,” Mr Flavell says.
