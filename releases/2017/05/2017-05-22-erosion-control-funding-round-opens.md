Associate Minister for Primary Industries Louise Upston has welcomed the opening of the next round of funding for erosion control in the Gisborne region.

The Ministry of Primary Industries’ Erosion Control Funding Programme (ECFP) helps eligible land owners in the region contain erosion and improve susceptible land.

Improvements were recently made to the programme, including providing upfront funding to reduce the financial burden for land owners and extending the land categories eligible for treatment.

“We hope that these changes will enable more land owners to take up the funding opportunity,” says Ms Upston.

“Severe erosion causes long-term damage to the productivity of rural land. It threatens communities and rural businesses and damages infrastructure.”

The ECFP was established in 1992 and MPI works closely with Gisborne District Council and Te Runanganui o Ngāti Porou to deliver the programme.

Last year 37 applications totalling $2.39 million covering 1438ha were approved.

The latest funding round is open from today until 30 June 2017.

Community groups, iwi and other organisations are also now able to apply for funding for projects to reduce erosion in the region. Access to this project funding is available year round and more information on eligibility and the application process will be available early next month.
