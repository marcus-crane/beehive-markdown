Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that the Ministry of Education will work with schools and communities to develop an Area Strategy for the Havelock North/Hastings area, as well as Napier if necessary.

“An Area Strategy looks at the education needs in a particular location and how these will be addressed, taking into account factors such as projected population and roll growth,” says Ms Kaye.

“Information gathering for the strategy will begin now, but the key work will happen in 2018.

“We know that schools in Havelock North are experiencing roll growth and extra classrooms are already on the way to help address this.

“Four new classrooms will be delivered this year for Havelock North Primary School, along with two classrooms each for Lucknow and Te Mata Primary Schools.

“The Area Strategy will consider medium and long term population growth, as well as how the existing network of schools could accommodate this growth. It will also consider the school property requirements needed to support a quality education network for the local community.

“I met with the principals of Havelock North’s three primary schools today, to inform them of the strategy and discuss their views about local education provision.

“I acknowledged concerns around the pace of delivery of some of the new classrooms. This has been affected by factors including extending project scope after the initial timeline was developed, and I reassured the principals that the Ministry expects all the new classrooms to be delivered by the end of this year.”

Ms Kaye says work is also continuing towards confirming a new site for Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Wānanga Whare Tāpere o Takitimu.

“Last year, following an environmental evaluation, the Ministry decided that the Arataki Road site previously proposed for the kura is unsuitable for education purposes,” says Ms Kaye.

“A preferred new site has been identified and due diligence is being carried out. 

“Meanwhile, the Arataki Road site has been transferred to LINZ for disposal, in line with the provisions of the Public Works Act 1981.

“Student safety and wellbeing will always be paramount, which is why the Ministry sought alternative sites for the new kura.

“The Government recognises the important part that a school’s physical environment plays in supporting the success of students.

“In the Hawke’s Bay region, we’ve announced around $5.9 million for new classrooms and $19 million for school redevelopments since June 2016.

“Relocating and rebuilding Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Te Wānanga Whare Tāpere o Takitimu could see an additional estimated investment of around $12 million, including land purchase, design and construction.

“In total, this represents an investment of up to around $37 million in Hawke’s Bay school infrastructure.

“We’re committed to modernising and expanding schools to meet the needs of local communities, which is why we’ve invested more than $5 billion since 2008 towards new and upgraded school infrastructure across New Zealand.”
