The Government will invest $9.17 billion in capital into New Zealand’s state highway network over the next four years through the New Zealand Transport Agency, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

“This will be the Government’s biggest ever investment in our state highway network and it is a key pillar of the Government’s commitment to building the infrastructure for a growing country,” Mr Bridges says.

The $9.17 billion is made up of:

- $4.84 billion from the National Land Transport Fund.
- $1.00 billion  in committed Crown funding for the reinstatement of State Highway 1 between Picton and Christchurch, Auckland Transport Package and Regional State Highways Package.
- $1.43 billion in public-private partnerships (Transmission Gully and Puhoi to Warkworth).
- $1.90 billion in other funding from NZTA (primarily depreciation funding).

Budget 2017 provides $812 million in total for the reinstatement of damaged sections of State Highway 1 between Picton and Christchurch following the Kaikōura earthquakes.

“This essential investment not only provides for a more resilient and safer transport system, but  the increased network capacity supports economic growth throughout New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.

Key projects being progressed over the next four years include:

- The completion of Auckland’s Western Ring Route.
- The Northern and Southern Corridor State Highway 1 improvements in Auckland.
- The East-West Link in Auckland.
- The Huntly and Hamilton sections of the Waikato Expressway.
- The State Highway 1 Peka Peka to Ōtaki Expressway.
- The Northern Arterial and the Southern Motorway Extension in Christchurch.
- The Transmission Gully and Pūhoi to Warkworth Public Private Partnerships.
- The Whirokino trestle bridge replacement in Manawatu-Whanganui.
- The Mt Messenger-Awakino Gorge corridor in Taranaki.
- The Motu Bridge replacement in Gisborne.

“The Government expects to open 540 new lane kilometres of state highways over the next four years.  This will be the largest increase in state highway capacity in decades,” Mr Bridges says.

“A key focus of the programme is the completion of the current Roads of National Significance projects.  These are lead infrastructure projects that link our major cities with the regions, and link our export sectors with the key ports. They help promote economic growth while increasing the ability to move people and freight around safely and reliably.”

“We are also investing more in regional roading projects that improve journey times and reliability, and remove bottlenecks. The regional investments are also hugely important for our growing tourism industry.”
