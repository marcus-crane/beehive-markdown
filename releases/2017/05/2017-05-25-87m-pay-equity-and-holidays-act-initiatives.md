Budget 2017 provides $8.7 million of operating funding over the next four years for initiatives to support pay equity dispute resolution and Holidays Act compliance, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

“The Government is committed to achieving pay equity in New Zealand and ensuring we have the resources to settle pay equity claims in a timely manner,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The $8.7 million is made up of $6.7 million of new funding and $2 million reprioritised from existing baselines. 

“$5.3 million towards pay equity dispute resolution will provide for the adequate resourcing of mediation services for pay equity issues,” Mr Woodhouse says.  

“Prompt and effective mediation for pay equity cases will benefit employers and employees by reducing time and costs associated with protracted employment disputes, leading to more productive employment relationships.

“Budget 2017 also supports the effective delivery of the Holidays Act compliance strategy by providing $3.4 million to the Labour Inspectorate.

“The strategy benefits employees by ensuring remediation of historical underpayment for holidays and leave, as well as correct payment in the future,” Mr Woodhouse says.  

“The additional funding allows the Labour Inspectorate to continue this important work alongside its other regulatory activities to ensure our employment law is being applied fairly and consistently.”
