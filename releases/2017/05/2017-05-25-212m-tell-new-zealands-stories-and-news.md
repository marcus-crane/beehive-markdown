Budget 2017 includes a significant investment in Radio New Zealand, as well as new funding to support the understanding of our most important national stories, Ms Barry says.

Radio New Zealand will receive an additional $11.4 million of operating funding over the next four years to allow for investment in new modern technology and improved capability.

“RNZ provides a high quality, responsive service. The new funding will ensure it remains an accessible and sustainable public broadcaster,” Ms Barry says.

“Like many New Zealanders, I was acutely aware of the importance of RNZ during the 2016 earthquakes. In times of pressure and emergency we look to certain organisations to help us through – RNZ is one of those organisations.’’

The Government will also provide a further $5 million of operating funding over the next three years for the *Encounters 250* programme.

“*Encounters 250* will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the first meetings of Māori and Europeans when James Cook and the Polynesian navigator Tupaia first circumnavigated and landed in 1769,” Ms Barry says.

“This new funding, which takes the total Government investment to $8.5 million, will ensure a special and accessible commemoration across the landing sites in 2019 that acknowledges the impact of that first meeting for all New Zealanders.”

Budget 2017 also provides $4.8 million of operating funding over the next four years for the operation of Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, the Queen Elizabeth ll Education Centre and for continued investment in newly found Māori heritage treasured objects taonga tuturu.

“British, Belgian and American memorials will be unveiled gradually through the year and a French memorial will be installed early next year at Pukeahu in time for ANZAC Day 2018,” Ms Barry says.
