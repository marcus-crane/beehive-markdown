Ua saunoa le Minisita o le Matagaluega mo Tagata Pasifika i Niu Sila, Alfred Ngaro – “O le vaiaso o le gagana Samoa, o se avanoa mo Niu Sila atoa e ma’au ma fiafia fa’atasi i le felanulanua’i o gagana ma aganu’u taitasi, aemaise ia maua’a le gagana”

Sāmoan Language week gives all New Zealanders the opportunity to celebrate our diversity and keep the language alive says Minister for Pacific Peoples, Alfred Ngaro.

“I’d love to see more of our young people, regardless of their ethnicity, leading the way and embracing Gagana Sāmoa,” says Mr Ngaro.

“Regardless of your heritage there’s no doubt that Gagana Sāmoa and Fa’a Sāmoa make a massive contribution to modern New Zealand.

“With renewed interest internationally in Pacific cultures, in large part because of the hugely successful Moana film, Vaiaso o le Gagana Sāmoa presents an opportunity for us to showcase and celebrate Gagana Sāmoa.

“I’d encourage everyone to give Gagana Sāmoa a go this week whether through song, dance, or using words and phrases.”

Vaiaso o le Gagana Sāmoa runs from Sunday 28 May through to Saturday 3 June 2017.

The theme for the week this year is “Ma’au i lou ofaga. Maua’a lou fa’asinomaga”, or in English, “keep your identity alive to thrive”.
