Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett and Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee have today announced that New Zealand will provide $1.3 million to support Fiji’s presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year.

“At last year’s conference in Marrakech, Fiji was selected to take up the role of president of this significant event,” Mrs Bennett says.

“This is a major undertaking for any country and these important talks will bring together climate experts officials and leaders from around the world.

“In addition to our financial support, New Zealand climate change ambassador Jo Tyndall will be available as an on-call adviser.”

Mr Brownlee says the conference will be important for maintaining momentum in negotiating the rules which will bring the Paris Agreement on climate change into effect.

“This is also the first time a Pacific Island nation has taken leadership of this conference.

“Given the significant impact of climate change on the Pacific, we are committed to supporting Fiji’s presidency and helping them to ensure the talks are successful,” Mr Brownlee says.

The conference begins on 6 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany.
