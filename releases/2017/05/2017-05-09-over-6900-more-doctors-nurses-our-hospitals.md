Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a record number of doctors and nurses are working in DHBs across the country.

“Our dedicated health workforce is making a difference to the lives of New Zealanders. More doctors and nurses in our DHBs means faster treatment and better experiences for patients and their families,” says Dr Coleman.

As of 31 March 2017, there were almost 8,200 doctor full-time-equivalents and nearly 23,000 nurse full-time equivalents employed by DHBs – that’s over 2,250 more doctors and over 4,640 more nurses compared to 2008.

In total the number of doctors and nurses working in DHBs across the country has increased by over 6,900 since 2008 - an increase of over 28 per cent.

This includes over 1,220 more senior doctors, an increase of almost 45 per cent, and over 1,210 more senior nurses, an increase of over 45 per cent.

“Recently I welcomed the Health and Independence report which shows that overall, the health and disability system performs well for most New Zealanders.

“However, the report outlines the challenges facing the sector, such as an ageing population.

“The New Zealand Health Strategy positions the health sector to respond to the changing and ageing nature of our population and works to ensure that the health workforce is well equipped to handle current and future demands.

The health workforce is supported by the extra $568 million being invested into the health sector this year - the biggest single increase in seven years - taking the health budget to a record $16.1 billion in 2016/17.”
