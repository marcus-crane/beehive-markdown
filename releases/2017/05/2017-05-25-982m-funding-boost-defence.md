New Zealand’s Defence Force will receive a $406 million boost in operating funding over four years and $576 million in capital as part of Budget 2017, says Defence Minister Mark Mitchell.

“It is vital that the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) has what it needs to meet the country’s security and defence interests. This major increase in funding for the armed services will support a range of NZDF capabilities as identified through the Defence White Paper of 2016,” Mr Mitchell says.

“One of our biggest priorities is ensuring the NZDF has the right people with the right training ready when needed, and this funding will support a range of personnel initiatives.

“It will also go towards a variety of new initiatives and projects in train already, including a cyber security support capability for the protection of NZDF communication networks, a new pilot training capability service, and more funding for our helicopter fleets.”

The capital funding includes:

- $100 million to improve defence camps and bases throughout the country, including facility upgrades in Auckland, Manawatu and Canterbury.
- $301.7 million for the Littoral Operations Support Ship and the Frigate Communications Upgrade.
- $36.1 million to replace the underwater intelligence, surveillance systems fitted to the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s six P-3K2 Orions.
- $28.2 million for counter-explosive hazard and counter-improvised explosive device capability.
- $110 million to invest in a modern, efficient logistics system that will enable smaller fleets of military equipment to be held and to ensure that equipment is safe.

“Our Defence Force has to be modern and able to operate in a wide range of tasks and environments, both on its own and with our partners,” Mr Mitchell says.

“The ongoing defence and security of New Zealand and the protection of our interests requires significant investment in our Defence Force, and this Budget provides that.”
