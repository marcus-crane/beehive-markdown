With Student Volunteer Week celebrations kicking off, Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Alfred Ngaro says young people have an opportunity to learn new skills, contribute to the causes they value and be part of a national movement this week.

Student Volunteer Week is in its third year in New Zealand and runs from 1-7 May.

“Student Volunteer Week celebrates those students already making a difference in their communities and encourages others to give it a go,” says Mr Ngaro.

“Schools, universities and volunteer organisations take part in the celebrations and there are special events and opportunities available for us all to look into.

“Volunteering does so much for New Zealand. Every year volunteers contribute about $3.5 billion in labour. But what’s also important is the impact that volunteering has on those who volunteer.

“Whether it’s a general feeling of satisfaction at making a difference, the social nature of many opportunities or the new skills you may acquire, volunteering has as much to offer volunteers as it does to communities more generally.

“I’d encourage all our students to look up the opportunities and events in their area and to give volunteering a go.”
