Today (Sunday) and tomorrow mark two international days for children and the Minister for Children, Hon Tracey Martin is asking New Zealanders to reflect on our tamariki and do something extra for them.

 “Today, like every day, is a day to remember and look out for the wellbeing of our children,” Children’s Minister Hon Tracey Martin says, marking International Day of Prevention of Child Abuse (19 November) and welcoming UN Universal Children’s Day (20 November).

 “It’s important to support and acknowledge the special days we have designated for our children and I invite everyone today to do something extra for a child. Children note all the things in their environment, good and bad, praise and criticism, love and neglect, and we know from our international comparisons New Zealand can do better.  Small acts of kindness, the things that make kids smile, are what help children grow and reach their potential.

 “I’d also suggest bigger commitments, such as coaching children’s sport, helping the local board of trustees, or donating to children’s charities.  And we need more social workers and caregivers - more New Zealanders need to put their hands up for this vital work.”

 “There’s nothing more important to New Zealand than the wellbeing of its children.”

 Mrs Martin said that the new Government was aware of the issues that face the nation’s families and children and was making our kids, who are our future, a priority.

 “We’re going to have child poverty reduction measures and targets, and we’re going to have a families’ package – they’re part of the 100 day commitments. We’ll also continue with the approach taken with Oranga Tamariki in putting children first and ensuring the voices of children are heard.

 “But no government and no government agency alone can ensure our children get the support and love they deserve. That’s over to us and how we act as families; as whanau; as communities; as neighbours.

 “Every day is a day to remember our children.”

 The Minister said that, as a nation, we had to better to prevent child abuse.

 “If you know a child who you believe or suspect is in danger or facing a form of physical or emotional abuse – put them first and make a call.”
