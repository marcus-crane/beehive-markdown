Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern supports the call from a wide range of groups for a non-partisan approach to reducing child poverty.

“Labour is committed to introducing legislation in our first 100 days to establish targets and measure progress in reducing child poverty.

“Every government should have at the core of its objectives, the aim to lift children out of poverty.

“All our work should be geared towards this, regardless of our political views. No government should be afraid of being measured in this way.

“Every child should be able to grow up and reach their potential without the burden of poverty.

“I intend to reach out to the Opposition over coming weeks to talk through our draft legislation. I hope it receives widespread support.

“It’s time for a durable, long-term commitment to tackling child poverty and I’m keen to lead the way,” says Prime Minister Ardern.
