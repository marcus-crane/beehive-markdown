New Zealand’s top researchers have been awarded $84.6 million in grants through the 2017 Marsden Fund investment round, Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods announced today.

One hundred and thirty three (133) successful proposals will receive funding over the next three years and represent a diverse range of research topics from climate change, volcanic eruptions, to the lifecycle of galaxies.

“The Marsden Fund supports our top researchers to conduct excellent research across science, mathematics, engineering, social science and the humanities,” says Dr Woods.

“Through this Fund, the recipients will undertake research of the highest quality in their fields of expertise and raise the standard of research in New Zealand. The Marsden Fund is integral in growing New Zealand as an innovation-led society and economy, and boosting our R&D investment.

“The diversity and strength of the research funded will have many flow-on effects for New Zealand’s science and innovation system, as well as the potential for long-term benefit for our environment, society and the economy. I congratulate all of the recipients announced today.”

The Marsden Fund is administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand. Proposals are evaluated by independent assessment panels and the final recommendations for funding are made by the Marsden Fund Council, which is chaired by Professor Juliet Gerrard.
