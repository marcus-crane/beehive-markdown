Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister, the Rt Hon Winston Peters, has condemned the terrorist attack in Egypt’s North Sinai which has killed more than 230 people and injured over 100 more, making it the deadliest attack in Egyptian history.

The attack took place today during Friday prayers (Egypt time) when gunmen opened fire on worshippers in the mosque, as well as detonating bombs.

“New Zealand strongly condemns this cowardly attack on innocent people at prayer and conveys its condolences to the Government of Egypt and the families and loved ones of those affected.” Mr Peters says.

The area where the attack took place is one of two areas in Egypt which New Zealand’s travel advisory classifies as an extreme risk due to the threat of terrorism, kidnapping and the presence of armed groups. 

“Our embassy in Cairo is monitoring the situation closely and there is no indication of any New Zealand casualties," Mr Peters says.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade advice to New Zealanders travelling to Egypt is available on [www.safetravel.govt.nz](http://www.safetravel.govt.nz/).
