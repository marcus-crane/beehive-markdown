New Zealand has endorsed the Bonn Communique of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition on Tackling Air Pollution to Save Lives and Protect the Environment.

 Climate Change Minister James Shaw endorsed the communique at the COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, overnight New Zealand time.

 The communique focuses on “super pollutant” short-lived gases that cause air pollution and climate change, such as methane.

 “It’s really good to see the momentum and hard work that’s going into finding solutions for agricultural and waste emissions,” Mr Shaw says.

 “Endorsing this Bonn Communique recognises the important role that New Zealand plays internationally looking for ways to tackle agricultural climate pollution.

 “We’ve known for a long time that tackling agricultural climate pollution and other sources of air pollution are critical to addressing climate change and ensuring we leave a stable climate for future generations.

“The Green Party’s confidence and supply agreement with Labour commits to significant reductions in waste to landfill by 2020, and this Bonn Communique recognises how important work to reduce waste emissions is.

“Auckland City has committed to a very ambitious target of zero waste by 2040. The new Government is proud of the leadership Auckland is showing. We support that goal, both at home and on the world stage,” Mr Shaw says.
