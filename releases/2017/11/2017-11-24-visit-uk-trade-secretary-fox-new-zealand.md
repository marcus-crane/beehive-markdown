Minister for Trade and Export Growth David Parker has confirmed that United Kingdom Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox will visit New Zealand between 25 and 28 November.

 

“New Zealand and the United Kingdom enjoy a uniquely close and important friendship,” Mr Parker says.  

 

“We have long-standing and deep family connections. Our countries promote shared values and respect for international norms. We share extensive defence and security links, as well as significant business and investment ties.

 

“New Zealand and the United Kingdom are both strong advocates for progressive and inclusive trade. We are important trading partners and have committed to laying the foundations for a UK-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement once the UK leaves the EU.

 

“We welcome Secretary Fox’s visit as an opportunity to strengthen our close relationship at a time when the United Kingdom is seeking to reshape its relationships around the world following its decision to leave the European Union,” Mr Parker says.

 

While in New Zealand, Secretary Fox will visit Auckland and Wellington, meeting with senior ministers and engaging with the business community.
