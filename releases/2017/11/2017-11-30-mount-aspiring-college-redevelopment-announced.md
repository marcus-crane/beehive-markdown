Around $13 million will be invested to redevelop Mount Aspiring College, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced today.

 

“This investment recognises that Mount Aspiring College is growing rapidly, and needs both expansion and modernisation to cope with their expanding roll,” says Mr Hipkins.

 

“This project is an example of the Government’s commitment to the school and its students, by providing teaching spaces and a physical environment that supports improved learning outcomes.”

 

The redevelopment will include:

 

- 18 new teaching spaces
- Modernisation of 5 existing teaching spaces
- The demolition of four outdated teaching spaces.

Mr Hipkins said now that funding and the broad scope of this project has been approved, the Ministry of Education will work with the school on the specific details of the redevelopment, ensuring that the new teaching spaces are designed to support the school’s vision for learning.

 “The Government is committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand can learn in an environment that inspires and supports them to achieve to the best of their potential.”

 

“Wanaka is one of the fastest-growing towns in New Zealand, and it’s vital that we reflect that growth through delivering this project,” said Mr Hipkins.

 

The redevelopment is expected to start in early 2018 and is anticipated to take approximately three years to complete.
