A new report launched today by the Associate Minister for Transport Julie Anne Genter shows that supporting more people to walk and cycle for transport could have significant public health benefits.

 Minister Genter today launched the *Transport Outlook Future State* report, produced by the Ministry of Transport, and the *Shared Mobility Simulations for Auckland,* prepared by the International Transport Forum for Auckland Transport and the Ministry of Transport.

 “The Transport Outlook report shows that around 260 premature deaths could be prevented if walking and cycling trips increased by about 50 percent and 250 percent respectively,” said Associate Minister for Transport Julie Anne Genter.

 “If we ensure our streets are safer for cycling and walking it’ll be easier for all of us to get a bit more exercise on our way to work, school or just getting around town. That’s great for both our physical and mental health.

 “Ministry of Transport modelling shows a big increase in walking and cycling is possible with safe cycling infrastructure and more medium-density housing in the central cities and inner suburbs.

 “We know that regular physical exercise halves the risk of conditions such as stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. However, less than half of adult New Zealanders get the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.

 “This is why the new Government has made a commitment to increase funding in the transport budget for walking and cycling infrastructure.

 “It’s important to note, however, that a number of the other scenarios in the Transport Outlook report reflect policies of the previous Government. I would expect some different outcomes from the new Government’s approach to transport.

 “The Shared Mobility report looked at the role on-demand taxi-bus and shared taxi services could play in Auckland.

 “The report suggests that shared mobility could provide feeder services connecting with rapid rail and bus lines. This could reduce congestion and the number of car parks needed in central Auckland," said Ms Genter.
