**NZ welcomes Mugabe’s resignation**

 

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister the Rt Hon Winston Peters has welcomed the resignation of Zimbabwe’s President, Robert Mugabe, who voluntarily stepped down today after 37 years.

 

“This moment will be seen as a critical point in the history of Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean people have voiced their support for change in a peaceful way.”

 

“New Zealand has made its position on the Mugabe regime clear over the years. Zimbabwe has suffered enormously under Robert Mugabe’s presidency through economic oppression, corruption and a blatant disregard for democracy and human rights,” Mr Peters says.

 

New Zealand has travel bans in place for Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace due to the destructive conduct of Mugabe’s government.

 

“The Zimbabwean people have an opportunity to hold free and fair elections as soon as possible to determine the future direction of their country.

 

“New Zealand supports the efforts of the Zimbabwean people to uphold democracy and to return to a prosperous and vibrant country free of oppression,” Mr Peters says.
