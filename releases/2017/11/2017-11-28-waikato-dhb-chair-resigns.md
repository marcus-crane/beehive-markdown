Health Minister Dr David Clark has accepted Waikato District Health Board chair Bob Simcock’s resignation this afternoon.

His resignation as chair and board member will take effect immediately. 

“It was the right decision for him to make under the circumstances,” says Dr Clark.

“The DHB’s deputy chair, Sally Webb, has agreed to step in as acting chair, which I am grateful for and have confidence she will manage the role to a high standard while I consider long-term options.

“It’s still very important to fully review the findings from the State Services Commission’s investigation into allegations of wrongful expenditure of public money by the DHB’s former chief executive, Dr Nigel Murray.

“I believe that Mr John Ombler QSO will provide an interim report early in 2018.

“I am unable to comment further at this stage while the investigation is still underway,” says Dr Clark.
