The news that the road toll for 2017 has now surpassed the total for 2016 is tragic news, says Associate Minister for Transport Julie Anne Genter.

“This year we’ve already seen 330 people lose their lives on New Zealand’s roads.

“Every death on our roads is a tragedy and the high number this year is quite simply unacceptable.

“The road toll has been going up over the last four years and is now the highest it’s been since 2010. My number one priority in the transport portfolio is to bring the road toll down.

“In recent years expensive roading projects have been the priority and road safety has taken a back seat.

“This government will be exploring all options to improve road safety including reallocating funding to target high risk roads.

“Every life lost leaves behind a devastated family and community. We have to do better.

“In addition, all of us have a responsibility to make our roads safer. It’s the basics, like wearing a seatbelt at all times, driving to the conditions, and stopping a mate from driving home drunk,” said Ms Genter.
