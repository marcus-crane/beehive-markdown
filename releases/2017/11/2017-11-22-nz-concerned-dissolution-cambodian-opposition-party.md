The New Zealand government is dismayed by the recent decision of Cambodian authorities to dissolve the country’s main opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters says.

 

“New Zealand is a long-standing partner of Cambodia, and this latest blow to Cambodia’s democracy is deeply concerning.

 

“There is now a serious question over the legitimacy of Cambodia’s general

election next year, in which Prime Minister Hun Sen will stand largely unchallenged,” Mr Peters says.

 

“New Zealand calls on Prime Minister Hun Sen to urgently restore freedom of expression and political choice for the people of Cambodia.”

 

The dissolution of the Cambodian National Rescue Party is the latest in a series of concerning actions in the country, including the ongoing detention of the Cambodian National Rescue Party’s leader, Kem Sokha.
