Associate Minister of Health Jenny Salesa is excited to announce applications are now open for the 2018 Ministry of Health Pacific Health Scholarships.  

The Scholarships are available to Pacific students aiming to complete a health-related tertiary course, who are committed to improving Pacific health. Preference is given to those studying in medicine, nursing, midwifery, oral health, and allied health. Since 2002 when the Scholarships began, over 1,500 Scholarships have been awarded.

“The Scholarships are an important pillar of the health system as we look to grow the Pacific health workforce,” says Hon Jenny Salesa.

“While the 2013 census counted 7.4% of New Zealand residents as being of Pacific origin, the proportion of doctors and nurses identified as of Pacific origin was 1.8% and 2.6% respectively.

“The Scholarships acknowledge the important role Pacific people continue to play in our health workforce, as we work towards reducing health inequalities affecting Pacific communities in Aotearoa, New Zealand.”

Over $1.0M has been allocated for the 2018 Scholarships. The Scholarships are paid directly to tertiary institutions as a contribution towards tuition fees and will pay:

- up to $10,000.00 for Medical and Dentistry students
- up to  $5,000.00 for all remaining health qualifications

Applications will **close on 6 February 2018 at 5 pm.**
