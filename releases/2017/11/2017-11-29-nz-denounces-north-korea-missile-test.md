Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has denounced North Korea’s latest ballistic missile test. The test, which took place this morning, is North Korea’s third test flight of an inter-continental ballistic missile.

“This missile test is deeply disappointing,” Mr Peters says.

“It is in breach of UN Security Council resolutions which bans all such missile tests by North Korea.”

“New Zealand is committed to the continuing international effort to persuade North Korea to disband its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes,” he said

“It is incumbent on all of us to continue sending the message that the international community is united in opposition to North Korea’s actions. We will continue to do our part, including by fully implementing UN sanctions.

“New Zealand supports a diplomatic solution to this threat to global security. All parties must continue to consider how this could be achieved,” said Mr Peters.

“New Zealand, once again, urges North Korea to abide by its international obligations, refrain from further testing and take steps which can enable international dialogue,” he said.
