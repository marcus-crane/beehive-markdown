Fisheries Minister Stuart Nash has instructed Ministry for Primary Industries officials to look at options for slowing down the implementation of IEMRS (Integrated Electronic Monitoring and Reporting System) on commercial fishing vessels.

 “I am aware that a range of issues have been raised so I have made this decision following advice from officials, and discussion with a number of stakeholders,” says Mr Nash.

 Under the current timeframes all commercial fishers would be required to use Geospatial Position Reporting and e-logbooks by 1 April 2018, and the rollout of cameras would begin on 1 October 2018.

“Digital monitoring will give confidence to New Zealanders, and consumers from around the world, that fish from our waters are being managed and caught sustainably.

“However, we need to be satisfied that the systems are robust in the interests of all stakeholders.

“This is an important initiative to get right, and we will not be following the hasty timetable set by the previous Government.

“I am working with MPI officials on options for timing and these will be communicated once a decision has been made.”

The requirements covering the catch and position reporting for trawl vessels over 28m have been in place since 1 October 2017. These requirements will continue.

Implementation for other vessels will be deferred while options for the remaining roll out are worked through.

Further information on IEMRS is available on the MPI website: [https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/sustainable-fisheries/strengthening-fisheries-management/future-of-our-fisheries/digital-monitoring-of-commercial-fishing/](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/sustainable-fisheries/strengthening-fisheries-management/future-of-our-fisheries/digital-monitoring-of-commercial-fishing/).

“I look forward to working further with stakeholders and officials on the roll out of IEMRS.”
