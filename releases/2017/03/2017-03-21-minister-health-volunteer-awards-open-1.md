Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says nominations are now open for the 2017 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards.

“These awards help to recognise the thousands of unsung heroes who support New Zealand’s health and disability services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Health volunteers make life better for New Zealanders in many ways, often without seeking any recognition.

“Last year’s award recipients ranged from helping people to navigate their way around hospitals and health services, to visiting isolated older people in their homes.

“If you know an individual or team of volunteers who deserve to be recognised, I encourage you to nominate them.”

Last year the overall winner of the Health Volunteer Awards was ‘Sing Your Lungs Out’, a choir for people with severe respiratory disease.

The choir meets weekly in the Wellington region and is a good example of health professional’s combining their skills to deliver an innovative approach to improving people’s quality of life.

Choir members have noticed significant benefits from singing including enhanced physical and mental wellbeing.

To mark applications for the awards opening today the choir gathered at Parliament to showcase their talent.

Nominations close on 21 April 2017. The Awards will be presented during National Volunteer Week, 18 – 24 June.
