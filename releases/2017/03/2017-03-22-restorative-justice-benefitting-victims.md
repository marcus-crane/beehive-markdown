The vast majority of victims who participated in restorative justice benefitted from the process, according to a survey released today by Justice Minister Amy Adams.

Restorative justice conferences are face-to-face meetings between victims and offenders, where they can discuss the crime and the harm caused.

“Restorative justice is an important part of giving victims of crime more support and a stronger voice,” says Ms Adams.

“The 2016 Victim Satisfaction Survey found that 75 per cent of victims surveyed were able to say how restorative justice benefitted them. Responses included that the offender heard how the crime affected the victim and that the victim felt they could move on.”

The survey also found that 86 per cent of victims of family violence were satisfied with restorative justice.

“Tackling family violence is a key priority for the Government. These results demonstrate that restorative justice can reduce the devastating impact that family violence has on victims,” says Ms Adams.

Other findings of the survey show that 84 per cent of respondents were satisfied with the restorative justice conference they took part in, up from 82 per cent in 2011. 81 per cent of respondents said they would recommend the process to other people.

The results of survey come after recent findings that show restorative justice reduces reoffending. Data from 2008 to 2013 shows reoffending rates for those who participated in the service within 12 months was 15 per cent lower than comparable offenders who did not participate.
