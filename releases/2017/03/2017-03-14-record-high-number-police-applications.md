The number of people applying to join Police has hit a new high in 2017 following a successful summer recruitment campaign.

In January and February 1351 people applied to join Police, twice the number of applications at the same time in 2016. Police Minister Paula Bennett says the record numbers are a promising start following the Government’s announcement of 1125 new Police staff over the next four years.

“This is a positive first step towards our target of 880 new sworn officers by 2021. Interest in joining Police has been strong following Police’s summer recruitment drive, and the Government’s $500 million *Safer Communities* investment announced in February,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Along with completed applications, we’re also seeing more New Zealanders interested in joining the Police. More than 50,000 people visited the newcops.co.nz website in January, and there are more people taking steps to begin the recruitment process.

“What’s most exciting is the 61 per cent increase in women who were interested in becoming new cops in January compared with the same time last year. It’s a sign New Zealanders have confidence in our Police and want to play a part in keeping our communities safe.”

The Royal New Zealand Police College is currently preparing to train 220 additional police per year over the next four years and will double the average wing size from 40 to 80 recruits. For more information visit [newcops.co.nz](http://www.newcops.co.nz/).
