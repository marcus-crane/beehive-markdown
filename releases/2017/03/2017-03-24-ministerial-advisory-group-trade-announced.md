Trade Minister Todd McClay has announced the formation of a Ministerial Advisory Group on trade to ensure the public is better informed on trade issues.

The Ministerial Advisory Group (MAG), part of today’s Trade Agenda 2030 announcement, includes representation from iwi, unions and NGOs, as well as industry bodies for primary industry, wood, tourism, education, horticulture, aviation and technology.

“Trade is of vital importance to New Zealand, helping support jobs and incomes and our growing economy, and we all have a stake in our trading future,” Mr McClay says.

“With the Government today renewing its commitment to free trade and forging new trade ties, it is important we take New Zealand with us – the MAG will help ensure that.

“It will allow the Government to consult with a wide array of stakeholders on trade issues, and ensure they have their say. The MAG will have the opportunity to provide feedback directly to me on developments in the trade agenda and will help to identify issues of importance.”

The MAG was identified as a key priority following public meetings in 2016 which were held to allow the public to have its say on the new trade agenda.   

“I am very pleased with the quality of the MAG membership and look forward to working constructively with them to advance important trade issues,” Mr McClay says.
