Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, today says he is proud to open a new papakāinga that will provide affordable housing options for whānau of Waimārama.

A total of five homes have been built at the papakāinga in Waimārama, with three, three-bedroom affordable rental homes and two homes for ownership as part of the first stage of the papakāinga development.

The Minister is full of praise for the Proprietors of Waimārama 3A1C2.

“I am pleased to acknowledge the first stage of the Waimārama Incorporation papakāinga is now complete.

“Through the leadership, commitment and determination of the whānau and Incorporation, they have increased the availability of affordable and quality housing for whānau in the area.

“They can be proud of what they have achieved today,” says Mr Flavell.

The Incorporation developed a plan during the early stages of the papakāinga development, and successfully applied for funding through the Māori Housing Network led by Te Puni Kōkiri and the Social Housing Unit within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

The Incorporation received joint funding for project feasibility and infrastructure support through Te Puni Kōkiri and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to build the homes. The Incorporation also made a significant contribution with cash and securing a Kāinga Whenua bank loan.

In addition, the two whānau with home-ownership properties successfully obtained Kāinga Whenua loans through Kiwibank with support from Housing New Zealand.

Minister Flavell acknowledges the support of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Housing New Zealand and the Hastings District Council to the Waimārama 3A1C2 Incorporation.

“With the first stage of the papakāinga now complete, I want to commend all those involved for their dedication to this project to date. What they’ve achieved is a tangible symbol of success of working together to build homes for whānau,” he says.

“I am proud to able to support this papakāinga project as part of the Māori Housing Network. Like the Waimārama papakāinga, we are focused on better support whānau and Māori organisations to meet their housing aspirations.”
