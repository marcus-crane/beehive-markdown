Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne says he is very pleased with the progress agencies have made in making it easier for New Zealanders to use government services online.

“Since 2012, when Better Public Services became a government priority, the Result 10 group of agencies have proactively used their mandate to radically change the way government delivers its services to its customers.

“The number of people completing their transactions online has increased from below 30 per cent in mid-2012 to nearly 60 per cent in 2016.

“Back in 2012 a number of these common transactions were not even available digitally, for example renewing a passport, but now over 50 per cent are renewed online.

“We want to make it easier to do things like travel in and out of the country, file tax returns, pay a fine or a vehicle licence, apply for financial assistance and find out what you need to do when you are expecting a baby.

“SmartStart is another initiative born out of this commitment to making it easier for New Zealanders and is proving a hit with new and expectant parents,” says Mr Dunne.

 

SmartStart a multi-agency initiative delivered by the Department of Internal Affairs, Inland Revenue, Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Health with support from Plunket NZ and the New Zealand College of Midwives.

It is an online tool that aims to help babies get off to the best start by having step-by-step information and help all in one place and already over 1000 parents have chosen to notify the Ministry Social Development  of the birth of their child through SmartStart, saving them time and money.
