Associate Health Minister Nicky Wagner says it is encouraging to see such a high level of interest in the proposed Healthy Ageing Strategy.

“It’s incredibly heartening to know so many people have taken the time to engage in the Healthy Ageing Strategy consultation process — it gives us a great chance of delivering what New Zealanders want,” Ms Wagner says.

About 2000 people took part in strategy discussions and workshops and a summary of more than 200 submissions was recently released on the Ministry of Health website.

“The high level of public and sector engagement led to positive changes in the strategy’s direction. For example, the name was changed to better reflect what people were telling us — that this is about maximising health and wellbeing through New Zealanders’ older years,” Ms Wagner says.

“It recognises that we’re ageing at different times and in different ways, and our needs are not the same. Healthy ageing is a life-long process.”

Ms Wagner says there was strong support for the strategy’s goals and plans to achieve them.

“I look forward to seeing how the health and social sectors work to implement the strategy and improve health and social outcomes for our older people.”

The Healthy Ageing Strategy is expected to be finalised later this year.
