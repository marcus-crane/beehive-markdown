This weekend is an opportunity for us to check in on our neighbours and build our communities says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Alfred Ngaro.

Neighbours Day Aotearoa is celebrated across the country over the weekend of 25th and 26th March.

“Events like the Kaikoura Earthquake and Port Hill fires prompted neighbours to come together and offer each other a helping hand. It’s great then to also have a more positive reminder to check in on each other and build those communities,” says Mr Ngaro.

“While lots of us are getting better at keeping in touch online I find nothing quite beats a chat over the fence or a barbeque with neighbours.

“Neighbours Day Aotearoa is an opportunity to meet new people and get to know our neighbours better. I encourage everyone to get out and celebrate the day in some way.”

The annual event began in Auckland in 2009 and is supported by LifeWise, Inspiring Communities, Public Libraries, the Mental Health Foundation and the Methodist Mission.
