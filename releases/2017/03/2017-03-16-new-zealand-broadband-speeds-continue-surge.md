Communications Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed Akamai’s latest State of the Internet Report which shows that average connection speeds in New Zealand have increased by 38 per cent since 2015.

The Report shows that in the fourth quarter of 2016, the average connection speed had increased to 12.9 Megabits per second (Mbps) – a significant leap from the previous year.

It also shows that almost half of New Zealanders have an internet connection that provides speeds of more than 10 Mbps – representing a 75 per cent increase from 2015. Further, a quarter of New Zealanders now have an internet connection that provides speeds in excess of 15 Mbps – a 134 per cent increase from the previous year.

“These figures demonstrate that Kiwis are increasingly reaping the benefits of faster, better internet, stimulated by the Government’s investment in the Ultra-Fast Broadband programme and the Rural Broadband Initiative,” Mr Bridges says.

“Improved broadband access and faster internet delivers huge opportunities for homes, schools and businesses right across New Zealand. It’s great to see we’re making real progress in terms of uptake and connection speeds on the world stage.

“For example, the Report found that mobile broadband users in New Zealand enjoy average speeds of around 12 Mbps. This is the fourth fastest in the Asia Pacific region and puts New Zealand alongside other global internet leaders such as Japan and South Korea.”

Akamai’s latest Report comes just a few weeks out from the due date for tenders for the Government’s extension of the Rural Broadband Initiative and coverage of mobile black spots under the Mobile Black Spot Fund, which will further improve access to fast broadband.

The Government’s $150 million investment in these initiatives will deliver high speed broadband to more rural communities and cellular mobile coverage to key stretches of state highways and tourism locations that do not already have coverage.
