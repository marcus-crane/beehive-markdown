Customs Minister Nicky Wagner is today congratulating border agencies on the five-millionth transaction through a key trade system.

The Trade Single Window, developed by Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries as part of the $104 million Joint Border Management System, was launched in 2013 to streamline the clearance of goods and craft.

“The simplicity of submitting border clearance information in one place has been a real boon for importers and exporters — leading to time savings, elimination of data duplication, a reduction in transaction costs and improved response times,” Ms Wagner says.

“Internationally, we’ve been at the forefront of adopting the single window concept and it’s pleasing to see how well the system is benefiting New Zealand.

“Traders will benefit further once the final piece of the system goes live in a matter of weeks.”

Four new lodgement types will be added to the Trade Single Window, with functionality also enhanced across the system.
