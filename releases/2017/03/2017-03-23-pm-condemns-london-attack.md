Prime Minister Bill English has condemned the terror attack in London today and expressed New Zealand’s condolences to the people of the UK.

“London is a place many thousands of New Zealanders have visited and called home, and where many more have friends and family based, so this attack feels very close to home,” Mr English says.

“We utterly condemn this act.

“Innocent people should never have to fear such violence when going about their daily lives, and New Zealand stands alongside the UK in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism.

“Our thoughts are with the people of London, and in particular with the victims of today’s shocking attack, and their families and friends.”
