A project aimed at growing the capability of women in the primary sector has been granted close to $300,000 in the latest Sustainable Farming Fund round, Associate Primary Industries Minister Louise Upston says.

The Agri-Women’s Development Trust (AWDT) has received $289,000 from the fund to design and deliver two-year pilot programmes around the country beginning in July.

“Our primary industries are a vital part of our way of life and are responsible for over 78 per cent of our exports. In order to keep these industries internationally competitive, we need investment, innovation, market development and a skilled workforce,” Ms Upston says.

“Projects such as this, which recognise the contribution women have to make in industries that may not be their traditional domain, are key to our future success”.

The programmes will focus on three key groups - Māori women in regional communities; young women entering agri-sector careers; and women with careers outside agriculture whose expertise can be used within the sector.

They will be delivered in key economic development regions including Northland, Bay of Plenty, West Coast, Hawkes Bay and Manawatu/Whanganui.
