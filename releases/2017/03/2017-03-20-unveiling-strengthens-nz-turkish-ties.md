Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says the ties between New Zealand and Turkey were strengthened further today with the unveiling of the Turkish Memorial at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park.

“It’s fitting that the second memorial to take its place at the park is Turkish as it was Gallipoli where the Anzac tradition was born. Designed by New Zealand artist Gunner Matt Gauldie it features Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s 1934 words of reconciliation, and a Turkish red pine (pinus brutia) descended from the original Lone Pine at Gallipoli,” Ms Barry says.

“The lone pine and the new bronze memorial will be illuminated every night and complements the existing Atatürk Memorial in Seatoun, which was installed in 1990.”

“This week also marks the 102nd anniversary of the Dardanelles naval campaign, which prompted the assault on Gallipoli.”

Ms Barry says the Turkish memorial is one of four planned for Pukeahu National War Memorial Park this year.

“British, Belgian and American memorials will be unveiled gradually through the year – their designs are still under wraps.  A French memorial will be installed early next year in time for Anzac Day 2018, followed by a Canadian memorial.”

“Each is a testament to our international relationships, and the shared values, the freedoms and the quality of life our countries have fought for and continue to support today.”

The Australian memorial was the first to be installed at Pukeahu before Anzac Day 2015.
