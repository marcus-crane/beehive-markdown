Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says two industrial buildings will receive the first funding from a new grant specifically for earthquake strengthening privately-owned heritage buildings.

“The National Tobacco Company Building in Napier and the former Union Steamship Company store in Dunedin will receive grants from the new Heritage EQUIP fund,” Ms Barry says.

The Heritage Earthquake Upgrade Incentive Programme (EQUIP) and Retrofit Funds can be applied for at any time, with an expert panel assessing applications three times a year.

“A $12,000 grant for the Union Steamship store will be used to strengthen one of its floors as part of a major refit to apartments and offices. With a rates relief package from the Dunedin City Council, this building and others are part of the revitalisation of Dunedin’s warehouse precinct.

“The National Tobacco Company building is one of Napier’s most distinctive art-deco structures and a major tourist attraction. The $10,000 will be used for parapet strengthening.

“Faced with seismic strengthening work, heritage building owners often face challenges finding technical advice, skilled labour and money. Heritage EQUIP is designed to help and a web-based information package will be rolled out soon to support owners.

“I encourage building owners considering earthquake upgrade work to visit the Heritage EQUIP website, [www.mch.govt.nz/heritageequip](http://www.mch.govt.nz/heritageequip),” Ms Barry says.
