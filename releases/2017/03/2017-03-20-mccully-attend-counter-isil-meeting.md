Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced he will attend the Counter-ISIL Foreign Ministers’ meeting being hosted by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington DC on 22 March.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting Iraq as it addresses the threat posed by ISIL and works to stabilise affected communities,” Mr McCully says.

“The defeat of ISIL is more than a military campaign.  The Coalition will review progress across all lines of effort, including the important work being done to undermine ISIL’s propaganda and cut off its finances.” 

“As ISIL finds itself on the back foot in Iraq and Syria, we want to work with our Coalition partners to ensure that ISIL does not find safe haven elsewhere,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealand has contributed around $26 million since 2012 in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the violence in Syria and Iraq.
