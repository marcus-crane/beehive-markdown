Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more adults and their families are benefiting from medication-free healthy lifestyle prescriptions.

“The Government is committed to supporting New Zealanders to live healthier more active lives away from hospitals,” says Dr Coleman.

“One of the ways we are doing this is through Green Prescriptions, which contain advice on nutrition and physical activity. Local initiatives range from cooking classes to motivational texts, and a range of options to be active.

“There are a variety of reasons someone might receive a Green Prescription from their GP or practice nurse. Patients may have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, at risk of stroke, have arthritis or have weight issues.

“There has been an increase in the number of referrals for support in the second quarter of 2016/2017 to 11,818 compared to the same time last year when there were 11,225 referrals for adults.

“A total of 284 children from 267 families were referred to the Green Prescriptions Active Families programme. More children under five and their families are also starting to be referred to the programme as a result of the new Raising Health Kids health target.

“It’s great to see that more New Zealanders are getting the extra support they need to develop long-term lifestyle changes so they can get well and stay well.”

Green Prescription services are provided by a range of organisations across New Zealand including local regional sports trusts, primary health organisations and NGOs.
