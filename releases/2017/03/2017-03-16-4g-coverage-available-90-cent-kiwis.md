Ninety per cent of New Zealanders now have access to 4G cellular mobile services – two years earlier than anticipated, Communications Minister Simon Bridges announced today.

The Minister thanked telecommunications companies Vodafone and Spark for their efforts in quickly rolling out their 4G networks.

“In 2013 the Government set an objective that 90 per cent of the population would have access to 4G cellular mobile services by 2019. Thanks to the work of Spark and Vodafone, we’ve reached our target well ahead of schedule,” Mr Bridges says.

“This is a fantastic achievement that will help meet growing consumer demand for mobile data, and is essential for improving connectivity right across New Zealand.”

4G cellular mobile services are capable of speeds more than ten times faster than 3G mobile data networks.

“The Government is committed to delivering greater mobile coverage and network capacity. Currently more than 95 per cent of the New Zealand population has access to 3G. 4G is a better service and our 90 per cent requirement ensures that many rural people have access to the same level of services as people in urban areas,” Mr Bridges says.

“As part of the Government’s 2013 objective, Vodafone and Spark were required to build new towers to provide new coverage each year for five years. They’re well on track to meet this deadline – creating even better coverage and capacity for rural communities.”
