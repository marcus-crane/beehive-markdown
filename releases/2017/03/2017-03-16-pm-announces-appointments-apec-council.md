Prime Minister Bill English today announced the appointments of Phil O’Reilly and Tenby Powell to the APEC Business Advisory Council, through to December 2019.

The Prime Minister also confirmed the extension of Katherine Rich’s appointment through till March 2019.

“Mr O’Reilly and Mr Powell both bring important skills to the organisation and will strongly represent the interests of New Zealand businesses on important trade and economic issues in the Asia Pacific,” Mr English says.
