Health Minister and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is travelling to Melbourne to take part in a meeting of Health Ministers.

Dr Coleman will attend the Council of Australian Governments Health Council meeting, along with Australian Commonwealth Health Minister Greg Hunt and Health Ministers from states and territories.

Dr Coleman will also meet separately with Mr Hunt, who like Dr Coleman, also holds both the health and sports portfolio.

“I’m looking forward to meeting with my counterpart while in Melbourne,” says Dr Coleman.

“Our health systems share many things in common and having an opportunity learn to hear how our counterparts across the Tasman are dealing with challenges and advances in the health care system is extremely valuable.

“I am particularly interested in hearing about innovative programmes which could further improve the health outcomes of New Zealanders.

“I will also be relaying New Zealand’s experience of delivering faster more convenient health care closer to home.”
