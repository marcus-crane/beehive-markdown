Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says an extension to the national transition period will continue to support recovery efforts following the Kaikōura earthquake.

Mr Brownlee has given notice of an extension to the national transition period in Kaikōura and Hurunui Districts and the Wairau-Awatere ward of Marlborough District, which will come into force at 1pm today and last for a further 90 days.

The extended national transition period for these areas will now end at 1pm on 7 June 2017, unless extended or terminated earlier.

“An extension of the national transition period will help Recovery Managers deal with ongoing recovery issues, such as restricting access to places and buildings while further geotechnical and engineering investigations are carried out,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The national transition period allows the National Recovery Manager to coordinate the work of central government agencies, while also allowing local authorities to continue effective recovery work on the ground.

“Authorities in Kaikōura, Hurunui and Marlborough have used transition period powers to restrict access to dangerous buildings and areas at risk from natural hazards, close roads and public places, and issue directions.

“This extension will allow communities to continue their recovery activities,” Mr Brownlee says.

Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, the Minister of Civil Defence may give notice of an extension to an existing national transition period.
