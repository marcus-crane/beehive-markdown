Around 200 more Christchurch secondary school and university students will have the opportunity to be part of local volunteer initiatives, with the Government investing alongside other funders to support the University of Canterbury Student Volunteer Army, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“This is about developing future leaders and supporting them to inspire their peers to make service part of the student lifestyle,” says Ms Kaye.

“The volunteering opportunities created through this partnership will enable more local young people to grow their skills and confidence, and contribute to the community at the same time.

“Since it began in 2010 in response to the Canterbury earthquakes, the UC Student Volunteer Army has remained active as a mobiliser of volunteers, and now has 2,000 members. They take on major projects as well as smaller weekend projects during the university terms.

“It’s great to be able to support this fantastic initiative to continue its good work, and help develop the skills and potential of local young people.”

The Government will invest $20,000 alongside the University of Canterbury, as part of their wider package of support, and other community funders.

“This investment is being made under the Partnership Fund, which sees the Government co-invest with business, philanthropic, iwi and other partners to grow youth development opportunities,” says Ms Kaye.

“Today’s announcement follows around $2 million of partnerships for a range of youth development opportunities announced already in 2017, which shows the partnership model is delivering great results.”
