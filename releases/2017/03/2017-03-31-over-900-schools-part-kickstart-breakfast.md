Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says over 28,000 students in more than 900 schools are receiving a healthy start to the day through the KickStart Breakfast programme.                                                                      

“The KickStart Breakfast programme helps to improve focus, behaviour and energy levels among students,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Over eight million breakfasts have been served in schools around the country since the Government expanded the KickStart Breakfast programme in 2013 and invested $9.5 million over five years.

“It’s great to see schools and communities continuing to take-up the programme - over 40 schools have signed up over the last six months.

“From the community to central government, everybody’s doing their bit to give kids the best start to the day.”

The Prime Minister Bill English and Minister Tolley visited Holy Family School in Porirua, Wellington this morning. The decile one primary school has been participating in KickStart since 2011.

Around 126,000 breakfasts are currently served every week in 913 decile 1-10 primary and secondary schools. 85 per cent of schools are delivering breakfast more than two days each week.

KickStart brings together the government, Fonterra and Sanitarium, as well as the volunteers who run the breakfast clubs. There is no cost involved to the school - milk, Weet-bix and delivery costs are funded by the KickStart Breakfast partnership between Fonterra, Sanitarium and the government.
