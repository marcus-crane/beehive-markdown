Foreign Minister Murray McCully has today signed two arrangements with China aimed at strengthening cooperation in the areas of fisheries and international development, particularly in the Pacific region.

The arrangements were signed in Wellington as part of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s visit to New Zealand. 

“These arrangements will strengthen and expand our cooperation even further,” Mr McCully says.

“Fisheries are an important part of many Pacific economies. New Zealand and China are committed to protecting sustainable fish stocks in the Pacific region, and together support efforts to combat illegal unreported and unregulated fishing.” 

New Zealand and China also signed an arrangement aimed at promoting stronger cooperation on international development.

“Under this new arrangement, we can work together to identify a further development cooperation project in the Pacific, building on our existing cooperation with the Te Mato Vai project in the Cook Islands.”
