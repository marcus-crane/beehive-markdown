With the ‘Support for Volunteering’ fund opening today volunteering groups should look at what projects they need help with and apply for funding says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Alfred Ngaro.

“Every year we grant over $500,000 through this fund to support volunteering in New Zealand,” says Mr Ngaro.

“Volunteers contribute about $3.5 billion in labour every year, so this funding is one of many ways we can support the amazing contribution they give to New Zealand every day.

“Last year we supported Volunteering New Zealand, regional volunteer centres and a number of volunteering projects looking at building community strength and we’re looking for the same mix again this year.

Some of the projects that were successful last year included:

- specialised training for Snow Sports NZ volunteers who are working to help people with disabilities ski
- training youth volunteers with the Chinese New Settlers Services Trust to become leaders who could train and mentor other children and youth in the organization
- a training day for volunteers of the Alzheimer's Society (Manawatu) who are working with people affected by dementia
- a volunteer development and celebration event in Invercargill where volunteers shared knowledge and resourcefulness, engaged with other volunteers and celebrated their successes.

“I’d encourage any group looking to support or promote volunteering to apply for the fund.”

Applications for the DIA administered fund open on 22 March 2017 and close on 3 May 2017.
