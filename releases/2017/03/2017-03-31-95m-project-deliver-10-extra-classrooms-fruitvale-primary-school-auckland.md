Fruitvale Primary School in New Lynn is the latest Auckland school to receive extra classrooms to help it accommodate a growing roll, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

Ms Kaye made the announcement during a visit to the school this morning.

“Around $9.5 million will be invested in a project that will see a new two-story block built, comprising eight teaching spaces,” says Ms Kaye.

“The project will also include weathertightness remediation of existing classrooms, an upgraded access way, and construction of a new, two-classroom satellite unit of Carlson School for Cerebral Palsy.”

The total number of permanent teaching spaces at the school will increase to 18, including the new satellite unit. Currently, there are eight permanent and two temporary classrooms at the school.

“Fruitvale Primary is one of a number of schools in New Zealand that have experienced weathertightness issues as a legacy of the leaky buildings era, and we have a nationwide programme underway to address these issues,” says Ms Kaye.

“Combining weathertightness remediation with the project to build new roll growth classrooms makes good sense in this instance, as it will achieve time and cost efficiencies and minimise disruption to the school’s activities.

“As its name suggests, Fruitvale Primary has beautiful gardens, featuring an orchard, native plants and a stream, and it is part of a collaborative local school community.

“The addition of the satellite unit to provide learning support for students with special education needs will further strengthen the school’s welcoming and inclusive nature.

“This investment continues our focus on getting ahead of growth in our fastest-growing city.

“At the start of this month, a new $3.8 million classroom block was announced for Long Bay Primary School.

“This means we’ve announced over $13 million in March this year, on top of $158 million announced in June and October last year for new classrooms in Auckland.

“As a result of these investments, we’re on track to deliver more than 17,000 new student places in Auckland by 2019.

“Since 2014, around $375 million has also been approved for major redevelopments at 18 schools in Auckland. This is part of the greatest spend ever on school infrastructure by a New Zealand government, which so far has seen over $5 billion committed for new and upgraded schools and classrooms since 2008.”

Fruitvale Primary School is working with other local schools to form the Kotuitui (Green Bay) Community of Leraning/Kahui Ako.

Communities of Learning are about increasing student achievement, through early education services, schools and tertiary providers working together to share expertise and lift the quality of teaching and learning.
