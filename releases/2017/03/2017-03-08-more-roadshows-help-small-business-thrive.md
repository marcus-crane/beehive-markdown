Small Business Minister Jacqui Dean has announced today she will travel throughout New Zealand in 2017 for Small Business Roadshows, starting with Kāikoura, Blenheim and Wellington.

“This is particularly important in Kāikoura, whose businesses may need added support following the devastating earthquake. Therefore we’ll be in town on 27 March to meet with businesses and help them navigate all the support that is available in the region,” says Ms Dean.

“The aim of our roadshows is to get to the regions and work with local business to navigate the support and information available to them.

“Ensuring small businesses have access to information and support they need to thrive is essential.

“Other centres to host events are Blenheim and Wellington Central on 29 and 31 March respectively. Over the coming months I will also be traveling to Cromwell, Oamaru, West Auckland, and Whanganui.

“We are also holding two roadshows specifically for Māori Business and Enterprise in Kaitaia and Whakatane as well as an Auckland event specifically to help the Chinese business community.

“Last year’s roadshows reinforced how important it is to continuously engage with small business and increase the visibility of support they can access.

“Listening to small business is vital, as small tweaks in policy can have an impact. It is important to make sure their voices are taken into account during the decision making process.

“I am looking forward to meeting with small business owners throughout New Zealand,” says Ms Dean.
