Parliament has today passed three Regulatory Amendment Bills into law, bringing up to date 20 pieces of legislation, Minister for Economic Development Simon Bridges says.

The Amendment Omnibus Bills are:

- Regulatory Systems (Building and Housing) Amendment Bill
- Regulatory Systems (Commercial Matters) Amendment Bill
- Regulatory Systems (Workplace Relations) Amendment Bill

The Bills clarify and update 20 Acts administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“The passing of these Bills will address regulatory gaps and errors, and remove unnecessary compliance costs, as well as improving efficiency,” Mr Bridges says.

The Bills will also allow for smaller regulatory fixes to be progressed in a timely and cost-effective way which will deliver flow-on benefits to business and the wider economy.

“This updated legislation also responds to the challenge of finding time on the Parliamentary calendar for “repairs and maintenance” of existing legislation. Being able to gather so many small changes into a collection of improvements supports better regulatory performance,” Mr Bridges says.
