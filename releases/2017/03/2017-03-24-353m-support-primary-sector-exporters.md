Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Trade Minister Todd McClay have welcomed new funding of $35.3 million to help support our primary sector exporters succeed in overseas markets.

The funding, announced as part of the launch of Trade Agenda 2030 today, will be made available to the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) over the next four years as part of Budget 2017.

“The primary sector is vitally important to the New Zealand economy, earning around $36 billion a year, supporting thousands of jobs and exporting to around 130 countries. It’s important the Government continues to support the sector through creating new and improved trade links,” Mr Guy says.

“Barriers to trade cost our exporters billions, and entering new markets can be complex so Trade Agenda 2030 brings a renewed focus on helping our exporters address these issues and making them more competitive.

“This funding will help them overcome such barriers, navigate international regulatory requirements and further resource efforts to improve trade access issues.”

The new funding will:

- Increase MPI presence in Europe and South East Asia.
- Establish an Export Regulatory Advice Service to help exporters navigate complex regulatory environments. This will include guidance, case studies and proactive support.
- Accelerate work on priority non-tariff barriers, which are a major issue for primary sector exporters. This will include gathering information and making it easier for exporters to seek government advice and assistance.
- Expand MPI’s Economic Intelligence Unit to provide market insights and economic information to support exporters and Government agencies. This will help identify market opportunities and develop export strategies.
- Support work on market access, systems audit, and assurance and monitoring.

Mr McClay says that while Trade Agenda 2030 looks to expand New Zealand’s good and services exports into new and diverse markets, we must also focus on getting the best out of the high-quality trade deals New Zealand already has in place.

 “MFAT and MPI work closely together both domestically and internationally to resolve non-tariff barriers as they arise.

“These barriers cost our economy hundreds of millions of dollars every year, so improving the resources available to fight these impediments to trade is an excellent way of increasing the value of existing trade deals.”
