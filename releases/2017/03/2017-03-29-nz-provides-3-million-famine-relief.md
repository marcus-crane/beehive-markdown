Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will provide $3 million to support emergency famine relief and prevention efforts in Africa and Yemen. 

“More than 20 million people are currently facing famine conditions or severe food shortages across the Greater Horn of Africa, Nigeria and Yemen,” Mr McCully says.

“Droughts in some of these areas have been compounded by conflict and insecurity, giving rise to a very serious humanitarian situation. 

“Our relief package will make a total of $1 million available for New Zealand non-government organisations with partners working on the ground in the Greater Horn of Africa, and will focus on delivering assistance in the areas of food, water and health care,” Mr McCully says.

“We will also provide $1 million to support the World Food Programme’s work in South Sudan and $1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for relief efforts in Yemen and Nigeria.”
