Minister for Children Anne Tolley says that extraordinary foster care families have been celebrated at an awards ceremony at Government House, as Foster Care Awareness week comes to an end.

Ten foster care families received awards for their dedication and devotion to supporting vulnerable children and young people at the Excellence in Foster Care ceremony, which was hosted by the Governor General, the Rt Hon Patsy Reddy.

“I was delighted to meet and talk to these wonderful families, and to thank them for their patience, resilience and strength,” says Mrs Tolley.

“They provide loving and stable homes, often under very challenging circumstances, to ensure that young people can be safe and secure and have a sense of belonging, free from abuse and neglect.

“Fostering Kids New Zealand, which has partnered with CYF to organise the awards, will in future have close ties to the Ministry for Vulnerable Children, Oranga Tamariki, through the radical overhaul of care and protection.

“We are currently working on how we can better support foster carers as part of the overhaul, and how we can recruit and retain more of these fantastic people, so we can help vulnerable children and young people recover from the trauma they have suffered and go on to thrive and lead successful and happy lives.

“I want to congratulate those families who received awards today, and thank all of the amazing foster carers who work tirelessly every single day to improve the lives of young New Zealanders.”
