Pacific Peoples Minister Alfred Ngaro has today congratulated the winners of the 2017 ASB Polyfest.

“It was another fantastic event this year and I know that the judges would have had an extremely hard time selecting the top groups,” says Mr Ngaro.

“I attended the celebrations on Friday, while the PM visited yesterday and we were both blown away by the caliber of the performances.

“The Pacific population in New Zealand is incredibly diverse and growing rapidly. We’re young and gifted and it’s fantastic to see events like the ASB Polyfest recognising and celebrating this.

“The Government invested funding into the festival over the last three years and it’s great to see that investment working to help so many young people connect with and celebrate their cultures.

“I’d like to congratulate all the students on their hard work, leadership and dedication, it really showed in their performances. And of course congratulations in particular to those schools who came out on top.”
