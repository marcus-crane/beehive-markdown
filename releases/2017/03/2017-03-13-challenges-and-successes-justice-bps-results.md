Crime rates are significantly lower than in 2011, but latest figures show that challenges remain to tackle crime and reoffending, says Justice Minister Amy Adams.

The Justice Sector’s BPS results for the year ended September 2016 released today show slight increases across the four targets over the last quarter, although they all remain down on 2011 levels.

“There has been great progress in our BPS results since 2011 but we know we need to ramp up our efforts to develop more innovative ways to continue to drive crime and reoffending rates down further,” says Ms Adams.

The BPS measures for the year to September are as follows:

- total crime rate up 1.4 per cent (down 14 per cent since 2011)
- violent crime rate up 3.1 per cent (down 2 per cent since 2011)
- youth crime rate up 2.5 per cent (down 32 per cent since 2011)

<!--THE END-->

- re-offending rate up 1.2 per cent (down 4.4 per cent since 2011)

The increase in reporting of family violence is one of the major factors resulting in the upturn of violent crime and the total crime rate.

"Violent crime in dwellings, strongly correlated with family violence, has risen 3 per cent in the last quarter. This is likely to be due to increased reporting of family violence incidences, a sign that the Government’s comprehensive family violence programme is raising awareness,” says Ms Adams.

“Tackling family violence is a key priority for this Government. While I’m pleased that more victims are coming forward to report this horrendous form of abuse, the results also show the extent of the work that needs to be done.”

Ms Adams says that although strong gains have been made across all four targets since 2011, there are still areas to address to improve justice outcomes for New Zealanders.

“That’s why we are focusing on areas that can really make a difference in homes and communities, including investing in a new Safer Communities package with 1125 additional police staff and introducing legislation to create a modern, fit for purpose family violence system.

“The Government is committed to investing in programmes which tackle these complex issues head on so that New Zealanders continue to feel safe within their homes and communities,” says Ms Adams.
