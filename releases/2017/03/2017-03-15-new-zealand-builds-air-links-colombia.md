New Zealand has signed an air services agreement with Colombia, Transport Minister Simon Bridges announced today.

The agreement provides opportunities for code-sharing between each nation’s airlines. Under the new arrangements, New Zealand and Colombian airlines may operate up to 14 passenger services per week, with no limits on the number of cargo services.

"Strengthening our air links with South America has been a priority since we created new air services opportunities with Argentina in December 2014, and Air New Zealand made its first direct flight to Buenos Aires in December 2015,” Mr Bridges says.

”This signing means New Zealand now has air services agreements with Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Worldwide, New Zealand has air services agreements with 61 countries and territories. 

“New Zealand is well placed as a stop-over point between South America and Asia. Building air links with Colombia–South America’s fourth largest economy–broadens opportunities for people to explore New Zealand before continuing their travel elsewhere.

“New Zealand has a friendly and growing relationship with Colombia. I look forward to the benefits including tourism and trade that this agreement offers for both countries,” Mr Bridges says.
