The Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Gerry Brownlee has approved the first phase of future land use decisions for Christchurch’s Avon River Corridor red zone.

On March 23, Regenerate Christchurch provided Mr Brownlee with a draft Outline for a Regeneration Plan to determine the long-term uses for the Otakaro/Avon River Corridor.

“In accordance with the Act’s requirements, I’ve approved the Outline. This marks an important step forward in regeneration planning for the largest and most central of Christchurch’s residential red zones,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Now that demolitions are completed, land has been cleared and areas made safe, Cantabrians should explore the Avon River Corridor once again. I’m expecting some announcements about opportunities in the red zone in the coming weeks.

“The Crown and the people of greater Christchurch and New Zealand have a strong interest in this area and what will happen to it in the future.

“The Crown owns more than 5400 properties in the area, having spent more than $1 billion purchasing homes on severely damaged land to allow people to move on with their lives after the earthquakes.

“This is one of the most important Regeneration Plans for which Regenerate Christchurch will be responsible, so it is essential that both the process and the product are robust.

“Regenerate Christchurch will develop a Plan for area of the residential red zone that stretches from the central city to Bexley, along the Avon River.

“The Outline details the agency’s intent to involve the public and stakeholders throughout the process, include a vision and spatial plan for the area as a whole and identify the location of long-term land uses and activities.

“Development of the draft Plan will happen this year before being finalised and released to the public early next year.

“The next step will be for the Outline to be publicly notified by Regenerate Christchurch, which formally kicks off the Regeneration Plan process,” Mr Brownlee says.
