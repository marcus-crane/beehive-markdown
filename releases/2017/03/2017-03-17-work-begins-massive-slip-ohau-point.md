Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a significant milestone has been reached in the effort to restore the coastal road and rail corridor north of Kaikoura. Work commenced this week at Ohau Point, the site of one of the largest of slips which came down in the November 14 earthquake.

“The slip at Ohau Point is one of the biggest and most complex of the 10 major slips north of Kaikoura,” Mr Bridges says.

“Helicopter sluicing crews and specialist abseilers have been working long hours for several weeks to clear loose material from the site.

“We now have machinery at both sides of the slip to start work clearing the estimated 110,000 cubic metres of rock and debris as quickly and safely as possible,” Mr Bridges says.

A remote-controlled excavator will work on the north side of the slip because it is too unstable to allow workers access safely.

“People will begin to see some very visible progress in coming weeks. Work is now happening on all sections from Blue Duck Valley Road to north of Waipapa Bay,” Mr Bridges says.

Construction access tracks have now been built around all of the slips to Ohau Point. Work will soon begin rebuilding sections of the highway and railway line damaged by the earthquake.

Work is on track to fully restore the road and rail network by the end of this year.
