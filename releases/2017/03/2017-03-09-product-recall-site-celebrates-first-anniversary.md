Over 160,000 people have accessed the government’s product recall website to help keep themselves and their families safe since it was launched one year ago today, says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Jacqui Dean.

“The site is a whole-of-government, one-stop-shop simplifying the product recall space. It is an accessible, easy-to-use website that brings together all product safety information in one location,” says Ms Dean.

“People can get overwhelmed with the amount of information out there. The aim of this site is to be a one-stop-shop for product recalls making it easier and faster for people to get the information they need to make safe and informed decisions.

“In 2016, there were a number of high-profile recalls that meant people were actively seeking information on faulty products. The recalls website proved to be a valuable resource for them to go to find trusted information.

“Because of its usefulness, the government will continue to grow the site with the aim of becoming the single site where both people and businesses can turn for product recall information,” says Ms Dean.

The recalls website is a collaboration between the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment; the New Zealand Transport Agency; the Ministry for Primary Industries; and the Ministry of Health.

The Product Recalls website is available at: [www.recalls.govt.nz](http://www.recalls.govt.nz/).
