Trade Minister Todd McClay says an additional $27 million will be invested in improving access to international markets for New Zealand exporters and to help more of them succeed internationally.

The funding, announced as part of the launch of Trade Agenda 2030 today, will be made available over the next four years as part of Budget 2017.

“This funding will ensure the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade can more effectively improve market access for New Zealand exporters and to help those businesses make the most of our extensive and increasing trade networks,” Mr McClay says.

“Trade is critical to New Zealand’s prosperity and success. It translates to more business and job opportunities for New Zealanders.

“We need to encourage more businesses to grow and sell their goods and services by making it easier for them to do so in as many markets as possible.”

The funding will increase the resources available to the work being done in the Asia-Pacific region which takes more than 70 per cent of New Zealand’s exports. Additional resource will be allocated to other regions and allow for diversification of our trade relationships. 

The funding will accelerate the implementation of existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), support an increased FTA negotiation workload, and increase business engagement and support.

Investment will also be made in our international networks across the globe and boost the availability of consular services for Kiwis overseas.

“This Government remains committed to creating new trade opportunities and maximising the benefits from existing opportunities, the new funding helps achieve this,” Mr McClay says.
