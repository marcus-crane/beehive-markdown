The House of Representatives sat through extended sitting hours this morning to pass the Iwi and Hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa Claims Settlement Bill through its first reading. The Bill has been referred to the Māori Affairs Committee.

“Today’s first reading is an important step towards full and final settlement of the historical claims of the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa,” Mr Finlayson said.

When enacted, this Bill will give effect to the Deed of Settlement signed by the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa and the Crown in November 2016.

The settlement contains total financial and commercial redress of $100 million, including the transfer of interests in Wharerata Forest Limited and Patunamu Crown Forest Licensed land and the opportunity to purchase a number of Crown properties.

“The Crown can never fully compensate the iwi and hapū for the loss and prejudice they have suffered,” Mr Finlayson said. “This settlement marks the beginning of a new relationship between the Crown and the iwi and hapū of Te Rohe o Te Wairoa.”
