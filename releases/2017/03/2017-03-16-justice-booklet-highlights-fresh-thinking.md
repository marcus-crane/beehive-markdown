A new Ministry of Justice publication launched today by Justice Minister Amy Adams showcases how fresh thinking by talented people is helping to address complex issues in the justice sector.

Ms Adams says the *Justice: Our People, Our Communities* booklet shares stories about people and initiatives that are making a real difference to New Zealanders’ experiences of our courts and justice system.

“The booklet is more than just an insight into the running of a busy courtroom. It highlights smart and innovative ways that people are working together in the justice sector to deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders.

“It shows how initiatives like the National Home Safety Service, which keeps people at risk of family violence safe in their homes with practical support including replacing locks and installing security lights, are delivering real benefits to those who need it most.”

Ms Adams acknowledged the contribution of everyone showcased in the booklet and the many others who were also contributing innovative thinking and hard work across the justice sector.

“This booklet reminds us that we have a justice system we can be proud of, but we can never rest on our laurels. We want to continue to see more efficient, effective and timely courts and justice processes.”
