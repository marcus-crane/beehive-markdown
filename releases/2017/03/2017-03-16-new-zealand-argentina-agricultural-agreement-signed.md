Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has signed an Agricultural Cooperation Arrangement with Argentina today, aimed at building closer relationships between the two countries.

The Arrangement was signed at the Central District Fieldays in Feilding today with Argentina’s Secretary of Agriculture, Ricardo Negri, during his three day visit to New Zealand.

“New Zealand and Argentina have a close relationship, particularly in agricultural sciences,” says Mr Guy.

“This new Arrangement creates a framework for greater cooperation between our two countries in the agricultural, livestock and agro-industrial sectors, including opportunities for technical exchanges, joint research, innovation and value addition.

“Two-way trade between Argentina and New Zealand is growing, particularly in primary sectors. The Arrangement will support strengthened economic relations between both countries with agriculture at the centre of this.”

As like-minded countries, Argentina and New Zealand are active participants in the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.

“Agriculture is critical to the economic wellbeing of our countries and we both benefit by working together to address the challenges of climate change. We are natural partners in developing practical, sustainable solutions for reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

“Our research institutions are already exploring opportunities for joint research into areas such as methane vaccines.

“New Zealand and Argentinean farmers have also worked together through an annual farmers study tour, organised by the Global Research Alliance and the World Farmers Organisation.

“Our countries are mindful that for research and development to be effective it will need to be readily picked up by farmers.

“Under the agreement there are also opportunities for us to collaborate on the development of new biosecurity tools to tackle pests and diseases of concern to both countries.”
