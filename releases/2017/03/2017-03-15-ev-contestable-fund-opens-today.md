Businesses, local councils and organisations with projects to spark interest in electric vehicles can apply for the second round of the Government’s Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund, opened today by Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins.

The fund is one of a suite of initiatives in the government’s electric vehicles programme, which has a target of doubling the numbers of electric vehicles every year to reach approximately 64,000 by the end of 2021.

“The government wants to see more people swap to electric vehicles which are cheaper to run and maintain than petrol-fuelled vehicles,” Ms Collins said.

“Electric vehicles are powered by New Zealand’s more than 80 per cent renewable electricity and will reduce transport emissions, which is good for New Zealand.”

Up to $3 million is available in this round with another funding round planned to run later this year.

“Electric vehicles are becoming an increasingly viable option for New Zealanders with prices becoming more competitive and more models available which can cover a distance of over 200km on one charge.

“The first round of this fund saw 15 projects funded, including the delivery of at least 100 new public charging stations around the country. It also saw support for an electric car sharing scheme and electric trucks, buses and supermarket delivery vans.

“New Zealanders will be able to see electric vehicles and charging stations in their neighbourhoods. This fund is helping kick-start innovative projects that are building momentum for change,” Ms Collins said.

The fund will offer up to 50 per cent funding towards projects that encourage and support the uptake of electric vehicles and other low emission vehicles on public roads and that make use of New Zealand’s renewable electricity advantage. This could include projects in the areas of: electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars, vans, trucks and buses, or associated technologies or services.

Applicants have six weeks to submit their proposals to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) with the funding round closing on 26 April.
