Trade Minister Todd McClay says a new all-of-government approach to tackling non-tariff barriers (NTBs) imposed on our exporters will deliver real benefits to business.

The Clearing House, announced as part of Trade Agenda 2030 today, ensures that New Zealand exporters will be able to access the best information and support on trade barriers in a single place.

“We know non-tariff barriers can impose significant delays and costs on New Zealand exporters, making them less competitive, so the quicker we learn about and act on them, the better,” Mr McClay says.

Mr McClay says that MFAT had been trialling a Clearing House concept with NZTE for the NTBs that businesses raise with them.

“As part of this, we have set targets for NTB enquiries to be followed up within 48 hours,” Mr McClay says

"It is now time to make this service available to all exporters he said.  We will be creating an online portal for businesses who have NTB concerns to more easily access vital information and interact with government agencies,”

As well as a centralised online point of contact for exporters, the Clearing House will:

- Make it easier for exporters to report issues, seek government advice and assistance with NTBs and other export issues.
- Track and trace the assignment and resolution issues across agencies on behalf of the exporter.
- Provide the Government with an accurate and up-to-date understanding of NTB and other export issues facing exporters.
- Enable the collection and interpretation of data regarding the NTB and other export issues
- Ensure NTB enquiries are dealt with in a timely fashion

The Clearing House and online portal will be jointly developed by developed by Customs, MFAT, MPI, MBIE, and NZTE, and is to be funded from baselines.
