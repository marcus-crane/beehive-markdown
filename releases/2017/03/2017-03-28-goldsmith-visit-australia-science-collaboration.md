Science and Innovation Minister Paul Goldsmith is today travelling to Australia   to advance science and innovation collaboration between New Zealand and Australia.

“It’s great to see that our already extensive collaboration with Australia now has a clear work programme in the form of the recently signed the Australia-New Zealand Science, Research and Innovation Cooperation Agreement,” says Mr Goldsmith.

“Meeting with key people in the science and innovation sector will allow for a deeper practical understanding of the impact of the agreement, and also allow me to reaffirm our strong scientific links, which benefit both Australia and New Zealand.”

During the visit to Melbourne and Canberra, Mr Goldsmith will meet with his Australian counterparts, the Minister for Industry, Science and Innovation, Hon Arthur Sinodinos, and the Minister for Education and Training, Hon Simon Birmingham, as well as other science and innovation sector leaders.

Mr Goldsmith will visit the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, which is co-funded by the New Zealand Government, to observe the research opportunities that significant infrastructure like the Synchrotron can provide. He will also tour the Whisstock lab at Monash University, which undertakes world-leading genomics and imaging work.

Mr Goldsmith will be in Australia from 28-30 March and will also undertake meetings relating to Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, and Regulatory Reform.
