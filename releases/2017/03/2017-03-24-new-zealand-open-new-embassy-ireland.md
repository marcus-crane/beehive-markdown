Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will open an embassy in Dublin, Ireland.

“New Zealand and Ireland enjoy a very warm relationship which is underpinned by our shared values,” Mr McCully says.

“We work closely together on issues such as climate change, disarmament, and human rights, and are also both members of the Small Advanced Economies Initiative.

“Having an embassy in Dublin will enable us to build on and strengthen this relationship.

“Ireland is an important member of the European Union, so the Embassy will also support New Zealand’s interests in Europe, including as they relate to the negotiation of a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU.”

The Government, through Budget 2017, has committed $4.8 million in capital funding to establish the embassy and a further $9.1million to cover operating costs over the next four years.

The new funding was announced today as part of the launch of Trade Agenda 2030.
