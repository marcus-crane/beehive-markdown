Revenue Minister Judith Collins today welcomed Inland Revenue’s new webpage to help trustees of foreign trusts comply with the new disclosure rules.

“Foreign trusts now have to provide significantly more information than in the past. The webpage has all the information on the new rules and includes the forms which trusts need to complete in order to be registered by 30 June 2017.

“This information will help Inland Revenue get a much clearer picture about the beneficiaries of foreign trusts and their activities, as well as enable greater exchange of information with tax treaty partners.”

“Our new comprehensive foreign trust disclosure regime reinforces New Zealand’s international reputation.”

Trustees are encouraged to visit [www.ird.govt.nz/international/exchange/foreign-trusts/](http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/exchange/foreign-trusts/) to download the forms and find more information.
