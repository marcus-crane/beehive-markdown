Associate Minister of Conservation, Hon Peter Dunne, welcomed the launch of the Mountain Safety Council's report into Hunter-Safety called A Hunter’s Tale yesterday.

“As I have previously said, this report represents a significant moment in our country’s collective understanding of the nature, scale and risks of hunting in New Zealand,” said Mr Dunne. 

"The report comes after a rigorous collection and analysis of data to produce a first-of-its kind snapshot of the current context hunters in New Zealand live in.

"The report, which compiles a large range of data from sector groups and Government Departments provides a reliable database that will provide a useful touchstone for how we engage with hunter safety in New Zealand.

“The report indicates that over 160,000 hunters actively engage in our outdoors on a regular basis and many more come from overseas to experience our world-leading outdoors. 

"With so many people regularly engaging in an activity it is natural that we will continue to discuss the issues, such as safety, that come along with it.

'Having a solid database to inform the discussion we will have is vital to guarantee that we can have a sensible and measured discussion on how we successfully manage potential risks to people's safety while still enjoying our great outdoors," said Mr Dunne.

The report’s launch at the Mountain Safety Council's Headquarters in Wellington was attended by nine organisations, including Coronial Services, The Department of Conservation, Fish and Game, The Game Animal Council, New Zealand Deerstalkers Association, The New Zealand Police, New Zealand Recreation Association, Worksafe, and WaterSafety New Zealand.

The Mountain Safety Council will be establishing advisory groups, focused on specific issues from the report, in order to draw in experts relevant to each specific issue to continue to progress the positive work being done to ensure a safe and enjoyable recreational activity.
