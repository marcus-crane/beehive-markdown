Associate Tourism Minister Nicky Wagner today opened new toilet facilities in Tekapo, co-funded through the Government’s Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund.

The Mackenzie District Council received $405,000 last year for the construction of two toilet blocks, one located near the Church of the Good Shepherd and the other in Tekapo township.

“Tekapo is an iconic Kiwi location, but this little town of around 400 people receives in excess of 100,000 visitors per month in the summer season, and we were seeing high demand for new facilities,” Ms Wagner says.

“It’s great to see this fund in action, helping smaller communities like Tekapo respond to growth in visitor numbers by developing new and enhanced infrastructure.

“There is no doubt tourism benefits the area — international and domestic visitors spent around $723 million in South Canterbury in the year to January, an 8 per cent jump on 2016. Tourism drives growth and job creation in this region, as in so many others around the country.”

The Regional Mid-sized Tourism Facilities Grant Fund was developed as part of the Government’s tourism strategy to help regions benefit from growth while managing the pressures it places on communities and infrastructure.

Budget 2016 allocated $12 million over four years for the Fund and an additional $5.5 million was announced earlier this month. The Tekapo toilets are one of 14 approved projects from the first funding round, held in 2016.

A second funding round is open until 12 April.
