Foreign Minister Murray McCully has condemned in the strongest terms today’s launch of multiple missiles by North Korea.

“This decision is highly provocative and deeply detrimental to regional and global security,” Mr McCully says.

“Today’s launches follow two North Korean nuclear tests and more than twenty missile tests since last year.   

“It is deeply frustrating that North Korea continues to show such disregard for UN Security Council resolutions, which prohibit all such missile launches.

“New Zealand strongly urges North Korea to cease such tests and abide by its international obligations,” Mr McCully says.
