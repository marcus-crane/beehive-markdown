Education Minister Hekia Parata is travelling to the United Kingdom, to talk with international experts about the biggest change to New Zealand’s education system in 30 years.

Ms Parata will share this country’s experience with Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako during meetings in London, and then in Scotland at the 7th International Summit on the Teaching Profession being held in Edinburgh.

“We have already had a great deal of interest from other countries in what we’re doing in New Zealand,” says Ms Parata.

“Communities of Learning | Kāhui Ako are part of an innovative programme of work to update and reform the education system for the first time in nearly 30 years.

“Targeted operational grant increases, the funding review, improving the use of data and the Education Act Update are all part of creating a dynamic 21st century education system with children at the centre.”

“This trip provides an opportunity for us to share our experience and learn from others about developments overseas.” 

In London, Ms Parata will meet with Dr Tim Leunig, the Department of Education’s Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Analyst.

“I am also pleased to be speaking at the Education Policy Institute and the Education Development Trust. I will also be meeting leading researchers at the Education Endowment Foundation, a charity finding ways to close the achievement gap between children from different backgrounds.”

From London the Minister will travel to Scotland to speak at the ISTP Summit, which takes place in Edinburgh on 29 - 31 March.

“This is where leaders and experts from some of the world’s highest performing economies learn from each other,” Ms Parata says.

“We are taking a very strong and experienced delegation from New Zealand, representing a variety of views. They include a deputy principal, the Chief Executive of the Education Council, the President of the New Zealand Principals’ Federation and the leaders of the PPTA and NZEI unions.”

While in Scotland, the Minister will also meet with the chief executive of the country’s General Teaching Council, as well as speak to senior academics and practitioners at the University of Edinburgh’s renowned Moray House School of Education.
