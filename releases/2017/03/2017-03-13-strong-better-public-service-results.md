State Services Minister Paula Bennett has today welcomed the Better Public Services (BPS) results which have delivered improved outcomes for people, families and businesses across every target. 

“When we set the BPS targets in 2012, we designed them to be challenging. Five years on they’re driving real improvements in the services government provides to New Zealanders to address complex and long-term issues,” Mrs Bennett says.

“None of the targets can be achieved by one agency working alone. Every one requires agencies to work together to combine their efforts and focus on what will make a difference in the lives of New Zealanders.

“More young people are getting education and qualifications to improve their employment prospects for the rest of their lives.

“Fewer children are getting rheumatic fever or being physically abused. There is less crime in our communities. More people are getting into work and off benefits. New Zealanders and businesses are spending less time engaging with government and are accessing high quality services online at a time that suits them.

“While not every result has been achieved, there has been progress made for each target that we’ve set. Across the ten results there are eleven targets. Seven targets are on track to be achieved. The remaining four are still making progress but need more work.

“The progress is not just numbers on a spreadsheet or lines on a graph. Every improvement is real, and means real changes for real people that are making a difference in their lives. 

“This Government will continue to drive positive results from our Public Service, that’s why we’re working on refreshing the BPS with new challenging targets. We want Government departments to keep striving for positive results. Our new targets will be announced later this year and will give us a new set of priorities through until 2021,” Mrs Bennett says.
