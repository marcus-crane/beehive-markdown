Conservation Minister Maggie Barry has welcomed a new predator-free initiative signed today which includes trapping in and around hundreds of holiday parks.

The partnership between the Predator Free NZ Trust and the Holiday Parks Association of New Zealand (HAPNZ) will help in the battle to make New Zealand predator-free by 2050.

“This is a timely and important contribution from the tourism sector which I hope will be the catalyst for other partnerships and I congratulate them on this initiative. Eradicating rats, stoats and possums by 2050 will deliver massive benefits for our native species, our environment and the economy through tourism,” Ms Barry says.

“Our outstanding natural landscapes are the reasons why so many local and overseas visitors holiday in New Zealand.  We have to protect our natural environment for future generations and international guests.”

The partnership will see trapping at 300 holiday parks throughout New Zealand; support predator control activities in local communities; and encourage guests to understand and support the Predator free 2050 goal.

“Just over a third of holiday park guests are international visitors so the partnership will explain to them why Predator Free 2050 is so important in the New Zealand context,” Ms Barry says.

“HAPNZ will also introduce an annual award to recognise the greatest contribution to Predator Free 2050 from a holiday park or park team member.”

“The Department of Conservation, Predator Free NZ and HAPNZ have worked closely together on this very positive leadership initiative. Through it we can grow the army of volunteers working to rid New Zealand of these predators and inspire other sectors to develop predator-free partnerships.”

“This partnership compliments the Government’s 2050 goal and along with other initiatives to be announced soon will extend the war on predators from our parks and forests to our towns and cities,” Ms Barry says
