Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis has congratulated 20 new Corrections officers and offender employment instructors who graduated at a ceremony in Upper Hutt today.

“This is the first graduation I have attended as Minister and I was impressed to see Corrections attract so many high calibre women and men from all walks of life,” Mr Davis says.

“Corrections frontline staff work face-to-face with offenders every day. It’s not always an easy job, and I’m grateful for the work they do in motivating prisoners to change their lives so we can reduce re-offending and keep our communities safe.”

Patricia Parkin from Christchurch Women’s Prison was presented with the Minister’s Excellence Award and Recognition Pin, acknowledging her leadership, professionalism and outstanding contribution throughout the 12 week training programme.

Patricia moved to New Zealand in 2009 and has spent a number of years working as a care assistant and a facilitator for youth group, Q-Topia.

“Patricia’s passion for helping people will serve her well in her new role and she will no doubt find this new career path incredibly rewarding,” Mr Davis says.

“This was also the first time a Recognition Pin has been presented to the award recipient. I hope the pin, with its silver and blue hei matau (fish hook) design, becomes a source of pride, strength and support for Patricia and future recipients.”

The new graduates will work at Mt Eden, Auckland Region Women’s, Spring Hill and Otago corrections facilities, and Waikeria, Tongariro and Christchurch Men’s and Women’s prisons.
