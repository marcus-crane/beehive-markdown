Minister for Pacific Peoples Aupito William Sio has expressed his sincere condolences and sympathies to the family of Tony Johns who has passed away. 

“Tony was the first Director of the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Ministry and was a huge advocate for Pacific communities as well as a mentor for many Pacific public servants and community leaders in New Zealand,” Mr Sio says.   

“Tony had a close relationship with Tokelau, Niue and the Marshall Islands with his work on their constitutions and governance. He also has left his mark in health, justice and the development of public good programmes like COGS, GELS and CEG through his leadership. 

“He was a strong advocate of indigenous languages too with his work with Literacy Aotearoa,” Mr Sio says.

His funeral will be held at the Pipitea Marae, Thorndon Quay, Wellington on Friday 29 December at 11:00am.
