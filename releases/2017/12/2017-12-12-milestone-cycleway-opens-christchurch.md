Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter today joined Christchurch City Councillors and local Linwood Avenue School students in opening the first stage of the Rapanui to Shag Rock Cycleway in Christchurch.

When complete, the full 6.3km cycleway will run from the central city through to Linwood and Ferrymead, connecting to the Christchurch Coastal Pathway. The first stage of the cycleway runs from Linwood Park to the Fitzgerald Avenue/Worcester Street intersection.

“Safe cycleways are a key part of making Christchurch a healthy, happy and vibrant city full of people, rather than traffic,” said Ms Genter.

“Cycleways, like the Rapanui to Shag Rock route, will make it easier for people of all ages and abilities to cycle to work, school and into town.

“Cycling to school is a great way for young people to get more exercise into their day, and that pays off with better concentration in the classroom.

“This government is committed in increasing investment in cycling and, in particular, making it safer and easier for young people to cycle to school.

“This is good news for people driving too. More people safely cycling to school and work, on alternative routes, mean less morning traffic, said Ms Genter.

As a direct alternative to the arterial roads, the Rapanui to Shag Rock Cycleway is designed to offer a more comfortable separated link for commuters and students travelling into the central city and along the eastern corridor.

Following the formal ceremony, students led guests on a first ride of the newly opened cycleway with the Cycle Safe team. Cycle Safe is a cycle skills education programme for schools where students learn the benefits of cycling and how to ride with confidence and be road-wise.

“I’m now looking forward to opening the next sections of this cycleway and seeing the benefits for Christchurch,” said Ms Genter.

The Rapanui to Shag Rock Cycleway is a $15.64 million project co-funded by the New Zealand Government, NZ Transport Agency and Christchurch City Council through the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme.
