**New Administrator of Tokelau announced**

 Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced that Mr Ross Ardern will be the next Administrator of Tokelau.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Tokelau is unique constitutionally and characterised by mutual obligations, responsibilities and shared citizenship,” Mr Peters says.

“The Administrator’s role is to ensure that public services of an appropriate standard are delivered to the New Zealand citizens living in Tokelau and helping manage the relationship between our two countries.”

 “Mr Ardern will also be responsible for overseeing New Zealand’s development assistance to Tokelau which includes major investments in internet connectivity and transport infrastructure.”

 “Mr Ardern’s experience as a High Commissioner, his extensive understanding of the Pacific, and distinguished career with New Zealand Police make him an ideal candidate for this role and I have no doubt he will make a major contribution to the relationship between New Zealand and Tokelau,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Ardern is currently New Zealand’s High Commissioner in Niue and has previously served as Niue’s Police Commissioner and as New Zealand’s Police Liaison Officer for the Pacific based in Samoa. He is expected to take up the role of Administrator in early 2018 and will be based in Auckland.
