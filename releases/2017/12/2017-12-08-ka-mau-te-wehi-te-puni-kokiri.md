Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta congratulates Te Puni Kōkiri on its 25-year anniversary which will be celebrated with a broad range of activities over the next few weeks.

“The Silver Jubilee marks 25 years of Te Puni Kokiri realising Māori potential.

“Being Māori is fantastic. Speaking Māori is sensational. Having Te Puni Kokiri deliver Māori aspirations and achievements for nearly three decades is exciting and I look forward to working with the Ministry developing new opportunities for te iwi.

“I’ve enjoyed introductory hui with the kaimahi at Te Puni Kokiri offices in the regions from Tamaki Makaurau to Otautahi, to meet, greet and understand how we can work best to improve and increase Māori outcomes.  

“The Labour-led government appreciates the significance and importance of Te Puni Kokiri and its’ role in Māori development, which is why we’ve placed the portfolio back inside Cabinet. It means the crucial calls for Māori receive top level consideration.

“Te Puni Kōkiri continues to hold a remarkable mandate that has challenged some of our most esteemed leaders navigating the waka through controversial and contemporary stormy waters, over the years.    

“I acknowledge the work of founding chief executive Tā Wira Gardiner who headed the organisation in 1991 when Te Puni Kōkiri was established after the Ministry of Māori Affairs (Manatū Māori) and Iwi Transition Agency (Te Tira Ahu Iwi) closed down.

“The Ministry’s role has evolved across the public sector to support and measure Māori success and I’m keen to continue the work that’s designed to improve and raise economic, educational, health and home aspirations for all Maori,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
