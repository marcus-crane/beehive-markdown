Wellington barrister and solicitor Christine Grice has been appointed a Judge of the High Court, Attorney‑General David Parker announced today.

Justice Grice graduated from the University of Canterbury with an LLB (Hons) in 1979 and commenced work with Fell & Harley, Lawyers in Nelson.  In 1981 she moved to Hamilton to take up a position at Harkness Henry, eventually leading the firm’s commercial litigation team, and joining the partnership in 1985. 

From 2000 to 2003, a time of significant change for the regulation and governance of the legal profession, Justice Grice chaired the Board and Council of the New Zealand Law Society as President. 

In 2004 Justice Grice was awarded the Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the legal profession.

Since 2007 Justice Grice has been a Judge of the High Court of the Cook Islands, sitting in civil and criminal jurisdictions, and from time to time sitting on the Cook Islands Court of Appeal.

In 2010 Justice Grice resigned from the partnership of Harkness Henry to take up a permanent role as Executive Director of the New Zealand Law Society.

She had been acting in that role for the previous three years to lead the implementation of the regulatory and governance changes introduced under the Lawyers & Conveyancers Act 2006.  She has remained a consultant to the firm.

The new judge will sit in Wellington.
