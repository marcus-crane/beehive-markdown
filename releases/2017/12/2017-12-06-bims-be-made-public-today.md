Briefings to Incoming Ministers (BIMs) are to be made public today in one block, in another sign of the Government’s commitment to be open and transparent, State Services Minister Chris Hipkins says. 

More than 170 documents will be published at midday on the Beehive website. They include BIMs for public sector agencies and Crown Entities, as well as supporting documents.

“The comprehensive release of BIMs in one go and in one place provides the public with a full picture of the issues the new government faces.

“While the documents contain a huge amount of information, we considered this to be a better approach than releasing BIMs one by one over time, which has happened in the past. It gets everything out in the open at the same time.”  

“The documents reveal significant challenges, particularly in health, housing and social development. We will meet these challenges head on.   

“They reinforce the need for urgent action in some areas. In our first 100 days, we’re already delivering meaningful change.”

**The documents released are in the following categories:**
