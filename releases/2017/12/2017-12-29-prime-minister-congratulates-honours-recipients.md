Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Jacinda Ardern today congratulated the 179 New Zealanders named on the 2018 New Year’s Honours List. 

“Although this list was compiled and completed by the last government, it is a pleasure to welcome in the New Year by recognising exceptional New Zealanders,” Jacinda Ardern said.

 “As an Aunty, I love reading books to my nieces, so it’s lovely to congratulate Joy Cowley, who is made a member of the Order of New Zealand today. 

“Joy Cowley’s extraordinary contribution to literature and literacy is treasured in New Zealand and internationally. She has brought delight to many young New Zealanders, as well to those who read her books to them. Her work demonstrates the wonderful opportunity authors have to not only engage and inspire, but to educate. 

“As Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage I congratulate the 26 New Zealanders recognised for their contributions to arts and culture.  

“New Zealanders’ expertise and love for the arts in Aotearoa is reflected in this year’s Honours List, with the number of honours awarded for arts and culture second only to contributions in our community, voluntary and local services. 

“I also acknowledge a personal mentor, colleague and friend, the Honourable Annette King, for her appointment today as a Dame Companion of The New Zealand Order of Merit. 

“Annette’s example as a Cabinet Minister, electorate MP and our longest serving woman MP, is one members across Parliament strive to emulate. She is well respected across the political spectrum and loved by her community. 

“Congratulations also to the Honourable Georgina Te Heuheu, being made a Dame Companion of The New Zealand Order of Merit for services both to the State and Māori.  

“Thank you to all of the 2018 Honours recipients for their contributions and service,” Ms Ardern said.
