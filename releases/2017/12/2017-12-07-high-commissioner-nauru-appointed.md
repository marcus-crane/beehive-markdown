**High Commissioner to Nauru appointed**

 

 

Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters has announced New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Nauru will be career diplomat Nicci Simmonds.

 

“New Zealand and Nauru enjoy a good relationship and the High Commissioner will play an important role in strengthening our engagement around mutual interests,” says Mr Peters.

 

“New Zealand contributes approximately $2.3 million in development assistance to Nauru each year with a focus on building greater self-reliance through improving educational achievement, protecting Pacific fisheries and increasing access to renewable energy.

 

“New Zealand is also looking forward to Nauru hosting the Pacific Island Forum Leaders’ Meeting in 2018, and to attending Nauru’s milestone celebration of 50 years of independence at the end of January 2018.”

 

Ms Simmonds, who is Unit Manager in the Pacific Branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and manages the Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Nauru team, will be based in New Zealand.
