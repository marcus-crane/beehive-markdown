Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced new Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko curriculum content is being included in *The New Zealand Curriculum* and *Te Marautanga o Aotearoa*.  

“One of my goals as Education Minister is to make sure we are future-proofing our education system. This means we need to change the way we do things to keep ahead of changing technologies,” Mr Hipkins said.

“The digital curriculum content positions us as global leaders in education, meeting the needs of a digital and fast-paced world and making sure our students will be job-ready when they graduate.

“Young people will learn how digital technologies work and will develop critical thinking skills and learn key competencies such as collaboration, communication, problem solving, and ethical and safety awareness.

“The Hangarau Matihiko curriculum content connects traditional Māori practices and knowledge with digital confidence. The Hangarau concepts reinforce the importance of understanding the past to inform future practice for people and the environment.” 

The release of the content follows a consultation period with teachers, kaiako, schools and kura, parents and whānau. Over the next two year period we will continue to work with the sector to ensure they receive the support they need to understand and implement the content. We will seek feedback during implementation to enable us to make any adjustments required. 

The Ministry is supporting schools and kura to build their staff capability, so they can support their learners with the skills needed to succeed, and work with parents and whānau to develop the best fit for their students.  

Schools and kura are expected to integrate the Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko curriculum content by 2020. It will be taught from Years 1-10, with the option to specialise from Years 11-13.

The new Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko curriculum content is available from - [technology.tki.org.nz](http://www.technology.tki.org.nz/) and [hangaraumatihiko.tki.org.nz](http://www.hangaraumatihiko.tki.org.nz/) 

A package of support will be rolled out for teachers and kaiako to build their capability and confidence in teaching the curriculum from 2018. View more on these initiatives here - [education.govt.nz/digitech](http://www.education.govt.nz/digitech)
