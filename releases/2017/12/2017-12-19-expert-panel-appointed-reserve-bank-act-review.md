The members of the Independent Expert Advisory Panel for Phase 1 of the Review of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 bring considerable knowledge and expertise to the table, Finance Minister Grant Robertson says.

Suzanne Snively ONZM has been appointed Chair of the Panel and is joined by members Dr Malcolm Edey and Dr Girol Karacaoglu.

“This is a high-calibre Panel with extensive experience in banking, finance, economics, policy development and governance. Their input will be invaluable for the Reserve Bank Act Review,” Grant Robertson says.

“As announced on 7 November, the Act is being reviewed to ensure our monetary policy framework still provides the most efficient and effective model for New Zealand.”

The Review is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 (led by the Treasury with technical advice from the Reserve Bank) will recommend changes to the Act to provide for requiring monetary policy decision-makers to give due consideration to maximising employment alongside the Bank’s price stability framework. It will also provide for a committee decision-making model for monetary policy decisions, and consider whether changes are required to the role of the Reserve Bank Board as a consequence of the alterations to the decision-making model.

The Independent Expert Advisory Panel will provide input and support for the Review. It will also be expected to test Treasury’s findings. The Panel will produce its own report of its views on the Treasury’s conclusions and recommendations to the Minister of Finance on Phase 1 of the Review.

The Reserve Bank and the Treasury will jointly develop a list of areas for Phase 2 of the Review where further investigations of the Bank’s activities may be desirable. The Panel will assist in the development of this list. Phase 2 will also incorporate the review of the macro-prudential framework that was already scheduled for 2018.

The first meeting between the Panel and officials is planned for later this month, with further meetings in early 2018. The membership of the Panel for taking forward policy work for Phase 2, as well as their terms of engagement, will be determined once the list of Phase 2 issues has been scoped.
