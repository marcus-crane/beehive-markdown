**Celebrating our volunteers on International Volunteers’ Day**

Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector Peeni Henare is celebrating International Volunteers’ Day today (5 December) and acknowledges the efforts of thousands of New Zealanders who volunteer for their communities each year.

“Many essential services in New Zealand are reliant on everyday volunteers, so it is important to recognise the contributions they make to their communities,” Mr Henare says.

International Volunteers’ Day is an initiative led by the United Nations, and this year’s theme is ‘Volunteers act first. Here. Everywhere’ recognising volunteer efforts around the world and paying tribute to the support that volunteers provide in times of instability, disaster or crisis.

“New Zealanders are amongst the most generous in the world when it comes to volunteering and helping others, which not only has major benefits for local communities, but also gives volunteers valuable skills and experiences. Our volunteers make a vital contribution to New Zealand in many areas, including sports, culture and heritage, emergency and social services, education, the environment, and more. Volunteers spend approximately 157 million hours each year working throughout New Zealand.”

“Lending a helping hand and contributing to the greater good is what it means to be a Kiwi, so we should be proud to celebrate those who generously give their time and effort to help others,” says Mr Henare.
