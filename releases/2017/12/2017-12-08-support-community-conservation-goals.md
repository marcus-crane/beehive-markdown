Conservation groups across New Zealand will benefit from $4.2 million in new funding grants announced today by Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage.

Ms Sage made the announcement at Glenfalloch Woodland Gardens in Dunedin while visiting the Otago Peninsula Biodiversity Trust, an outstanding example of community conservation work receiving a $100,000 grant.

“The DOC Community Fund is designed to provide community conservation and recreation groups with an all-important boost to reach their goals for protecting native wildlife, restoring vital habitat and improving access to New Zealand’s outdoors,” Ms Sage says.

“The Otago Peninsula Biodiversity Trust’s work is an inspiring example of community action, volunteers working with farmers and other landowners to protect the Peninsula’s distinctive wildlife from predators.

“The richness of the peninsula’s biodiversity must be nurtured and protected. Yellow-eyed and little blue penguins make their home here, and it has the world’s largest mainland albatross colony, as well as geckoes and invertebrates,”

To date the group has removed 12,600 possums through volunteer efforts, part of a programme to permanently reduce possum numbers across the peninsula. This will improve forest health and increase the breeding success of bird, lizard and insect populations.

The new Community Fund grant will allow the group to increase the number of volunteers and expand its predator control efforts.

“Ultimately the Trust hopes to make the entire Otago Peninsula pest free – projects like this are crucial in helping our native plants and wildlife thrive,” Ms Sage says.

Other recipients of this year’s funding include:

**Project Crimson Trust - Trees That Count Community Partnerships ($300,000)**
