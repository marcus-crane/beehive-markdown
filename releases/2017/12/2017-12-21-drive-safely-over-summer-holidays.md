Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter and Police Minister Stuart Nash are urging people to travel safely over the summer holidays.

“2017 has been a shocking year with 369 people having lost their lives on our roads already,” Ms Genter says.

“Too many families are going into Christmas this year without their loved ones because of crashes that could have been avoided.

“We all have a responsibility to make sure everyone gets home safe for Christmas,” says Mr Nash. “Don’t be afraid to challenge behaviour that may lead to unsafe driving on our challenging roads. 

“The people we have lost this year are more than a statistic. They are parents, children, friends and colleagues. Each one has left people behind who are grieving for their loss,” he says.

“The government is doing its bit to make our roads safer by increasing resources for Police and boosting road safety funding by $22.5 million this summer,” said Ms Genter.

“In 2018, road safety will be a major priority for the Government. The trauma on our roads is unacceptable and something needs to change,” Ms Genter says.

The official holiday period will begin at 4pm on Friday 22 December 2017 and end at 6am on Wednesday 3 January 2018.
