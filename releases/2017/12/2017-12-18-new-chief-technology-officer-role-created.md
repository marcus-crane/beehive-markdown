Communications Minister Clare Curran has called for expressions of interest for the new role of Chief Technology Officer position to help drive a forward-looking digital agenda for New Zealand.

“We need to respond to the opportunities and challenges of our changing digital world. This position is critical to ensuring we can use and develop digital technologies for social prosperity, economic productivity, and for the good of all New Zealanders,” Ms Curran says.

“The Chief Technology Officer role would suit someone who has a high level of expertise in the digital technology industry, who is passionate about the issues, who carries the influence needed to stimulate public discussion, and who wants to take action with government and other stakeholders to deliver and support meaningful change.”

The Chief Technology Officer will be accountable to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media, and Government Digital Services, and will provide independent expert advice to Ministers and senior leaders on digital issues.

“The Chief Technology Officer will be responsible for preparing and overseeing a national digital architecture, or roadmap, for the next five to ten years,” Ms Curran says.

“This Government intends to close the digital divides by 2020, and to make ICT the second largest contributor to GDP by 2025. The internet and digital tools are fundamental to us achieving these goals

“In particular, I see the Chief Technology Officer working on issues such as improving digital equality, protecting citizens’ rights online, and building a connected nation, alongside the Digital Economy and Digital Inclusion Advisory Group and the other Advisory Groups that I have already signalled I will be establishing.

“Although the role sits within the government context, the Chief Technology Officer will require a collaborative way of working across government, with Ministers and officials, and with a range of other stakeholders to shape and drive New Zealand’s digital agenda,” Ms Curran says.
