Education Minister Chris Hipkins has announced a $5 million dollar project to redevelop the Decile 4 Karamea Area School at the northern end of the West Coast of the South Island.

The school caters for students from Year 1 to Year 13. It is in an isolated location, with the closest primary school an hour away by car, and the closest secondary school closer to 90 minutes. 

This significant project involves the demolition and reconstruction of two teaching spaces, the library block and boiler room, all of which suffer from weathertightness issues, poor building conditions and at around 50 years old, are at the end of their economic lives.

The remainder of the school will be refurbished, this includes upgrading nine teaching spaces. Major infrastructure upgrades will also ensure the school’s water supply and wastewater systems are fit for purpose.

Minister Hipkins says the redevelopment is a hugely important project for the people of Karamea.

“Regional development is a key plank of Government policy – and that includes investing in our key infrastructure around the country.

“I’m proud to announce this project, and to ensure the young people of this area will have a modern, fit-for-purpose school to give them a great start.

 “Like all isolated communities, the people of Karamea have a strong sense of belonging, and this project will help keep the area’s young people connected to their families and the town.”

The project is now in the design phase. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and completed in early 2020.
