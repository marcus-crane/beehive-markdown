Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Minister Clare Curran has appointed Aucklander Wendy Palmer to the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) Board.

“In 1990 she took a break from the sector to establish international market research company Market Pulse Ltd and she is still its executive chair.

“Reentering the broadcasting industry in 2005 Wendy Palmer joined MediaWorks and held a number of senior executive positions including as CEO of MediaWorks Radio. She stepped down in April 2017.

“Wendy Palmer has served as director and chair of the Auckland New Venture Trust and the Radio Bureau and as a board member of the Radio Broadcasters Association,” Clare Curran said.

She was nominated for the role by broadcasting sector representatives and her appointment takes effect from 1 January.
