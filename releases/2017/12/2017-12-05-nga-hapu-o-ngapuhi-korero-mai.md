Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Andrew Little continues his Ngāpuhi listening tour throughout Te Tai Tokerau following the announcement of six more hui this weekend.

“My focus is now on the smaller regions of the rohe, to hear from hapū, as I’ve met with some rangatira and key advisors of the larger Ngāpuhi groups.

“I’m looking forward to visiting and hearing from hapū at meetings in Kaeo, Ohaeawai, Moerewa, Omapere, Titoki and Whangarei.  This is an opportunity to meet, greet and hear how the hapū see the settlement negotiations shaping up. I’m also keen for Ngāpuhi hapū to understand that I’m there to listen.

“I’m happy with the response we’ve had so far, from attendance numbers and iwi feedback following our previous hui in Waitangi two weeks ago.

“I’ve heard the hui are providing an opportunity for all hapū to discuss what’s best for Ngāpuhi and how they see the settlement advancing their communities,” says Andrew Little.
