Health Minister Dr David Clark acknowledges the resignation of Director-General of Health Chai Chuah today.

“I’d like to thank him for his public service as Director-General of Health since November 2013 and I respect his decision to finish early.

“I’m advised by the State Services Commissioner that an acting Director-General of Health will be appointed shortly.

“Leadership and relationships are key parts for our health sector’s success. I look forward to continuing to work with the health sector’s leadership to deliver quality health services, which all New Zealanders deserve and expect.

“I am unable to comment further at this stage,” says Dr Clark.
