Minister Responsible for Pike River Re-entry Andrew Little has announced the appointment of Rob Fyfe as an independent advisor who will provide impartial advice on plans for the re-entry of the Pike River drift.

“The new role will provide crucial independent advice to me so I can be sure of the quality and thoroughness of the information I receive from the Pike River Recovery Agency. The role provides another safeguard for the families and the public.

“Appointing an independent advisor will ensure I have access to a third-party perspective and independent assurance about the adequacy of the Agency’s processes.

“Mr Fyfe’s background as former CEO of Air New Zealand means he is well equipped to advise on safety sensitive activities and workplace environments needing best practice risk assessment and management.

“Mr Fyfe’s other great quality as CEO of Air New Zealand was a real empathy for those who had suffered tragedy which he shared in the aftermath of the 2008 A320 crash in France.

“He also sent 30 airline personnel to assist the Pike families immediately following the disaster in 2010. The members of the Pike River Families Reference Group have expressed their support for this role and the appointee.

“I look forward to working with Mr Fyfe who takes up the role from 31 January 2018, when Te Kāhui Whakamana Rua Te Kau mā Iwa-Pike River Recovery Agency will also be formally established,” says Andrew Little.
