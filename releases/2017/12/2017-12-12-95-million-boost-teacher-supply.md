Education Minister Chris Hipkins today announced an immediate $9.5 million teacher supply package to support more teachers into classrooms in 2018.

 

“Principals have been telling the Government for many months they are desperately trying to plug a major shortage of teachers in locations such as Auckland and in subjects including science, te reo Māori, technology and maths,” Mr Hipkins said. 

 

“After years of ignoring the problem, National’s late and panicked promise to help had zero funding attached to it. This Government, however, has listened and has prioritised funding for a $9.5 million boost to address immediate pressures while the need for further initiatives will be considered for Budget 2018.

 

“The funding, which is approved by Cabinet, will support more graduates into permanent teaching positions, support experienced teachers back into the profession and recruit new graduates into teaching.

 

“The package includes:

- Expanding the eligibility of the Voluntary Bonding Scheme (VBS) to beginning teachers who start in decile two and three schools in Auckland next year,
- Expanding VBS nationally to new teachers of science, technology, maths and te reo Māori.
- Expanding the Auckland Beginner Teacher Project to increase the employment of beginning teachers in permanent or fixed-term roles in Auckland primary schools and to support them to become fully certificated teachers.
- Help to retain experienced teachers whose practicing certificates are about to expire, and attract back teachers who haven’t taught for six years, by covering the cost of the Teacher Education Refresher course.
- Financial support to schools needing to attract and retain teachers with limited authority to teach in skill areas that are in short supply.
- Promoting and making it faster, easier and cheaper for overseas teachers from the UK, Ireland, Canada, South Africa and Fiji to come and work in New Zealand.

 

“Together with a commitment to address teacher workloads and to raise the status of the profession, this is the first stage of a comprehensive programme to alleviate teacher shortages and build a strong and engaged workforce,” Mr Hipkins says.
