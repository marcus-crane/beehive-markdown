Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor has welcomed 28 new projects under the Sustainable Farming Fund (SFF), and the new SFF Tere pilot scheme announced today.

The SFF supports community-led projects at the grass-roots level to build productivity and resilience throughout the primary industries.

These 28 projects represent a combined investment of around $7.15 million.

“The SFF has enabled unique collaborations of farmers and growers, scientists and researchers, iwi, local government and many others that are making a real difference for our rural communities and the wider primary industries,” says Mr O’Connor.

“The SFF Tere pilot has been an opportunity to show we can take the SFF even further by enabling the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to increase investment in smaller projects.”

The name “SFF Tere” translates in English to be quick, swift or fast, which describes the nature of projects funded.

“I discussed the SFF with MPI officials and challenged them to develop an initiative that would enable investment in small SFF projects,” says Mr O’Connor.

“The result is SFF Tere, and I’m pleased that four SFF Tere projects, representing $271,000 in investment, have already been approved and will get under way in the new calendar year.

“SFF and SFF Tere projects must contribute towards improving our primary industries’ economic, environmental, and social wellbeing. 

“Many SFF projects have played a key role in delivering ways to optimise the use of our resources and protect the environment for future generations.

“I’m looking forward to seeing the difference these new 28 projects will make.”
