Minister for Pacific Peoples Hon Aupito William Sio has announced applications for the 2018 Prime Ministers Pacific Youth Awards are now open. 

First held in 2010, the Awards hosted by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples (MPP) provide an opportunity for high-achieving Pacific youth in New Zealand to be recognised for their contribution to the country by the Rt Hon Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern.

The Pacific community is one of the fastest growing and youngest populations in NZ, and Minister Sio says making sure this group thrive is crucial for the country’s economic and social outlook.

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards not only recognise and celebrate Pacific youth success, but they create a network of young emerging Pacific leaders, while showcasing Pacific talent to key stakeholders,” Minister Sio adds. 

The Awards are integrated with MPP’s youth engagement initiatives and are the Prime Minister’s opportunity to affirm her relationship with the increasingly vibrant Pacific community across NZ.   

Awards are presented in eight categories – Leadership and Inspiration; Top Regional Pacific Scholar; Community Star; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); Arts and Creativity; Commercial and Corporate; Business and Enterprise; and Sport and Fitness. 

Awards vary for each category – from a diplomatic international experience, to paid summer internships and grants to support further study and career development.

Additionally, the 2018 award winners will also be offered personalised leadership development support. 

With so many talented and gifted Pacific youth in every award category, Minister Sio strongly encourages individuals to apply for these prestigious awards. 

Past award winners have gone on to gain highly visible roles and become proactive leaders throughout New Zealand.

Applications for the 2018 Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards open today and close 6 February 2018, to be followed by an Awards ceremony.
