A new centre designed to encourage collaboration between Police, scientists and crime researchers has been opened in Wellington by Police Minister Stuart Nash.

The Evidence Based Policing Centre brings together Police, the University of Waikato, and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) as joint partners. The agencies and the centre are also supported by Police strategic partner, Vodafone New Zealand.

Mr Nash says staff from the three agencies will work collaboratively in an open environment to focus on crime and science research and other initiatives to benefit operational policing.

“The Centre is designed to better inform Police in their work to prevent crime and protect the public. It uses information, crime-science and problem-solving methods to lead to better, smarter, and more efficient ways of working,” says Mr Nash.

“I am a firm believer in the need for agencies and sectors to work together to solve problems. The mix of skills and experience at this new Centre will produce research and potential innovations drawn from a rich source of data, information and expertise.

“This evidence base will inform Police strategy and tactical decision-making at the frontline to help ensure Police do an even better job at preventing and responding to crime and victimisation.

“This approach fits squarely with Police’s ‘Prevention First’ model and is another example of an organisation constantly challenging itself to look for new ways of preventing crime and ensuring public safety.

“When the first of our intended 1800 new officers join the Police the organisation will have a much greater understanding of what works well and where enhancements can be made.

“This Centre has the very real potential to be world-leading in the field of evidence-based policing and I wish every success to all those involved,” says Mr Nash.
