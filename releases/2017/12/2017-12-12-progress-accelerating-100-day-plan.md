This week marks the half way stage of the Government’s 100 Day Plan and will see further pleasing progress on delivering on our commitments, says Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

 “We promised we would be a different government, one that makes dealing with child poverty and reducing inequality a priority. We are delivering on that promise.

 “On Thursday we will introduce legislation to give effect to the Families Package. Changes to Working for Families will boost the incomes of low and middle income earners and lift tens of thousands of children out of poverty.

 “In addition, Best Start and the Winter Energy Payment will provide other much needed support to parents, superannuitants and beneficiaries.

 "We also promised we would be a fiscally responsible government. By cancelling the National government’s tax cuts we can afford to deliver that support while still meeting the financial targets we have set ourselves.

 “This week we will reach the half way stage of our 100 Day Plan and I’m pleased with the significant progress we have made to date.

 “There’s much more to come as we continue to deliver on our plan, tackle National’s legacy of underfunding in health, housing and education and ensure the gains of economic growth are more fairly shared,” says Prime Minister Ardern.
