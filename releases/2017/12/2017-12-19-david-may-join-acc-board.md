The ACC Board will be joined by experienced director David May from 1 January 2018, the Minister for ACC Iain Lees-Galloway announced today.

“Mr May will bring senior governance experience and investment oversight to the Board having served as Chair of the Guardians of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund,  Deputy Chair of the Government Superannuation Fund Authority and as a director of several insurance companies.

“Mr May has a background as an actuary in the insurance industry where he progressed to Chief Executive roles, and will be a valuable addition to this Board.

“I thank the departing board member Jill Spooner for her service and commitment. Ms Spooner has made a considerable contribution to the board over the past six years,” says Mr Lees-Galloway.
