Climate Change Minister James Shaw has welcomed the One Planet Summit being hosted in Paris on 12 December – two years to the day after the historic Paris Agreement was concluded. 

“Climate change affects everybody, everywhere. The action people take in their everyday lives, however, must be supported by strong and sustained political leadership.”

“The One Planet Summit aims to bring together that political leadership and reinforces the growing momentum for global climate action, not just from the 170 governments that have already ratified the Paris Agreement, but also from local government and the finance sector,” Mr Shaw says.

On 12 December 2017 the One Planet Summit will bring together heads of government, along with local government, finance and business leaders, to showcase their support for accelerated global efforts to fight climate change.

“It will be two years to the day since 150 heads of state turned up in Paris in support of a new international agreement on climate change.

“I am heartened by the growing focus around the world on moving to ‘green’ investment. Finance flows are increasingly being managed to get the incentives right for a shift away from coal and oil and towards support for decarbonisation.

“The One Planet Summit complements the recent UN climate meeting I attended in Bonn. Momentum continues next year when Governor Jerry Brown will convene a summit of business and other non-state organisations, and in 2019, when Secretary General Guterres will host a UN Climate Change Summit.

“Regular gatherings such as the One Planet Summit are essential to maintain our focus on collective progress in dealing with climate change,” Mr Shaw says. 

New Zealand will be represented at the One Planet Summit by our ambassador to France, Jane Coombs.
