Minister Andrew Little welcomed and acknowledged the rangatira of Ngāti Tūwharetoa who were at Parliament today as their claims settlement Bill passed its first reading this morning.

“I acknowledged Sir Tumu Te Heuheu and Sir Michael Cullen who have worked tirelessly for Ngāti Tuwharetoa.

“A second Bill, the Iwi and Hapū of Te Rohe Wairoa Claims Settlement Bill, also received its second reading today.

“The government is committed to settling historical Treaty grievances and to building a new partnership between the Crown and Māori.

“The Ngāti Tūwharetoa settlement includes an agreed historical account, a Crown apology and commercial and cultural redress. It is a significant step towards full and final settlement of all historical claims of Ngāti Tūwharetoa,” says Mr Little
