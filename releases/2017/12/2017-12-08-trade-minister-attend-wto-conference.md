Trade Minister David Parker will depart this weekend to attend the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

“At Buenos Aires I will be seeking to secure better rules in the WTO in order to limit subsidisation of agriculture and fisheries,” says Minister Parker.

“WTO Members will be seeking further progress on these issues from the meeting in Buenos Aires which builds on New Zealand’s efforts in two previous meetings in Bali in 2013 and Nairobi in 2015.

“The WTO membership has chosen New Zealand to be one of the Vice Chairs for the Conference.    In that role, I look forward to working with the Argentine Chair, and with all other WTO members, in brokering a successful outcome.”  

“The WTO system is the most important set of international trade rules.  They can, if used properly, help not just trade, but also the environment, as they allow issues to be addressed more effectively,” says Mr Parker
