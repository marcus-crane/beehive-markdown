Minister supporting Greater Christchurch Regeneration Nicky Wagner is welcoming the start of preliminary work to reinstate ChristChurch Cathedral.

“It’s been less than a week since Synod voted in favour of the Government’s offer to support reinstatement, but we’re already making significant progress — Bishop Victoria Matthews and I have signed an agreement outlining the project’s commercial, financial and legal terms, and we have a name for the independent trust,” Ms Wagner says.

“The ChristChurch Cathedral Restoration Trust will be responsible for fundraising and managing the project, alongside the Church Property Trustees.

“Work is already underway to set up an establishment group to develop the joint venture structure and a project plan that reflects the recommendations of the ChristChurch Cathedral Working Group.

“This group will help determine who else should be involved, so I look forward to its recommendations.

“We’ve also begun looking into the legislation required to streamline consenting and approval processes.

“It’s important we get these structures and processes in place so we can begin work on site as quickly as possible. 

“While I’m keen to maintain this momentum, the General Election is just around the corner, so there’s likely to be a settling in period, whatever the outcome. 

“Even so, we’re fielding many queries about where to send donations and a bank account will be available from next week.”
