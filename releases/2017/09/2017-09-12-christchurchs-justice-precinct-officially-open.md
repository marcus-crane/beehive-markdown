Christchurch’s state-of-the-art Justice and Emergency Services Precinct was officially opened by Prime Minister Bill English this morning.

Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams says today’s opening marks the latest and most significant milestone in the $300 million Precinct’s development.

“This is a special day for Cantabrians. The Precinct will provide a welcome boost to the vibrancy and economy of Christchurch city, with an estimated 2000 people either working in or visiting the facility daily,” she says.

“The Precinct is the largest multi-agency government co-location project in New Zealand’s history and brings all regional justice and emergency services together in one purpose-built facility.

“It has been built to withstand seismic events and contains special resiliency features to enable the Emergency Operations Centre and 111 Call Centre to continue operating in a major emergency, including a back-up power generator, 100,000 litres of portable water and 100,000 litres of sewerage storage,” says Ms Adams.

The official opening of the Precinct will be followed by a public open day at the weekend to give Cantabrians the opportunity to have a behind-the-scenes look at spaces that would otherwise be restricted once operations begin.

Following the public open day, agencies will begin moving in and it is expected that the first public facing operations will begin in mid-October.

“I know that Cantabrians have been eagerly awaiting the opening of the Precinct, which will breathe new life into a city that continues to rise from the rubble of the earthquakes,” says Ms Adams.
