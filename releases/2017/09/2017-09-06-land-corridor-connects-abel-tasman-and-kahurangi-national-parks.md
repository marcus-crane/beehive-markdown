Abel Tasman and Kahurangi national parks are now connected by a 169-hectare block of land purchased by the Nature Heritage Fund, Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner announced today.

The land, purchased for $275,000, has high ecological value and will be added to Abel Tasman National Park.

“The purchase of this land completes a chain of legally-protected natural areas linking Abel Tasman National Park with Kahurangi National Park. These protected areas form a scenic skyline of continuous native forest on the crest of the Pikikiruna Range and Takaka Hill,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Nature Heritage Fund is also purchasing an adjoining 43-hectare block from the same landowner. This block needs to be surveyed before being transferred to the Department of Conservation (DOC), but it too will be added to Abel Tasman National Park.

“These parcels of land contain diverse and rare ecosystems. Nearly half the land is covered in original forest and vegetation, and more than 200 native plant species grow there, including species only found locally or in the wider north-west Nelson area.

“Birdlife on the land includes the threatened bush falcon/kārearea, and populations of tūī, kererū and bellbird.”

The 169-hectare block borders Abel Tasman National Park to its north and its southern boundary adjoins Takaka Hill Scenic Reserve. It is being managed by DOC as scenic reserve while the process of adding it to Abel Tasman National Park is completed.

Since 1990 the Nature Heritage Fund has protected over 341,880 hectares of indigenous ecosystem through legal and physical protection.
