Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee is encouraging all New Zealanders in, and travelling to Bali to register with Safe Travel.

“Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority has raised the volcanic alert level for Mount Agung to level four, the highest level on their scale,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Bali is a popular holiday destination for New Zealanders, and I encourage Kiwis living or travelling to Bali to register with SafeTravel.

“Registered New Zealanders will receive updated advice and information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the event the situation deteriorates.

“Residents and tourists have been warned to stay at least 12 kilometres from the volcano’s crater.

“There are evacuation orders in place for those within that area due to the potential for an eruption.

“In the event of volcanic ash clouds, New Zealanders travelling to or from Bali are advised to confirm their travel arrangements with their airline or travel agent directly, prior to travelling to the airport,” Mr Brownlee says.

SafeTravel launched in 2006 and is the official source of advice for New Zealanders living or travelling overseas.

There are currently 386 New Zealanders registered as being in Bali.
