The fuel industry is cautiously optimistic as the pipeline disruption situation continues to improve, Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins says.

“With the pipeline successfully repaired, the first two million litre batch of jet fuel is on track to arrive at Auckland Airport late tonight, subject to necessary settling and testing.   Planes are expected to fuelled using this supply from the early hours of Tuesday morning. Another five million litres should be available through the pipeline from Wednesday,” Ms Collins says.

“The amount of fuel being trucked from Marsden Point refinery to the Airport continues to increase, with 184,000 litres expected to be delivered today. This is more than twice the amount delivered on Friday.

“More jet fuel should be available from Wednesday, with trucks transporting stocks stored at Wynyard Wharf. NZDF will be providing expert support around the use of their fuel filter that has been provided at Wynyard.

“While industry is responding well and I am encouraged by the improving situation, it’s important to realise that we are recovering from a 10 day disruption to normal supply.

“Industry remains cautiously optimistic but there’s still plenty of work to do. Government continues to monitor the situation and is ready to provide industry further assistance, if required.

“Flights in and out of Auckland Airport are continuing to look very much like business as usual, with only four international flight cancellations today. No domestic flights have been cancelled.”
