Transport Minister Simon Bridges was joined by Wellington City Mayor Justin Lester today to turn the sod on the Cobham Drive Cycleway, part of Wellington’s refreshed Urban Cycleway Programme.

“This cycleway will become an iconic feature of Wellington’s eastern gateway,” Mr Bridges says.

“As a key part of the proposed Great Harbour Way, the Cobham Drive Cycleway will serve as an important link to other planned routes in Miramar and Kilbirnie, and to the central city.”

The design of the two-way cycleway is integrated with the coastal environment and features landscaping and planting that will complement the wind sculptures along the harbour’s edge.

Today’s sod turning follows the start of work on upgrading the Hutt Road shared path into a cycleway, which began in April.

“It is fantastic to see Wellington making fast progress on the city’s refreshed Urban Cycleways Programme. Today also marks the start of the Council’s next urban cycleway project,” Mr Bridges says.

Public consultation has begun for cycleways planned in the eastern suburbs including options for Evans Bay Parade, and better biking connections in Kilbirnie and Miramar.

“This is a great opportunity for the community to have their say in shaping a safer, connected cycling network for Wellington that will improve transport for everyone,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Cobham Drive Cycleway and planned eastern routes are part of the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme, a $333 million investment to build key, high-value urban cycling projects throughout the country.”
