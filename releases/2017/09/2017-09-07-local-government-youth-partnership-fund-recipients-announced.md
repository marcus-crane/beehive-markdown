Fifteen councils up and down New Zealand will share $280,000 of funding under the 2017 Local Government Youth Partnership Fund, Youth Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The Local Government Youth Partnership Fund recognises that councils have far-reaching local networks with young people, local businesses, iwi and community partners,” says Ms Kaye.

“We want to help young people access and benefit from these connections to grow their capabilities and resilience, and contribute to their communities at the same time.

“The fund is overseen by the Partnership Fund Board, set up in 2016 as part of a new direction for youth development in New Zealand.

“A focus of this new direction is working more collaboratively to deliver and grow youth development opportunities such as mentoring, volunteering and leadership opportunities.

“It’s great to be able to support councils to reach out to local youth and build opportunities for them to become more involved, and develop their own potential at the same time.

“I expect that together, we will support the creation of more than 2,500 new youth development opportunities through these projects.”
