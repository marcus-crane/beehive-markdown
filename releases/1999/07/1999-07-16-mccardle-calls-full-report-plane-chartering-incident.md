Associate Work and Income Minister Peter McCardle said today he was very concerned about the hiring of a charter plane by a WINZ staff member, and has called for an urgent report.

"It is clearly an operational matter and as such is the responsibility of WINZ senior management. But, as WINZ Ministers, both Roger Sowry and myself insist that there be full accountability for any deficiencies in WINZ's administrative processes, and for prompt action to be taken where necessary.

"I had an initial briefing today but I have asked for a fuller explanation as to how the incident came about, and expect a report by early next week."
