ACC reforms will save universities, polytechnics and colleges of education about 30 per cent in workplace accident insurance premiums, a survey of tertiary institutions has found.

Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford said the survey of 27 of the country's 39 tertiary education institutions showed that the 27 organisations expected to save a total of about $2.4 million in the next year.

The estimate was based on the number of claims the institutions expected to make. The survey was carried out by the Ministry of Education.

"These savings come on top of the estimated saving of $50 million for government agencies this year and wider savings in the order of half a billion dollars over the next two years," Mr Bradford said.
