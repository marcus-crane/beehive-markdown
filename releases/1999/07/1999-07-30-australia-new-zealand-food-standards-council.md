Health Minister Wyatt Creech will travel to Australia to attend a meeting of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council on Tuesday.

"The joint Australia New Zealand Council of Ministers responsible for food standards will consider a number of issues including labelling of genetically modified food," Mr Creech said.

In December 1998 Ministers made an 'in principle' decision to extend the relevant food standard to require labelling of all GMFs.

"The New Zealand Government supports a practical, workable regime for informing people on genetically modified foods.

"The Government is committed to the consumer's right to be able to make an informed choice when purchasing food, and will take an approach which will reflect that commitment.

"There has been considerable public consultation and policy advice about how best to make this food standard work.

"The consultation process raised some of the issues and options for labelling GMFs they included WTO obligations and compliance costs."

Mr Creech arrives in Canberra on Monday night and will meet other ministers before the council meeting which begins at 1:30 pm on Tuesday. A full day meeting of Health Ministers will be held on Wednesday and Mr Creech will also represent New Zealand at the Community Services Ministers' Meeting on Thursday before returning to New Zealand.
