Sports Minister Murray McCully and Hillary Commission Chairman Sir Brian Lochore are urging New Zealanders to back the Black Team in the exciting series of fixtures being played by New Zealand teams, between now and the Sydney Olympics in September 2000.

Speaking before the first challenge for the All Blacks this year, the two announced a campaign to raise the profile of the Black Flag as a visible means to support New Zealand teams.

20,000 black flags with silver ferns will be on hand at Carisbrook this Saturday for the South African test.

"New Zealand's key sports people face a series of major challenges with the All Blacks and Silver Ferns building up to their World Cup, our sailors working on the successful defence of the America's Cup and the start of the long build up for our Olympic Team, amongst others."

"On Saturday, we are going to be at Carisbrook inviting New Zealanders to wave the black flag and support the New Zealand Team."
