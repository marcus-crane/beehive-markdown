Waitakere MP and Associate Minister for ACC, Hon Marie Hasler and Waipareira MP Brian Neeson expressed their sadness and disappointment over today's protest outside the Henderson ACC Branch by Alliance list MP Laila Harre.

"With some dozen or so supporters, Laila Harre has shown appalling lack of judgement and complete insensitivity in choosing the Henderson branch of ACC to mount a political protest," both West Auckland MPs said.

"At a time when staff are struggling to come to terms with the tragic death of their colleague Mrs Janet Pike, this action has caused them further grief and stress.

"Only days after their loss and not 48 hours after the memorial service for Janet, when staff are obviously grieving and in shock, it is disappointing to see such sorry and remorseless behaviour.

"We have asked Ms Harre for an apology, on behalf of the staff at Henderson branch, who are understandably distressed at this thoughtless action."
