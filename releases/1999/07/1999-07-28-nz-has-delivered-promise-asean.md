Foreign Minister Don McKinnon delivered a strong message of support for furthering New Zealand's relationship with Asia in Singapore this week.

In concluding remarks to the ninth ASEAN Post Ministerial meeting, Mr McKinnon revisited his 1991 pledge to place a priority on New Zealand's relations with the member states of ASEAN.

"I said in Kuala Lumpur in 1991 that I placed a priority on New Zealand's relations with ASEAN and I committed New Zealand to closer economic cooperation with the member states of ASEAN.

"That priority remains, and we have delivered on the promise.

"Our institutional and people-to-people links have broadened immeasurably in that time and been cemented through the business, educational and media programmes of the Asia 2000 Foundation."

Mr McKinnon said it is salutary to remember that only eight years ago the ASEAN free Trade Area (AFTA) did not even exist.

"Now APEC and the AFTA are both crucial vehicles for maintaining and expanding an open trading environment and our economic relationships have deepened in all manner of ways."

This is the ninth year Mr McKinnon has attended the meeting.

"What I have witnessed is the maturing of ASEAN as an institution, and the maturing of New Zealand's relationship with ASEAN to the advantage of both sides.

"We have set a solid basis for the future relationship as we move to the next millenium. I have been privileged to be part of this process."
