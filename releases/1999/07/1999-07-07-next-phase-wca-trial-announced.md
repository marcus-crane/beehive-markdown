The next phase for the new work capacity assessment process was announced today by Mr Sowry, the Minster of Social Services, Work and Income.

?The Government is keen to show people with a disability and disability support groups how the new work capacity assessments and employment assistance will work? said Mr Sowry.

?The assessment focuses on people's abilities, and what type of assistance we can offer to help them achieve their employment goals."

Participation in the demonstration will be voluntary and does not affect benefit eligibility.

Assessments will be done by suitably qualified professionals, like occupational therapists. It will give both the customers, and Work and Income New Zealand case managers, good information about what they can do and what support they may eligible for.

The demonstration phase is due to run from March 2000 to February 2001 in 10-15 WINZ sites. The trial sites have yet to be selected and will be chosen on the basis of operational and evaluation criteria.

Work capacity assessment trials are part of the Government's welfare and employment strategy, which aims to focus on what people with disabilities CAN do, rather than concentrating on what they can't do.

The Work Capacity Assessment is being trialed in 3 stages. The first stage trialed the process of obtaining assessments, the second will demonstrate use of the assessment, and the third stage will evaluate the impact of the assessment.
