Associate Finance Minister Lockwood Smith departs New Zealand today to attend the Forum Economic Ministers' Meeting in Apia, Samoa.

"This is an important meeting for New Zealand, Australia and the smaller economies of the Pacific Region," Dr Smith said.

"Economic development in the Forum nations is particularly important to New Zealand. These countries are our closest neighbours, and their economic well-being is of interest to our exporters, and all New Zealanders.

"The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting is an opportunity to share experiences with economic reform and to assist each other with economic reform. The impact of the Asian economic crisis on Pacific nations will bring a sharp focus to the talks," said Dr Smith.

Dr Smith will also be holding bilaterals with other Finance Ministers who will be attending this meeting.

He returns to New Zealand on Saturday 3 July 1999.
