Education Minister Nick Smith today announced he has approved Mt Albert Grammar School's application for a change in status from a single sex boys school to a co-educational school. The school will be able to enrol girls from the beginning of next year.

"This is a big step for Mt Albert Grammar. They have been a boys-only school for 77 years. I commend the school for being willing to break with tradition and look to how it can best meet the needs of its community."

The decision follows a widespread consultation process among parents and the community. The school has already received 89 applications from girls wishing to enrol in form three. Over the next few years, enrolments will be allowed into other levels of the school. The school roll, which is currently 1250, is projected to rise to 1700 during the next decade.

"It is a real tribute to the Board, Principal Greg Taylor, and the school that they have received so much support from the community for their decision, and interest from potential students. This move gives parents and students a real choice of schools and between single sex and co-education options."

"Roll growth in Auckland has given us some real challenges. The willingness of schools to be more flexible and provide more options is key to continuing the ongoing improvement in learning for the students of Auckland."
