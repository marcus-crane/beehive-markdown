Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has warmly welcomed reports that Kiwifruit New Zealand and the California Kiwifruit Commission have reached an agreement which will see the longstanding US anti-dumping order against New Zealand kiwifruit lifted.

The anti-dumping order has prevented Kiwifruit NZ from participating competitively in the US market for the past eight years by preventing the sale of the fruit in the US at less than domestic product prices. Dr Smith, who is currently leading a delegation of New Zealand exporters in Santiago, Chile, said that the agreement demonstrated what could be achieved when industries work together to resolve trade differences in a constructive way.

"I'm delighted that Kiwifruit New Zealand will now have full access to the US market, and I'm confident that as well as taking advantage of the new opportunities, Kiwifruit New Zealand will also help build a stronger market for kiwifruit within the US," Dr Smith said.

"It's also encouraging that Kiwifruit New Zealand and its counterpart in the US, the Californian Kiwifruit Commission, have chosen to join forces in an innovative joint marketing programme to promote kiwifruit generically within the US market.

"This sort of cooperation between industries is progressive, and will produce a win/win for the US and New Zealand industries.

"There is huge potential to expand the kiwifruit market in the US, and combining the resources and marketing expertise of the New Zealand and US kiwifruit industries will ensure they are well placed to develop that potential.

"I am confident that the cooperative relationship developed between the two organisations will stand both in good stead in the coming years. I wish Kiwifruit New Zealand every success in taking advantage of the enhanced market opportunites now opening to them in the US", Dr Smith concluded.
