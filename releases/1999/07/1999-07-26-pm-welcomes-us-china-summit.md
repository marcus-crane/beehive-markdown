Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed news that the Chinese and the United States Presidents will take the opportunity of their visits to New Zealand in September, to hold a bilateral summit.

"It is pleasing that the United States and China have taken the opportunity of their New Zealand visits for a meaningful discussion between the two of them.

"New Zealand is the perfect setting for such a meeting, given our great friendship with both countries, and because we can offer a relaxed environment and a neutral location, which should encourage a free and frank exchange of views between the two countries.

"In my meeting with Chinese President Jiang last week, I reiterated our offer to facilitate a meeting and it is gratifying that his Foreign Minister and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have now announced that a meeting will be held.

"The US and China are both very important to New Zealand and we will do everything we can to facilitate dialogue between the two. A positive relationship between China and the United States is good for New Zealand and the other countries in the Asia-Pacific region," Mrs Shipley said.
