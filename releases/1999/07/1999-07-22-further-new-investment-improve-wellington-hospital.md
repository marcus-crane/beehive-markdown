The Minister of Health today announced much needed extra investment of $5.5 million to upgrade the orthopaedic facilities and facilities for the elderly at Wellington Hospital.

"The Government has approved new investment of $2.8 million to relocate and upgrade the adult orthopaedic ward at Wellington Hospital.

"An extra $2.7 million is also to be invested in the elderly inpatient and outpatient Assessment, Treatment and Rehabilitation services. We have had to weigh up approval for the extra investment against plans for a new hospital for Wellington.

"The new orthopaedic ward will contain 34 beds, an increase from the 27 beds in the current ward. The current facility is not acceptable. It falls short of expected patient safety standards and there is overcrowding.

"The decision has been made because the work is urgent. Patients and staff not only deserve much better conditions, they need them."

Features of the new orthopaedic facility to address patient safety issues include:

- a four bed Special Needs Area
- adequate space in ward cubicles
- patient meeting/support rooms
- extra patient showers and toilets

"The extra $2.7 million for elderly services will see the current Ward Two upgraded and a two storey extension to house a day hospital for the assessment and rehabilitation of the elderly.

"The current elderly services are delivered from two locations. There are problems with overcrowding and isolation from specialist services.

"Tenders will be called for both developments shortly. The new facilities are expected to be up and running by the middle of next year," Mr Creech said.

The upgrades follow earlier approval for a new Emergency Department and fracture clinic at Wellington Hospital.

"Wellington Hospital has had safety issues that Capital Coast Health and the Government have been steadily addressing. Further announcements are imminent."
