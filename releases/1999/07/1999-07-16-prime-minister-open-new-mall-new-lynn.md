"The newly refurbished LynnMall shopping centre in New Lynn is a tremendous social and economic development for the people of West Auckland," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley is due to open the new shopping mall at 6pm tonight, amid a shower of fireworks.

"LynnMall has provided a focus for the local community. Ask any cabbie where the heart of West Auckland is, and she or he will tell you it's LynnMall."

Mrs Shipley said the development of the mall reflected the powerful sense of community in West Auckland.

The Prime Minister also congratulated the owners of LynnMall - AMP Ltd - for their commitment to investing in New Zealand.

"The renovations and refurbishments alone have boosted the local economy by almost $62 million, and the 110 shops in the mall will provide work for 600 people, most of them locals.

"I understand AMP is planning to build another significant centre in East Auckland that will inject $180 million into the local economy there. That's a real vote of confidence in the region and I welcome AMP's investment in our country.

"Our growing economy and consumer confidence is encouraging for us all and represents a promising future," Mrs Shipley said.
