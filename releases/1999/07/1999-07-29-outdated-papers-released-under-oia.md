Minister for Tertiary Education, Max Bradford, today released outdated discussion papers to the Labour party's research unit on ownership options for tertiary institutions.

They were released after a request was made under the Official Information Act.

The papers discussed issues and options that were investigated more than three years ago.

Mr Bradford said the media should not be fooled by the Labour Party into regarding the papers as proof of an underlying agenda of privatisation in tertiary education.

"As is normal practice, the Ministry of Education looked at the full range of options when asked to look at ways of improving the performance of tertiary education institutions.

"At the time these papers were prepared, some tertiary institutions were contemplating proposing alternative ownership arrangements to the Government.

"The option of divestment was looked at by officials, but the officials were told by Cabinet to look into ways of improving tertiary institution performance within Crown "ownership".

"The Government has no privatisation agenda," Mr Bradford said.
