"Comments made by Invercargill Mongrel Mob member, Shaun Te Kahu, last night on TV One's '60 Minutes' were repugnant and totally unacceptable to New Zealanders", Police Minister, Clem Simich, said today.

"The Police have been closely involved in the Lawton family's case from day one", said Mr Simich.

"They have advised me that they will continue their close interest in the case and prosecute whenever they consider there is sufficient evidence to bring a case.

"I have been assured that the Police are investigating the veiled threats made last night and will consider if any offence has been committed.

"I have also asked that the Police advise me on what actions they have taken to ensure the safety of the Lawton family.

"All law abiding New Zealanders would want to express their support for the Lawton family.

"I trust the Lawtons take some comfort from Mr Te Kahu's statement to the Southland Times this morning that his comments to 60 Minutes were 'made in the heat of the moment' and that 'the mob would not take revenge against the family'.

"I also welcome The New Zealand Herald's initiative to raise funds for the Lawton family.

"The Government, through its compensation scheme for witnesses, has already approved $30,000 to the Lawtons, the maximum available", Mr Simich concluded.
