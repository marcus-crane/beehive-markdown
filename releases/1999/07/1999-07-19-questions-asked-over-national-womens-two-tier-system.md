The Minister of Health has sought advice from the Ministry of Health and Health Funding Authority over the proposal by National Women's Hospital to charge women for extra post-natal services.

"The decision is one made by National Women's Hospital, without reference to me.

"Free quality maternity care for women is a given under the National Government," Mr Creech said. "Women should expect the same high level of clinical care regardless of where in the public health system they receive it.

"National Women's Hospital is a public hospital and receives substantial taxpayer funding to provide a good quality service to women.

"I have asked health officials to advise me about National Women's plans, including whether there would be any impact on the provision of free quality clinical care," Mr Creech said.
