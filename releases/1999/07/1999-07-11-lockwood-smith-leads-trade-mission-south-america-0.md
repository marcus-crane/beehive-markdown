Trade Minister Lockwood Smith departs New Zealand on Monday 11 July 1999 to lead a trade mission of 23 New Zealand business organisations to South America.

The visit, organised by the New Zealand Trade Development Board (TradeNZ) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, involves two days in Argentina, three days in Brazil, four days in Peru, and two days in Chile.

"I'm delighted to be involved in this mission which will provide New Zealand exporters with unique opportunities to establish new commercial links with important trading partners," Dr Smith said.

"The programme involves visits to economies that have undergone liberalisation and modernisation over the past few years and show a positive trend for growth in trade and investment for New Zealand.

"The wide variety of opportunities in these countries is reflected by the broad range of representation within the New Zealand delegation which includes five representatives from education service providers, as well as financial and air service providers, engineering companies, manufacturers and a fisheries company.

"It's encouraging that the New Zealand delegation is made up of companies that are basically new exporters to the region. The delegation will take part in a programme of group or individual appointments facilitated by TradeNZ and take part in representative functions to increase the profile of New Zealand across the region.

"The visit also provides an opportunity to meet Cairns Group, APEC and Trade Ministerial colleagues, advance a range of current trade policy objectives, and develop new business opportunities," Dr Smith concluded.

Dr Smith will also take part in hiki tapu ceremonies led by four Te Arawa elders to open new offices for the New Zealand Embassy and TradeNZ Office in Santiago, Chile and the new Consulate General in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Dr Smith returns to New Zealand on Saturday, 24 July 1999.
