Jim Anderton has found a way to let any Labour-Alliance government get around Dr Cullen's tax pledges: wealth taxes. In other words, taxes on getting ahead.

Labour-Alliance are promising the world. The taxometre is heading of the scale! More for pensioners, more for students, more for unions, more for beneficiaries, and buying back ACC!

How much do you own? Labour-Alliance wants to know.

Asset taxes, or capital gains taxes will penalise middle New Zealand families who have saved and put money aside. If you?ve bought your own home, a new car or some shares then Dr Cullen and Mr Anderton want to know. And they?ll have their cut, thank you.

This latest bumble by Jim Anderton shows Dr Cullen's pledges to be worthless. Dr Cullen tells business audiences nothing will change. Mr Anderton and the rest of Labour-Alliance tell social audiences everything will change.
