APEC members need to work harder at building broader support for APEC within their communities, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon said today.

Speaking at the Makati Business Club in the Philippines, Mr McKinnon challenged the members of the Philippine business community to join New Zealand in finding new ways to promote APEC within the Philippines and across the region.

"Broadening support for APEC is critical if we are to ensure its continuing effectiveness," Mr McKinnon said.

"The benefit of APEC to society is immense, he said, but some critics remain unconvinced and other people feel excluded from the process. It is incumbent upon us, as community and business leaders , to ensure that our constituencies identify the link between APEC and positive economic developments."

Mr McKinnon said that member economies had agreed to take individual action to open their markets and the Philippines, for example, had made significant progress reducing the average tariff from around 30% in the late 1980s to about 10%.

In September Minsters would be looking at other ways to broaden APEC's work to eliminate red tape, make trading easier and strengthen the functioning of market.

"Gains from initiatives such as speeding up customs processes are considerable and may outweigh the gains from opening markets by a factor of two to one.

"And while opening markets and keeping them open is an essential factor in promoting sustainable growth, no less significant is ensuring that the markets function effectively."

While in Manila Mr McKinnon will call on President Estrada, Foreign Minister Siazon and senior officals.

On Saturday 17th July he departs Manila, scheduled to arrive in Viet Nam on Sunday 18th .
