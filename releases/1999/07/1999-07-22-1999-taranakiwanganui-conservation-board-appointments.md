Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced appointments to the Taranaki/Wanganui Conservation Board with effect from 1 September 1999.

"Conservation boards have a unique role to play within the public conservation sector. They are independent bodies providing for important interaction between the community and the Department of Conservation on local conservation issues."

"I am very pleased to be appointing people who I believe will make a positive contribution to the Taranaki/Wanganui Conservation Board's work. These people bring a diversity of new skills which will both complement those already represented on the board, and have relevance to the issues the board will face in the immediate future."

"The contributions of outgoing members are appreciated and will be missed. However, changes in board membership are essential in ensuring others get a chance to have some input into the decision-making process on local conservation issues. The new board has a healthy mix of new blood as well as continuity from experienced members."

1999 Appointments:  
Keith Chapple of Taumarunui, conservationist, has over twenty years experience in all aspects of conservation work at local, regional and national level. He is currently the President of the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society and a member of the Kaimanawa Wild Horse Advisory Group. He will bring a wealth of conservation experience to the board.

Peter Horsley of Palmerston North, university lecturer, is a current member of the Taranaki/Wanganui Conservation Board and has been re-appointed for a further term. He has special expertise in environmental law and resource planning.

Maia Waitai of Palmerston North, Maori literacy co-ordinator, has previous local government experience with her work assisting the Palmerston North City Council and has a good background on issues relating to land management. She will provide a valuable linkage with Rangitane (significant Iwi in the Manawatu area) that is not currently represented on the Board.

David Digby of Stratford, maintenance officer, has a keen interest in  
conservation and the outdoors. He is an experienced tramper and will bring good
