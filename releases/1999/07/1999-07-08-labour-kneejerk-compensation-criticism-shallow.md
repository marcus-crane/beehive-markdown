"Labour's criticism of the compensation issue following the inquiry into treatment of neonates at National Women's Hospital reveals just how kneejerk their health policy has become," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"I have made it very clear that the families are entitled to compensation through ACC.

"But I have also pointed out that responsible Governments would not start another special compensation scheme or fund to pay out whenever there was a public case, issue or concern.

"The National led Government wants a compensation scheme that is fair to everyone.

"In this case the Government's has not even had a request from the families for special compensation. The Ministry of Health advice is against special compensation for high profile public cases.

"Labour's Health spokesperson jumps on every passing bandwagon. What would she do if she was Minister of Health? Would she change Accident Compensation Regulations every time to suit a particular case or situation?

"Would Labour have an open wallet to pay out people? The costs could be horrendous, and who would foot the bill?.

"Kneejerk reactions are becoming more and more Labour's trademark in the health sector. There is no rhyme nor reason to their approach to health."
