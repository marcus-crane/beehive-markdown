Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith presented a cheque for $100,000 to the Regional Conservator for the Department of Conservation in Taupo last night.

The money, allocated through the Tourism Facilities Grant programme, will be used to fund the development of new visitor facilities at Huka Falls, which will include an information kiosk.

Dr Smith said that as New Zealand's busiest natural attraction, it was important that the Huka Falls provided modern, well presented facilities.

"The Huka Falls are visited by over 700,000 people every year, and the Tourism Facilities Grant recognises their importance amongst a variety of attractions in the Taupo district which are of both regional and national importance," Dr Smith said.

The Huka Falls are part of the Wairakei Tourist Park, known for its geothermal activity including the unique steam clouds, the world famous geothermal power station and the so-called 'Craters of the Moon'.

Dr Smith's visit to the Wairakei Tourist Park is part of a broader programme of visits to regional centres in his capacity as new Tourism Minister. Dr Smith will also call on the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute in Rotorua.
