Labour Leader Helen Clark has publicly distanced herself from Aoraki MP Jim Sutton following his abysmal performance on the Holmes Show last week, say Associate Food Fibre Minister David Carter.

On Friday Helen Clark publicly said she did not support her frontbencher's call for President Clinton to stay away from APEC in Auckland. "What a slap in the face for such a senior MP."

"In my five years in Parliament I have never seen such a swift and so-public humiliation of a frontbencher. Mr Sutton must be very embarrassed his eagerness to catch a headline has so backfired.

"Mr Sutton's place on the frontbench must be at risk in next month's reshuffle planned by Helen Clark" said Mr Carter.
