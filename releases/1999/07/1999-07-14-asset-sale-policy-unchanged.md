Treasurer Bill English said today the Government's position on the sale of assets had not changed.

"I have made no statements signalling any change to the Government's position. As stated in the Budget the Government's policy is to examine government businesses case by case, and sell where that is in the public interest.

"What I have said is that the public floats of assets have shown there is an apetite from the public to invest in these companies," said Mr English.
