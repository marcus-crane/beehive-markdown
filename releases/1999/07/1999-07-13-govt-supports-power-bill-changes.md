The Government had considered proposed changes to the Commerce (Controlled Goods or Services) Amendment Bill and would support the changes as reported back to Parliament, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

Mr Bradford said he had fully examined the text of the Bill and believed it was consistent with the desires of the Government.

"The confusion was created by some of the explanatory notes attached to the reported back Bill. But on full examination of the text of the Bill I believe it is consistent with what the Government wants and the Government will be supporting it."

Mr Bradford said the Government supported the Committee's firm conclusion that it did not favour price control on retailing or generation.

"The Government supports effective measures to combat anti-competitive practices in any part of the industry.

"It agrees to the proposed changes in Section 170A of the Electricity Act which clarify and confirm existing regulatory powers to control anti-competitive practices in retail and the amendment to the Commerce Act to allow control of customer switching charges by lines companies to retailers," Mr Bradford said.
