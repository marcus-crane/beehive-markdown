Consumer Affairs Minister Peter McCardle said today that he is pleased with the Disputes Tribunal's decision on phone cards, and is urging Telecom to re-think its stance on the issue.

"I am strongly opposed to Telecom's refusal to reimburse people who bought phone cards, and who had assumed there was no time limit on their use. Earlier this year my attempt to persuade Telecom to reimburse holders of unused cards came to nothing, but it is not too late for the company to change its mind."

The Disputes Tribunal decision does not set a legal precedent, and is separate from a case before the High Court which has yet to be heard.

Mr McCardle said, "I am still prepared to talk further with Telecom on the issue, and believe the company should change its position."
