Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today that a delegation of New Zealand Parliamentarians would go to East Timor next month to observe the UN-sponsored ballot on East Timor's future.

The delegation comprises Phil Goff (Labour), Matt Robson (Alliance), Ken Shirley (ACT) and Rana Waitai (Mauri Pacific) and will be led by Hon Roger Maxwell (National).

"Their selection and representativeness reflects the very intense interest New Zealanders and Members of Parliament have had in the East Timor situation over the years" said Mr McKinnon.

"The delegation will be formally accredited by the Electoral Commission in East Timor. The team will be allowed to move around freely to observe preparations for the ballot and to be present at polling stations on the day of the ballot. It will report back on return to New Zealand and share its findings with the Electoral Commission in East Timor."

"Conditions on the ground will be tough as East Timor's resources are already stretched by the large UN presence and observers will have to be fairly self-reliant."

"Ongoing security problems has prompted the UN Secretary General to delay the start of registration but I am hopeful that conditions will improve sufficiently for the ballot to go ahead on 21 or 22 August."

"The visit by 15 Indonesian Ministers to East Timor this week for talks with UN and East Timorese leaders is a welcome signal of Indonesia's commitment to the ballot process. I sincerely hope that as a result of this we will not see a repeat of the deplorable attacks against UN staff and East Timorese in recent weeks and that the pro-autonomy militias will be brought firmly under control."
