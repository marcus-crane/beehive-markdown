The Lottery Grants Board has granted $250,000 to complete the carved artwork planned for the top of Gisborne's Mt Hikurangi and which will be unveiled at the end of the dawn ceremony on January 1, Internal Affairs Minister and Grants Board Chairperson Jack Elder announced today.

The seven-piece artwork, "Maui Whakairo", is being undertaken by Derek Lardelli and a team of students from Tairawhiti Polytechnic Art Faculty on behalf of Te Runanga O Ngati Porou.

"The artists have committed to a gruelling 15 hours per day, five days per week routine to complete the project in time," Mr Elder said.

The different pieces making up the work will be placed in a circle called \`Te Ana o Murirangawhenua' which is 17 metres in diameter and represents a compass using the compass-points names given by Mohi Turei of Ngati Porou.

Mr Elder said an additional $50,000 grant has gone to Te Runanga O Ngati Porou to help with the 45 metre carved waka which will also be an integral part of the dawn ceremony. The 20 tonne waka has been 10 years in the making and has been named "Te Aio o Nukutaimemeha" (the peaceful/tranquil Nukutamemeha) by Ngati Porou.
