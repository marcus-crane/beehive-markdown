Phil Goff's comments on the Children, Young Persons and their Families Agency show his complete lack of political backbone, said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

"Every time there's a high-profile crime anywhere in the country, Mr Goff calls for tougher penalties."

"But just last week he voted against the Government's Home Invasion Legislation to introduce longer sentences," Mr Sowry said.

"And in 1993 he voted against increasing sentences for rape, as well."

Mr Sowry said the Labour justice spokesperson has always followed the party line - Labour's soft on crime.

"Mr Goff is prone to baying for tougher penalties in the media, but when it comes to the crunch he has a history of voting for a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket."
