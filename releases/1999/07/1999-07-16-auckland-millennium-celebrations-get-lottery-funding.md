The Lottery Grants Board has given the Auckland City Council grants totalling $800,000 toward its Millennium celebrations, Internal Affairs Minister and Grants Board Chairperson Jack Elder announced today.

Auckland City has three major community events planned for the New Year's Eve/New Year's Day period, he said.  
The first of these, \`This Is It\`, a multi media extravaganza to be held in the Auckland Domain on New Year's Eve, attracted the largest grant of $500,000.

"This is possibly the largest free event ever staged in this country and will have an enormous cast with professional performers featuring alongside cultural and community groups," Mr Elder said. "About 300,000 people are expected to attend and thousands more will be able to see it on television because it is a major focus of TV3's Millennium broadcast ."(TV3 is the Government's official Millennium Host Broadcaster).

A $100,000 Lottery grant will also help fund the \`This Is It\` climax, a cacophony of fireworks, which will then spread out into the harbour and ultimately include the Sky Tower, Harbour Bridge and barges around Rangitoto, he said.  
The final key element of Auckland's millennium celebration, a dawn ceremony in the Okahu Domain, received a $200,000 Lottery grant.  
Ngati Whatua, representatives of Tangata Whenua and Pacific Island communities are helping organise the ceremony which will include a regatta, waka ceremony and a 2000 strong haka party from throughout Auckland, Mr Elder said.
