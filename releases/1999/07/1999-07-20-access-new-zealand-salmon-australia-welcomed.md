Acting Minister for International Trade, John Luxton today welcomed news that Australia is to allow imports of salmon from New Zealand and other suppliers.

The decision to allow imports was taken yesterday in Canberra by AQIS (the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service) on completion of a risk analysis process that was finalised in shorter time than originally planned because of a WTO ruling against Australia late last year.

"This is great news for New Zealand. We have waited a long time. New Zealand agriculture and trade officials have put in a lot of work on this issue. At last our industry has the access it has been seeking for over a decade. But it is now up to industry to take advantage of that access opportunity."

A particularly pleasing aspect of the decision was the recognition it accorded to New Zealand salmon's very good health status.

"I really welcome the decision. It takes the development of trans-Tasman trade a step further under CER."

Full details of the Import Risk Assessment and the decision are available on the AQIS website, www.aquis.gov.au.
