The establishment of a Consulate General in Sao Paulo is an important demonstration of New Zealand's commitment to building a stronger relationship with Brazil, according to Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

The Consulate General was opened with a Hiki Tapu performed by Kaumatua and Wharehuia of Te Arawa. The ceremony was attended by over 100 officials, business people and other invitees from Brazil, as well as New Zealanders living in the region.

"Brazil is the world's eighth largest economy. It is an important market for New Zealand exporters, and plays an important role within Mercosur, the regional free trade area which encompasses Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay," Dr Smith said.  
"New Zealand's relationship with Brazil is sound, but we're committed to developing even stronger links. We already have a formal dialogue with Mercosur through CER, and I'm exploring opportunities to further develop this dialogue between two significant regional trading blocs.

"New Zealand's relationship with Brazil is also benefiting from improved air services to South America, which is in turn encouraging the development of strong people-to-people links through increased trade, tourism, and investment.

"New Zealand's trade with Brazil has been increasing over recent years, and there are a number of New Zealand companies with significant investments in Brazil. In the year to December 1998, exports of New Zealand products were worth $134.7 million, up from $94 million for the same period in 1997.

"There are also opportunities to develop stronger relationships through providing education services to Brazil. The New Zealand delegation includes representatives from education providers, and they're registering strong interest in Brazil as an alternative to more traditional providers in the United States and Canada.  
"The introduction of a visa waiver for short-term visitors from Brazil is also likely to improve tourism and business contacts between our two countries over the coming years. We're currently working with Brazil to develop a reciprocal agreement for New Zealand visitors, and Brazil has extended the validity of its business visas to New Zealand citizens to a five year period.  
"New Zealand's bilateral relationship with Brazil has a strong foundation. But today's ceremony and the establishment of formal representation in Brazil demonstrates New Zealand's commitment to developing stronger, more meaningful relationships across the region, and signals an exciting new phase in our relationship with Brazil," Dr Smith concluded.
