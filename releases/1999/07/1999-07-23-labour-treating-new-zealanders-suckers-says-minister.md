ACC Minister Murray McCully has accused the Labour party of "treating New Zealanders like a bunch of suckers". He was referring to promises contained in Labour's ACC policy which both Helen Clark and Ruth Dyson will address at today's Loony Left Conference in Wellington.

"Labour is asking New Zealanders to believe that they can vastly expand ACC benefits without increasing the schemes cost. They are promising to reintroduce lump sums, which even Mr Anderton says would cost $400m. They will extend the scheme to include illness and mental injury, as well as nationalising the books of the private ACC insurers - all for the $2.35 average premium which employers paid last year.

"Leaving aside the fact that employers will this year pay $200 million less than that, Labour must think the public are stupid.

"Any delegate to today's Loony Left Conference who believes what Labour is telling them has no need to wonder about the source of the loud hum outside their conference hall. It will be coming from the wings of the squadron of pigs flying overhead".
