Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced appointments to the Otago Conservation Board with effect from 1 September 1999.

"Conservation boards have a unique role to play within the public conservation sector. They are independent bodies providing for important interaction between the community and the Department of Conservation on local conservation issues."

"I am very pleased to be appointing people who I believe will make a positive contribution to the Otago Conservation Board's work. These people bring a diversity of new skills which will both complement those already represented on the board, and have relevance to the issues the board will face in the immediate future."

"The contributions of outgoing members are appreciated and will be missed. However, changes in board membership are essential in ensuring others get a chance to have some input into the decision-making process on local conservation issues. The new board has a healthy mix of new blood as well as continuity from experienced members."
