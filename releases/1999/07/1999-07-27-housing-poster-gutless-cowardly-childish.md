"A poster (copy attached) supporting evicted state housing tenant, Len Parker, is gutless, cowardly, and childish", Housing New Zealand Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"The poster gives an Auckland address which it purports to be that of Housing New Zealand spokesperson, Ms Margrit de Man", Mr Ryall said.

"The address given is not that of Ms de Man, but one wonders what the author of the poster is attempting to achieve by publishing someone's home address at all.

"It seems to be a veiled threat, akin to that made by the Invercargill Mongrel Mob earlier this week.

"This kind of personal attack on a neutral public servant simply doing their job, is totally repugnant.
