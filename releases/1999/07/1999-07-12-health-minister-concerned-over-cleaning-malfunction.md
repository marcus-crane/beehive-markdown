Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, has told the inaugural Waikato Police Conference on Maori Development that National's plan to invite the Police to consider joint patrols with probation and CYPS officers would help reduce youth offending.

The proposal is part of a new youth justice plan being developed by National, and announced by Tony Ryall at the National Party Annual Conference in Wellington last weekend.

"On the weekend I outlined a new plan National is working on to save a generation of young people from a life of crime", said Mr Ryall.

"It is plan about the positive ways we can help young people and their families to break the cycle of crime.

"Our plan is not only about taking tough actions, it is also about the need for young people to learn respect, discipline and responsibility.

"As we have developed the plan it has become increasingly apparent that cooperation and coordination between agencies is essential to successfully save repeat young offenders from a life of crime.

"We ?ve seen real benefits in the justice team of ministers working across portfolio boundaries.

"It seriously concerns me that hundreds of people in the Canterbury region are faced with blood screening tests because of a cleaning malfunction with Canterbury Health's endoscopy machine.

"The public expects people working in hospitals to take the care needed to ensure quality and standards in services provided," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said tonight.

"While my health officials advise me that this step is precautionary and the risks of anyone being infected are, in this case, very very low, such failures are concerning and unsettling.

"I have spoken this afternoon to the Acting Chair of Canterbury Health and expressed my concern. I have asked Canterbury Health to ensure there is a proper internal inquiry into the matter.

"The Ministry of Health's Chief Medical Advisor is also working closely with Canterbury Health on this issue to ensure people get the care, reassurance and any counselling they require.

"An international expert brought in by the Ministry to advise on the situation says the increased risk of infection is minimal.

"In addition the Ministry of Health is reminding all hospitals to check the quality control processes involved in disinfection of endoscopes.

"The Ministry has advised me that it is confident that appropriate standards for cleaning of endoscopes were in place in New Zealand hospitals, and that they were generally well-observed."

The Ministry of Health is contacting all endoscopy units to reinforce the need for good quality control and auditing. This follows a letter written late last year to the Gastroenterology Society about appropriate standards to control the risk of transmission of disease through endoscopes.
