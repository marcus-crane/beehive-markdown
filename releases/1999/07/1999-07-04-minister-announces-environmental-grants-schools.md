Hon Marie Hasler, Associate Minister for the Environment, today announced environmental grants to 15 schools, totalling $20,222.

"These New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund grants are sponsored by ACI Glass Packaging New Zealand to encourage studies which give young people an understanding of the importance and fragility of the environment," Ms Hasler said.

"Equipping young people with the skills and knowledge to develop a clean and healthy environment is vital in today's world and for our future survival.

"ACI is committed to encouraging young people to value and relate to their environment and I commend them for this. I hope ACI, as well as other businesses, will continue to support quality projects such as these."

Ms Hasler said the New Zealand Glass Environmental Fund was established in 1983, and through its national committee each year's funding recipients are decided. Of the 15 successful applicants this year, five are from the South Island and 10 from the North Island.
