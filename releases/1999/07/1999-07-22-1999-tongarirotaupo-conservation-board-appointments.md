Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced appointments to the Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Board with effect from 1 September 1999.

"Conservation boards have a unique role to play within the public conservation sector. They are independent bodies providing for important interaction between the community and the Department of Conservation on local conservation issues."

"I am very pleased to be appointing people who I believe will make a positive contribution to the Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Board's work. These people bring a diversity of new skills which will both complement those already represented on the board, and have relevance to the issues the board will face in the immediate future."

"The contributions of outgoing members are appreciated and will be missed. However, changes in board membership are essential in ensuring others get a chance to have some input into the decision-making process on local conservation issues. The new board has a healthy mix of new blood as well as continuity from experienced members."

1999 Appointments:  
Laurie Burdett is a strengthening families co-ordinator and comes from Taupo. She has a broad range of community interests and brings to the board strategic and business planning skills and a keen interest in local conservation issues.

Murray McKee is a management consultant and lives in Wellington. He knows the Tongariro/Taupo area well, particularly as a recreationist and will bring this knowledge, as well as his strategic thinking, business and analytical skills to the board.

John Nankervis is a Wellington based solicitor and has been re-appointed to the board for a further term. He brings to the board a good balance of business and legal knowledge together with tourism and recreation interests.
