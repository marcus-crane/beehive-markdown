Education Minister Nick Smith today announced the purchase of three new secondary school sites in Epsom, Albany and Howick and major investment in the development of existing secondary schools to accommodate projected increases in rolls of 25,000 over the next decade.

"Auckland's secondary school rolls are growing rapidly due to both domestic and international migration and the echo of the baby boom moving into secondary school. Current rolls of 78,000 are projected to increase to 103,000 by 2011. This poses a major challenge for the Ministry of Education and for schools in managing this growth".

The Ministry of Education's strategy for managing roll growth incorporates using spare capacity, expanding existing schools where appropriate and building new schools. The school support project is designed to get alongside schools with under utilised capacity to improve the quality of their education in line with parental expectations.

$32 million has been allocated for expansion of accommodation in secondary schools in Auckland. The Ministry of Education is currently negotiating with Epsom Girls' Grammar, Mt Roskill Grammar, Lynfield and Auckland Girls' Grammar.

$20 million has been provided for the following new site purchases. The Alexandra Park site is just over 3 hectares with access to playing fields. It is situated on the corner of Campbell Crescent and Puriri Drive. The Albany site is 8 hectares and is on the corner of Appleby Road and Albany Highway. The Howick site is also 8 hectares and is situated on East Tamaki Road near Te Rakau Drive.

The actual opening date of these three new secondary schools is currently projected to be 2006. However, with the procurement of these sites, these opening dates can be brought forward as required and if necessary, schools could be operating within two years of a decision to proceed.

"Managing roll growth pressures is never easy as the areas in which we require new schools are also the areas in which there is the least available land. These purchases and commitments will give Auckland parents the confidence that there will be good schools available for their sons and daughters".
