Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today that he was distressed to hear of the murder of Western Samoa's Minister of Public Works, Luagalau Levaula Kamu.

"The death means that New Zealand has lost a great friend. The death, in such tragic circumstances, is a matter of great loss to Samoa.

"Leva had a wide network of friends in New Zealand and most recently escorted the Governor General throughout the period of his recent visit to Samoa.

"New Zealand conveys its deepest sympathy to the Samoan government and the family for this sudden loss."
