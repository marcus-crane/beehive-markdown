Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will greet National MPs John Carter and Eric Roy in Wellington's Civic Square at 3.30pm today at the completion of National's tour of rural New Zealand.

Since Friday 25 June, Mr Carter has been visiting rural centres around the North Island and Mr Roy has been visiting centres in the South Island. The MPs have been listening to the concerns of rural people and they will report back to Mrs Shipley and other senior ministers outside the Wellington Town Hall today.

The two MPs will use two large maps in the Civic Square to show the Prime Minister the areas they covered during their tour.

All media are welcome to cover the event. A site map of Civic Square is attached.
