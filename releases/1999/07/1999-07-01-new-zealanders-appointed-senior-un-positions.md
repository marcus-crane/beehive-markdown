New Zealanders Dame Ann Hercus and Dennis McNamara have been appointed to positions of international leadership in two of the world's political hotspots, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Dame Ann Hercus has been appointed as the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cyprus, and Dennis McNamara was appointed last week as one of the Secretary-General's four Deputy Special Representatives in Kosovo.

"These important appointments are a testament to the abilities of these two outstanding New Zealanders," Mrs Shipley said.

"Dame Ann has been with the UN in Cyprus for only one year and her swift promotion to chief adviser reflects her qualities and skills as a leader," Mrs Shipley said.

Dame Ann replaces former Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, who resigned in April this year.

"Dennis McNamara has the challenging role of looking after the return of refugees and humanitarian assistance in Kosovo. We are delighted that the UN has recognised Mr McNamara's ability to take on this tough assignment," Mrs Shipley said.

Mr McNamara was formerly the Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to the Former Yugoslavia. Prior to this, he was Director of International Protection in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

"These appointments are a source of pride for all New Zealanders, and our encouragement and best wishes go to Dame Ann Hercus and Dennis McNamara in their challenging new assignments," Mrs Shipley said.
