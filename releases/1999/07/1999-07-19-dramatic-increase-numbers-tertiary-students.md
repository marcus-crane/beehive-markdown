The number of people studying tertiary education had increased dramatically over the past decade, Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford said today.

Mr Bradford was referring to a figures of the total number of Equivalent Full Time Students (EFTS) in tertiary study between 1984 and 1998. The table also included unfunded students and research students.

"Since 1984 the total number of EFTS has increased by over 150 per cent," Mr Bradford said.

"This growth is due to the increased participation in tertiary education, an increasing number of students choosing to study full time rather than part time and increasing lengths of courses.

"These figures go a long way to dispel concerns that fees and the student loan scheme is scaring off students.

"The loan scheme was in fact established to ensure that anyone who wants to can study tertiary education.

"Under this scheme more students than ever before have been able to participate in tertiary education and training, especially women, Maori, Pacific Islanders and people with low incomes. For example; Maori and Pacific Island backgrounds have showed large increases - between 1994 and 1998 the total growth rates were 24% and 30% respectively.
