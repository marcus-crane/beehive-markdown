Associate Minister for the Environment, Hon Marie Hasler, presented the Dunedin-based company, Palmers Quarries, with the environmental 1999 Green Ribbon Award in the North East Valley, in Dunedin today.

"These national Green Ribbon Awards recognise the contributions and achievements made by groups and individuals towards a healthy and sustainable environment," Ms Hasler said when presenting the award to Palmers Quarries Managing Director, Mr Jim Hunter.

"Palmers Quarries have turned an old quarry site into a wonderful garden with more than 20,000 trees and shrubs and this, as we can all see, is a wonderful achievement and highly commendable.

"Since 1989 Palmer's aim has been to landscape the quarry in order to visually diffuse the effect of the quarry face as seen from the surrounding residential areas.

"Some 200 cubic metres of soil and 500 tonnes of a soil-compost mix has been poured into planting beds constructed on the old quarry benches.

"The walkways, roads and park areas are well supported by the local community and over the past two years a sound shell has been established for large outdoor concerts.

"The conversion of this site from a derelict quarry to an attractive garden is an ongoing commitment for the company and I would like to congratulate all those involved."

Ms Hasler said Palmer & Son were nominated by the Institute of Quarrying for their effort and commitment to restoring the quarry into a garden and their work sets a standard which other companies could strive to follow.

Appropriately all this year's winners are playing a major role in promoting environmental education.

Palmer & Son Limited have been quarrying proprietors in Dunedin since 1880. During this time the company has operated quarries at North East Valley and Logan Point. The North East Valley quarry ceased operations in 1980 after operating for nearly 100 years.

The Institute of Quarrying accepts that the end result of quarrying can be an eyesore and that more could and should be done to remedy the problem. The Institute believes that the work of Palmer & Son Limited is an excellent example and standard for the industry to follow in the future.

Palmer's aim in 1989 was to landscape the quarry in order to visually diffuse the effect of the quarry face as seen from the surrounding residential areas.

Over the past 10 years, more than 20,000 shrubs and trees have transformed the site into an asset that benefits the entire community. The walkways, roads and park areas are well supported by the local community and over the past two years a sound shell has been established for large outdoor concerts.

The project was awarded the New Zealand Quarry Industry's 1993 Nissan Award for Environmental Excellence and the Otago Regional Council (1997) Otago Environmental Award.

Palmer & Son Ltd is still owned by members of the founding Palmer family, with fifth generation family members involved in the running of the company today.
