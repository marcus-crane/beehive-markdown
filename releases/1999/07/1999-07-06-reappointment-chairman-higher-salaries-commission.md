These included the Central Hawkes Bay Electric Power Board and the Trust House Board. Mr Peacock has been a trustee of the Global Retirement Trust and Chair of the Central Regional Health Authority.

He has also served as Deputy Government Actuary and Chief Executive of Government Life throughout its transformation into the Tower Corporation.
