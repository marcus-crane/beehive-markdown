Food and Fibre Minister said today that it had been a momentous week for the kiwifruit industry with two significant milestones achieved.

"The introduction of the Kiwifruit restructuring Bill into the House followed by the news that after 8 years New Zealand kiwifruit growers will again have access to the lucrative US market, is excellent news for kiwifruit growers."

"The new legislation enables the kiwifruit industry to reposition itself so that it can respond positively to the challenges of the international market. The Bill clearly defines ownership rights for growers and reinforces Zespri's commercial focus of generating shareholder wealth."

"I believe the kiwifruit industry will be well served by the new structures and regulatory measures. The Bill provides more opportunities for the industry to innovate and respond to market opportunities, and conditions, and provides the incentives for the industry to become even more efficient."

"On top of the news that Kiwifruit New Zealand will again have access to the US market as a result of the lifting of the long standing US anti-dumping order, the industry has also joined forces with its Californian counterpart in an innovative marketing programme in the US."

"The US market is the biggest in the world and New Zealand has a very good product to offer US consumers. It is obvious that a lot of hard work has gone on behind the scenes and these efforts are now bearing fruit."

"The future looks very exciting for New Zealand kiwifruit growers. The industry should be congratulated for these initiatives. Kiwifruit New Zealand's constructive working relationship with the Government has paid dividends for the kiwifruit industry. So too has their perseverance in the international arena. It demonstrates how much progress can be achieved when the parties work together on a common goal," Mr Luxton concluded.
