Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage and longtime Francophile, will propose a toast to France at a "petit dejeuner" being held to celebrate Bastille Day on Wednesday 14 July.

Over 80 people, including the French Ambassador, His Excellency Jacky Musnier, are expected to attend the special breakfast being held at the suggestion of Ms Hasler in the Grand Hall, Parliament Buildings.

"This is the first time we've held this celebratory occasion at Parliament and I am delighted to host this event organised by cultural group Alliance Francaise here in Wellington," Ms Hasler said.

"I have been entranced with France from an early age when my parents took me there on a visit. This initial contact was strengthened during my school years when I was taught by an order of French nuns at Baradene College in Auckland.

"French culture has had a major impact on many New Zealander's lives, including my own, particularly its food, fashion and films.

"Bastille Day is an important day for the French and this breakfast will be a wonderful opportunity for people to gather together in celebration of their national day."
