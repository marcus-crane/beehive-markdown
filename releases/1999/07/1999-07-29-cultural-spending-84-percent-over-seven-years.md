Funding through Vote Cultural Affairs has increased 84 percent over the past seven years and reflects the National Government's commitment to the cultural sector, Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage said today.

"Expenditure has increased from $18.864 million to $34.752 million (GST exclusive) between 1992/93 and 1998/99," Ms Hasler told Members of Parliament.

"In addition, a further $266 million has been spent on capital funding for our national museum Te Papa, the Auckland War Memorial Museum and the Otago Museum."

"Government's commitment to the sector is recognised further by its establishment of the new Ministry for Culture and Heritage from 1 September this year.

"This new Ministry will strengthen our approach to policy development and create a strong platform for Government's further thinking about how it can most effectively protect our cultural and heritage history and support these activities now and in the future.

"Once the new Ministry is established I will be in a position to see what additional resources will be required. My expectation is that new money can be obtained in future budget rounds.

"The extent of the resources to be transferred to the new Ministry from other departments is still under consideration."
