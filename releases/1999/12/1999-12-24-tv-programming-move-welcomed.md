The Minister of Broadcasting, Marian Hobbs, today welcomed TV ONE's plan to run more drama and documentary programmes on weeknights.

"I hope it is a sign of better things to come," she said. "I believe there is a demand for drama and documentaries, particularly homegrown ones."

TV ONE says they will accommodate the programmes by running fewer advertisements in the 9.30pm to 10.30pm hour.

Ms Hobbs says she hopes TV ONE will promote its programming move and run with the experiment long enough to establish a loyal audience.
