The Minister of Transport, Hon. Mark Gosche, has received an assurance from the Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA) that measures are being taken to cope with increased demand for driver licensing services, including driver licence upgrades and driver testing.

The Minister met with the Director of Land Transport Safety, Reg Barrett, this week to discuss driver licensing issues.

As a result of the meeting the Minister was told that action is being taken to improve services.

A further 17 new testing officers are being assigned for the provision of driver testing, including 10 to be deployed in the Auckland area.

Other actions include:  
\* The provision of all licensing and testing services, including full licence testing on Waiheke Island;

\* Licensing services on Great Barrier Island have been extended from one to two days every two months;

\* Testing will be provided during the Christmas/New Year period including weekends, except on statutory holidays.

LTSA is also seeking its own assurances from agents that agreed procedures are being followed, that staff are actively managing customers in queues, and that customers are being provided with accurate information about driver licensing and testing requirements.

Mr Gosche said these measures should go some way to towards reducing backlogs that have occurred leading up to Christmas.

"Problems have been caused in part by new drinking laws which have lead to increased demand for photo licences as a form of identification by 18-20 year-olds, and in part by a pre-Christmas rush," Mr Gosche said.

"LTSA Director, Reg Barrett, has taken immediate action to ensure every effort is made to clear up the backlog."
