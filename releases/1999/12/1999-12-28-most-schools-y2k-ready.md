New Zealand schools have worked hard to ensure they are Y2K compliant, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

A representative sample of 161 schools was surveyed by Education Review Office over the past six months and the results show that most schools are well prepared.

The survey looked at school boards’ planning, the advice they had sought and the actions they had taken to guard against risks from Year 2000 computer failure in their schools.

Schools had been given a checklist by the Ministry of Education in July 1998, and most had taken precautionary measures to address the issue.

"Their administration and finance systems are the areas most at risk from non-compliant computer hardware and software and the extent of the Y2K issue varies from school to school depending on the amount, purpose and age of computer hardware and software.

"Most schools also took into account the vulnerability of microchip items like photocopiers, telephone and faxing systems, security and fire alarm systems, bell systems, video recorders and cameras, and electrical appliances with time clocks.

"The Secretary for Education was notified of the very few schools found to be either unprepared or even unaware of the potential problem.

"The Ministry of Education has also been involved in Y2K assurance checks on fire sprinklers and alarm systems and there were no issues in these areas still to be resolved in state schools.

"Getting ready for potential Y2K problems is something that all New Zealand individuals and organisation should have been doing this year. I am pleased that our schools have taken on this task so successfully," Trevor Mallard said.
