Work is to begin immediately to review the youth minimum wage, Youth Affairs Minister and Associate Minister of Labour Laila Harré announced today.

The adult minimum wage was today increased from $7 an hour to $7.55.

Laila Harré said the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Department of Labour would report back to Cabinet by the end of February on options to improve the youth minimum wage.

Other relevant ministries and sector groups will be consulted as part of the review.

“Options include the introduction of a universal minimum wage, dropping the threshold age at which the adult minimum wage applies from its current level of twenty, and improving the level of the youth wage compared to the level of the adult rate.

“There is a simple point of principle at stake with the youth minimum wage. No one should be paid less for doing exactly the same work as someone working along-side them doing exactly the same work.

“The principle that people should not be discriminated against on the basis of their age is now firmly established,” Laila Harré said.
