Minister of Conservation Sandra Lee today declared New Zealand’s only native dolphin a threatened species under the provisions of the Marine Mammals Protection Act.

“My primary responsibility in respect of threatened species of marine mammals in New Zealand waters is their protection and conservation management. Declaration of Hector’s dolphin as a threatened species will provide me with greater flexibility to take the necessary steps to ensure the survival of this very special animal. Hector’s dolphin is as unique to the New Zealand marine environment as the kiwi or kakapo are to our forests.”

Hector’s dolphin is found only around the New Zealand coastline. The total population has been estimated at between 3,000 and 4,000, most of which are found along the coast of the South Island. Concerns that the population was declining, possibly due to accidental captures in fishing nets, were first raised fifteen years ago, and led to the establishment by then Conservation Minister, Helen Clark, of New Zealand’s first marine mammal sanctuary, at Banks Peninsula in 1988.

“The Banks Peninsula marine mammal sanctuary has been a spectacular success. Not only have we observed a steady increase in the dolphin population, but also there has been a remarkable boom in tourist numbers. Seven businesses are now operating within the sanctuary, taking 10,000 passengers annually to view the dolphins. The sanctuary is a great example of how conservation initiatives can have positive economic benefits for the local community.”

The internationally-recognised criteria adopted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) specify that a species may be considered threatened if it has a total population of less than 10,000 individuals or if there is evidence of rapid recent decline of one or more sub-populations. Recent advances in the recovery of DNA from skeletons of Hector’s dolphins held in various museums around the country demonstrate that there has been a marked reduction in genetic diversity, particularly in the North Island. These findings are consistent with a very significant population decline for the North Island population over the past 100 years. Unfortunately, Hector’s dolphin therefore meets the criteria for a threatened species on both counts, Ms Lee said.

"The challenge is now to develop measures to allow the species to achieve non-threatened status as soon as is reasonably practicable. This will require close co-operation between government agencies, representatives of fishing interests, researchers and conservation groups. The Department of Conservation is currently developing a Population Management Plan for Hector’s dolphin that will provide opportunities for these groups and the public to become involved in devising a strategy that will ensure the survival of this endearing animal to delight future generations of New Zealanders. I call on all these groups to work closely together to achieve this goal."
