Alliance leader and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton is attributing the rapid pace of action by the new government to the co-operative approach the Alliance and Labour are taking to the new coalition.

Initiatives announced by the coalition include a 55 cent an hour increase in the minimum wage, restoration of the training incentive allowance, changes to the student loans scheme and the F 16 review.

“The Alliance has been intimately involved in discussions over the initiatives announced today. The government is demonstrating that it is possible to negotiate issues and also sustain a rapid pace,” Jim Anderton said.

“There are many policies we are still working on constructively, and the fact that announcements haven’t yet been made on everything doesn’t mean that action won’t be taken later.

“For our part the Alliance is determined to keep the momentum of the new government going to ensure that the hopes and aspirations of New Zealanders can be kept alive as we enter the new millennium.”
