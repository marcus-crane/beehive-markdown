The Government has suspended work on the review of New Zealand border control pending further discussion on the issue by new Ministers.

State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today released the Border Control Review Team’s final report, which includes the team’s recommendations on potential improvements to border control.

"In doing so, I must stress that this report is not Government policy and no decisions will be made on which recommendations will be adopted until it has been thoroughly discussed by the relevant Ministers," Trevor Mallard said.

"Those discussions will take fully into account the Labour Party’s policy that there should be a separate agency with a biosecurity focus rather than merging all border-related agencies – a position which differs from the review team’s recommendation that Government merge MAF Quarantine Services with NZCS.

"I am conscious that a lot of work and consultation went into the preparation of the report and I thank the review team – headed by Sir Ron Carter – for their effort. I am confident that the new Government will be able to make good use of their work to ensure that we develop practical and safe systems on border control for the benefit of all New Zealanders," Trevor Mallard said.
