The Government today took the first step in its promised streamlining of health administration by announcing the chairman of an interim board to oversee the process of bringing the Health Funding Authority Health into the Ministry of Health.

Health Minister Annette King said she had appointed experienced health administrator Sid Bradley to chair a new board, and the other members of the new board would be announced in late January.

Mrs King said Dr Graham Scott was standing down as chairman of the HFA, and paid tribute to his contribution and leadership in establishing and chairing the organisation, and to the quality of his work during more than five years involvement in the public health sector.

Before chairing the HFA, Dr Scott was chairman of the Central Regional Health Authority and then the Transitional Health Authority.

"Dr Scott has properly and professionally implemented the policies of the previous Government in guiding the establishment of the HFA," Mrs King said.

"But both Labour and the Alliance made clear policy pledges before the election of their intention to disestablish the HFA and bring it into the Ministry of Health.

"This will be followed with the establishment of 22 District Health Services that will allow communities to elect board members."

Mrs King said the Government would build on some of Dr Scott’s and the HFA’s work in the new District Health Services.

"But we have made our intentions plain of creating a different framework for the way public health is to be administered.

"Both Dr Scott and I agreed, in light of this, that the person who led the formation of the HFA is not the appropriate person to oversee its disestablishment."

Dr Scott will remain as chairman and the current board will remain in place until the new board takes over on February 1 next year, and Mr Bradley will be known as chairman designate in the interim.

Mrs King said Mr Bradley’s appointment could be seen as a start to the Government’s delivery on its promise to streamline health administration.

"Our policy is clear. We intend to simplify health bureaucracies and cut administration costs in favour of better services. The new board, which will have five members instead of seven, is a first step in that direction.

"The process of change will be evolutionary. Structures will be changing, but the challenge will be to build forward, with the help of experienced and valuable staff."

Mr Bradley has been a chairman and director of Canterbury Health, Healthlink South and Healthcare Otago, and chairman of the New Zealand Crown Health Industry Group.

Mrs King said more steps to implement the merger of the HFA with the Ministry of Health would be announced in late January.

To ensure a smooth transition, the current contracting round between the HFA and health providers would continue as planned. “It will be business as usual, with no disruption of health services.”

Mrs King said the Government was committed to restoring public faith in a comprehensive public health system.

"Overall our changes are intended to reduce central bureaucracy, increase public involvement in health and public accountability, and allow leadership to be more clearly demonstrated in the sector.

"We also want to avoid the mistakes of past changes, and retain skills and capacity within the health sector so we can best meet the needs of patients and work for the good health of all New Zealanders."
