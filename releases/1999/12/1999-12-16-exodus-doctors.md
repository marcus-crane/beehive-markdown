A planned strategy is needed to stop the exodus of young New Zealand doctors to Australia, Health Minister Annette King said today.

Mrs King was responding to statements from the Residents’ Doctors Association and Rural GP Network that lucrative Australian pay rates were luring young doctors across the Tasman and contributing to an acute shortage of New Zealand doctors.

The minister said she would be happy to meet representatives of both organisations in the new year.

"I have already had a meeting with the New Zealand Medical Association this week. The matter was raised with me, and we agreed to meet again to talk about some solutions."

Mrs King said the former National Government’s reliance on market forces delivering a stable workforce had proven to be absolute and disastrous failure.

"They have burdened students with massive debt. As a result many leave the country after graduating."

The national shortage of junior doctors was severely hampering the provision of medical services, she said.

Mrs King said the new Government wanted to develop both short-term and long-term solutions.

"In the short term Labour will establish a central fund which public hospitals can access to cover the recruitment costs of obtaining sufficient staff.

"In the long term, the Government will also establish a Health Workforce Advisory Committee charged with developing a co-ordinated workplace strategy."
