Health Minister Annette King has begun consultation with the Mental Health Commission to finalise a timetable for providing the necessary mental health services for New Zealand.

Mrs King, who met members of the commission yesterday, said today mental health had been the Cinderella of health services for far too long.

"One of my most important priorities is to develop a comprehensive mental health strategy that takes into account a range of economic, social, educational and cultural factors," she said.

Mrs King said the Mental Health Commission would be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Blueprint for Mental Health Services in New Zealand for services with people with serious mental disorders.

The Government was committed to implementing the blueprint but wanted adequate housing and employment strategies to be included in it.

Mrs King said the Blueprint would be implemented within a timeframe agreed between the Government and the Commission.

A timetable would be finalised within three months.
