Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that the Government took a practical and flexible approach by not declaring and Auckland region holiday on Monday 13 September.

"A holiday was only one of many options looked at by Government to assist those organising the APEC leaders meeting from 11-13 September in Auckland.

"Other factors the Government took into consideration included the effect on business and the economy in general by closing Auckland down for a day. Employers were adamant that this would have had a detrimental affect on their business, and were happy to avoid this and instead do what they could to help APEC organisers by juggling their requirements on Monday, which seemed to be a sensible solution.

"Declaring a holiday was also thought to be too much like using a sledge hammer to crack a nut. The Police are confident that they can handle the situation without a holiday and The Employers Federation and other employer bodies are encouraging their members to keep as many workers as possible out of Central Auckland on the Monday to help reduce traffic problems. As well, only a few schools among all the Auckland schools would be affected."

Mr McKinnon said that there would definitely be some delays for those who chose to come into Auckland on Monday, but if everyone was co-operative these could be kept to a minimum.

"The fact is when the Presidents of the United States, Russia and China, along with 18 other leaders come to town, you have to expect some disruption," he said.

"There is more flexibility in allowing business to offer staff a three day weekend or to close for a day. Schools also can make adjustments provided they meet the requirements of the Education Act.

The fact that both Auckland university and AIT have put their term vacation around APEC will also help considerably," Mr. McKinnon said.
