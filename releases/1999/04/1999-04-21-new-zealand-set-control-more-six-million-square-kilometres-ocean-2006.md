New Zealand's exclusive economic zone could be extended by more than 50 per cent giving the country rights to more than six million square kilometres of ocean, or one per cent of the earth's surface, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said at an Ocean Opportunities function at the Beehive today.

The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) presented Mrs Shipley with a new map of New Zealand's ocean territories that will be mounted in the Cabinet Room.

The Prime Minister also signed an international UNESCO Oceans Charter and launched a new project on offshore resources being co-ordinated by Canterbury University's Centre for Advanced Engineering (CAE).

"New Zealand already has the fourth largest exclusive economic zone in the world which covers about four million square kilometres of ocean," Mrs Shipley said.

"This could be extended by a further 2.4 million square kilometres giving us access to resources that could be worth trillions of dollars.

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, New Zealand has until 2006 to claim an extension to the amount of ocean floor under its jurisdiction.

"Most people don't realise that far more of our country lies below the sea than above it and it's the stuff below that holds an enormous amount of wealth that will be the new economic frontier of the future.

"Much of seabed over which we could have sovereignty is part of the continental shelf which harbours lucrative minerals and resources. Rough estimates show we could earn up to $100 billion alone from hydrocarbons and even larger returns from mineral deposits in our zone.

"Within the next few years annual returns from fishing, acqaculture and hydrocarbon extraction will be in the order of $3 billion a year."

Mrs Shipley warned that with the opportunities came responsibilities.

"We have been fortunate to inherit a vast ocean region that is rich in resources. But we must manage these resources in a prudent and sustainable manner to preserve our wider ecosystem and the interests of future generations.

"That will require everyone working together including government, private sector groups and others," Mrs Shipley said.

The UNESCO Oceans Charter signed by Mrs Shipley is aimed at promoting awareness of the ocean environment and its importance to society.

The CAE project is aimed at highlighting the possibilities of ocean exploration and resource extraction. The Centre is planning to bring all interested parties together for a national conference in October this year.
