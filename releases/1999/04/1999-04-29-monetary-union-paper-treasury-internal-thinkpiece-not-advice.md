The Treasury paper on Monetary Union reported in the Dominion this morning is a Treasury think piece, not advice prepared for Government Mr Birch said this morning

"Monetary Union is not on the Government's policy agenda"

"The Treasury has a responsibility to ensure its staff think broadly and deeply across the full range of issues affecting the economy, and to make sure they are at the forefront of economic thinking" Mr Birch said

The paper on Monetary Union is an example of this type of long range thinking by Treasury staff, and the work does not necessarily reflect a Treasury view. v The paper is purely a review of the key academic articles on the topic , in light of European monetary union. It does not draw any conclusion on the desirability of monetary union or propose any course of action.

The paper is one of a number of working papers. Working papers, including the paper on monetary union, are available on Treasury's web site, at www.treasury.govt.nz/workingpapers/default.htm
