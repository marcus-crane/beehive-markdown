Associate Minister for the Environment, Hon Marie Hasler urges New Zealanders to "uncover an environmentalist" before it's too late.

"Nominations for the 1999 Green Ribbon Awards close at the end of the month and I would like to see the present steady flow of applications turn into an avalanche," Ms Hasler said.

"These awards recognise outstanding contributions by individuals, organisations or businesses for protecting and improving the quality of our environment.

"People in our part of the world are innovative and put a lot of time and energy into caring for the environment and this award is a fitting way to recognise this effort."

Ms Hasler said the three winners in 1998 were Otaki dairy farmers Jim and Katherine Simcox, for excellence in farming practices which sustain the environment; the Guardians of Pauatahanui Inlet (Inc), for outstanding efforts to conserve and protect the natural resource; and Southland Regional Council's environmental education programme.

Award nomination forms are available from the Ministry for the Environment, phone (04) 917 7493, e-mail: publications@mfe.govt.nz, or on-line from the Ministry web site at www.mfe.govt.nz.

Winners will be announced on World Environment Day, 5 June 1999.
