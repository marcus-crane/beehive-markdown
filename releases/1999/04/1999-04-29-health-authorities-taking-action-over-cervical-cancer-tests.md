"Emotive claims of a "massive cover-up and inaction" from health authorities over a North Island pathologist's identification of cervical cancer are irresponsible and factually incorrect," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"I am very worried about the tenor of the claims being made - not only because they are wrong but because they seem to be designed to raise fears.

"I am most concerned about the impact such irresponsible allegations may have on women, provoking unnecessary fears and alarm.

"The Alliance Health spokesperson is completely wrong on a number of fronts - but particularly on claims there has been no action.

"I received a briefing and update on this issue a week ago - including information about what health authorities were doing.

"The Health Funding Authority has been working on how best to identify women who may be at risk to review their slides.

"It has had to operate in an environment where the court had suppressed identification of the pathologist.

"The Health Funding Authority has given an assurance that it is doing everything it can to give the women concerned certainty about the status of their cervical smears.

"Littering comments with words like massive cover-up and sickening inaction does nothing to assure women."

The pathologist concerned retired in 1996 and many woman should have had another test since then because the National Cervical Screening Programme is designed to ensure women have a test every three years.

Mr Creech noted that the Ministry of Health was about to embark on a major evaluation of the National Cervical Screening Programme which started ten years ago.
