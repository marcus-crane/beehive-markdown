Conservation Minister Nick Smith and Department of Conservation staff are ecstatic at the success of the Kakapo Recovery Programme that has seen a record seven chicks hatch, four of whom are female.

"In the last two decades, we've averaged only one chick every two years. To have seven in one year is extraordinary. Sexism is alive and well in DOC as our biggest worry has been the declining number of females. We've had only two female chicks this decade so four females is a huge boost to the Kakapo Recovery Programme."

The Kakapo Recovery Programme is a joint programme between the Department of Conservation, Forest & Bird and Comalco. There are now 63 kakapo in the world, of which 26 are female. The birds live on three island sanctuaries, Whenua Hou adjacent to Stewart Island, Little Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf and Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds. The chicks are all being cared for at the Burwood Bush Rearing Unit in Te Anau.

"This is a turning point for the kakapo. It represents a 25% increase in the female population. With most females being quite old, there has been a huge question mark over the survival of the species. The birth of these four females gives me confidence that the kakapo will survive."

"What makes this success all the more remarkable is that three of the four female chicks belong to Lisa, who had been lost and presumed dead for 14 years on Little Barrier Island. Lisa has become the matriarch of kakapo and will be enshrined in the history of the specie's survival."

Dr Smith said he would be writing to all Southland Schools this week, seeking suggestions for names for the chicks. The selection would be made by the Kakapo Recovery Team in consultation with iwi. The successful schools would then be invited to become guardians for the chicks.

"We want to raise the awareness amongst school children of our endangered species, and the importance of ensuring that they, and their children, get to experience that which makes New Zealand special."
