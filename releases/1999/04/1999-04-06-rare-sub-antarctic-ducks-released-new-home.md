Conservation Minister Nick Smith yesterday released twelve of the worlds rarest ducks onto a predator-free offshore island in a bid to seed a second wild population.

"The Campbell Island teal is a small, highly territorial duck found only in New Zealand's sub-Antarctic. The only existing wild population of as few as twenty birds survives on a 23 hectare rocky islet off Campbell Island where they fled from rats and wild cats."

Wairarapa's Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre took on the responsibility of beginning a captive breeding programme for this species back in 1984 from a total founder stock of eleven birds. The task was not easy as breeding behaviour and nesting activity had never been observed for this species and the wild birds of unknown age and history appeared reluctant to breed in captivity.

"After much experimentation and a magic mix of intuitive and intelligent guesswork the breakthrough occurred in 1994 and the Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre received international recognition for successfully rearing the first ducklings."

"Five years on, with a current captive population of forty-five Campbell Island teal, we are now able to move to the medium-term goal of establishing an insurance population on another predator-free island."

The teal recovery team had a difficult task choosing a suitable island for the release. Codfish Island, lying off the west coast of Stewart Island, offers a safe habitat for the teal and is visited regularly by conservation staff.

The twelve teal have been temporarily held in aviaries to allow them to adjust to their new surroundings and put on a little extra weight before being released into freshwater habitats around the island. They will also be fitted with identification bands and radio transmitters to enable staff to monitor the birds.

"Once established, this important Codfish Island population will be used as a source of birds to restock Campbell Island sometime in the next millennium."
