Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton, while visiting Central Otago, today announced the continuation of Rural Sector Assistance for farmers affected by the drought and who have insufficient income to meet family essentials.

Assistance is available to eligible farmers in Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Taraura and Wairarapa, Marlborough, North and South Canterbury, Otago and Southland until 31 March 2000. Assistance is also available to those families devastated by floods in the Whakatane area last June, and farmers on the West Coast of the South Island who were affected by incessant rain during 1998.

'Because the drought has moved further south into Otago and Southland, we've extended the coverage of welfare assistance to include the Dunedin, Clutha, Gore, and Southland Districts. An estimated 5,300 farms in Southland alone have been affected by the drought, 1,300 severely,' said Mr Luxton.

'These events have severely impacted on more than 13,000 farms and 280 families over the next year are likely to need support. These numbers are expected to rise this winter and then decline into spring as farming becomes more viable again,' said Mr Sowry.

'Farmers who need assistance should contact rural support trust co-ordinators in their area, who will be able to help them apply for any assistance. Because there is no established trust system in Southland, farmers could either approach local farming organisations, or MAF, who will put them in touch with nearby rural support trusts.'

'Many farmers in need of assistance are in a precarious situation that has been exacerbated by the drought. Families who will continue to need financial help during the coming summer will be invited to work closely with the rural trusts to see what options are available to them, ' Mr Luxton concluded.
