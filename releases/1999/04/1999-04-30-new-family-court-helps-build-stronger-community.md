The Minister for Courts, Hon Georgina te Heuheu, today officially opened the new $5 million dollar Christchurch Family Court complex.

'The old Christchurch Magistrates Court, built over one hundred years ago, has been given a new lease on life. It now provides a modern, comfortable, safe and operationally efficient court facility whilst retaining its historic features and ambience. The new Family Courthouse provides 3 new Family courtrooms, mediation rooms, Judges chambers and retiring rooms, segregated public waiting areas, separate and secure interview rooms, facilities for lawyers, and a modern security system including closed circuit television surveillance,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

Mrs te Heuheu said the Government is investing a sizeable sum, some $63 million over five years, in upgrading court buildings around the country. 'It is estimated that around half a million people come through our court buildings each year, for all sorts of reasons. Our aim is to provide court facilities that meet the needs of local people. Well designed and modern courthouses mean

a more friendly and safe environment, more efficient processing of cases, and better service for the community,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

Mrs te Heuheu praised the strong links between the courts and the community, and said the Family Court makes a very significant contribution to the community through helping to strengthen families and protect children. 'The court system plays a role of vital importance in making our society and our nation stronger.

The Family Court, in particular, is vital to building strong families and strong communities,' Mrs te Heuheu said.
