Trade and Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith has concluded a successful mission to the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

Speaking from Washington DC, Dr Smith said that there had been a positive response to his visit, particularly the announcement of a visa waiver for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar.

"The waiver allows citizens from the six Gulf States to visit New Zealand for up to three months without requiring a visa, and will facilitate closer contacts with the Gulf States involved, particularly in trade and tourism," said Dr Smith.

"The initiative has been received as a clear signal that we're serious about welcoming tourists and business people from these six Gulf states," said Dr Smith.

Before leaving the region for Washington DC, Dr Smith held talks with senior representatives of Emirates Airlines, who made it clear that they are now considering an expansion of the company's service to include New Zealand.

"The possibility of a direct link between the Gulf region of the Middle East and New Zealand is an encouraging development," said Dr Smith.

"My visit to the Middle East has re-affirmed the importance of these markets to New Zealand. There is huge potential for New Zealand within the region, and we must do more to maximise these opportunities," said Dr Smith.
