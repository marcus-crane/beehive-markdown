New Zealand is to host a week-long study tour for key Bougainville leaders next week, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon confirmed today.

The group of around 25 leaders, including Papua New Guinea Minister of State Sam Akoitai, and Co-Chairmen of the Bougainvillian Constituent Assembly Joseph Kabui and Gerard Sinato, will arrive on 12 April and visit several iwi in the central North Island.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand was responding to a request by the PNG Government and by senior Bougainvillean leaders to provide an opportunity for senior leaders to look at dispute resolution processes and Maori economic development projects in New Zealand.

"The aim of the study programme is to enable Bougainvillean representatives to take a fresh look at how to resolve some of the differences which have emerged over recent months.

'We have been able to make a positive contribution in the past through meetings at Burnham and Lincoln, and we remain committed to supporting this peace process.'

Mr McKinnon said the study tour would not only bring together representatives of the various Bougainville factions; it would also expose the group to positive ways in which New Zealand had dealt with some very difficult issues.

'The study tour will have a focus on issues relating to ownership and resource development which will have the most resonance with the Bougainvilleans' own situation,' Mr McKinnon said.
