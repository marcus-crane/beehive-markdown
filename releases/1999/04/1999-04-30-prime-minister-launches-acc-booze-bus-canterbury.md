Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today launched a new bus sponsored by the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation (ACC) for processing drink drivers in Canterbury.

"Drink drivers should understand we intend to catch them. Canterbury police will now have this excellent new ACC Stop Bus or 'booze bus' as an important weapon in the battle to get drink drivers off our roads," Mrs Shipley said.

"The police also now have tough new laws such as vehicle impoundment on the spot to use against recidivist drink drivers.

"Government is determined to maintain the pressure on drink driving and reinforce the message that it's unacceptable. I congratulate the ACC for its proactive measures in achieving this goal."

Mrs Shipley praised the ACC and the Police for working together to lower the number of alcohol-related road crashes.

"Both the ACC and Police are committed to getting the road toll down and they've put their money where their mouth is. I'm proud that Government agencies are working together in this way."

The Canterbury ACC Stop Bus is one of four supplied to the Police by ACC. They are clearly marked for high visibility and are fully equipped with breath testing equipment. The first bus was handed over to Police for use in Auckland and Northland, last month, and stopped nearly 700 drivers for random breath testing in its first three days of operation.

A total of 24 people have died on Canterbury roads this year.

"Government is proud of our progress in lowering the road toll. But, we still kill 500 people in New Zealand each year through road accidents.

"In Victoria, Australia the 'booze buses', along with other measures, helped achieve a further lowering of the road toll. We are determined to achieve this in New Zealand as well," Mrs Shipley said.
