Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, today announced that computer hackers and computer virus 'Typhiod Marys', or spreaders of computer viruses, will be targeted under proposed amendments to the Crimes Act.

"Recent Court of Appeal cases have highlighted the need to update the criminal law to take account of new technology and computer related offending", said Mr Ryall.

"The Government intends to introduce a number of amendments to protect computer owners from unlawful access to their systems and dishonest use of the data and information stored on their computer systems.

"Proposed new offences are:

accessing a computer system for a dishonest purpose;  
attempting to access a computer system system for a dishonest purpose;  
damaging or interfering with a computer system; and  
unauthorised access to a computer, commonly known as 'hacking' or 'cracking'.  
"The amendments will be included in a Bill that will address broader property law issues. The Bill will be introduced this session.

"The Government wants the many people who rely on computers in their daily lives to know that we are introducing laws to help protect their valuable property", Mr Ryall concluded.
