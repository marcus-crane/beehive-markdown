Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched the new Department of Conservation Trainee Ranger Programme at Nelson Polytechnic, at which the Director General, Hugh Logan, and Nelson Polytechnic Chief Executive, John Cretney, signed an agreement to implement the new course.

"This is an exciting day for conservation and Nelson. It's about recognising that DOC needs skilled, motivated staff to manage New Zealand's wild and beautiful places. I am doubly pleased that Nelson Polytechnic has been selected as the training provider, reinforcing our image as the conservation capital of New Zealand."

The Polytech has just begun advertising for the first 20 places on the National Certificate in Conservation (Trainee Ranger Programme) that starts in June. The programme involves one full year of study at Nelson Polytech's Richmond Campus, followed by two years as a trainee ranger working for the Department of Conservation.

The programme includes work skills, safety, fire fighting, radio use, administration skills, public relations, transport, machinery, construction, natural history, communication skills and an understanding of conservation philosophy. Also included is work experience, where students will be employed at a Department of Conservation location over their summer vacation.

"It combines a good mix of conservation theory along with practical field skills. We secured the course ahead of 12 other polytechnics, which is a real endorsement of the quality of what the polytechnic offers but it also makes sense because of the proximity to a such a wide range of important conservation parks and sites in the Nelson region," said Nelson Polytechnic Richmond Campus Manager Chris Clark.

Students coming straight from school need satisfactory grades at sixth form or equivalent. Applicants need a current driver ?s licence and a demonstrated interest in the outdoors and conservation.

"DOC and Nelson Polytech will face a difficult challenge in selecting those to be accepted for the programme. Already more than 100 enquires have been made by people who wish to pursue a career in conservation," said Dr Smith.

"Both conservation and young people are going to win from this programme. Young people gain the opportunity to pursue a career in an area they enjoy and have a passion for, and conservation gains by having committed, well trained staff that can improve the quality of conservation management," Dr Smith concluded.
