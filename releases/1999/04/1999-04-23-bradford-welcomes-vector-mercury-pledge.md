Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford has welcomed the pledge by Auckland electricity lines company Vector and retailer Mercury Energy to cap price levels over the next year.

Vector said that prices should fall over time as the April 1 electricity reforms started to take effect.

Mercury has promised to immediately pass on to customers any fall in Vector charges over the next year.

"It just goes to show that some companies are prepared to look after the interests of their consumers," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said the reforms were clearly working as wholesale power prices had fallen dramatically and for the first time ever most consumers had a choice of power retailer.

Only one energy retailer, TransAlta, has increased its prices.

Consumers should remember they have the power to put pressure on companies likeTransAlta.

"Consumers can vote with their feet and change supplier at no additional cost," Mr Bradford said.

The Government was also moving quickly to regulate lines companies that were rorting consumers by exploiting their monopolistic position, he said.
