Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has described today's meeting with US Ambassador Josiah Beeman to discuss the US International Trade Commission's recommendations on imports of New Zealand lamb as positive and constructive.

"I advised the Ambassador that this case is very important to New Zealand, and that we strongly oppose the ITC recommendations, which include trade restrictions.

"New Zealanders would find it inconceivable if the US, a leading proponent of international trade liberalisation, were to impose punitive trade measures to protect its domestic industry in a situation where there is no evidence of unfair trade.

"New Zealand believes that ITC recommendations will not resolve the alleged 'threat of injury' to the US lamb industry. The ITC itself has acknowledged that the problems facing the US lamb producers are caused by weaknesses within the industry and the lack of an effective marketing strategy, rather than over-supply.

"We believe it would be far more constructive, and consistent with the US support for free trade principles, for the President to consider steps which will improve the competitiveness of the US lamb industry, rather than closet it away from healthy competition from NZ lamb.

"I advised Ambassador Beeman that the New Zealand meat industry stands ready to contribute its marketing expertise and funding to assist the US industry to promote lamb consumption in the US, provided that we continue to enjoy unrestricted access to the US market. "The US response to the ITC recommendations has the potential to send important signals to other trading nations with a commitment to fair and efficient trade in the very year when the US is to host the WTO Ministerial that aims to launch a new free trade round.

"While I have already had important discussion with key figures in Washington, today's meeting was the first step in New Zealand's formal response to the ITC recommendations. Ambassador Beeman will relay our concerns to Washington this evening, and I will continue to work closely with the New Zealand meat industry to ensure that New Zealand producers are not penalised for successfully marketing a quality product to consumers in the United States," said Dr Smith.
