Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will visit Peru, Chile and Mexico next month. This will be the first visit by a New Zealand Prime Minister to the South American continent, although prime ministers have previously visited Mexico.

Mrs Shipley announced the visit at the APEC Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) meeting in Christchurch today. The brief trip will take in the three Latin American members of APEC.

"I'm announcing my plans to the SME meeting because small and medium businesses are by far the biggest force in New Zealand business and APEC is all about delivering better business conditions for them.

"The APEC process will deliver huge new markets, and one of the APEC regions with most potential is Latin America.

"The economies I will be visiting have all been opened and modernised in recent years and they have a lot of scope for New Zealand businesses. Some companies, both large and small, have already discovered that, and I want a lot more to."

Mrs Shipley said she would be talking in Peru, Chile and Mexico about New Zealand's plans for APEC.

"I want to talk to these leaders about my hopes to use our year in the chair to put new life into the free trade movement.

"I will also be discussing our intention to see APEC as a clearing house for information and ideas that member nations can use to improve their own economies and increase the prosperity of their people.

"The visit will give new focus to the bilateral relationships between New Zealand and these countries. The trends in trade and investment are looking good and I'll be exploring a lot of avenues to open up more business with this region that is becoming increasingly important for New Zealand."

Mrs Shipley's programme will include meetings with President Alberto Fujimori of Peru, President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle of Chile and President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de L éon of Mexico.

Mrs Shipley will leave New Zealand on Sunday 9 May and return on Monday 17 May.
