The Hon John Luxton today announced that he had withdrawn his nomination as the National candidate for the safe National seat Karapiro at the next election.

Mr Luxton said a combination of his increased Ministerial workload and changed family circumstances over the last Parliamentary term had led to his decision.

"An additional National MP representing the Karapiro electorate will ensure that the electorate continues to receive the level of MP support it has come to expect."

"The new mega-ministerial portfolio of Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control and Associate roles in the Trade and Immigration portfolios, have required an increased commitment across the country at the expense of electorate and family responsibilities."

"MMP allows Members to opt for a list only candidate and that is the approach I have decided upon. I look forward to being part of the incoming National Government after the next election," concluded Mr Luxton.

Mr Luxton intends to retain his residence in the Karapiro electorate and continue to assist constituents in the Waikato region.
