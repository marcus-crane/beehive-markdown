Education Minister Nick Smith today announced the Government's target of having all schools on the Internet by year's end.

"Every school pupil should have access to the information superhighway. The power of the Internet grows by the day and confidence in its use will be essential in the new millennium. New Zealand's geographical isolation and large number of small rural schools has previously been a barrier to accessing information and knowledge. The Internet is an opportunity to connect every school to the knowledge banks of the world."

"The benefits of having all 2700 schools on the Internet is not just educational. There are huge administrative efficiencies in the Ministry, ERO and other Government agencies being able to instantly communicate with schools."

"I accept this is a very ambitious goal, but I believe it is achievable. Already 85% of schools have Internet access, but I will not be satisfied until we reach 100%. I will be working with the Ministry of Education, School Trustees Association and Internet providers on how the remaining 400 or so schools can be resourced and connected."

The goal of having every school on the Internet by year's end is part of a broader information technology strategy announced last year, providing $16 million of investment in infrastructure, school capability and professional development over 3 years. Principals will begin workshops next month for I.T. leadership training, and an Information Technology Professional Development programme has provided $1.1million for 357 schools across New Zealand to meet their I.T. professional development needs this year. Earlier this month, the 23 I.T professional development schools, to provide professional development and support to other schools in their region, were announced. An online resource centre will begin in July, and a computer recycling scheme is underway.
