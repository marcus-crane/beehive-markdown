"I am very pleased that I have been able to reach an agreement with Sir Robert Mahuta which reflects the tremendous amount of goodwill that exists between us. We both want to make progress now on the river claims by Waikato-Tainui."

"The change made to the Crown's assurance records that if after the split, Waikato-Tainui have concerns that their interests are about to be prejudiced, then the Crown in accordance with its Treaty obligations will consider the matter."
