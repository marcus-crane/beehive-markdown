Discussion Document First Step to Better Consistency Education Minister Nick Smith welcomed the release of the Working Party's discussion document on the issues of the length of the school day and year and encouraged parents, teachers and the wider community to have their say in how schools will be managed in the new millennium.

"It is timely that we take a fresh look at the regulations governing the times of the school day and length of the school year. When these issues were last debated, issues like milking time and haymaking were a prime consideration. We also need to debate the educational merits of the primary and secondary school years being different."

Current regulations prescribe that a school must be open for 2 hours prior to noon and 2 hours after. The primary school year is defined as 394 half days while the secondary year is 380 half days.

"One also needs to be clearer about what constitutes a school being 'open for instruction', given the cost of $20 million per day. In 1998 the Education Review Office highlighted the fact that some schools were cribbing the length of the school year. This may be short-changing our pupils of essential learning time."

"A problem that needs sorting out is the time a teacher is expected at school. Some teachers work tirelessly through term holidays preparing course material, supporting extracurricular activities and engaging in professional development programmes. Other teachers believe that when school's out, they're out. We need to explore the proposal of separately defining a school's holidays from a teacher's leave as has occurred already with Principals."

"The issue of term times is discussed, but should not be the major focus. The four-term year was introduced three years ago and schools generally tell me they like it. However, it is useful to get feedback on how well it is working".

"The school day, length of year and term times are not something we can take a laissez-faire approach on. We need consistency for all sorts of education and social reasons. This makes it all the more important that teachers, parents, boards, principals and the wider community have an input into this review".

The Working Party Discussion Document will be released to all schools on the 19th of April and is available from the Ministry of Education and the Internet. Submissions close on 28 May and the Working Party is due to report in early October.

Working Party Releases Discussion Paper

Margaret Austin, Chairperson of the Working Party Reviewing the School Day and the School Year, has announced the release of its Discussion Paper.

"The Discussion paper goes into all schools with the Education Gazette on Monday April 19th" said Mrs Austin. "It is accompanied by a summary and a questionnaire. The working party wants feedback from educators and the public through the questionnaire, which must be returned to the working party by May 28th 1999."

The paper and questionnaire is also available on the Ministry of Education's website.

"The Working Party has uncovered a number of issues which need greater definition," said Mrs Austin. "Questions such as the number of days in the school year, when should a school be open, what does 'open for instruction' actually mean, how long must the school day be to deliver the curriculum for different age groups, what is the place of extra-curricular activities? Why should the primary school year be 7 days longer than the secondary year or equally why should the secondary year be 7 days shorter than the primary year?"

"The working party was concerned to hear that some schools include parents' evenings, prize givings and the days of a staggered start at the beginning of the school year as part of the time they are "open for instruction." This is pushing the boundaries of what is required and must be sorted out."

"Another concern is the time lost during the school year. There is a great difference between intended instructional time and the time actually available for instruction," said Mrs Austin.

"There must be a clear understanding of expectations if we are to achieve the quality education we seek for New Zealand's school age students. The Working Party is convinced that the key to educational achievement is setting goals and expectations, quality instruction, students on task and effective use of instructional time," said Mrs Austin.

"Referring to the school day in half days where they are required to be open for 2 hours before noon and 2 hours afternoon is a hangover from the past with little relevance to the present day. Schools require flexibility to organise their school day within a consistent framework," said Mrs Austin.

"Another issue to be taken into account is the nature of the teacher's task. It is much more than fronting up in a classroom. The need for time for planning, reading, collaboration with colleagues, professional development and interviewing parents must be recognised," said Mrs Austin.

"The questionnaire asks educators and the public to consider and respond to a number of options on all of these issues and some others. We hope that a very large number of people will do so."

"This exercise has to do with quality of education and achievement across the curriculum at the highest possible level," concluded Mrs Austin
