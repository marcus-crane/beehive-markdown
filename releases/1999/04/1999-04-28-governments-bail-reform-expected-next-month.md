The Government proposes to introduce a comprehensive bail reform bill at the end of next month, says Justice Minister Tony Ryall. The Government's plans were signalled in February's Prime Ministerial statement. "Our plans are more comprehensive and go further than Mr Goff's proposals, and will provide more support for the Police in opposing bail applications", said Mr Ryall.

"However, because Mr Goff's bill is a timid step in the right direction, we will support it going to a select committee. We expect it will be overtaken by our bill.

"The Government's bail plan as announced in February will reverse the onus for getting bail for serious offenders who commit an offence while already on bail. This will increase the number of people denied bail each year from 3000 to 4500. Our plan targets those most likely to re-offend or breach bail. An offender will not need ten convictions to lose bail as proposed by Mr Goff.

"Courts will also be given power to have the details of bail breaches permanently recorded against a defendant, making it harder for offenders to gain bail in any future offence. This new database will allow the Courts to instantly tell whether a bail applicant has offended on bail or breached conditions previously. Currently it is very hard for the Police to assemble this information.

"These changes build on a District Court Bail Practice Instruction which gives more time for the Police to provide information to the Courts than was previously the case.

"Perhaps the most important aspect of the Government's bill is that it will bring together in a single law the bail provisions scattered through seven separate acts and common law. That is why the bill has taken some time to draft. This will lead to greater public confidence in the bail process and the criminal justice system generally," noted Mr Ryall.
