Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that the Government was now deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation in East Timor, with the continuation of killings on the island.

"The Government condemns the violence that is occurring, particularly the actions over the weekend by anti-independence civilian militia, which resulted in further Timorese deaths.

"We expect the Government of Indonesia to meets its commitment to maintain peace and good order in East Timor and we also expect the military forces to act to curb and disarm militia groups.

"Further, Indonesia must ensure conditions on East Timor are conducive to the process of consultation with the East Timorese people being able to proceed in a transparent, peaceful and orderly way."

Mr McKinnon said talks between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations , scheduled for later this week in New York, should clarify the process proposed by Indonesia for the East Timorese to vote on their future.

"The United Nations will have a vital role to play in this process and the New Zealand Government supports this initiative. Along with others in the international community we will provide whatever help and assistance that we can, through the UN.

"As well, the New Zealand Ambassador in Indonesia has been to see the Indonesian Foreign Ministry to state our concerns and will also be calling on defence force chiefs, to re-empahsise New Zealand's position," Mr McKinnon said.
