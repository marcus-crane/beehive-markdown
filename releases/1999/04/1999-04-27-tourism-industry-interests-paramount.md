The Acting Minister of Tourism has had an initial briefing from the Chair of the Tourism Board and is pleased with the level of optimism about future plans to promote New Zealand on the world stage.

"New Zealanders want the tourism industry to be able to get on with the job of promoting our country overseas.

"The Tourism Board Chair has given me an update of its four step plan to market New Zealand globally, taking advantage of opportunities such as the Millennium and the America's Cup.

"I am pleased with the sense of optimism and enthusiasm that has been expressed about the plans.

"I have also re-confirmed the Government's commitment to ensuring our energies are focused on showcasing New Zealand on the world stage and attracting people here.

"Now the distractions are behind the Tourism Board I trust it will be able to get on with the job and continue with the development of the global marketing strategy," Mr Creech said.
