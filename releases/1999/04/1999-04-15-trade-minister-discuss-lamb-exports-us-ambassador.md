Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has invited US Ambassador Josiah Beeman to a meeting to discuss New Zealand's response to the International Trade Commission's recent recommendation to impose a tariff rate quota on imports of New Zealand lamb. "The New Zealand Government objects strongly to the trade restrictive measures recommended by the ITC," said Dr Smith.

"Up until now, the ITC hearings have been a largely judicial process. But we're now into the political phase, and its important that the US Administration understands the importance of this case to New Zealand.

"The New Zealand Government is determined to see the ITC recommendations overturned. "It is inconceivable to New Zealanders that the US, a leading proponent of trade liberalisation around the world, would impose punitive trade measures to protect its domestic industry from fair competition in a situation where no actual injury has occurred.

"The US Administration must be aware that endorsing the ITC recommendations would send a most unfortunate signal, particularly in the year that the US is to host the WTO Ministerial that aims to launch a new free trade round.

"We are also convinced that New Zealand can offer some very constructive solutions to the problems facing the US domestic sheep meat industry which do not involve trade restrictions. "I'm looking forward to the opportunity to share our thinking with Ambassador Beeman, and will ask him to relay our response to the appropriate agencies in Washington" said Dr Smith. Ambassador Beeman meets with Dr Smith in a closed session at 4 pm on 15 April 1999. Media are welcome to assemble in Dr Smith's office (17th Floor, Bowen House) at 4.10 pm. Ambassador Beeman and will make a brief statement after the meeting and Dr Smith will be available to take questions.
