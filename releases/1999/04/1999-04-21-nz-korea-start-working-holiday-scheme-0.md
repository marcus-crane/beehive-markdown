Young New Zealanders will be able to live and temporarily work in Korea for up to one year under a new Working Holiday Scheme announced today by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon and Immigration Minister Tuariki Delamere.

The agreement, signed today by Mr McKinnon and Korean Ambassador Moon Bong-joo, starts on May 1 and applies to people aged between 18 and 30. It is similar to successful Working Holiday Schemes already operating with the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and the Netherlands.

Under the scheme, 200 New Zealanders will be eligible to enjoy a 12-month holiday in the Republic of Korea and also undertake temporary work to supplement their holiday funds. The same number of young Koreans will have reciprocal eligibility for New Zealand.

"This agreement reflects the increasing closeness of relations with Korea, a significant trade partner for New Zealand and a fellow APEC member. It will further enhance ties between us and gives young New Zealanders and Koreans an opportunity to better understand each other's country," Mr McKinnon said.

Mr Delamere said the scheme offered young people a chance to work on a temporary basis to help part-fund their stay. "This will provide a new generation of New Zealanders and Koreans with an opportunity to build stronger links and a better understanding between the two countries." New Zealanders wishing to take part in the scheme should contact the Korean Embassy in Wellington, while Korean citizens should contact the New xZealand Immigration Service, at the New Zealand Embassy, in Seoul.
