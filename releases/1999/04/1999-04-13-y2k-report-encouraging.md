The Local Government sector is making good progress towards preparing itself for Y2K problems, but there is still a great deal of work to be done, Minister responsible for Y2K Maurice Williamson said today.

Mr Williamson was responding to the release of a Local Government New Zealand survey on Y2K readiness.

"Although there were a number of positives such as all local authorities believing they will be Y2K compliant in time for the new millenium, a number still have a lot of work to do.''

"I'm disappointed that seven councils didn't respond to the survey, but I believe the recent Local Government Summit on Y2K will have highlighted what every authority must do.

Mr Williamson welcomed the fact that citizens and communities are now able to see for themselves the preparedness of their local councils after it was decided at the Summit to publish the Y2K Readiness Commission's two monthly surveys .

"It's a positive incentive for local authorities to make further progress and reassure the public that their interests are being taken seriously."

"This is akin to hanging out our dirty washing for all to see. Hopefully, over time, the public will see that this laundry is progressively becoming cleaner."

Mr Williamson was also hopeful that more progress had been made since the data of the survey was collected in February.

"Because of the importance of the services that local authorities provide, the Government will be watching closely for progress to be made."
