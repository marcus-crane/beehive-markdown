Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has announced that New Zealand has suspended its WTO action against the European Commission on spreadable butter in order to explore opportunities to resolve the dispute outside of the WTO process.

New Zealand requested a WTO Panel ruling on the dispute after the European Commission denied access for spreadable butter under a special tariff quota arrangement negotiated in the Uraguay Round. The Commission argued that spreadable butter did not meet the relevant access criteria which requires New Zealand butter to be 'manufactured directly from milk or cream'.

"The WTO Panel has released its interim report, and although WTO rules prevent me from discussing the Panel ruling, I can say that we've agreed to suspend the panel and re-enter negotiations with the Commission", said Dr Smith.

"We're naturally pleased to be revisiting this issue, and we're hopeful that we can find a mutually satisfactory solution to this dispute.

"Our officials will be making every effort to ensure that any settlement delivers what we sought by taking this case to the WTO in the first place - that entry for spreadable and Ammix butter is reinstated by the EU within the tariff quota arrangement.

"It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the negotiations with further comment at this stage.

"We hope to be in a position to provide a full report on progress in late May of this year," said Dr Smith.
