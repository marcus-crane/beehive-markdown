Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that no one could be pleased with the outcome of the trial of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been found guilty on four charges of corruption and sentenced to six years in jail.

Mr McKinnon said that the conduct of the trial, and today's verdict, have caused concern and unhappiness in Malaysia and internationally.

As an appeal may well be lodged by Anwar, it is not appropriate to comment on specific aspects of the trial as these may be taken up in the appeal process.

New Zealand will be watching any appeal process with critical interest. "We hope that the process and outcome of any Appeal will reaffirm the credibility of Malaysia's judicial system," the Minister said.

Mr McKinnon noted the admission by former Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor that he had assaulted Anwar while the former Deputy Prime Minister was in custody. "We understand that the Commission of Inquiry into these allegations had made recommendations for action against the former Inspector General of Police and we hope these recommendations will be implemented. We would also expect that Mr Anwar's physical safety be assured while he remains in custody".
