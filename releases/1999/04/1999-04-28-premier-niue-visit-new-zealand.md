The newly-appointed Premier of Niue, Sani Lakatani, will pay an official visit to New Zealand from May 3-7, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

Mr Lakatani, who had been Leader of the Opposition, was elected Premier by the Niue Assembly on March 26 after former leader Frank Lui lost his seat in a general election.

Mrs Shipley said she was pleased to be meeting the new Premier so soon after his appointment.

"Niue and New Zealand have very close ties and I welcome the chance to discuss our common interests. Niuean people are New Zealand citizens and so a strong, positive relationship is very important to both sides," Mrs Shipley said.

There are approximately 16,000 Niueans living in New Zealand. Niue was once a territory of New Zealand, but has been self-governing in free association since 1974.

During his visit, Mr Lakatani will meet Mrs Shipley and other Ministers, pay a call on the Governor General, and will also attend a function hosted by the Niuean community.
