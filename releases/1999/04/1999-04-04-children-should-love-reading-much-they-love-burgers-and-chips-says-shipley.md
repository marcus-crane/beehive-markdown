"I want children to love reading as much as they love their food like burgers and chips," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Feeding their mind is just as important as feeding their body, if they want to obtain a successful career or run a successful business in the future.

"Children must be able to read and write and do basic maths if they want to realise their dreams."

Mrs Shipley and Minister of Education, Hon Nick Smith, launched the "Feed the Mind" (Whangaihia te hinengaro) campaign at Wharenui Primary School in Christchurch today to encourage adults to teach word and number skills to young children in a relaxed and fun environment.

The campaign is the second part of the Government's $35 million, five year strategy to make sure every child can read, write and do maths by age nine.

"Teachers do a good job, but they can't achieve this goal on their own. People must understand that schools are not the sole domain for learning. It must also take place in the home.

"This campaign shows practical and fun ways that parents and wider family can help children learn at home. We need grandparents, sisters and brothers, friends and others in the community to help see that every child has someone to listen to them read and to read to them.

"We also want parents to be confident about what helps a child learn. It is the simple, everyday family activities like going to the supermarket, driving a car, riding the bus or preparing a meal that offer valuable opportunities to get involved in a child's learning.

"Several of the television advertisements show relatable scenes of families in their own homes having fun learning literary and numeracy skills," Mrs Shipley said.

She said it was important for parents to make sure they had books in their homes to read to their children.

"Through Alan Duff's Books in Homes project the Government is helping families who cannot afford to buy new books for their children.

"I hope parents and children take on board the message that it can be fun to teach and learn at home."

Mrs Shipley told the children at Wharenui School that just like their bodies, their minds need a healthy diet.

"It is hard to imagine going through life without being able to read. So much of our lives today depend on our ability to communicate through written words, whether they are electronic or on paper.

"Like the theme song for the campaign says, 'you've got to know to understand'."

The $3 million campaign will reach parents, families and friends nation-wide through television, radio and billboard advertising along with a mailout campaign.

The Ministry of Education is planning regional meetings with primary school principals on the "Feed the Mind" campaign and explain how it will produce opportunities for schools to work even more with their communities to improve reading, writing and maths learning.

"We want every New Zealander to love reading, to be able to read and share that pleasure with others.

"By 2004 and every year after that we want every nine year old to be able to read, write and do maths in our country.

"Reading, writing and maths unlock opportunities for our future. Government wants every New Zealander to have these skills. It will only happen if every New Zealand adult is determined to see that we as New Zealanders fall in love with reading again," Mrs Shipley told the children and teachers at Wharenui School.
