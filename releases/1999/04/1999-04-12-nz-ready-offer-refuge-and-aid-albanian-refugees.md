New Zealand could be providing direct help to refugees from Kosovo as early as next week, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"There has been an outpouring of concern by New Zealanders about the plight of refugees. This Government has an obligation as a good international citizen to do whatever we can to help," Mrs Shipley said.

She also welcomed the many New Zealanders who have offered accommodation, assistance and donations to refugees.

Officials had been talking this week with the New Zealand Albanian community who are eager to see a refuge provided for Albanian family groups from Kosovo, Mrs Shipley said.

As well as offering places for those refugees, the Government is in touch with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to assess how best New Zealand can help in providing refugee assistance.

Cabinet would consider specific proposals on Monday to provide temporary refuge and humanitarian aid in the region, such as a small mobile medical team to work in refugee camps along the border areas of Kosovo.

A small group of staff from all three services of the armed forces - Navy, Army and Air Force - have this week been making preparations to leave for the Balkans as early as next week.

"They will be providing the sort of practical help that New Zealanders can see is so sorely needed. I know that our country will be well represented and that our servicemen and women will make a very useful contribution to this huge humanitarian task," Mrs Shipley said.
