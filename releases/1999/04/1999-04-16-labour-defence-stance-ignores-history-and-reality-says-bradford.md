Defence Minister Max Bradford today expressed incredulity at the stance adopted by Labour leader Helen Clark on the future of New Zealand's Defence Force.

Mr Bradford was reacting to Miss Clark's reported comments that a Labour-led government would back a niche force structure for New Zealand's defence forces.

"I find it alarming that she believes we live in 'a very low threat environment.' In barely a year the world's security environment has deteriorated significantly," Mr Bradford said.

"NATO for all intents and purposes is on a war footing in the Balkans. India and Pakistan are throwing rockets over each other's territory and testing nuclear weapons to the horror of the world community.

"Tension between China and Taiwan has increased and closer to home there is considerable internal conflict in Indonesia and East Timor.

Mr Bradford said the Labour Party and some people on Parliament's Defence and Foreign Affairs select committee who believed New Zealand's Defence Force should be run as a niche land force seemed to be ignoring not only the lessons of history but the realities of today.

"Even the most well equipped land force cannot perform peacekeeping, peace making or God forbid real war on their own.

"Never again do I want to see our New Zealand forces go into dangerous situations without the proper equipment and full support from air and naval forces.

"In spite of all the technology that is now available the simple fact is that we cannot base a defence force policy on a niche strategy.

"The Goverment and the National Party strongly believe that New Zealand's defence strategy must be based on a balance of forces between the army, navy and Airforce.

"That is what the 1997 defence assessment was about and why we have Closer Defence Relations with Australia with whom we work closely to ensure regional security," Mr Bradford said.
