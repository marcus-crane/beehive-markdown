The Government has renewed its commitment to the Asia 2000 Foundation, pledging $1.74 million each year for the next three years, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

"The recent economic crisis in Asia has driven home to many New Zealanders how important Asia is to New Zealand. With more than one third of all our exports going to the region, that is not going to change. Asia 2000 is a key part of New Zealand's response to the reality of Asia's significance to us," Mr McKinnon said.

The forthcoming budget will roll over current funding for Asia 2000 of $1.74 million per year, for another three years.

"This will provide the core operating budget for the organisation, which will continue to seek support from the private sector and wider community to undertake educational, cultural and business activities.

"Asia 2000's approach of always working in partnership with others and drawing support from the private sector enables it to undertake a level of activity far in excess of the funding it gets from government.

"This is a government and private sector partnership with a great record of success. Since 1994, thousands of New Zealanders of all ages have benefited from its education, business, culture and media programmes.

"As well, through initiatives like the recent Festival of Asia, thousands more have come to appreciate the diverse and exciting cultures of our neighbours in Asia."

Mr McKinnon thanked all Asia 2000's sponsors for the support which is so critical to its ongoing success.

"We must continue to work collectively to promote our links with this part of the world," Mr McKinnon said.
