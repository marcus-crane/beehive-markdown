Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford is appalled that the Labour-Alliance Bloc has played politics with the issue of power prices.

Labour this afternoon blocked Communications Minister Maurice Williamson from tabling a document in Parliament that listed the name and telephone number of retail power companies offering lower prices to consumers than TransAlta .

TransAlta this week increased its charges to customers in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland, prompting hundreds to switch to a cheaper power supplier.

"It is reprehensible for Labour and the Alliance to claim they have the interests of consumers at heart and at the same time stand in the way of information that will give TransAlta customers the opportunity to save money," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford repeated his call for consumers facing electricity price hikes to vote with their feet and change suppliers.
