Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today congratulated Wrightson, Williams and Kettle and Elders Livestock on the swift rebuilding of the Fielding Saleyards, when he officially opened the new $400,000 facilities. Abby Andrews of Marton assisted the Minister.

"It's amazing that only six months since the cattle rostrum was destroyed by fire, in its place there now stands a completely new building from the ground up. It's a like a phoenix rising from the ashes."

"The new facilities and new technology are state-of-the-art. Electronic scales made of stainless steel and hermetically sealed for reliability, weigh the cattle before the sale. Then electronic display boards show the price per head and cents per kilogram. The electronic selling of livestock heralds a new chapter in the history of the Feilding Saleyards."

The remodelled complex and cattle rostrum seats 225 people. The new selling pavilion also incorporates staff amenities and offices.

"The Feilding Saleyards is a major lifestock centre with around 40,000 cattle and 350,000 sheep sold annually and it plays an important role in servicing the farming community in the greater Manawatu region

"I commend the companies on this new facility. Liveweight auctions take the guess work out of buying and selling livestock. They provide the producer with accurate feedback and stock performance, which minimises the risk for the purchaser," Mr Luxton concluded.
