Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith has disbanded the Tourism and Sport Ministerial Advisory Board.

The Board's future has been the subject of speculation following the Auditor General's report on the role of the Board, and the subsequent separation of Ministerial responsibility for the Tourism and Sport portfolios.

Dr Smith said that it had been decided to disband the Board after careful consultation with relevant officials and discussions with the Minister of Sport, Fitness and Leisure.

"Mr McCully and I agreed that the original circumstances that led him to establish the Board no longer apply, and, accordingly, we have decided to disband the Board," said Dr Smith.

"It is important to acknowledge that this decision does not reflect on the members of the Advisory Board. These individuals have acted in good faith, and served on the Board in the interests of maximising the benefit of Tourism and Sport for all New Zealanders.
