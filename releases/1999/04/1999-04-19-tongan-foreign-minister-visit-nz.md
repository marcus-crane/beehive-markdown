Tonga 's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence, HRH Prince 'Ulukalala Lavaka Ata will visit New Zealand from 19-24 April, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand enjoyed a close relationship with Tonga and the Prince's visit would provide a timely opportunity to look at ways of consolidating those links.

'New Zealand's relationship with Tonga is one of our strongest in the Pacific. Economic, family and defence links are robust and with over 30,000 Tongans living in New Zealand, our connections remain strong,' Mr McKinnon said.

'Prince Lavaka Ata has only recently assumed the Foreign Affairs and Defence portfolio. To have him visit New Zealand so early on in his new position is a testimony to the solid and long-standing bilateral links between New Zealand and Tonga. Cooperation on regional issues is also an important component in our relationship," Mr McKinnon said.

New Zealand's official development assistance programme for Tonga stands at $5.6 million, while solid defence links have also been established under the Mutual Assistance Programme.

Prince Lavaka Ata will call on the Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie-Boys and hold bilateral meetings with Foreign Minister Don McKinnon; Treaty Negotiations Minister Doug Graham; Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare and Pacific Island Affairs Minister Tuariki Delamere.

Prince Lavaka Ata will meet with senior officials at Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as visit defence establishments in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. He will also be welcomed onto Nga Hau e Wha National marae in Christchurch and visit the University of Canterbury.
