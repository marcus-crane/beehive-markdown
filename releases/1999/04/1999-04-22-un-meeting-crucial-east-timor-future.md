Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said the meeting at the United Nations in New York today between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal is crucial to the future of East Timor.

"I am hopeful that the outcome of the meeting (Friday morning NZ Time) will be an agreed plan for a ballot of East Timorese people on autonomy, by September at the very least, and that they reach agreement that the UN can deploy people in East Timor to prepare for the vote and supervise it.

"It is not possible at this time to send civilians into the present turmoil in East Timor. It is essential that peace is restored before the UN sends people there.

When I spoke to Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas on Tuesday, I made the point that internal security is the responsibility of the Indonesian Government and they must act to disarm all active militia forces in East Timor right away.

"I also urged Alatas to ensure that Indonesia's commitment to provide a safe and secure environment in East Timor was met. I said that Indonesia will be judged on its ability and willingness to do that. Subsequent reports that the different factions have concluded a peace pact, following General Wiranto's visit, are encouraging.

"I have instructed our Ambassador to the UN to assure Secretary General Kofi Annan of New Zealand's support for an early UN engagement in the ballot process, including both money and personnel for the ballot operation," Mr McKinnon said.
