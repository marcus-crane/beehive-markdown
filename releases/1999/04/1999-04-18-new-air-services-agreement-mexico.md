New Zealand and Mexico have negotiated an Air Services Agreement allowing unrestricted reciprocal access for up to two airlines from each country, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

"The agreement provides a sound basis for the development of direct air links between Mexico and New Zealand, enhancing service options for travellers and traders."

The services may be operated via any route, either in each airline's own right or on a code-share basis with other airlines, including those from third countries. Code sharing is where one airline sells seats under its own name on another airline's plane.

"The Agreement adds another strand to the growing relationship between New Zealand and Mexico. It demonstrates both economies commitment to the APEC Bogor objectives of free and open trade and investment among APEC economies."

Mr Williamson said it also strengthens New Zealand's aviation ties with the Americas (agreements are already in place with Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile and the United States).

"We also hope to shortly establish an air services agreement with Peru and to enhance arrangements with Argentina, as foreshadowed during the visits last year of Presidents Menem and Fujimori."

It is expected that in the short to medium term it will be code-sharing opportunities that will be taken advantage of rather than the operations by an airline of its own aircraft over the entire route.

Both Air New Zealand and the Mexican carrier Mexicana operate a number of services through Los Angeles and both are code-share partners with United Airlines.

The Air Services Agreement will be applied immediately with a date of signing to be arranged.
