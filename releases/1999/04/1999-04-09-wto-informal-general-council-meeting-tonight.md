Trade Minister Lockwood Smith is not concerned by the delays in appointing the next Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

"The process of appointing the new Director-General has been very fair, transparent and professional. Although it has taken longer than anyone might have expected, this is a very important position, and WTO members quite rightly wish to be certain that they appoint the best candidate to the position," said Dr Smith.

"The WTO General Council Chairman gave delegates the opportunity to reflect on their positions over Easter, and has continued to discuss each country's willingness to support candidates over the current week. The Chairman is expected to report progress to an informal meeting of the General Council this evening.

"It is likely he will report that efforts to build consensus around one candidate are continuing. There may not be any significant developments tonight.

"We remain convinced that the New Zealand candidate, the Rt Hon Mike Moore, is the best candidate to lead the WTO.

"Mike Moore continues to enjoy strong levels of support across a wide range of WTO members, including developed and developing economies, and large and small countries from a broad geographical area.

"Mike has the best experience of GATT, WTO and international trade issues, and would be a strong voice for the WTO.

"I'm not discouraged by the delay in appointing the new Director-General. If anything, the delay reflects the WTO membership's acknowledgement that there are two very good candidates. We will continue to promote Mike Moore's strengths over the coming week", said Dr Smith.
