Biosecurity Minister John Luxton today rejected Jim Sutton's allegations that recent MAF interceptions of exotic mosquitos and gypsy moth at the border indicated a breakdown in our border protection service.

"In fact quite the opposite. It's as a result of increased vigilance that we are detecting these things in the first place."

"MAF operates a highly sophisticated and internationally recognised border protection service. Mr Sutton should get his facts right. No border protection service in the world offers 100% guarantee in preventing pest and disease entry. Even if we closed our borders, there would still be some things that arrived in the jetstream or migrated here as may well have happened with the current tropical grass web worm outbreak in Northland."

"Our border is a dynamic situation and risks are changing all the time. With growing trade and increasing tourist numbers each year, the level of risk has obviously grown, but so has MAF's ability to deal with it."

"The Ministry has a comprehensive border protection system involving offshore and border measures, post border surveillance, and the ability to respond rapidly to pest incursions. MAF's systems have made them world leaders."

The Biosecurity Act requires the development of pest management plans for each pest or disease deemed to pose a threat to New Zealand. The Act requires both 'exacerbaters' and 'beneficiaries' to participate and or pay for pest control programmes.

"New Zealand's clean green image offers many opportunities, but maintaining that image comes with a cost. "

"Labour's solution to everything is to keep throwing taxpayer money at it. The Government has a credible, affordable policy that actually works. Labour should come up with decent costed alternatives or stop scaremongering," Mr Luxton concluded.
