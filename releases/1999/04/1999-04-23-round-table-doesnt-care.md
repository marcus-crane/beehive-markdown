The New Zealand Business Roundtable demonstrates little concern for consumers by criticising Government plans to regulate against overcharging lines companies, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says. Mr Bradford confirmed this week he would soon take to Cabinet a proposal to impose tough, faster acting controls against lines companies exploiting their monopolistic position.

Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr has criticised the move, saying price controls never work.

Mr Bradford said today the Government was acting in the interests of consumers.

"For the life of me I can't understand how Mr Kerr can believe that self regulatory behaviour of monoplies is something that consumers can depend on.

"That is why we have the Commerce Act and the price control provisions within it, which will be the basis of any government regulation of the monoply lines businesses," Mr Bradford said.
