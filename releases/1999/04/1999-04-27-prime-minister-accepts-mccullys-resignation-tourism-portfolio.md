Today Murray McCully tendered his resignation from the Tourism Portfolio. "Last Thursday Mr McCully indicated to me he wished to take a few days off to reflect on the future for tourism in New Zealand, and how he could best serve that future," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said.

"He contacted me late this morning and made it clear that while he is passionate about the future of tourism, he believes it is the right time for me to appoint a new Minister of Tourism to pick up the reins of the global marketing strategy that the Tourism Board has been developing, and work with them to promote this strategy world wide.

"Tourism is very important to the New Zealand economy. I intend to see that we move ahead from this point with confidence. I have decided on the following course of action:

· I have accepted Mr McCully's resignation from the Tourism portfolio.

· Because the vital job of promoting tourism falls into two strands I have asked Mr McCully, as Minister for Sport, Fitness and Leisure, to retain Ministerial responsibility for the America's Cup and millennium events.

· I have asked International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith to become the Minister of Tourism. He has the ideal mix of skills and knowledge to pick up the global marketing strategy and make it work for New Zealand. His international knowledge and contacts, and his deep familiarity with trade issues, mean he is ideally placed to work for the best future for tourism in New Zealand, which are so important to New Zealand this year.

· I have had discussions with the Tourism Board chairman and I plan, in coming days, to work with the outgoing minister and the incoming minister to make appointments very soon to fill the three existing vacancies on the Tourism Board.

"Dr Smith is currently overseas and until he returns next week, Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech will be Acting Minister of Tourism."
