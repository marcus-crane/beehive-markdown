Health Minister Wyatt Creech said he was seeking further advice on the wider questions being raised about the identification of patients who may be at risk because of the actions of their doctors.

"A law change in mid 1996 requires Medical Practitioner Disciplinary Hearings to be open, and for the name of the doctor to be able to be published. This allows for the Medical Council to forward the name of the doctor to the relevant health authorities where there are concerns about patient care.

"I want to know from officials whether this process is working, and whether there is a gap under the old law for cases before mid 1996.

"I am seeking further advice on how best to ensure there are the mechanisms in place which allow patients to be followed up for further checks if that is required.

"In the current case relating to the actions of a North Island pathologist the first priority is to make certain everything that can be done is being done to identify any women who may be at risk to get further checks.

"I am advised by a number of experts that the Health Funding Authority has been, and is, taking the appropriate action in this regard. The health of these women should be our first priority and I am concerned to see that women receive the right health advice by the professionals who know best.

"I am concerned that women may be unnecessarily alarmed following some of the wild claims being made. Unfortunately all sorts of allegations are being thrown around. This matter requires thoughtful analysis of the facts to find solutions and I plan to seek further advice from health officials about the matter.

"In the meantime health authorities are getting on with the job of identifying women who may be at risk as a result of the actions of this particular pathologist."
