Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today launched the Ostrich and Emu Processing Standard, calling it another milestone for an industry that has had a number of success stories in a relatively short time.

"Ten years ago there was only one pair of emus in New Zealand. Today there are 15,000 emus on 150 emu farms. Five years ago the only ostriches in New Zealand, were the five zoo animals at Orana Wildlife Park. Today there are 20,000 birds and 520 ostrich farms. How time flies for a fledgling industry!"

Because ostriches and emus are not covered by the 1981 Meat Act, the industry sought advice from MAF staff on the development of a processing standard in preparation for the passing of the Animal Products Bill into law.

"The new processing standard is totally aligned with the objectives of the proposed Animal Products Bill. It also allows opportunities for high quality leathers, oils and other items to be exploited."

"The ultimate goal for both farmers and investors in the ostrich and emu industry is for their product to be enjoyed by New Zealand and overseas customers, and to be able to compete with other more established meats."

"Ostrich and emu meats are versatile and healthy products. They are a tender, lean red meat, high in iron, high in protein and with a National Heart Foundation 'tick' of approval. These qualities, and the food safety components in the standard will go a long way to helping the industry develop into a range of markets both domestic and ultimately overseas."

The standard is outcome focused and gives processors an opportunity to develop new techniques for processing within a framework of food safety outcomes.

"I commend the Ostrich and Emu Standards Council on their foresight in progressing this standard. It is a very positive step, especially for a new industry. It is this type of vision that guides an industry's development, and is further evidence of the entrepreneurship of New Zealand farmers," Mr Luxton concluded.
