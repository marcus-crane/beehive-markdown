Conservation Minister Nick Smith yesterday met with representatives of Te Runanga o Ngati Porou to progress negotiations to finalise the 1990 deal to return Mount Hikurangi into Ngati Porou ownership, while protecting public access to the mountain.

"This issue has been rumbling along for most of this decade and needs to be finalised. After today's meeting, both parties are hungry for agreement and are looking forward to working together co-operatively."

Chief Executive of the Runanga, Amohaere Houkamau, said "What was heartening about the meeting was the focus and general agreement on key principles, specifically ownership, control, and public access. Ngati Porou acknowledges the genuine intent of the Minister to conclude the negotiations as quickly as possible, while at the same time establishing the basis for a co-operative working relationship."

The meeting agreed to act immediately to finalise details of the land survey, protective covenant, public access arrangements and transfer of title. It is hoped to finalise these matters by mid-year.

Dr Smith said none of these are easy matters. "Ngati Porou are running a huge farming operation, and the public interest in access across the farm is growing each year. We need an agreement which protects both of these interests and reflects the significance of Mt Hikurangi to Ngati Porou and to all New Zealanders."
