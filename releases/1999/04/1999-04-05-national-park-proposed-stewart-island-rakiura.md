Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced the Government would initiate a formal investigation into a new National Park on Stewart Island by inviting the New Zealand Conservation Authority to report under Section 8 of the National Parks Act on the proposal.

"Stewart Island is a natural treasure chest, and the largest unspoilt forested island on earth. Its 164,000 hectares of forest include 585 different native trees and plants, and are critical to the survival of kiwi, yellow eyed penguin, little blue penguin, crested penguin, dotterel, bat, and weka, and its offshore islands for the kakapo and saddleback. The island is the only home for 28 species of plant and unique subspecies of kiwi, robin, kaka, weka and fernbird."

"90% of Stewart Island is public land, but it is managed by DOC under a confusing variety of over 30 different land and reserve status'. A National Park would reinforce Stewart Island's importance to conservation and enable the public lands to be managed under a single management system."

A National Park on Stewart Island was first suggested by the Stewart Island Promotions Group in 1997, and has been actively promoted by Southland MP Eric Roy. Prime Minister Jenny Shipley last year gave her backing to the idea.

Dr Smith met today with Stewart Islanders to discuss the proposal and outline the process for consultation. The Department propose that all public land above the mean highwater mark, including inshore islands, except Whenua Hoy (Codfish Island), be part of the investigation. All Maori land, including the Titi Islands, private land and public roads, would be excluded.

"Inclusion of the three large Maori blocks of land at Port Adventure, Lords River and Toi Toi, would be desirable but this can only occur with the owners agreement. The Government is currently negotiating with the Rakiura Maori Trust Board for a potential deal on the Lords River block, which would see the area permanently protected and managed as part of the National Park, but it's ownership remaining with Maori. The formal Section 8 investigation will exclude these areas."

Dr Smith said the first formal step in the process would be him writing this week to the New Zealand Conservation Authority requesting the investigation. This would be followed by consultation with iwi and the publication of a formal discussion document in June. Submissions would be invited through the months of July and August. The New Zealand Conservation Authority could make a recommendation to Cabinet before Christmas if all the issues have been resolved.

"On the eve of the new millennium, the world grapples with issues of overpopulation, pollution and species extinction. It would be tremendous for

New Zealand to set aside its third largest island for conservation this year as a permanent legacy for the new millennium. There is not a shadow of doubt that our children, and their children would thank us for it."
