The Health Minister today rejected claims that the National Breast Screening Programme was putting women's lives at risk.

"I am very concerned at the scare-mongering over women not being eligible for examinations through the breast screening programme," Mr Creech said. "Labour's comments are ill-informed and reveal they are prepared to put political interests ahead of patients' interests.

"Women with serious symptoms of breast cancer need the right treatment by the right person.

"If a woman has serious symptoms of breast cancer a screening programme is not the place to be. She needs a different clinical process which a screening programme is not designed to provide. She needs to see her doctor for a thorough examination and referral for the appropriate investigation.

"The right clinical processes, including free mammograms, are available in the public health system to help women with serious symptoms of breast cancer. "The National Breast Screening Programme is designed according to international best practice to ensure well women aged between 50 and 64 are checked regularly for breast cancer.

"It has been developed by health professionals with clinical and technical expertise who know how to ensure the programme succeeds in diagnosing women at a very early stage.

"The same approach is taken in Australia and the United Kingdom," Mr Creech said.
