The Chair of the Earthquake Commission, Neville Young, has been appointed to fill a vacancy on the Fire Service Commission, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder announced today.

The vacancy was created by the resignation of Doug Martin following his appointment as Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office last year.

Mr Elder said Mr Young, a Barrister and Solicitor, will bring valuable experience to the Fire Service Commission through his service on the Earthquake Commission, his legal background and as a Trustee of the National Provident Fund.

"Mr Young with his expertise in the governance of public organisations will help the Fire Service through its current problems," he said. "And, as the Government moves ahead with its comprehensive emergency management strategy, I see a certain synergy between the activities of the Fire Service and Earthquake Commissions."

Mr Young was President of the National Party between 1986 and 1989 but has not been actively involved at a senior level since then.
