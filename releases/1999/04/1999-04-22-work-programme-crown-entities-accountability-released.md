Finance Minister Bill English today released a programme of work the Government has underway to enhance the management of public organisations, particularly Crown entities.

"In his report released yesterday, the Auditor-General drew attention to Crown entity governance issues arising from his inquiry into the Tourism Board. The Government takes these concerns seriously and is speeding up a work programme which will:

clarify roles and responsibilities for managing Crown entity issues  
improve the process for selecting and inducting board members  
make better use of existing accountability instruments.

"This initiative will be led by the Minister of State Services, Simon Upton, and myself as Minister of Finance. We expect most of the work outlined in the Crown entities initiative work programme to be completed by the end of June.

"While there is certainly further work to be done in this area, the Government has not been ignoring this issue. In recent years a number of reviews and pieces of work have been done which further clarify governance issues around particular Crown entities. Some examples are:

Since 1996 directors of Hospital and Health Services have been given a Statement of Owner's Expectations by Shareholding Ministers, of which Governance and Accountability issues are at the forefront.

In late 1997 Cabinet approved a paper setting out the respective roles of the Ministry of Health and the Health Funding Authority.

the Tertiary Education Review White Paper, which outlines the Government's goals for tertiary education, was published in November 1998. The governance and accountability of tertiary education institutions is part of the Paper.

A review of the Foundation for Research Science and Technology Act and the Health Research Council Act was published in February this year. That review started in mid 1998 and looked at the Governance Framework amongst other issues. Submissions on that review closed last month and are now being analysed.

The governance of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation has been looked at in parallel with the work started early last year to introduce competition in the ACC scheme. This work was led by the Department of Labour and proposed changes are due to be implemented in conjunction with the 1 July start date.

A report on the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra was published in May 1996.

While this report arose out of funding issues, it also covered governance issues, including clarifying the Government's interests as Owner, Purchaser or Funder.

"In relation to the Tourism Board itself, the Auditor-General has found that confusing formal accountability arrangements made the relationship between the key players difficult. He has recommended that these issues be resolved quickly and that will certainly be followed through by the Government.

"There is no doubt in my mind that the Tourism Board Act made it extremely difficult for the Minister to extract the performance he expected from the Board in order to meet the accountabilities he has to Parliament. I think we are probably looking at some sort of change to the Act, but the Government will take further advice on that before making a final decision.

"There can be no question around the fact that Ministers have an obligation to form a view about the performance of a Government-appointed board and to act if he or she does not believe the board is performing to expectation. As a Minister of Health I spent a significant amount of my time putting pressure on the boards I was responsible for because their performance matters to the welfare of those people using hospitals.

"The power of dismissal is a key weapon in ensuring performance," said Mr English.
