"Jim Anderton's claims that deflation will lead to Superannuation cuts next year are malicious rubbish," said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

The legislation clearly states that while the CPI is used to work out increases in superannuation, under no circumstances can CPI cause their weekly payments to drop.

"This is the latest episode in the Labour-Alliance bloc's strategy of trying to terrify superannuitants and veterans into voting for the left."

"It's disgraceful that Mr Anderton is prepared to spread such utter nonsense when he knows full well NZ Superannuation can never be cut by the rate of CPI."

Mr Sowry called on Mr Anderton to apologise to the nearly half-a-million superannuitants and veterans who could be needlessly worried after his statements.

"A politician with integrity would correct his statements and put the minds of superannuitants at rest."
