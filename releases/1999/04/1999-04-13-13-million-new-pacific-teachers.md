Education Minister Nick Smith, at the opening of the "Educating Pasefika Positively" conference in Auckland, announced a new initiative to increase the number of Pacific teachers in the school sector.

"The Pacific rolls of our schools are burgeoning. There are currently 75,000 Pacific pupils and this is forecast to rise to 120,000 within 30 years. We need to ensure we have the diversity of teachers to match that change."

"There are only 350 Pacific teachers in New Zealand whereas, on a population proportionality, we would have 1300. Pacific teachers help improve educational outcomes by providing positive role models, and are more responsive to the needs and styles of learning of Pacific pupils. They also help by assisting other teachers meet the needs of their Pacific pupils."

Key parts of the initiative, aimed at increasing the number and proportion of Pacific teachers, include a targeted advertising campaign, face to face recruitment, and 35 Pacific TeachNZ scholarships to assist Pacific people who enter teacher training. $350,000 has been allocated in 1999/2000 for this initiative, increasing to $475,000 in 2000/2001 and to $512,000 in 2001/2002.

"This is only part of the Government's education strategy for Pacific people. There is a specifically targeted programme to provide career development for Pacific teachers, and a programme to assist and encourage Pacific school trustees. The Government is also working on early childhood education initiatives for Pacific families."

"I must also acknowledge the work of Government MP, Arthur Anae and the Mauri Pacific Party in supporting and encouraging this initiative. This Government is determined to invest in programmes that will reduce disparity."
