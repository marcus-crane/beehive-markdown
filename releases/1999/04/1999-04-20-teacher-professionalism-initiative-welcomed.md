Education Minister Nick Smith, in opening a Teacher Registration Board seminar today, welcomed the Board's initiative in taking the first step to develop a unified code of ethics for teachers.

"The quality of our education system is only as good as the person standing in front of the classroom. Almost without exception, our teachers have their pupils' interests at heart, put tireless hours into the job and are serious about their professional standards. However, we should not be shy of wanting to drive standards higher."

"We need to further develop the professionalism of teachers and have a unified code of ethics that matches other professional bodies. I do not believe that the current professional standards and regulatory controls reflect the importance of teaching to the future of our nation."

The workshop brings together about 30 people, representing some 15 different groups from the education sector. The aim of the seminar is to initiate a process for the development of a code of ethics for the entire teaching profession.

"I am keen to explore an expanded role for the Teacher Registration Board and welcome their first step along this road in developing a code of ethics. To date, the TRB has been very much a tool for determining the bottom line. The challenge for the TRB is to grow their role, not only to set the bottom line, but to recognise and encourage excellence."
