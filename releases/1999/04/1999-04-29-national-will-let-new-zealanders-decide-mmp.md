National plans to let New Zealanders have another say on how we elect MPs to Parliament, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley announced the party's position on MMP at the Wellington Divisional Conference of the National Party in Palmerston North.

"There has been a lot of public concern about whether the MMP system is delivering the best for New Zealanders and it is important that New Zealanders, not politicians alone, should have a say on the question," Mrs Shipley said.

At present it is proposed that a Parliamentary select committee will review the electoral system in 2002. But National believes the public and the Parliament should share this responsibility.

"It is also vital that we maintain New Zealand's strong international reputation for the security and quality of its electoral system.

"New Zealand has a strong reputation concerning how we run our economy and how we care for our people.

"Even though the Minority Government is currently delivering stable government and strong leadership in economic and political terms, there is still some doubt about whether we've got our electoral system right.

"International visitors and investors and many, many New Zealanders are uncertain about the future of our voting system.

"In order to guarantee public and international confidence that New Zealand can deliver ongoing stable government we must make it clear, once and for all, what system we as New Zealanders support, and then stick to it.

"We must either confirm the present MMP system, modify it, or choose an alternative.

"After long and extensive debate within the National Party, we have decided to let New Zealanders decide. We intend to hold two public referenda after a well-informed public debate about the options."

Under National's policy, the Government will hold two referenda. The first, which it is hoped would be held in early 2000, will allow voters to choose which system they want to "run off" against MMP. The referendum will centre on the choices offered in the 1992 referendum on the electoral system - the supplementary member system (SM), single transferable vote (STV), preferential voting (PV) and first past the-post (FPP).

A second referendum will run off the winner of the first referendum against MMP. It is National's intention that the winning system will be adopted for the 2002 election.

The Government will this year introduce legislation allowing postal voting for referenda. The legislation will give the option of postal votes for citizens' initiated referenda and other Government referenda.

"This is an important step, making it easier for people to have a say in big decisions. And it will save between $5 million and $8 million for each referendum," Mrs Shipley said.

As the referenda are held, the Government will consult with independent experts, as well as other parties in Parliament, on any issues that arise, including the implications of the separate, citizens' initiated referendum, to be held at this year's general election, on the question of reducing the number of MPs from 120 to 99.

"If that referendum is passed, it will have big implications for MMP and I want independent experts to examine them.

"I also want independent advisers to help consider any other changes we could make to MMP or any other system to allay voters' misgivings and help deliver maximum stability.

"It is vital that we have a well-informed debate and avoid knee-jerk reactions. The process National is proposing will ensure voters can make their final decision in the light of a full understanding of the options for MMP.

"National believes New Zealanders value stable government. They want Government to deliver improved security and prosperity for people. Able MPs and a sound electoral system that enjoys widespread public support are vital if we are to achieve this.

"We believe we should begin the new millennium taking hold of this issue, debating it thoroughly and settling it, once and for all," Mrs Shipley said.
