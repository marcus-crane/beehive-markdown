Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate arrives in New Zealand today to meet with Bougainville leaders, in New Zealand on a study tour, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said.

Mr McKinnon said the Prime Minister was taking the opportunity of meeting with all the various leaders of the different factions on Bougainville while they were gathered together in New Zealand.

"New Zealand welcomes this visit by Mr Skate, which will further help to cement the peace process in Bougainville.

"While the Bougainville Leaders are here on a study tour, they have of course been discussing the situation in Bougainville, and continuing to work through the challenges they face. It is therefore pleasing that Mr Skate has chosen to take some time out of his schedule to come to New Zealand to update himself on the issues faced by the Islanders."

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand is committed to a lasting peace, as well as sustained economic development, on Bougainville and would continue to assist the Islanders and the PNG Government to achieve that.

Mr Skate arrives at Auckland International Airport at approximately 1pm today.
