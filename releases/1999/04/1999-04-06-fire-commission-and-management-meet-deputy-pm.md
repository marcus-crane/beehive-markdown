The Fire Service Commission, the Chief Executive of the Fire Service, Jean Martin, and the National Commander, Ken Harper, held a brief meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister, Wyatt Creech, in the Executive Wing of Parliament this evening.

The Commission was given until 5pm today to provide the Government with additional information following its response to a written direction on March 25 from the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder. The direction, made under Section 13 of the Fire Service Act, required the Commission to provide a detailed programme of change to meet the Government's expectations on the Fire Service including timelines and how these changes will be managed and given effect to.

Mr Creech says officials will now analyse the information and Ministers will confer further tomorrow.

The other Ministers involved, Treasurer, Bill Birch, and Mr Elder were not in Wellington today.
