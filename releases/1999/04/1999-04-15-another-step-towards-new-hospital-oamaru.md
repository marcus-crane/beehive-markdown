Oamaru's new hospital will give the people of Waitaki confidence that when they need medical help they will get it from an accessible, modern, local hospital, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley unveiled the foundation stone for Waitaki District Health Services' new hospital in Oamaru today.

"Once built, this new hospital will provide a modern medical service in a healthier and safer environment.

"I am sure the district will welcome this and also the wonderfully accessible location.

"This new hospital is a great example of what can be achieved when a community has the confidence and vision to plan for the future, and take a lead role in what health services are offered in your area.

"I am pleased that the new hospital can now give the people of Waitaki the security of continuing hospital care in Oamaru. I am also thrilled to be laying the foundation stone. I well recall promising this new hospital would happen and I'm proud that, in partnership with the community and Government, we will now see this happen.

"As a rural Member of Parliament I know the importance to rural communities of knowing they can access quality healthcare services in their district, and this new hospital will provide just that," Mrs Shipley said.

The new hospital was made possible through the Government's Community Trusts Assistance Scheme which provided a suspensory loan of $5 million to Waitaki District Health Services Limited.
