Exporters and overseas travellers need to think carefully about the potential impact on their plans from Year 2000 (Y2K) problems, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has posted two Y2K advisories on its website and Mr McKinnon said the messages were timely reminders that New Zealanders could find their end-of-year plans disrupted no matter where they were in the world.

?The impact of Y2K problems will vary from country to country depending on each country?s readiness, but essential services such as power, water, transport, medical care, policing, finances, and telecommunications could be affected,? Mr McKinnon said.

?How widespread or long-lasting any such effects might be is unknown, so exporters and all New Zealanders planning to be overseas at the end of this year need to be aware that there could be potentially serious disruptions, and they should plan accordingly.?

The Ministry?s advisories suggests that all travellers should plan to be self-reliant if their plans are disrupted, because although New Zealand?s overseas posts will be providing emergency consular services, that help might also be constrained by local Y2K problems.

The business advisory recommends that exporters consider how potential Y2K problems offshore could affect business. A list of potential issues that exporters might wish to explore with overseas partners is included.

Mr McKinnon said detailed, country-specific Y2K information was hard to obtain and his Ministry was working with other Governments and international forums to assist where it could ?but only individual businesses can assess and respond to possible problems they might face?.

The Minister said APEC was providing a regional focus with a symposium on the trans-border impact of Y2K in key sectors, and contingency planning, to be held in Singapore on April 22 and 23. A report on the readiness of member economies had also been commissioned.
