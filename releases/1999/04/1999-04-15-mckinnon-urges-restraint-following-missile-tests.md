Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today expressed deep regret at the recent tests conducted by India and Pakistan of missiles capable of being armed with nuclear warheads.

"Such tests can only undermine regional stability", Mr McKinnon said. "I urge both India and Pakistan to avoid spiralling into a nuclear arms and missile development race."

On 11 April India announced that it had test-flown an Agni II ballistic missile with a range of 2500km. Pakistan tested its comparable Ghauri missile on 14 April.

Mr McKinnon noted that some positive moves had earlier been made by both countries in their bilateral relations: in February, the Indian Prime Minister had visited Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, met the Pakistani Prime Minister, and agreed to work towards easing tensions.

"The tests were particularly regrettable given these recent developments".
