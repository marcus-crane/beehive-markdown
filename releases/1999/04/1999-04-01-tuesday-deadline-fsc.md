The Government is giving the Fire Service Commission until next Tuesday to provide it with more information on how it plans to meet the demands of the direction issued to it on March 25 by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder.

"We have taken advice from the Solicitor-General, John McGrath and are moving with care, but we are still concerned to ensure that the requirements of the direction are met," Mr Elder said.

The Commission was directed under Section 13 of the Fire Service Act to provide a detailed programme of change to meet the Government's expectations on the Fire Service including timelines and how these changes will be managed and given effect to.

The Deputy Prime Minister, Wyatt Creech and Mr Elder met with the Solicitor-General, John McGrath this morning.
