Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will present a New Zealand Trade Development Board (TradeNZ) Export Commendation Award to Albany firm Flo-Dry Engineering during a visit to Auckland today.

Flo-Dry Engineering specialises in the design, production and servicing of meat by-product rendering plants, waste water treatment plants and odour abatement plants.

"I am pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate the management and staff of Flo-Dry Engineering," said Dr Smith.

"This award recognises Flo-Dry Engineering's ongoing commitment to innovation, quality and reliable after-sales service which have been central to the company's success in offshore markets including Australia, Chile and most recently, two contracts in India worth over five million dollars.

"The company was initially formed with two staff. It now provides 12 jobs, and all of these people are involved in the company's export operations.

"Flo-Dry Engineering provides another excellent example of a New Zealand firm succeeding in competitive international markets, and the strong contribution of exports to economic growth and employment in New Zealand," said Dr Smith.

The award ceremony is part of a broader itinerary for Dr. Smith on 14 April involving calls on companies from the manufacturing and electronics sectors as part of an ongoing programme of visits to New Zealand exporters.

Media are welcome to attend the award ceremony, which will be held at 3 p.m. at Flo-Dry Engineering, 10 Beatrice Tinsley Crescent, North Harbour Industrial Estate, Auckland.
