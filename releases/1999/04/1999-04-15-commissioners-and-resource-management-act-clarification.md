Environment Minister, Simon Upton, clarified an aspect of the use of commissioners under the RMA.

"Once a commissioner has been requested, the commissioner hearing would be arranged by the council. The person requesting the commissioner would have no ability to select the commissioner.

"There has never been any suggestion that the person requesting a commissioner would be able to choose the commissioner."
