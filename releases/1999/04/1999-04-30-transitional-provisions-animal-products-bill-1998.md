Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton, today announced the release of the transitional provisions for the Animal Products Bill 1998.

"These provisions allow for industries and existing businesses to come under the Animal Products Bill over a three year period."

"During the transition, the Meat Act 1981 and the Animal Products Bill will operate in parallel except in certain key areas where only one regime will operate. For example, a single regime will operate for export certification (official assurance under the new Bill), for cost recovery, and for homekill."

The transitional provisions are contained in an additional five Parts to the Bill. (summaries attached) The intention is for these Parts to be split out into a separate Ancillary and Transitional Provisions Bill during Parliament's consideration of the Animal Products Bill following its report back from Select Committee. This leaves the main Bill uncluttered by provisions that will effectively expire at the end of the three year period.

Ensuring a smooth transition to a single regime is an important objective of the transition provisions.

"These transitional provisions provide the all important link between the current system and the system for the future. It is vital the transition proceed smoothly in order that the international reputation of New Zealand is preserved, that access to foreign markets continues, and that our competitiveness remains high," Mr Luxton concluded.

The Supplementary Order Paper containing the transitional provisions has been referred to the Primary Production Select Committee and submissions are due by 24 May 1999.
