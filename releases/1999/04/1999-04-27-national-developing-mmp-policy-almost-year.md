National has been developing its policy on MMP for almost a year, Justice Minister Tony Ryall said today. "The issue was clearly signalled last June at National's Annual Conference in Auckland. There the Prime Minister referred to the public's general concern about opposition to the MMP system.

"Since then National's Electoral Reform Caucus Committee has been developing a policy on the issue. In the process they have carefully considered the pros and cons of possible options, and discussed these with the National Party.

"The conclusion we reached is that it should be up to the people of New Zealand to decide whether to retain MMP or go for an alternative system. Whatever the result, New Zealand needed certainty.

"According to a study released by Massey University yesterday, just two percent of New Zealanders strongly support MMP. This compares 54 percent who strongly dislike the system.

"That is an enormous amount of discontent with such a fundamental aspect of our system of Government.

"People deserve the chance to have their say on the issue, rather than leave the decision up to Parliament.

"Helen Clark's hysterical attacks on the Prime Minister over the issue can only be described as anti-democratic and arrogant. In her heart of hearts Helen agrees with us", Mr Ryall concluded.
