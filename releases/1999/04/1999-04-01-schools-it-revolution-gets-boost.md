Education Minister Nick Smith today announced that the Government would be investing $5 million, over the next two years, in 23 schools throughout New Zealand to lead the information technology revolution in our schools.

"Our children are growing up in a world dominated by information technology but many of our schools are not keeping pace. Amongst our schools we have everything from Star Trek to Horse Trek. We want to harness the talent in the Star Trek schools to spread the word of the information technology revolution to surrounding schools."

For this initiative, 23 schools, from Paihia School in Northland to St George School in Invercargill, will each receive a $115,000 per annum grant from the Ministry of Education to provide professional development, resources and support to more than 300 other schools.

"This programme is about upskilling our teaching professionals. Too often the focus of information technology is on computers, cabling and software. These are useless if the teachers don't have the knowledge and confidence to incorporate I.T. into their teaching programmes. This initiative will provide teachers with practical examples of how to use I.T. in the classroom."

The initiative is part of the Government's comprehensive information technology plan that includes investment in infrastructure, school capability and professional development. 100 workshops are planned for school principals, a major computer recycling scheme has been launched and a new online resource centre will be established. Further initiatives are in the pipeline.

"Information technology, alongside literacy, is a top priority for me this year. This is about a lot more than having a computer studies class. I.T. needs to become part of the student's experience in all learning areas."
