Defence Minister Max Bradford announced today that the Government has appointed retired Court of Appeal Judge, Sir Edward Somers, to review the case of five New Zealand soldiers executed for desertion or mutiny in Europe during World War I.

"The Government has agreed with the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee's recommendation that the most appropriate way to deal with a Private Members Bill on the issue is by way of an independent examination by someone outside of Parliament," Mr Bradford said.

Under the terms of reference, Sir Edward will report to the Minister of Defence on whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the executed men were suffering from shell shock or other stress-related disorder when they offended. The review will also consider whether insufficient account was taken of this before they were convicted and executed "such as to make the conviction and/or execution a miscarriage of justice."

If he finds sufficient evidence of a miscarriage of justice, Sir Edward will advise the Government on what action it might take in terms of practicality and the finality of judgements. He will also report on the implications of his recommendations on the cases of other 1NZ Expeditionary Force members convicted by court martial in similar circumstances but not executed.
