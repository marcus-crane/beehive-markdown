Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed an announcement by India's Ministry of Commerce that it will remove quantitative restrictions (quotas) on almost 900 tariff lines.

The initiative includes items of particular interest to New Zealand, such as dairy products, fruit (including apples), vegetables and fish.

"I'm delighted that India has made a decision to lift quotas on 894 tariff items.

This means new opportunities for New Zealand exporters," said Dr Smith.

"India is often overlooked as an export market, but we do this at a cost. India's importance and potential for New Zealand was reinforced during my recent visit in 1998. I realised then that we must do more to maximise the opportunity presented by a market of almost one billion consumers.

"I welcome the Indian Government's bold initiative to remove quotas across a broad range of products. Although tariffs remain on many products, the announcement is a step in the right direction.

The significance of one of the world's largest developing economies reducing trade barriers cannot be overlooked," said Dr Smith.

The announcement to remove quantitative restrictions takes effect from 1 April 1999. A full list of the changes can be obtained on the Internet at http://www.nic.in/eximpol/freed.htm
