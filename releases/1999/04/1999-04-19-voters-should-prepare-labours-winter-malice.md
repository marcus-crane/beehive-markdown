With Parliament resuming this week voters should brace themselves for "Labour's winter of malice" as the Labour-Alliance bloc steps up its scheme of personal denigration against the Prime Minister and the National Party, says SOE Minister Tony Ryall. "Labour-Alliance is even boasting about its election strategy based on personal attacks".

"Labour's scheme of personal attacks on the Prime Minister and National MPs is outlined in the April edition of Metro. In the magazine Labour strategists and Helen Clark talk of their plan to undermine the Prime Minister, and repeat the smear tactics seen during recent months.

'Helen Clark has brought more MPs' families into the public arena than any other member of Parliament.

"New Zealanders are revolted by the sort of grubby personal politics Labour-Alliance sees as pivotal to its election chances. New Zealanders would rather have policy not personal attacks.

"National on the other hand is intent on running a positive and forward looking campaign. After breaking the shackles of the coalition with NZ First, National has revitalised and regenerated. The National team lead by our new Prime Minister offers fresh ideas and innovative approaches.

'Labour-Alliance represents nine years and no new ideas' said Mr Ryall.

'Labour-Alliance are still fighting the class battles of yesteryear. The country has left them behind. New Zealanders want a positive, enthusiastic

future, not the grim and grubby style foreshadowed in Metro', concluded Mr Ryall.
