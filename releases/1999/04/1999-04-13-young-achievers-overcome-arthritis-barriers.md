"Young New Zealanders achieving in their lives deserve recognition. It is a double victory when the young person overcomes a disability against the odds. They deserve to be rewarded and celebrated and we are doing that here today," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said this afternoon.

Foundation Young Achievers Awards to five young New Zealanders at Parliament.

"These young people have tremendous strength and spirit. In their own quests to attain their individual goals they have struggled and coped with the daily challenges of a disability.

"Erica Sklenars, for example, is already showing her talent as an artist but often her hands are swollen with arthritis making her art very difficult. Despite Bronwyn Savage's arthritis getting progressively worse, she is determined not to let it get in the way of her desire to be a journalist.

"Ruth Craigie is a talented musician with a passion for the trombone, and refuses to let the arthritis which affects her hands and fingers get in the way of her playing and music study.

"Daniella Calkoen is currently one of only 22 people studying a Post Graduate Diploma in Social Work at Canterbury University, in spite of the challenges arthritis poses her.

"And although Melanie Sloan's arthritis has meant much time off school, she has still won school prizes for academic achievement, learned to drive, become a confident speaker and was this year appointed Head Girl at East Otago High School.

"The common thread in the lives of these five young achievers is that through their determination they have become role models in their schools, positive examples for others and advocates for other arthritis sufferers their age.

"These five young New Zealanders are providing inspiring role models not only to arthritis sufferers their age, but also to able bodied young people they meet.

"They are real examples of mind over matter, proving that if you want something bad enough you can overcome great odds to attain it, and that is an achievement worth celebrating," said Mrs Shipley.
