Minister of Social Services, Work and Income, Hon Roger Sowry, today said that he expects the Department of Work and Income (WINZ) to pursue any debt where it has been established.

Mr Sowry was referring to comments made by the Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Tau Henare, that he owes money to the Department for overpayment of benefit.

"Wherever there is a debt, I expect WINZ to recover that debt regardless of the standing or financial circumstances of the individual.

"Personally, I would encourage Mr Henare, as I would any other person, to pay back the debt," Mr Sowry said.
