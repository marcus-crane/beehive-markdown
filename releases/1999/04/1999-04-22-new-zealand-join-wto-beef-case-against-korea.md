Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has announced that New Zealand will participate in Australia's World Trade Organisation (WTO) consultations with Korea over its beef import regime.

Speaking from Iran, Dr Smith noted Korea's earlier commitment to liberalising access to its beef market, but warned it was important that issues such as restrictions on retail sales of imported beef did not unfairly discriminate against imported product.

"Korea offers considerable potential for the New Zealand Meat Industry. We have a strong interest in ensuring that our beef producers have fair and unrestricted access to the Korean market," said Dr Smith.

Australia's decision to request consultations in the WTO with Korea follows an earlier similar request from the United States in February. New Zealand also took part in those consultations.

Exports of New Zealand beef to Korea averaged 18,000 tonnes between 1994 and 1997, when exports were valued at $37.99 million. But exports fell considerably last year due to the Asian Economic Crisis. In the year ended June 1998, provisional figures show New Zealand's beef exports to Korea were valued at $21.78 million.
