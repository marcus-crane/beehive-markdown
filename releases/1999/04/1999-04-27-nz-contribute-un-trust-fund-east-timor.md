New Zealand will make an initial contribution of $380,000 to a newly established UN Trust Fund for East Timor, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon and Associate Minister Simon Upton announced today.

The Fund has been set up to cover the costs associated with preparing for a UN- supervised ballot of East Timorese on the question of autonomy, and to support the placement on the ground of UN officials who will manage the process.

'East Timor faces a particularly challenging period in the lead up to these consultations. It is crucial that all parties work constructively with the United Nations to ensure that a ballot can take place in a free and fair environment.

To this end the New Zealand Government fully backs the central role the United Nations has in brokering an agreement and organising the ballot and is fully committed to supporting its efforts.'

The UN is planning to place a small UN team on the ground as soon as possible the Ministers said.

'New Zealand will continue to send development assistance to the territory, building on the assistance provided to date which is mainly in the area of human resource capacity building and community development. We will work with UN agencies, NGOs and other donors. We are also looking at future assistance such as the provision of election expertise and monitors," the Ministers said.

The Trust Fund will rely on voluntary contributions from donors. New Zealand's initial contribution will be funded from New Zealand's Official Development Assistance (NZODA) Programme.
