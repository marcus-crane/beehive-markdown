Conservation Minister Nick Smith today visited the proposed site of the Te Tapuwae O Rangokako Marine Reserve, near Gisborne, and met with key supporters and opponents of the reserve.

"New Zealand has a huge challenge in marine conservation. We have set aside over 30% of our land area for nature's sake, but less than one tenth of 1% of our marine environment. I am a strong advocate of the need for marine reserves and the purpose of my visit is to establish whether this proposal is a sound one."

The proposed Te Tapuwae O Rongokako Marine Reserve is situated on the East Coast between Pouawa and Waiomoko Rivers, 16km north of Gisborne. The proposed reserve extends along approximately 6 kilometres of coastline and a distance offshore of 3 kilometres. The proposed marine reserve is 20 minutes' drive from Gisborne, with vehicle access to the beach near Pariokonohi Point.

"I want to carefully consider the submissions of recreational and commercial fishermen, and thoroughly discuss the proposal with the applicants. It is particularly significant that Iwi are the joint applicants, which speaks volumes for their kaitiaki role on this coastline."

The application for the marine reserve was advertised in July 1998 and attracted 395 submissions. The application was forwarded to Dr Smith for his consideration. He has subsequently asked consultants for an independent review of the process. Dr Smith said that he would carefully reflect on the submissions and his visit before making a final decision.

"Marine conservation will be one of the most difficult challenges of the new millennium. It would be both symbolic and significant for Gisborne, as the first city to see the light of the 21st century, to establish a new marine reserve. However, the proposal has to stack up to the requirements of the Act, and have strong community support."
