Trade Minister Lockwood Smith is seeking public comment to assist the Government in formulating New Zealand's approach to new multilateral trade negotiations.

World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations on trade in agriculture and services are due to start at the end of 1999. The WTO members will also decide later this year whether to launch a new round of comprehensive negotiations, which would cover a broader range of trade issues.

"These multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO would be critically important for New Zealand," said Dr Smith.

"Trade in goods and services accounts for 30 percent of New Zealand's economic activity. Increasing access for our products through the WTO means more jobs, and increased prosperity for New Zealanders.

"As we move toward a new WTO negotiating round, we must be sure that we have identified the opportunities and risks for New Zealand, and that we're well placed to promote our national interests," said Dr Smith.

"I'm sure that New Zealanders will have views on the new WTO round, and I want to make sure that these are taken into account as we develop New Zealand's approach.

"Trade negotiations are often perceived as a closed shop. I'm keen to encourage wider participation as we formulate our approach to the WTO round, and my officials are currently consulting with the private sector, Maori and other interested groups across the country. This invitation for public comment is an extension of that process," said Dr Smith.

The deadline for receipt of submissions is 14 May 1999. Submissions should be addressed to the Director, Trade Negotiations Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Private Bag 18-901, Wellington.

Further information on the WTO and a new round of negotiations is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Web site at: http://www.mft.govt.nz/foreign/wto.html
