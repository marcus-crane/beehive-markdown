"Dr Cullen as usual has no idea what he is talking about, because he hasn't bothered to do his homework," Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"Clearly Dr Cullen has not taken the trouble to read his morning newspaper or the original Treasury working paper. If he had he would have been clear that the Government is not considering Monetary Union"

"The Government remains committed to an independent Reserve Bank, and it is neither practical nor desirable to consider any form of Monetary Union," Mr Birch said.

"If Dr Cullen had bothered reading the Treasury working paper, before rushing into print, he would have seen the work is a Treasury thinkpiece that draws no policy conclusions nor proposes any course of action. To quote from the first page of the Treasury paper:

"It must be stressed that the paper is a review of the modern international literature examining economic integration and monetary union rather than an assessment of the cost and benefits of New Zealand forming a monetary union with another country".

"The Government has made it absolutely clear that Monetary Union is not on its policy agenda, and Dr Cullen's views on the matter are irrelevant as New Zealand voters will never elect him to the Treasury benches," said Mr Birch.
