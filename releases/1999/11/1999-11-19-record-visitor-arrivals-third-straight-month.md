"New Zealand's strong growth in international visitor arrivals is continuing with visitor numbers reaching a new all time high for the third straight month" Tourism Minister, Hon Lockwood Smith, said today.

For the year ended October 1999, there was an eight percent increase on the previous year, and with almost 1.58 million visitors coming in the last twelve months, tourism is continuing to perform as New Zealand's biggest foreign exchange earner.

"New Zealand is reaping the benefits of having had a huge international profile over the past months, and combined with the Tourism Board's 100% Pure campaign, it is obvious that New Zealand's international profile is extremely positive", said Dr Smith.

The 88 percent increase in visitor arrivals from China is an indication that our recent approved destination status is having a positive effect. Arrivals from all Asian countries showed a 29 percent increase for the month.

"With our very favourable exchange rate, and ease of access due to most countries having visa-free status, New Zealand is a very attractive visitor destination. However, I strongly agree with the Tourism Industry Association, that to continue this positive growth, New Zealand needs political stability and an environment that allows tourism to flourish".

"The 113,192 extra international visitors received in the year to October 1999 represent an extremely valuable outcome for New Zealand. It is estimated that this growth will inject nearly $300 million into the economy and will support the creation of at least an additional 4000 new jobs. Tourism, and the benefits it brings to New Zealand, cannot afford the Labour/Alliance bloc plans to reverse ACC reforms and repeal the Employment Contracts Act", said Dr Smith.
