"As someone responsible for coalition management and Leader of the House, I know that the Greens position as outlined by Ms Fitzsimons today would only lead to instability."

"It shows any Labour-Alliance-Green coalition would be fundamentally unstable," said Roger Sowry.

Labour and the Alliance have signed a non-aggression pact (similar to that which the Soviet Union signed in 1970s) to enable them to campaign together.

"But the Greens have not been part of this agreement. Voters need to know Labour-Alliance-Green coalition is a recipe for disaster."
