"Labour has held more positions on the rimu contracts in the last month than a circus contortionist," says Associate Food and Fibre Minister David Carter.

"It's time they fronted up and clarified what their policy is regarding these legitimate contracts."

"Just two weeks ago Labour claimed the rimu contracts were unenforceable. Then last week Labour admitted legal advice had clarified that the contracts were legally binding."

"I quote Dr Michael Cullen on RNZ : 'We are not in the least pleased that those contacts have been signed...but that doesn't alter the legal facts."

"Now, in a letter to Native Forest Action, Dr Cullen says Labour will end the eight-year rimu contracts early, if it can legally do so."

"Labour are running around like chooks with their heads cut off. They don't know which direction to run in, and week by week their story keeps changing, depending on the audience."

"Their own West Coast MP Damien O'Connor has threatened to cross the floor of the House to ensure Labour honours these legitimate contracts."

"What will they do to stop him? Sack him under their planned anti-defection laws and replace him with a more compliant yes-man?"
