New Zealand will contribute $150,000 to Red Cross flood relief work in central Vietnam, Acting Foreign Minister, Hon Simon Upton, announced today.

"New Zealand has long-standing linkages with the provinces of central Vietnam which are among Vietnam's poorest and which have suffered the worst flooding in 100 years," Mr Upton said. "Several hundred people have died, and hundreds of thousands have lost their homes and crops, leaving 85 percent of the population without any form of livelihood."

"The New Zealand contribution will be channelled through the International Federation of the Red Cross which has played a major role in the relief effort since disaster struck. The IFRC will also assist with the reconstruction process of the affected area over the next few months," Mr Upton concluded.
