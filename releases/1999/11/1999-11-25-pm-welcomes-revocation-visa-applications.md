Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today the Acting Minister of Immigration has advised her that he has taken action to rescind the residency applications of Chinese investors, approved by former Immigration Minister Tuariki John Delamere.

Mr Delamere approved permanent residence for the investors on the basis that they would invest in specific Maori projects. In doing so, he was establishing a precedent that the Prime Minister was not prepared to tolerate. He knew this prior to granting approval.

"Mr Creech acted immediately on my request early last evening and, based on the advice of the Crown Law Office and the Immigration Service, he has taken action to rescind the approvals."

The Prime Minister again made clear that New Zealand has one law for all and she would not tolerate actions that favoured one group of people above others, nor would she allow Ministers to use their statutory powers to promote preferential treatment on the basis of being Maori.

"We have one law for immigration and investment. Any change to the law or current practice, in terms of the Ministerial discretion, must be considered by the Cabinet in the appropriate way," Mrs Shipley said.
