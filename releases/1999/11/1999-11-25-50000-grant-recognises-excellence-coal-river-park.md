Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith today announced a grant of $50,000 to the Greymouth Heritage Trust towards the development of Coal River Park.

The Park will highlight a key element of the West Coast's unique history and will link with other tourism facilities in Greymouth, such as the Visitor Information Centre, the Left Bank Art Gallery (which contains the New Zealand Pounamu Jade collection), the History House Museum and the Port itself.

"This Park will contribute strongly to the tourist ‘precinct' that is now well established in downtown Greymouth," Dr Smith said.

"The grant will fund the development of the Coal River facility as the first of four parks to be developed to reflect the waves of influence that shaped the West Coast economically and politically. These parks will make an important contribution to recording the social history of the West Coast, which has played such a key role in shaping modern New Zealand," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith said that the Coal River Park development will transform derelict land and buildings, alter the existing wharf to improve access for public use, as well as enhancing the passenger wharf as a base for river and sea tourist operations. Heritage features such as railway tracks and coal hopper railway wagons will also be placed on the site to reflect its history.

"The Greymouth Heritage Trust is to be congratulated for developing this project and for preparing an outstanding application," Dr Smith said.

"I'm confident that the level of commitment and professionalism shown by the Trust and its partners, including the Grey District Council, will ensure that the project will be a success," Dr Smith concluded.
