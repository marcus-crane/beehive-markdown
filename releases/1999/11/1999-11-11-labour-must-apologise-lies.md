TVNZ has upheld both aspects of the National Party's formal complaint about the advertisement that opened Labour's election campaign. TVNZ has ruled it was inaccurate and misleading.

"For a week now we've been asking Helen Clark to come clean on their campaign opening, and Helen Clark and Pete Hodgson consistently refused to budge.

"Helen Clark used taxpayer-funded broadcasting time to mislead voters. She should use the same amount of Labour's free allocation of time to put things right - that means confessing and apologising."

"This comes on top of the Prime Minister's call this afternoon for Helen Clark to tell the truth on other issues - like funding health care."
