Six months into the new driver licensing regime and after more than 1 million photo licences have been issued, we've seen a dramatic reduction in disqualified driving figures, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

"Reported offences for driving while disqualified in the first six months of the new regime were down by 24 percent on the same period last year."

"These figures show that the tough new laws where disqualified drivers lose their cars for 28 days are working by deterring serious traffic offenders from our roads."

For the six months from May until October 1998, 6666 offences for driving while disqualified were reported, while the figure for the same period this year fell to 5060.

"The whole aim of the new regime and the introduction of the tough new roadside sanctions was to get these drivers off the roads, and six months on, we're getting the results we wanted."

"Although the figures are still too high, they show that disqualified drivers are getting the message that if they continue to offend, they'll lose their car."
