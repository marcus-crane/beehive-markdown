Arts allowances are bureaucratic and another example of Labour's stifling hands-on policy that would smother inspiration and creativity, Hon Marie Hasler Minister for Culture and Heritage said.

"National doesn't see artists as beneficiaries, we see them as people out their working in their chosen profession," Ms Hasler said in response to Labour's arts policy released today.

"The idea for art allowances is a plot straight from a Franz Kafka novel. The protagonist going from one official to another in order to gain recognition as an artist.

"The irony of the situation is, Kafka combined working as an insurance manager with an extraordinary career as a novelist.

"What this suggested policy would do is set up one artist against another. Who would approve which artists should get an allowance, would it be another artist or a WINZ official?

"With WINZ officials consulting established artists as to whether or not an applicant is genuine would empower officials and not the artists.

"It often takes years to become established as an artist and it is naive to think a one year hand-out enough.

"National won't be picking favourites. National believes that artists know what's best for the sector, not politicians and not bureaucrats."
