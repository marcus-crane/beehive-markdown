Mrs Claire Elder, wife of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, died in Auckland yesterday after a long battle with cancer. She was 49.

Mrs Elder, a former schoolteacher, had been with Mr Elder for almost 20 years. They have one son, Edward, aged 13.

"Claire was a reluctant politician's spouse but she always helped me, while making strenuous efforts to avoid publicity herself," Mr Elder said.

"On behalf of Edward and myself I would like to thank the nurses, doctors and staff at St Joseph's Hospice and our many friends, relatives and political colleagues who have offered help and support through this difficult period."
