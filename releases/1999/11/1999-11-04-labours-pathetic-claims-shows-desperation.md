Helen Clark and Steve Maharey's responses to more jobs and falling unemployment are just pathetic, Statistics Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

"First Labour's leader tries to explain away 4,000 more jobs being created in New Zealand over the last quarter by saying everyone's going to Australia.

"Then Steve Maharey tries to claim the figures are politically biased. That is an unbelievable claim.

"The Household Labour Force Survey is a standardised international survey conducted by Statistics NZ. The Government Statistician has statutory independence. He is a man of integrity and accusing him of political bias is both ignorant and arrogant.

"The first time the Government saw these employment figures was when it was briefed at 10.30 this morning - the same time as the media."

"Labour are so desperate for bad news they will make up anything."
