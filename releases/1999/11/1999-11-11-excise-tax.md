Border Control Minister John Luxton, today announced a small increase to the rates of excise duty on tobacco products.

"This normal annual adjustment to the rates, based on the 1.105 percent increase in the Consumers Price Index All Groups - Excluding Credit Services in the 12  
months ending 30 September 1999, would add four cents in excise duty to a packet of 20 cigarettes and 13 cents on a 50 gram packet of cut tobacco", Mr Luxton  
said.

The new excise rates, which come into force on 1 December, will raise approximately an additional $6 million for Government in a full year.
