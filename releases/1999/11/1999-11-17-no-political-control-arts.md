Running arts and culture from the Prime Minister's office would debase the whole portfolio, Hon Marie Hasler Minister for Culture and Heritage said today.

"The portfolio cannot be used as an instrument of political control as Helen Clark seems to think, but on the other hand the extensive nature of it requires more than just attending opera concerts," Ms Hasler said.

"The arts in New Zealand have flourished over the past decade.

"National's arms-length policy, respecting artistic freedom, has created the right environment for this to occur without political interference."
