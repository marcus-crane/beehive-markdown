Minister of Women's Affairs Georgina te Heuheu today said she had been surprised by the effective dumping of two high profile and effective women Members of Parliament recently.

"I'm sure NZ First leader Winston Peters will feel a backlash of women voters in Tauranga," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Robyn McDonald and Jenny Bloxham from NZ First were part of a growing number of women within parliament providing a much-needed women's perspective. Many women have seen their demotion as a slight against the contribution and effective representation of all women," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Robyn did a fantastic job within the Maori Affairs and Justice and Law Reform Select Committees. She brought an informed approach to debate in the house and her contribution was highly valued," Mrs te Heuheu said.

A recent TV One Colmar Brunton poll put National's Katherine O'Regan ahead of Winston Peters in the Tauranga seat.

"Katherine is a well respected and effective Member of Parliament. Her winning of the Tauranga seat on November 27 may give women the final say," Mrs te Heuheu concluded.
