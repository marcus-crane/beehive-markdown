Helen Clark should tell New Zealanders the truth - the first thing a left-wing government has to do is put up taxes, Treasurer Bill English said today.

"Ms Clark's list of things she would do by Christmas is as dishonest as Labour's junked election ads.

"Dr Cullen's budget sets out in detail that Labour would collect $800m more in tax then National. To achieve that, Ms Clark has to pass legislation for  
higher taxes before Christmas.

"Her message to New Zealand families is that they are not working hard enough yet. Labour's plans would mean more for the government, less for families.  
Before Christmas our talented young people and our growing businesses would get the message that Labour wants to make it harder for them.

"But Ms Clark has not got the courage to be honest with New Zealand. If Dr Cullen's numbers are right, the first thing Labour must do is put up taxes.

"What the country is going to need in the next six months is action, honesty and leadership. The best we have seen from Ms Clark is a do-nothing, be-nothing campaign focussed on maintaining Labour's non-aggression pact with the Alliance. which would expire on November 28th

"MMP is about compromise, but its also about courage. Helen Clark's statements today misleading the public show her lack of courage on a key issue.

"Jenny Shipley is the only leader who has demonstrated capacity to stand up for stable government. She had the courage to put her job on the line and end the coalition with New Zealand First in the interests of good and stable government," said Mr English.
