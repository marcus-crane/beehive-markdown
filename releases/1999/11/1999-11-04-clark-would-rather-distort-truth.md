Minister of Social Services, Work and Income, Roger Sowry, is appalled at Helen Clark's complete disregard for the circumstances of a beneficiary used in Labour's election advertisement screened on television on Friday night.

"Helen Clark was aware of this woman's circumstances. Ms Clark could have helped her to ensure she received all her entitlements. Instead Ms Clark used her in a tv ad to mislead the New Zealand public."

"I have asked Helen Clark to provide me with all the details of this woman's particular circumstances so if there is a genuine problem I can fix it. Helen Clark told me to dream on", Roger Sowry said.

"It would appear that Helen Clark is more interested in distorting the truth than helping people in need".
