"Is there another full moon?" HNZ Minister, Tony Ryall, asked today. "Labour Housing Spokesman, Graham Kelly's, latest ‘revelation' is that Housing New Zealand uses private property managers to help improve service, reduce rents, and increase occupancy rates."

"Of course, the former HNZ Minister announced this in October 1998 saying ‘the majority of the 2,400 Housing New Zealand properties currently vacant would be placed with private sector letting agents'.

"The initiative is also discussed in HNZ's Annual Report. Still, better late than never Graham.

"To put the record straight - so that even Mr Kelly can understand it - HNZ has placed a number of properties in the hands of private agents for them to manage on HNZ's behalf.

"By using their local knowledge and experience, private managers have reduced vacancy rates in many hard to let properties and reduced rents.

"We think that's a good thing.

"The properties are not sold to the private agencies, they only manage them. And, the agencies are required to follow social objectives similar to those in HNZ's Statement of Corporate Intent.

"My guess is Labour leader - and former Housing Minister - Helen Clark, is putting the acid on Mr Kelly for his ineffectiveness in Housing, and his total lack of vision for public housing in the next century.

"His ideas on meeting the needs of low-income families are more suited to walk-shorted-roman-sandaled 1970's civil servants than they are to a modern society looking toward to the next chapter for public housing," said Mr Ryall.
