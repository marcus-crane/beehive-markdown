"Government will ensure the health needs of children of Vietnam or Operation grapple Veterans are supported," Veteran's Affairs Minister Don McKinnon said today.

Mr McKinnon said the Government has accepted the recommendations of a report by the Advisory Committee on the Health Status of Vietnam and Operation Grapple veterans. The report was presented to Government in June 1999.

The advisory committee recommends that, based on scientific evidence, children of Vietnam and Operation Grapple veterans whose health is affected by their parents' exposure to chemicals or radiation during service, have access to medical treatment and social care.

It also recommends a programme of special assistance involving case management, genetic and family counselling.

Mr McKinnon said programmes to support these recommendations will be administered by the Office of Veterans' Affairs.

Veterans' Affairs will also be responsible for development and monitoring of the register of Operation Grapple and Vietnam veterans' children; establishing a research capability to provide information on the health of veterans' children; provision of information and training for health professionals and others who work with children of veterans, and adoption of a case management approach to veterans' children.

"Cabinet has directed the office of Veterans Affairs to fully investigate the financial and management implications of the recommendations and report back to Government by May 2000."
