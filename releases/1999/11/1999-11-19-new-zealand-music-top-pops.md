New Zealand musicians have taken seven positions in the latest New Zealand Top 50 singles' chart, including the coveted number one spot for Deep Obsession with One & Only, Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage said today.

"This good news reflects New Zealanders' increasing appreciation for local music," Ms Hasler said.

"Currently New Zealand artists hold six positions in the NZ Top 50 albums' chart and earlier this month five New Zealand artists has their albums in the top 20 chart. This is also the third time Deep Obsession have been in the number one singles' spot.

"In recent years, new musicians such as Bic Runga and bands including The Feelers, Shihad, Garageland, Stereobus, and Stellar\*, are proving to be a strong force in the New Zealand music scene.

"I believe the continued exposure and success of local music hinges on the creativity and talent of local musicians. Creativity and talent cannot be regulated for and neither can we legislate for creativity with the establishment of a welfare state for musicians.

"The destiny of the local music industry lies ultimately in its own hands and should not be determined by what the Government thinks is best for it.

"The National Government has demonstrated its support for the music industry by providing funding of $400,000 over two years for the establishment of a Music Industry Forum.

"This leg-up complements our ongoing support for the promotion of New Zealand music via NZ On Air. This support will not be diminished," Ms Hasler said.
