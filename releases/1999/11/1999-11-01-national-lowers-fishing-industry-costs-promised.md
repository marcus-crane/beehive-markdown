Fisheries Minister, Hon John Luxton, today announced that Cabinet had approved a $4.8 million reduction in cost recovery levies for the fishing industry. Mr  
Luxton also confirmed that the changes to the fisheries cost recovery rules would be backdated to 1 October 1999.

Today's decisions follow consultation with approved stakeholders on rules provisionally approved by Cabinet on 23 August 1999. The rules are based on  
recommendations made by a joint working group of the Ministry of Fisheries, Treasury, industry and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission.

"Cost recovery has been a bone of contention between industry and Government since 1994. National has delivered on its commitment to implement a fairer  
regime and I am pleased that we have achieved a good result by working constructively together."

"The changes will allow an already thriving industry to further build on its success as New Zealand's fourth largest export earner," Mr Luxton said.

Consultation will now begin on the specific details of each levy, with a view to the new regime being in place by 1 December 1999.
