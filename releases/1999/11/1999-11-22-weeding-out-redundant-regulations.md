Twenty-one regulations in the Commerce and Labour portfolios have been axed as part of a National Government initiative to cut red tape, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford announced today. The regulations have been repealed by Cabinet at Mr Bradford’s request.

“Some of the regulations are nearly 60 years old and cover such things as provision for carless days. Their axing is the first step in a major clean out of the Government’s books, that will reduce red tape and compliance costs,” he said.

As part of the Bright Future package announced in August, the Government initiated a stock-take of Government legislation with the aim of cutting regulations by up to 25 per cent.

All Departments were surveyed and returns are being processed. Officials expect to be in a position to recommend the repeal of many other redundant Acts and regulations shortly.

The stock-take also identified areas of legislation requiring further review.

Mr Bradford said many of the recommended changes arising from these reviews would be incorporated into the Compliance Cost Reduction Bill, which he expected to introduce to Parliament towards the end of next year.

“The National Government sees it as essential that we continue to monitor the stock of legislation to weed out redundant laws, review any problem areas, and amend legislation demonstrated not to be working well.

“This is vital if we are to keep our laws up-to-date, minimise compliance costs, and ensure a regulatory environment best suited to meeting the needs of the community.

“It is in stark contrast to Labour’s policies, which would increase the size of government, leverage more taxes to pay for it, and impose more costs on businesses and families.

“In the last few months alone Labour has promised to create 166 more Ministers, Ministries, Offices and Commissions as it tries to bribe voters.

“What Labour hasn’t told voters is how it would pay for this expensive new layer of bureaucracy,” Mr Bradford said.
