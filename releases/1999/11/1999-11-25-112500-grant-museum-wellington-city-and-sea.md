Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith today announced a grant of $112,500 to the Museum of Wellington, City and Sea. The grant will be directed towards one of the Museum's signature displays, known as the 'Creation Legend' feature, which opens to the public on Saturday.

"The Creation Legend feature uses modern day technology to tell two Maori legends, one of the creation of Wellington Harbour by the taniwha Whataitai and Ngake, and the other of how Maui found fire," said Dr Smith.

"This innovative use of new technology to tell cultural legends will make a lasting impression on international visitors to the Museum and will help them gain an appreciation of New Zealand's unique cultural heritage.

"The Museum is an superb additional asset to the arts and culture aspect of tourism for which Wellington has become internationally recognised.

"As well as providing an enjoyable and educational facility, the Wellington Museums Trust is preserving one of Wellington's historic buildings, the old Bond Store. This development of an historic building for tourism purposes is an excellent way of protecting our history while incorporating the technology of the future to tell our stories," Dr Smith said.

Dr Smith said that the Museum has now secured over ninety five percent of the $12.6 million cost of redevelopment.

"I congratulate the Museum on its success in achieving such a significant goal, and also welcome its decision to levy a modest charge for entry in order to maintain the facilities, therefore ensuring their sustainability for future generations," Dr Smith concluded.
