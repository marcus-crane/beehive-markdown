New Zealand's next Ambassador to Spain will be career diplomat Christine Bogle, Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton announced today.

Mr Upton said Spain had shown increasing interest in this part of the world in recent years, and New Zealand was keen to take the relationship further.

"Trade between us has grown considerably in the last five years," Mr Upton said. "Spain is a key economy in the EU; it is one of the largest consumers of seafood in the world, and a valuable market for our product. It is also taking an increasing amount of our kiwifruit, as well as lamb and dairy products."

Ms Bogle, a Spanish speaker, has previously served overseas in Lima and in Rome, where she was Deputy Head of Mission from 1992 to 1996. She joined the Foreign Ministry in 1977 and is currently Acting Director of the Foreign Ministry's International Security and Arms Control Division. She has three children.

Ms Bogle will take up her appointment early in 2000, and will also be accredited to Morocco and the Holy See. She replaces Wilbur Dovey, who will return to Wellington.
