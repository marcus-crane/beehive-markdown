"The mystery surrounding Labour Party President Bob Harvey's trip to the UK to meet with Tony Blair's campaign advisers has now been solved," according to Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

A few weeks ago Bob Harvey was sent away for a few weeks to the UK in an attempt by the Labour Party to keep him from further embarrassing the party.

"We now know what it is that Bob was doing in the UK. He was picking up a copy of the Blair election campaign manual for Helen Clark," said Mr Sowry.

"Helen Clark continues with her predictable Blair copycat routine. Two weeks before the 1997 election in Britain, the British Labour Party suggested that the Conservative Government was about to cut pensions.  
Today, less than two weeks out from the election, Ms Clark comes out with the suggestion that National is considering cuts to superannuation.

This is untrue and is a deliberate attempt by Ms Clark to mislead superannuitants.

"Helen Clark also suggests that National is 'hiding behind' the Superannuation 2000 taskforce. This is complete and utter nonsense, which would be immediately apparent if the Labour Party took part in the independent taskforce which is committed to finding a solution to sustainable retirement income.

"Dare I suggest to the Labour Party that it is about time it stopped playing silly political games with the very serious issue of superannuation," said Mr Sowry.
