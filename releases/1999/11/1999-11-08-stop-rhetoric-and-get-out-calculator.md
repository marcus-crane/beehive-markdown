Treasurer Bill English said today Dr Cullen had so far failed to release to the country his Budget for Labour's spending plans.

"It's time Dr Cullen moved on from the rhetoric and got out his calculator.

"We know that he is going to take $800 million extra tax from New Zealanders. What we don't yet know is which of Labour's 176 uncosted promises he's going  
to pay for and which he's going to dump.

"Dr Cullen promised to come up with Labour's spending plans after he saw the pre-election fiscal update. That was two and a half weeks ago.

"He has managed to put out plenty of press statements in that time, but we're still waiting for some numbers.

"Even today Dr Cullen is accusing Winston Peters of being a snake oil merchant for refusing to tell New Zealanders what he's trying to sell them. Dr Cullen should look in the mirror before making statements like that," said Mr English.
