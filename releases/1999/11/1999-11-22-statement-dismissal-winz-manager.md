Associate Work and Income Minister Peter McCardle said the severance payment to a senior WINZ manager was properly authorised. He was notified of it last  month and approved it after receiving Crown Law advice on the matter.

"Crown Law's advice was that the Crown was legally obliged to make the payment and that if the payment had been disputed, it was likely that the dispute  would have been pursued through the Employment Court, and that the Crown would lose, and very likely incur substantial additional costs.

"I approved the payment reluctantly, and was disappointed that the matter should have occurred, and stated to WINZ management my concern that it should not happen again. This message I gave both verbally and in writing.

"As this is an employment matter between WINZ management and one of its staff, I cannot comment further."
