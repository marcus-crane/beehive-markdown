Following representations from the telecommunications industry, Communications Minister Maurice Williamson has agreed to delay the planned auction of the 2GHz spectrum for three months.

"Following representation from the industry I have agreed that the 2GHz auction will now commence on Monday 31 January 2000," said Mr Williamson.

"The Government remains committed to ensuring that the auction takes place and has agreed to give industry more time to prepare."

"We thought they would have been ready by November 15, but after listening to their concerns, we believe the later auction date is acceptable, especially considering it is likely to run for some months anyway."
