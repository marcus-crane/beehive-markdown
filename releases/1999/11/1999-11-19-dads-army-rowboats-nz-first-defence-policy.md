New Zealand First has shown its true colours by walking away from New Zealand's defence needs, Defence Minister Max Bradford said today.

"NZ First has shown that despite talking tough, it is really soft when it comes to making hard decisions in the interests of New Zealand's wellbeing.

"NZ First, by reneging on the deal to lease F-16 aircraft and not replacing frigates, would turn our balanced, credible Defence Force into a Dad's Army with row boats," Mr Bradford said.

"It is a policy position that would leave our troops vulnerable, undermine our trading relationships, and leave our international credibility in tatters.

"It is a nonsense policy from a nonsense party," Mr Bradford said.
