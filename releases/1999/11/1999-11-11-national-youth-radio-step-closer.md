Advertisements inviting proposals for a National Youth Radio Network will appear in major daily papers this weekend, the Minister for Culture and Heritage Hon Marie Hasler said today.

"This is the next step towards establishing a youth radio so our young people have a national voice for their music, drama and talkback," Ms Hasler said.

"We have a young, fresh and vibrant culture and we want to further encourage our young people to celebrate their identity and give them an opportunity to discuss issues relevant to them on a national level.

"Government has set aside frequency in the 100-108 MHz band for the youth radio and the format must promote New Zealand music and arts, and provide interactive, educational and advisory services."

Ms Hasler said proposals for the youth radio must include a business plan and demonstrate how the Government's objectives will be met.

The successful service would be a separate not-for-profit entity and self-funded from sources other than advertising.

Detailed applications are invited by 31 January 2000 and an advisory panel, including representatives from the Ministries for Culture and Heritage, Youth Affairs and Commerce, NZ On Air as well as an external evaluator, will assess these.

"I expect a decision to be made early next year as to who the successful applicant is, with the station up and running within 12 months of this announcement," Ms Hasler said.
