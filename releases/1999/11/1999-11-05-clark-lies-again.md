Helen Clark's extraordinary claim today that the drop in unemployment was because of a loss in population showed that she was prepared to lie about anything to avoid saying that New Zealand was doing well, said Roger Sowry, Minister of Employment.

"The facts are that the total labour force increased by 14,000 over the past year.

"Helen Clark makes much of her academic background. Surely even political scientists know how to read the official statistics. It is obvious to anyone cognisant of the facts that she is simply not telling the truth.

"Helen Clark can't face the fact that the economy is growing and more jobs are being created because she knows that Labour's policies will choke growth and cost jobs," said Mr Sowry.
