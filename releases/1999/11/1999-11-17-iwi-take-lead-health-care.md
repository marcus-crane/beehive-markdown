At a ceremony marking the formal handover of Te Puia Hospital on the East Coast to Ngati Porou Hauora today, the Associate Minister of Health expressed her delight at seeing Maori leadership coming to the fore once again.

"This handover demonstrates the willingless in the capability of Maori communities to take control of their own well being," Associate Minister of Health Georgina te Heuheu said.

"It also demonstrates the National government's confidence in the notion of "by Maori for Maori"," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Over the last nine years of a National government Maori have shown time and again that they can manage the provision of appropriate health services for their own and the rest of the community."

"This is good for the whole community," she said.

"It is particularly heartening for me as a Maori Minister and as one who has been involved in the health sector for much of this decade in a community that has a history of independent action and self determination."

"This decision will help ensure Ngati Porou Hauora continues to work with all locals to improve their health status," Mrs te Heuheu concluded.

The formal handover involved the $2.2million transfer of assets to Ngati Porou Hauora and upgrading of the old hospital.
