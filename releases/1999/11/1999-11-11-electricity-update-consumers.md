Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today released the electricity update newsletter, "A Better Deal For Consumers".

The newsletter contains the latest information on competition in the retail and wholesale electricity markets, the sale of Contact Energy, legislation, and the issue of security of electricity supply.

"It shows without a shadow of a doubt that the reforms are working," Mr Bradford said.

"The newsletter also gives exciting examples of innovative ways representative groups have negotiated cheaper electricity deals for their members.

"Since the newsletter was published another deal has emerged. Farmlands Trading Society Limited, which has obtained a special electricity rate for 22,000 rural families," Mr Bradford said.

The newsletter has been distributed to the electricity sector and interested parties.

For copies of the newsletter please contact the Minister's office on (04) 471 9982.
