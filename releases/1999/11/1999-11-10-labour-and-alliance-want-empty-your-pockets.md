New Zealanders would have less money in their pockets under Labour and the Alliance's economic policies, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Labour and the Alliance have confirmed that New Zealanders face a stark choice - lower taxes, more jobs and continued low interest rates under National or higher taxes, higher interest rates, fewer jobs and reduced spending power under Labour and the Alliance.

"People should cut through the scrapping between Jim Anderton and Michael Cullen over their tax and spending plans and remember one thing: regardless of who wins the internal fight on the Left, we would be left with a recipe that would throttle the spending power of New Zealand families and increase unemployment.

"As well forcing up taxes and interest rates, they want to stop New Zealanders benefitting from lower prices through tariff reductions."
