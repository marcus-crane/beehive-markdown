Primary industry cannot afford a political rainbow

"The future of New Zealand agriculture is dependent on an environment in which enterprise and innovation can flourish. Farmers need a progressive Government with the vision and policies to take their sector forward, not a flaky, disparate menagerie from the left who know nothing about the sector.

"National understands farming and our team represents rural New Zealand. We have a proven track record of success," said Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today.

"Recognising that strong rural communities hinge on a competitive economy, the National Government has driven a reform process to ensure that New Zealand's farmers remain internationally competitive.'

"Through tax cuts, we've ensured that Wellington's consumption of rural incomes has reduced. Stamp and death duties have been abolished. National is leaving more money in the private sector where it can boost the economy and returns to farmers and growers.

On producer boards, we've worked with the trading boards to deliver legislation that will enable farmers and growers to meet the increasing demands of an internationally competitive market.

The Employment Contracts Act has righted the balance between workers and employers, contributing to improved competitiveness and job growth in rural areas without lowering wages. Any change will see off-farm costs increase and farm returns reduce.

We've introduced much needed competitiveness into the provision of workplace accident insurance lowering ACC costs to farms and factories.

Our commitment to phase-out import tariffs, which place a tax on farmers and other consumers, has reduced costs for farmers and households, and increased the competitiveness of the export sector.
