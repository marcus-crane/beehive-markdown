This Monday not one, not two, not three but four Ministers will be live online to talk about policies, issues, and the election.

The four 'McMinisters' taking part are Treasurer Bill English, Social Services Minister Roger Sowry, Education Minister Nick Smith and Justice Minister Tony Ryall.

They're the youngest members of National's cabinet - the eldest is 40 years-old- and they've been good mates since they were elected as MPs in 1990.

They will be live on Xtra at http://www.xtrachat.co.nz from 8.30 p.m. Monday 15 November.

This is a unique chance to ask four senior Ministers the questions which are bugging you in the lead up to the election on November 27.

The four Ministers will physically be in different parts of the country - Bill English in Dunedin, Roger Sowry in Paraparaumu, Nick Smith in Auckland and Tony Ryall in Whakatane.

This is the first time four Government Ministers have held a live online chat - so log in on Monday!
