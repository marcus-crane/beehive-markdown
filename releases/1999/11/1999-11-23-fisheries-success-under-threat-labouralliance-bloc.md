Fisheries Minister, Hon John Luxton, today said that the fishing sector has expanded under a National led Government, but that all this is a risk if a Labour/Alliance/Green Government gets it's hands on the tiller.

"National's fisheries policy has led to New Zealand's fisheries and fishing industry being among the top performers in the world. More fish have been caught for the same effort; greater investment has occurred; profits have increased; export earnings have increased and employment in the New Zealand fishing sector is at record levels."

Seafood is now New Zealand's 4th largest export earner and is continuing to grow. Seafood exports were up 16.9 percent ($46 million) in the September quarter. Last year hoki exports earned $300 million. Employment in the sector has also increased from 8,350 full time jobs in 1989 to over 10,173 in 1999.

Not only have exports and employment grown but National has achieved the following; * an improved Quota Management System and cost recovery regime; * sustainable management of New Zealand's fisheries; * greater involvement of stakeholders in managing the resource; * delivery of strong standards setting, auditing and monitoring; and * the development of an oceans policy.

"After nine long years in Opposition, Labour's policy offers no fresh thinking on how to improve the fisheries sector or the rights of stakeholders. Nor does it offer any indication of where further growth in the sector would come from or where new jobs would be created. In fact it is possible that the reverse could occur and the entire sector could go backwards," Mr Luxton said.

"Labour's policy of stopping sustainable native logging on the West Coast sends a clear message to all primary industry including the fishing sector that Labour are against sustainability and that there will be little growth or job creation under a Labour led Government," Mr Luxton said

The policies promoted by the left will seriously jeopardise the creation of employment in this sector. Not only will Labour repeal the ECA they will increase taxes and re-nationalise ACC.

"New Zealand's fisheries need progressive, forward looking and innovative policies. Labour have shown they only occupy the shallow waters."
