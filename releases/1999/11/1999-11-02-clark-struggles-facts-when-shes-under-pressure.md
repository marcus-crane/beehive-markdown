"With Helen Clark's latest gaffe on how fast student loans grow she looks increasingly accident prone," said Roger Sowry.

"Before the campaign was even under way she was apologising to a surgeon because she accused him of doing something he hadn't done.

"Next thing she's promised 3% unemployment by the end of the term of the next Government, and then had to retract it when Michael Cullen heard about it.

"And let us not forget her flip-flops on Party accommodations. When she thought she didn't need the Greens she was highly moralistic about the arrangements others had made. When the tide turned she quick as a flash gave her Coromandel candidate the shove.

"It just shows she isn't very good when under pressure to perform," Mr Sowry said.
