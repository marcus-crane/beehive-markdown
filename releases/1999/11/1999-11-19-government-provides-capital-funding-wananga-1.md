Two Wananga (public Maori tertiary education institutions) are to get a $6.8 million capital funding injection, Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford, Finance Minister Sir William Birch and Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare announced today.

Te Wananga o Aotearoa will receive $5.2 million and Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi $1.6 million.

The Ministers said the capital injections would allow the Wananga to purchase buildings and necessary equipment for teaching in 2000.

The announcement is a response to Government awareness that present facilities are inadequate to allow the Wananga to teach in an appropriate environment.

The Pre-election Fiscal Update flagged that business cases seeking capital injections had been received from the Wananga and were being considered by Ministers.

Mr Bradford said the Government was supportive of the work that the Wananga were performing and their real contribution to Maori educational outcomes, Maori leadership and development.

The funding would provide the Wananga with some security while longer term planning and capital requirements were finalised.

The funding announcement was the first step of a two-step process for addressing the capital needs of the Wananga tertiary institutions, Mr Bradford said.

The Ministers said this and any further capital injections resulting from business cases currently being developed, recognised the special needs of the Wananga.

The Government regarded these payments as being distinct from the Government's consideration of the Waitangi Tribunal Report, they said.

A full response to the Tribunal's Report is still being developed.
