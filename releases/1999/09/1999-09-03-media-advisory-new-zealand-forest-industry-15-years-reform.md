All media are invited to the release of a report assessing the New Zealand Forest Industry's performance after fifteen years of economic reform and deregulation.

The report has been commissioned by the Forest Industries Council, and prepared by Forest Research.

The report's findings on the merits of trade liberalisation are particularly timely given that within days, New Zealand will host the APEC Ministerial Meeting and Leaders' Summit in Auckland.

The report will be presented by:

Bryce Heard, Chief Executive, Forest Research  
James Griffiths, Chief Executive, Forest Industries' Council  
Hon Lockwood Smith, Minister for International Trade

All Media Welcome
