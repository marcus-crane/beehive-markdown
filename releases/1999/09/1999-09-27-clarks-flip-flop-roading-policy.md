Labour leader Helen Clark has finally admitted that the principles of the National Government's roading policy must be implemented, despite previously criticising it, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

Miss Clark announced aspects of Labour's plans for roading at the Road Transport Forum Annual Conference on Saturday.

"She's suddenly advocating the building of toll roads by private companies which would be returned to public ownership when the companies recouped their investment," said Mr Williamson.

"Where's she been for the last few years. Toll roads and private sector participation have been major features of National's proposed roading document, Better Transport Better Roads, which has attracted over 1000 submissions."

Miss Clark also announced Labour's intention to work with local authorities to identify and adopt changes.

"This is another cornerstone of what we've been doing for the last few years and will continue to do. We've been consulting widely on our Better Transport, Better Roads document, where local authorities have had a great deal of input."

"Labour has finally conceded that something must be done about our roading system as we have for some time. But apart from using some of the ideas we have had on the table for some time, they are very vague about how to deal with the problem," said Mr Williamson.

"I will also be interested to hear the Alliance's reaction to the Labour position on tolling."
