The passage of the Kiwifruit Industry Restructuring Bill and the Apple and Pear Restructuring Bill today represents a significant milestone in the history of our fruit export industries, Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton said today.

"Despite the game playing of the opposition, I am pleased that Parliament has seen the merits of the Government's lead on this issue. The new legislation further enables the Kiwifruit and Apple and Pear industries to reposition themselves to meet head-on the challenges of the international market."

"The legislation also paves the way for a new regulatory framework for the exporting of kiwifruit and apples and the transition of the commercial business to generic governance laws. Corporatisation of these Boards is a positive step in defining ownership of these important New Zealand industries."

"The passing of these Bills reflect constructive consultations within the kiwifruit and apple industries over the past year. I specifically want to thank all those who have put so much effort into this process - in particular Doug Voss, Chairman of the Kiwifruit Board and John McCliskie Chairman of the Apple and Pear Board for their leadership on this issue."

"Parliament has enabled the transition to a new era based on commercial disciplines and innovation."

"This is the end of a process which commenced when the industries responded to the Government's challenge to provide a plan for the move towards deregulation in November 1998. Today's outcome will result in increased wealth for kiwifruit and apple growers and the New Zealand economy," Mr Luxton concluded.
