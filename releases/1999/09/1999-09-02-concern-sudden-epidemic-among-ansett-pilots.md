The sudden outburst of illness, bordering on epidemic proportions, among Ansett pilots is worrying Transport Minister Maurice Williamson. He intends talking to  his colleague the Minister of Immigration to discuss the possibility of bringing in overseas pilots until their New Zealand counterparts recover.

"These Ansett pilots are no doubt really worried about the inconvenience their illness is causing the travelling public."

"I don't want this sort of worry to add to their obvious deteriorating health" said Mr Williamson.

"If the pilots are unwell they must be left in peace to convalesce."

"I'm sure the public won't mind a Canadian, British or even an Australian accent coming from the cockpit until this epidemic is behind us." Mr Williamson said.
