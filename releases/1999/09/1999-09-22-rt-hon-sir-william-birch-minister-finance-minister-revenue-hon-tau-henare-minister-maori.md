Hon Tau Henare  
Minister of Maori Affairs

The Government is to allow more time for consultation on its review of the way Maori authority income is taxed.

Treasurer Bill English, Finance and Revenue Minister Sir William Birch, and Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare said today that more time was needed for consultation because of the complexity of the issues involved and the high degree of Maori interest in the review.

"The original plan, announced in March, provided for the release in October of a Government discussion setting out proposals for change. The discussion document will now be released in June next year," the Ministers said.

"This will allow more time for consultation with Maori and other interested parties during the policy development phase. Following the release of the discussion document, wider consultation will be undertaken including workshops and regional hui throughout New Zealand.

"The review is looking at the rules that govern the taxation of Maori authority income. The rules themselves generally date back to the 1950s, when Maori authorities engaged in a much narrower range of activities."

"The role of Maori authorities has grown significantly since that time, so it's time to review the tax rules to see if they meet the needs of Maori today," the Ministers said.
