Treasurer Bill English said today support for the Government's tax legislation was clearly conditional, based on discussions he had had with the MPs concerned.

"I was present at a number of discussions held by the Government with its supporters on the tax legislation.

"In each case, MPs indicated that their support was conditional. Treasury Ministers reported these discussions to the Prime Minister, who has represented them correctly.

"Public statements by the MPs concerned reflect the tenor of the discussions, but not the full detail," said Mr English.
