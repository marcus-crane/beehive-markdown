Fisheries Minister, Hon John Luxton today announced that the commercial catch limits for the deepwater species of oreo (known as oreo 3A) have been reduced from 6600 to 5900 tonnes for the 1999/2000 fishing year on the western oreo half of the Chatham Rise.

"I have asked industry to implement a voluntary agreement that will allow for 1900 tonnes of the 5900 Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) to be set aside as an upper limit for smooth oreo. I have also sought the co-operation of the fishing industry to maintain the black oreo catch at a sustainable level."

In addition there will be a phased reduction in catch limits over a three year period, starting in the 2000/01 fishing year.

"It is important to conserve the valuable oreo stocks so as to ensure their long term sustainability," Mr Luxton concluded.
