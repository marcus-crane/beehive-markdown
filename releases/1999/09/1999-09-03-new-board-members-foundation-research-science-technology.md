The Foundation manages the Public Good Science Fund, allocates funds for the Technology New Zealand scheme, as well as the post-doctoral and the Maori Fellowships schemes. It will invest over $310 million in the 1999/00 year in research, science and technology.

"The new members are familiar with the issues involved with moving technology from the research bench into the wider economy, as they have significant research, innovation and business experience," Mr Williamson said.
