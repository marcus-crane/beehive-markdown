Conservation and Education Minister Nick Smith today launched Clean Up New Zealand in Wellington with Ian Kiernan, founder of Clean Up the World by joining 200 pupils from Lyall Bay School to help clean up Lyall Bay Beach.

"New Zealand is fortunate to have so many beautiful beaches and parks, but too often they are ruined by litter, graffiti and a lack of public care. Clean Up New Zealand is all about building community support for better care of our public places. Spring has traditionally been about a home based spring clean. We also need to take the opportunity in spring to clean up our public places."

Clean Up the World has been running for six years and involves over 40 million people in 120 countries. When recently in Australia on an ANZAC fellowship, Dr Smith was impressed by the Clean Up Australia programme and wanted to see it adopted in New Zealand.

"Clean Up New Zealand week is not just about children. However, if we can get children to better understand the need to look after our public places then we can start to change the way adults behave. The Clean Up New Zealand campaign will be an annual event, of which this year is the first. I encourage all local bodies, schools and public authorities to get involved and make this week a success."
