Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she will announce the date of the 1999 general election following a special caucus to be held in Auckland on Sunday 26 September.

"At this caucus the National team will finalise campaign plans and policy positions.

"National intends to fight to win this election so New Zealanders have a forward-looking and progressive Government with the people and the programmes for the future," Mrs Shipley said.
