It has not gone unnoticed how badly Labour has let down the people of the West Coast in particular, with their policy of a complete ban on native forest logging, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley repeated the Government's commitment to the West Coast Accord today as she launched National candidate Rod O'Beirne's campaign to take back the West Coast-Tasman electorate.

"Rod knows this area well, and is committed to the people of this area. Rod together with this Government believes in sustainable logging, which protects and grows jobs on the Coast, and ensures that our native trees survive for future generations.

"I was delighted that Rod was chosen to contest this seat, because Motueka, and the West Coast deserve the very best.

"Labour, on the other hand, believe in a scorched earth policy ? no logging, no jobs, no West Coast. Hardly surprising from a party run by academics and trade union officials.

"I challenge Labour leader Helen Clark to debate sustainable native forestry issues with me on the West Coast at any time," said Mrs Shipley.
