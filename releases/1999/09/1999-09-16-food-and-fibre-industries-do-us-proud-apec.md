Food and Fibre Minister Hon John Luxton today paid tribute to New Zealand's primary industries for their significant contribution in making APEC and the post-APEC state visits such a success.

"The best of New Zealand food and wine was show-cased at the state dinners. The quality, taste, texture and presentation were superb. As Minister of Food and Fibre I was delighted to see world leaders enjoying some of the finest food our country has to offer," Mr Luxton said.

"From cervena to Chardonnay and from scallops to saffron broth it was all world class. Our farmers, fishers, orchardists, vintners and chefs have done us proud. It is a real testimony to their high standards that we were able to offer such a diverse range of produce."

Mr Luxton said that the food and wine received glowing compliments. Apart from state dinners some of the leaders also had the pleasure of dining in some of our finest restaurants. "With very short notice these too rose to the occasion."

As well as experiencing high quality food, world leaders also received gifts characteristic of New Zealand's primary industries. Among the gifts presented were fine Merino scarves, wooden crafts, paua shell jewellery and flax kete.

The activities also had a rural flavour. "Burton Shipley impressed the spouses with his prowess at shearing and who can forget the picture of Jiang Zemin, leader of the world's most populous nation, feeding a lamb? When it comes to showing the world what we do best it is agriculture and rural New Zealand we turn to."

"On occasions like this, it is important to remember that not only are our food and fibre industries the backbone of the economy, they are also the international face of New Zealand," Mr Luxton concluded.
