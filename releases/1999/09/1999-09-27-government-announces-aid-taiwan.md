The New Zealand Government has responded to the humanitarian disaster following Taiwan's worst earthquake on record by giving a grant of $150,000 to the New Zealand Red Cross Appeal.

"We have been concerned by reports outlining the full extent of damage, the continued aftershocks and the difficult situation many Taiwanese are facing" the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon Simon Upton said today.

"The Red Cross is already in Taiwan and has been assisting with relief efforts. The New Zealand Government wants to make a contribution of $150,000 to support this."

"The latest aftershock toppled buildings that were already weakened and dislodged landslides creating further mayhem".

"While the hope of finding survivors is now slim, there are countless homeless people in need of clean water, shelter and medical supplies". He added that he hoped that the funds provided would be helpful in securing essential provisions for the victims such as sleeping bags and tents.
