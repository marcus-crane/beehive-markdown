The Government has taken the next step in its plans to cut compliance costs for small businesses - setting up a panel of experts to test compliance costs faced by general practitioners.

Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the establishment of the General Practitioner Compliance Cost Reduction Test Panel.

"Doctors have raised concerns with me about compliance costs. The Test Panel will help address the concerns."

The aim of the pilot Test Panel is to develop practical proposals to reduce general practitioner compliance costs.

The panel will be chaired by Dr Tricia Briscoe a Rotorua GP and member of the New Zealand Medical Association Board.

It will look at where coordination and collaboration between Government agencies can reduce compliance costs, simplify information requirements placed on general practitioners and claiming processes.

The pilot Test Panel will be evaluated to determine whether it is an efficient method for reducing compliance costs and identify any improvements needed for the roll out of other test panels.

This first test panel is part of the Government's Bright Futures package - which includes measures to make life simpler for small businesses by cutting red tape, and removing outdated regulations and laws.

The panels will advise the Government on the impact of proposed legislation before final Parliamentary approval.
