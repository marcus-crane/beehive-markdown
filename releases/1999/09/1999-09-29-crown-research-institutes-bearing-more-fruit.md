"The years ahead pose fresh challenges for food and fibre producers, exporters and marketers. The Crown Research Institutes are working successfully with the private sector to meet those challenges here the Hawke's Bay and throughout New Zealand", Simon Upton said this evening.

The Minister for Crown Research Institutes, Simon Upton, made these comments while opening Analytical Research Laboratories (ARL) Ltd's new facilities in Napier.

"ARL is a prime example of a successful joint venture between the private sector and a CRI, looking for ways to future-proof New Zealand's agribusiness for the commercial environment of the new millennium".

"Scientists and the private sector are working together in new and successful ways in New Zealand, and this has been made possible by the flexible structure of the Crown Research Institutes".

Analytical Research Laboratories is a private company with AgResearch (a CRI) and Ravensdown as equal shareholders. It is an analytical laboratory providing soil, plant, environmental and food chemical and microbiological analysis. Its customer base includes food processors, local government, fertiliser manufacturers, horticulturists and farmers.

Mr Upton said, "Ravensdown brings commercial expertise and a strong customer base to the Partnership and AgResearch brings new technologies".

Originally located at Lawn Road, near Havelock North, ARL's volume of business outgrew its existing premises and a new state of the art laboratory was built. ARL relocated the new laboratories at Awatoto, Napier last June.
