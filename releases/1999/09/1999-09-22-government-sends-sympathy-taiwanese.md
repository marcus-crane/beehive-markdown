"The thoughts of New Zealanders are with the people of Taiwan as they come to terms with the impact of yesterday's destructive earthquake," the Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"New Zealand, like Taiwan, is vulnerable to earthquakes, so we feel a special symapthy for those who are suffering and who have lost loved ones.

"I know that all New Zealanders want to express their empathy to the people of Taiwan at this terrible time," the Prime Minister said.

"We will ensure that this sympathy is conveyed to Chinese Taipei representatives," she said.
