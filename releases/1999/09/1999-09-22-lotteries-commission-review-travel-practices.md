The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, has asked the Presiding member of the Lotteries Commission, Geoff Thompson, to review the Commission's travel practices and report back to him by the end of October.

In a 30-minute meeting at Parliament today Mr Elder told Mr Thompson it was inappropriate in most cases for spouses' travel to be paid for by the Commission.

He also asked Mr Thompson to review the numbers of Lotteries Commission representatives attending conferences. Five commission members or staff, not including spouses, attended a recent conference in Norway.

Mr Elder also discussed with Mr Thompson the consultations that took place with the State Services Commission over the employment package for the Commission's Chief Executive, David Bale, who has since resigned and the process for finding his successor.
