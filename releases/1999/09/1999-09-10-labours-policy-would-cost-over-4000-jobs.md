"The Labour Party's policy to ban sustainable forestry on Crown land would cost more than 4,000 jobs in New Zealand's furniture manufacturing industries according to the Furniture Association of New Zealand," SOE Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"Over the last three years Timberlands West Coast has produced around 70 to 80 percent of all rimu in New Zealand.

"The Association says that ongoing access to native timbers was critical to furniture makers survival. Without it many factories would likely close.

"Labour hope to bury this policy under coverage of APEC and the recent events in East Timor.

"But, 4,000 jobs potentially lost in major centres like Auckland and Christchurch can not be ignored.

"Labour's policy would also cost around 100 jobs currently dependent on indigenous forestry on the West Coast, and remove any hope of the region getting up to 200 more jobs resulting from the recently approved sustainable beech forestry plans.

"It is little wonder Helen Clark has refused to front this announcement herself, even though she has been the primary driver of it.

"Instead Labour's leader has put up the smart alec Dr Michael Cullen to front.

"Dr Cullen is scheduled to visit the West Coast next Monday to deliver the Labour policy personally.

"If he is brave enough to go through with that visit, he will, no doubt, be in for a ‘passionate' reception," said Mr Ryall.
