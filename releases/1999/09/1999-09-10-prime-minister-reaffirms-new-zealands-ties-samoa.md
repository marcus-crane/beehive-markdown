Prime Minister Jenny Shipley reaffirmed New Zealand's economic and social ties with Samoa at a lunch held for new Samoan Prime Minister Hon Tuila'epa Sailele Malielegaoi.

"Our governments and our people share an intimate relationship underpinned by our Treaty of Friendship," Mrs Shipley said.

"The Treaty's strength lies in its simplicity. It commits both governments to conduct our relations in a spirit of close friendship and to consult each other on matters of mutual interest and concern.

"Such matters have, in the past 30 years, included a range of diverse issues like immigration, trade, disarmament, fisheries and climate change.

"The annual immigration quota, which stands alongside our general migration arrangements, will continue to be a special and enduring part of the relationship for as long as both Governments want it to be.

"I am also pleased that our Government recently extended portability of New Zealand Superannuation to the Pacific Islands. This will enable Samoan people to retire to Samoa with their full superannuation entitlement if they so choose."

Mrs Shipley said Samoan people had made a significant contribution to all areas of New Zealand society including education, literature, business, entertainment and sport, and had helped New Zealand mature as a multicultural nation.

"Sporting heroes such as Bryan Williams, Beatrice Faumuina, Michael Jones, Olo Brown and David Tua are excellent role models for our young people in both New Zealand and Samoa. We are indebted to them for their leadership and inspiration, as well as their achievements on the sports field."

Mrs Shipley congratulated Prime Minister Tuila'epa on the economic reforms that he had overseen in Samoa as Minister of Finance in recent years.

"Much of Samoa's economic success can be attributed to Prime Minister Tuila'epa's commitment to making hard decisions regarding reform.

"Reform is an ongoing process and the Samoan people will need our ongoing support both now and into the future.

"That's why we will continue our development co-operation with Samoa, in such areas as public sector reform, education and work skills training," Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley finished her speech by making a toast to His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili the Second, who is Head of State in Samoa.
