"New Zealanders can expect the Labour-Alliance bloc to run a negative campaign based around personal denigration of the Prime Minister," SOE Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"The Labour-Alliance Opposition were desperate for an early election date to avoid a policy debate. It had hoped to win this election on the basis of its personal attacks on our Prime Minister.

"But, with a longer election campaign there will be more time for voters to look beneath the Labour-Alliance rhetoric. Unfortunately for the Opposition, New Zealanders will find the cupboard is bare.

"The Opposition's plan for employment is to bring back union control of the workplace, union control of the classroom, and increased costs for business.

"On the environment, Labour promises to break a deal it made with conservationists and West Coasters to allow a tiny amount of sustainable timber to be produced. Labour wants to shut down the West Coast and in the process much of New Zealand's furniture industry.

"Labour's law and order policy is to repeal National's legislation increasing penalties for violent-home invaders, and make it easier for the Police to take fingerprints from juveniles - something the Police say they have no problem doing now.

"These are not policies developed after careful consideration. They are the policies of pressure groups like unions, politically-correct liberals, and professional activists like Nicky Hager.

"It's no wonder Labour launched most of its policies during APEC week, and under the cover of state visits and the East Timor crisis. Labour-Alliance has left itself with no option but to step up its campaign against the Prime Minister.

"National is proud of New Zealand's achievements. We have the ideas and the people to take New Zealand forward and keep it successful in the next century," said Mr Ryall.
