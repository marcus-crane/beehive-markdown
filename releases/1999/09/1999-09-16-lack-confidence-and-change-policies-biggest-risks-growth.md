Treasurer Bill English said today the two biggest risks to the country's growth potential was New Zealanders' lack of confidence in their capacity to succeed and changing policies that had laid the foundations for growth.

Speaking to the Institute of Directors in Christchurch, Mr English said the outlook for the New Zealand economy was good, with most forecasters picking growth of 3.5% to 4% next year.

"The outlook for the New Zealand economy is good and we can make it even better. The only things that can hold us back are lack of confidence in our capacity to succeed and changing policies that have laid the foundations for growth.

"Many business people I meet say they are doing well, but they are concerned about how others are doing. They should be confident that others are doing well too and that means we are likely to grow as fast or faster than Australia, the US, the UK, and Canada next year.

"But we must build on the policies that got us this far: stable prices, modern industrial relations, prudent Government spending, an open and competitive economy, and lower taxes. We must drive from this base because that's what helps business grow, and growth means more jobs and more pay.

"No business will benefit from higher taxes, higher ACC costs, paid maternity leave, and the return of union-dominated workplaces.

"With the National Government's policies the first three years of the new millennium would provide 10% economic growth, 100,000 new jobs, stable inflation and low interest rates, lower public debt, and lower taxes - at a minimum.

"There's more for the taking if we restore our confidence in ourselves, and build on the foundation rather than undermining it," said Mr English.
