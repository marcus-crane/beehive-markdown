"I am disappointed that some health professionals involved in maternity care continue to argue from the sidelines instead of listening to women's views," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"The National Health Committee's Maternity Services Review has asked women what they want and need from maternity care. They are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care - but some fine tuning can be made.

"I had hoped that those involved in maternity care would rise above their own interests and take a considered approach to the National Health Committee's work.

"I would urge those health groups involved to set aside their own interests and consider how we can use the findings in the Maternity Services Review report to get better services.

"One of the main messages from the Review is that women want health professionals to work better together to provide maternity care.

"It is not an unreasonable expectation. I would hope that those involved will take heed of that."
