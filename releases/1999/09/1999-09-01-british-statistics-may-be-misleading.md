Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, today released advice from the Ministry of Justice showing statistics produced by the British Home Office regarding the level of violent offending in New Zealand may be misleading if compared to other countries.

"In fact since 1995 the rate of recorded violent offending (that is the number of recorded violent offences per head of population) has actually been falling in line with overall crime rates. While violence is still too high the trend is right," Mr Ryall said.

"The Ministry has advised me that the statistics produced by the British Home Office study cannot be used to make between-country comparisons. The authors of the report themselves included a precautionary footnote to this effect.

"The advice received shows that, using similar definitions of violent offending as are used by many countries in the study, New Zealand's rate of violent offending effectively halves and is lower than Australia, Canada and the United States.

"Violent crime is too high whatever its level. New Zealand's Police and the community are working hard to reduce crime of all types," Mr Ryall concluded.
