The Health Minister today announced new funding to expand the availability of "Green Prescriptions" - where General Practitioners prescribe physical activity not drugs to get people healthy.

"The health benefits of physical activity are astounding and it can be as simple as going for a walk.

"Walking for 30 minutes most days a week can make a real difference to each of our physical wellbeing," Mr Creech said.

"That's one of the reasons why the Ministry of Health is injecting $400,000 to expand the Green Prescriptions project."

Mr Creech made the announcement at the launch of the Ministry of Health's participation in the National Heart Foundation's "Stroll, Strut and Stride" programme to get people walking.

"Green Prescriptions involve GPs writing formal directions to patients to increase their personal levels of activity. They can be preventative or as part of a cure for existing medical conditions.

"Once the patient has the information they can get help from the regional sports trusts funded by the Hillary Commission. They provide additional advice to patients, provide 0800 free phone advice, support and monitoring.

"Green Prescriptions originated from the Hillary Commission after the completion of clinical trials conducted by the National Heart Foundation. They've been so successful that we're going to expand them.

"The extra funding will pay for six Green Prescription co-ordinators, information for GPs and patients, training for GPs and physical activity co-ordinators, promotion, improved computer prescriptions and research.

"Prevention is key to keeping us healthy and well as a nation. It is a fact we are getting fatter. I want us as a nation to get fitter. If we don't do it we'll be in real trouble in the future as our health status declines." One in three adults is inactive - a 10 per cent increase in the number of adults who are active would return health cost savings of at least $55 million a year.

The Minister was joined by staff from the Ministry of Health for a walk along Wellington's Lambton Quay to promote the National Heart Foundation's "Stroll, Strut and Stride" programme.

The programme challenges participants to walk the length of New Zealand (2113km) or either the North (1098km) or South Island (915km) over a period of eleven weeks in teams of about 10 people. The average team member would need to walk about 20km a week to achieve the team goal.

Green Prescriptions - some of the successes Jacqui Wade has proven that physical activity has a place in her ongoing health management.

Jacqui had a weight problem associated with her diabetes. She was encouraged by her GP Dr Robert Briggs, Hei Hei Medical Centre, to undertake an exercise programme. She was determined to lose the weight and did so in late 1998, shedding 15 kgs by the end of the year.

The entire medical team noticed the dramatic change in her wellbeing. Jacqui is now so involved in exercise she contacted Sport Canterbury on 0800 ACTIVE for further information on walking tracks and groups in her local area.

She also discovered that they could provide her with information on line dancing and was thrilled that she could now be involved in an activity that has been of interest to her for many years.

In January he was given a wake up call from his doctor. Stewart knew he was overweight, suffering from high blood pressure and cholesterol, a heart attack waiting to happen. His doctor gave him the choice of either taking pills for his health problems or a Green Prescription. Stewart opted for a Green Prescription.

"I wanted to improve my health once and for all. I just need an incentive to do something about it."

Stewart now walks every day, always walks the seven flights of stairs to and from his car each day, and takes long leisurely walks with his wife in the weekend. Sport North Harbour supplied him with support material and suggestions on a home physical activity programme. Eight weeks later, Stewart has lost 14kg while he has been on a Green Prescription.

"I am feeling great, and am happy to be alive. I was starting to feel very tired carrying the extra weight, my Green Prescription has given me a new lease on life."
