Treasurer and Clutha-Southland MP Bill English said Labour's plan to shut down indigenous forestry operations on Crown land showed that Labour would always let left-wing ideology overrule common sense.

"Labour talks about economic development and support for rural people, but the words are hollow.

"Left-wing ideology has overruled common sense and normal people will pay the price when they have to sign up for the dole instead of working for a living.

"Our rural communities can't survive unless they've got a viable economic base. People need real jobs from real industries, not hand-outs from economic development trusts.

"Labour's indigenous forestry policy is a direct attack on the livelihoods of people in Western Southland and on the West Coast and it shows that Helen Clark is willing to pick on people who live a long way from Wellington. At the first hurdle Labour is prepared to shut down multi-million dollar industries. All the soothing noises about development trusts are meaningless because meetings of bureaucrats will never replace real work.

"The best way to ensure the forestry industry continues to be viable in Western Southland and on the Coast is through the Government's policy of sustainable logging," said Mr English.
