The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, has announced the appointment of Auckland lawyer, Judith Collins, as the new Chairperson of the Casino Control Authority. She replaces Jock Irvine who has served as Chair since the Authority was established in 1990.

Mr Elder said Ms Collins, Vice President of the New Zealand Law Society, has all the qualities to make an excellent Authority Chairperson.

"She is highly experienced in commercial and property law issues, and has proved she can foster co-operation and consensus in diverse groups," he said. "She also has an understanding of cultural, racial, and other social issues which will equip her well to assess the range of issues facing the casino industry.

"Ms Collins has a very good reputation among the legal community and clearly meets the legal requirement of having at least seven years' experience as a High Court lawyer."

Ms Collins' appointment is for three years. The final duties of the former Chairperson, Jock Irvine, will be to complete the operator's licence hearings for Otago Casino Limited, one of the Queenstown casinos. Mr Irvine is not participating in the Hamilton casino hearings.
