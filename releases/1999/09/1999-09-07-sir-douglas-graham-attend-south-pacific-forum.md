Attorney General Sir Douglas Graham will represent the New Zealand Government at the South Pacific Forum in Koror, Palau, from 3 to 6 October.

Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will not be attending because of a heavy workload this year.

"It has been an extremely busy year on the international stage for New Zealand. I have been on several overseas visits in the build-up to APEC and we are currently hosting an unprecedented number of international leaders, followed by three significant State visits.

"I regret not being able attend the forum this year, but I am pleased that Sir Graham has agreed to attend as the Government's special envoy," Mrs Shipley said.
