Housing New Zealand Minister, Tony Ryall, today said that HNZ has been refocussing its role in communities to be more pro-active and involved rather than an out of town landlord.

Mr Ryall made the comments while opening the Papatuanuku Community Project, a new community based early intervention-crime prevention project in the Hamilton suburb of Fairfield.

"I want HNZ to continue to support communities who are committed to improving their future. It is important that HNZ develop its role as a responsible and active member of the communities in which it owns homes," said Mr Ryall.

"I am pleased to say that HNZ has been enthusiastic in doing this.

"HNZ has provided a number of properties around the country for community projects such as this one.

"HNZ is also involved in the successful Strengthening Families initiatives, the Community Partnerships project, and in a new project in provincial New Zealand towns called Great Neighbourhoods," said Mr Ryall.

Great Neighbourhoods is a commitment by HNZ to encourage and support communities in provincial towns who want to rejuvenate and revitalise their communities.

Community Partnerships is a project under which HNZ forms partnerships with local community groups who want to take a greater role in Housing for lower income New Zealanders. The most recent example of which is the Fanau Centre Housing project in Porirua (see attached article).

The Papatuanuku community project is a cooperative venture between Te Runanaga o Kirikiriroa, Iwi Social Services, Employment Initiatives, Waikato Community Police, Te Rapakau Health, Te Kohao Health, HNZ, local businesses, and many others.

Housing New Zealand has donated a property in the heart of the neighbourhood that will serve as the base for the project.
