"Labour's caucus is ready to explode following the resignation of Jim Sutton," says Associate Minister of Forestry, David Carter.

"This is the first time that Labour has come under real pressure this year, and barely a day after dissension in their midst, one of their highest ranking politicians quits."

"Jim Sutton's departure has shown up clearly how wide the divisions in Labour are. The extreme urban eco-fundamentalists that Helen Clark has aligned herself with are trying to bury the more mainstream members of the party."

"Who will be next?"

"Damien O'Connor obviously can't stay within the party. From my meetings with people on the West Coast today, it's clear that Labour has torpeded whatever remains of his local support. Mr O'Connor will go independent if he wants to have any chance of survival!"

"Under the shadow of APEC Labour has tried to bury three of its policies this week, their industrial relations policy, their social policy and now their forestry policy."

"They are running scared of their own policies. They know their large numbers of their own people don't support them and Helen Clark is trying desperately to shut down the rumours her party is collapsing."

"A few weeks ago she stated that Labour did not see forestry as an election issue. That was a huge cover up. Labour has been running two forestry policies for several years now. Today's resignation comes as no surprise to West Coasters who are shattered by Labour's abandonment of its own birthplace."
