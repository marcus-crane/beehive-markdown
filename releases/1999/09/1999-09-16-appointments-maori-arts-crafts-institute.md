Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith has announced new appointments to the Board of the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute.

- Ray Watson, Chief Executive of Lakeland Health Limited in Rotorua and a member of the MACI Advisory Committee;

"The new appointees have been carefully selected to balance cultural interests with the requirement that the Board has the necessary commercial skills and experience to ensure the Board’s success," said Dr Smith.

"The new Board has the skills and expertise to guide the Institute through its next three years, including oversight of its economic recovery and implementation of its redevelopment programme," Dr Smith concluded.
