"If sustainability isn't the issue for the Labour Party, what is?" asks Associate Forestry Minister David Carter.

"Dr Cullen conceded in private to West Coast leaders this week that Labour believes the Coast's beech forests can be managed sustainably."

"This proves what a cold-hearted, cynical move Labour's recent forestry policy announcement amounts to."

"It's not based on fact, but a cynical calculation that there might be more green-aligned voters in Auckland than people on the West Coast," says Mr Carter.

"Already we are seeing Labour hopefuls trying to milk the decision with a report today on Labour candidate David Jacobs using the policy to launch his campaign."

"But it's clear Aucklanders are wise to Labour's tactics."

"The NZ Herald recognises Labour's "values call" for what it is. Their editorial yesterday called for Labour to reconsider saying "if there are ways of extracting timber at a rate that can be matched by the regeneration of the forest, the West Coast deserves to profit". "

"Labour may not have noticed, but more than 80 percent of West Coast land and forests are already protected by the Department of Conservation."

"Sustainable forestry is not a myth, it's a reality on the West Coast, and it provides more "real jobs" on the Coast than Labour's economic development package could ever dream of."
