But we mustn't let the unions strangle our economy, said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income, commenting on Labour's industrial relations policy.

As minister responsible for employment, it's clear to me that this policy would cost jobs, weaken our economy and plunge new Zealand back into the dark days of industrial strife.

There are 320,000 small and medium-sized businesses out there who are terrified of being caught up in industrial action many of these just wouldn't be able to cope.

We've been working hard to make it easier for businesses to hire more staff. This will undo the outstanding industrial relations record this  
country has achieved under the Employment Contracts Act and see unemployment start to grow again.
