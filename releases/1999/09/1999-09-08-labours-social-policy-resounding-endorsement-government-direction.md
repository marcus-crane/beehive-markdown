The Minister of Social Services, Roger Sowry today welcomed Labour's belated approval of Government social policy.

"It's a resounding endorsement of all the changes this Government has brought in....Family Start, Strengthening Families, the new Ministry of Social Policy, WINZ and case-management and the Youth Services Strategy."

"Labour has spent the past 3 years fighting our moves to re-structure the welfare sector.

"They've spent 3 years being negative about early intervention.

"I'm just glad they've finally changed their minds and listened to communities around New Zealand who've been telling them that this is the way forward."

He said Labour had backed down from its earlier positions in many areas; they said they'd raise benefits, they said they'd set up a social exclusion unit in PM's office, plus they planned to scrap WINZ.
