The National Government's strategies for growth are right on track according to an OECD Jobs Strategy Report: Assessing Performance and Policy, Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton told a Federated Farmers meeting in Wanganui today.

Citing a recent article in the Business Herald, (18 September) Mr Luxton said that of 29 OECD countries, New Zealand was at the top of the class for job growth. Ten broad policy guidelines were identified for reducing unemployment, boosting employment and promoting economic prosperity.

"It was gratifying to see New Zealand ahead of so many other countries, but the evidence was plain to see. Countries like New Zealand which have taken tough decisions have been rewarded with falling unemployment rates. Countries like Germany which have been slow to change, now have an entrenched unemployment problem."

"National's commitment to stable macro-economic policy, increased labour market flexibility and labour costs; benefit reforms and job security laws as well as wide-ranging changes to education and training systems, has delivered the results."

"This Government has made substantial progress on reforming our labour market law and reducing the overall tax burden to ensure a responsive and flexible environment."

Mr Luxton said the excellent findings were worth remembering when heading to the ballot box on election day." While Labour an the Alliance are committed to retrograde industrial relations and tax policies, National is focussed on the future and the continued prosperity of the New Zealand economy."
