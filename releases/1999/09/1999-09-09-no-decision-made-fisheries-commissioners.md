Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today that appointments to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries' Commission had not been finalised.

Mrs Shipley was responding to media speculation about the appointment process.

"The Minister of Maori Affairs, Hon Tau Henare, and I will discuss the issue in full and the Government will make a decision in due course. Until a decision has been taken, all media speculation is premature."
