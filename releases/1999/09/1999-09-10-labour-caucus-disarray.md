The resignation of Labour forestry spokesman Jim Sutton shows there's a serious internal split developing inside the Labour camp.

"Labour is renowned for having problems holding itself together, and as soon as the pressure goes on to come out with policy, the fur starts to fly."

Mr Sowry said the left-wing of the party is in its ascendancy at the moment and people can expect to see extreme policies announced which will drive out the more moderate Labour members.

"If you take a look at Labour's list, it's clear that any Labour caucus would be even more to the left than at present," Mr Sowry said.
