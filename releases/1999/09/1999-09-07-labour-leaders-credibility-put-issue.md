"Labour Leader Helen Clark's credibility has been dealt a major blow with defamation proceedings against her over her claims about surgery at Ascot Hospital," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Helen Clark's credibility is on the line.

"Her attempts to turn a patient case at Auckland's Ascot Hospital into criticism of private hospital care have backfired.

"It is unusual for politicians to be sued. It is rare for a leader of a major political party to be sued. That is not what leadership is about.

"She has irresponsibly levelled very serious accusations - without checking the facts.

"This is nothing but an attempt to score cheap political points. New Zealanders have the right to expect much more than that from our political leaders."
