The Minister of Defence, Hon Max Bradford, this morning announced the Government had agreed to deploy the Navy tanker HMNZS Endeavour to Darwin.

Endeavour has just completed nine days of exercising in Malaysian waters as the sole tanker for ships participating in the Five Power Defence Arrangement exercise STARDEX.

The tanker will berth in Singapore today and will leave for Australia on Monday as soon as fuel loading is completed.

HMNZS Endeavour will support Australian, New Zealand and Royal Navy ships already in the region.
