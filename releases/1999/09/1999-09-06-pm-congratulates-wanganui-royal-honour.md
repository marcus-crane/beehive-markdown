Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today congratulated the Wanganui Opera House on the announcement that the Queen had given them the right to call themselves the "Royal Wanganui Opera House."

'"After visiting Wanganui last month, I was pleased to be able to recommend to Her Majesty The Queen that the Opera House's bid to be able to use the style 'Royal', and I am delighted that The Queen has granted such an honour.

"I was very impressed by the Opera House on my visit there last month. I know that it will wear its new name with pride, and Wanganui residents will have yet another reason to be proud of their Opera House," the Prime Minister said.
