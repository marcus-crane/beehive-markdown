Indonesia has confirmed that it will be represented at the APEC Leaders' meeting by a senior minister, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"President Habibie contacted me last night to confirm that he will not attend the meeting, but that Indonesia would be represented by the Co-ordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry, H.E. Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita.

"Understandably, President Habibie is remaining in Indonesia at this time to deal with the issues surrounding East Timor, but I am pleased that Indonesia is still committed to the APEC process.

"By sending Mr Ginandjar, Indonesia sends a strong signal that it remains committed to the goals of APEC. I look forward to welcoming the Minister at the Leaders' meeting," said Mrs Shipley.
