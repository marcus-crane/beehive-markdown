&lt;p&gt;Government has always acknowledged that some services may not be provided on a commercial basis, and has reserved spectrum in the past to meet various social policy and cultural objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 1998 the Ministry of Commerce invited submissions on the allocation of spectrum in the 101 -108 MHz band. Sixty-four submissions were received, 58 of which sought reservation of spectrum for various "non-commercial" services. Of these proposals, two were national in scope - Youth Radio and National Radio - while the others were more locally based.  
&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Government has decided to reserve spectrum now for the purposes of establishing a national youth radio station and to enable National Radio to broadcast in the FM frequency band. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government will make decisions on the other submissions received by the Ministry of Commerce when an assessment of those submissions has been completed and preliminary engineering appraisals have occurred. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Radio FM proposal will be subject to a satisfactory business case being approved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to youth radio it is envisaged that three months will be required to determine who will be the successful national Youth Radio network provider. This will involve: &lt;/p&gt;

inviting expressions of interest in providing the service  
assessing expressions of interest against agreed criteria regarding content and viability  
and,  
establishing final conditions under which the spectrum licence is held.

&lt;p&gt;Officials from the Ministries for Culture and Heritage and Youth Affairs will assess expressions of interest on the basis of compliance with the following licence conditions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;the service will be constituted as a separate not-for-profit entity&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;it will be self-funding&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;it must be funded from sources other than advertising revenue&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;the management board must be representative of youth and radio interests&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;it must make available to commercial radio, either through simulcasting or delayed broadcasts, any of its programming at no cost&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;the format must promote New Zealand music and arts and provide interactive, educational and advisory services, and&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;of the music and arts content, a significant proportion must be New Zealand content (Australian content would qualify as New Zealand content in accordance with the CER agreement).&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants will be expected to provide a business case, detailing how the service would be operated, and how it would be sustained. This will need to include details on:  
&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;ul&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;sources of funding for the network&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;financial projections over a five year period&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;management and governing Board structure&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;indicative programme schedules, and&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;relevant technical data.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;/ul&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;  
The spectrum will be reserved for a five-year period and the licence will be subject to annual review. Renewal of the licence will be subject to compliance with the agreed licence conditions.  
&lt;/p&gt;
