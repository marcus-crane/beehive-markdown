The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, to whom the Lotteries Commission is responsible, has thanked David Bale for his 12 years service as Chief Executive.

"The circumstances of his resignation is a matter for regret and I shared the Prime Minister's concern at the size of his salary package and the failure to disclose it," Mr Elder said. "But it would be churlish not to acknowledge the success of Mr Bale's efforts in competing for the discretionary dollar and with other forms of gaming, to the benefit of New Zealand's heritage, community arts, sport, cultural groups and countless charities.

"In his time as Chief Executive, the Lotteries Commission has returned more than $2 billion in pre-tax profits. In the last year alone the Commission achieved record sales of $644 million and paid a record $138 million to the Lottery Grants Board for distribution to the community.

"To me, Mr Bale's greatest strength has been in the technical area where the Lotteries organisation with its many products has operated its highly sophisticated computer systems without any hitches.

"I wish Mr Bale well for the future. I'm sure he will find himself in considerable demand internationally."
