Education Minister Nick Smith today launched Te Kete Ipurangi ? the Online Learning Centre, a website based resource for schools, at Karori West Normal School in Wellington.

"This is the beginning of a new era for the use of the Internet in schools. Te Kete Ipurangi is another step in the Government's Information and Communication Technologies Strategy announced last year. More than $4million over three years has been committed to the development of this resource for schools. The website will include reference materials for teachers and principals related to the school curriculum, professional development and best practice, and will be exciting and user friendly for students at all levels."

The Learning Centre Trust won the contract to build the structure of the website in July. The Trust is composed of Copeland Wilson and Associates and Multi Serve Education Trust, who combine a wealth of experience in web based activities and the development of educational resource materials for online use.

"The Internet can be a bewildering place for newcomers, especially for busy teachers with little time to spare. A search such as 'mathematics' turns up over 450,000 entries. Te Kete Ipurangi will enable teachers to find relevant information quickly and easily, in one place. Teachers and principals will also have a role to play in helping shape the site. It is an opportunity for schools to share useful resources and ideas and to build a site that reflects their needs."

Through the Learning in the Third Millennium package announced in this year's budget, every school will have an Internet connection by the end of this year, ensuring everyone can access Te Kete Ipurangi.

"This is only the beginning. In the years ahead, Te Kete Ipurangi will evolve to become the most useful and important resource that schools will have. This launch marks a real beginning to the third millennium for New Zealand schools as they seek to equip their students for the knowledge economy."
