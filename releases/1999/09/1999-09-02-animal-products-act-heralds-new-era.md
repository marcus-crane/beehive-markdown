Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton has welcomed the passing of the Animal Products Bill calling it a momentous occasion for food law in New Zealand.

"The Animal Products Bill represents one of the most significant legislative changes in nearly 30 years. The Bill represents another quantum move forward in the application of modern risk management principles in New Zealand law, particularly as applied to food."

It benchmarks standards for animal products processed in New Zealand. These standards then become the platform to critically assess the import requirements of our trading partners. This will enable more focus to be placed on requirements that will be justified only on the basis of science, health or wholesomeness.

"This approach will greatly enhance New Zealand's negotiating position and has the potential to deliver competitive advantages to our processors. The Bill provides the flexibility and choice for businesses to be innovative in their approach to processing as long as the standards set by Government are met," Mr Luxton said.

"The importance to the New Zealand economy of animal product exports cannot be overstated. For this reason, the safeguarding of official assurances remains a key objective of the Bill. This recognises that importing countries place great value on New Zealand Government issued assurances."

The Bill devolves responsibilities from Government to industry by specifying the duties of key players and imposing penalties for breaches of those duties.

Penalty levels for a number of offences have been increased to accurately reflect the serious consequences of breaches as well as providing a very strong deterrent.

"The animal product exports covered by the Bill comprise in excess of 20 per cent of New Zealand's export revenues. This Bill is a significant addition to New Zealand law and carries with it the potential to have far-reaching and beneficial effects both domestically and overseas," Mr Luxton concluded.
