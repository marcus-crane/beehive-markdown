Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage, today announced three appointments to the Board of the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa.

Chair of the board, Sir Ronald Trotter, has been reappointed until 30 June 2000, while two new members to the board, Glenys Coughlan, Wellington and Professor Judith Binney, Auckland, have both been appointed for three year terms.

"Sir Ronald has brought high level business and financial skills to the board and under his leadership, Te Papa has opened to a highly successful first year of operations," Ms Hasler said.

"Sir Ronald's experience is highly valued and his reappointment will ensure stability and continuity as Te Papa will ensure stability and continuity as Te Papa moves into the new millennium."

New board member Glenys Coughlan is the Chief Executive of the Tourism Industry Association and a member of the Towards 2000 Taskforce.

"Ms Coughlan's expertise in strategic planning, marketing and communications will be of value to Te Papa," Ms Hasler said.

"Judith Binney is Associate Professor of History at the University of Auckland and is the author of a number of significant books on New Zealand and Maori history.

"Professor Binney is a widely respected historian who will bring both an historical and cultural perspective to our national museum."

Paying tribute to departing board members Jenny Gibbs and Dame Anne Salmond, Ms Hasler said, both had served on the board since it was established in 1992.

"They have both made a hugely significant contribution to the museum and their hard work and commitment is highly regarded, both by Government and Te Papa," she said.
