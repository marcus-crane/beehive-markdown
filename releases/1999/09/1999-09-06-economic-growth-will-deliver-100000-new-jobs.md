Treasurer and Clutha-Southland MP Bill English said today that economic growth was the best way to deliver more jobs in Southland, with 100,000 new jobs predicted nationwide over the next three years.

"Those are just the jobs based on predictions of 3% growth each year for the next three years. In fact all the signs are that the economy could grow even faster, and that would mean even more new jobs.

"In Southland new jobs will come from investment in growth areas like forestry, the new horticulture industries and tourism.

"The Alliance's claim today that 2000 new jobs will be created in Southland as a result of Southland's share of a $200 million economic development fund is just nonsense.

"It is high time the Alliance realised that new jobs aren't created from Government handouts. New jobs are created when we are exporting more, when we've got smart people thinking up new business ventures, and when we are encouraging more people to visit New Zealand and spend their money with us.

"The Alliance Fund will put $5.3 million into Southland's economy. This is in marked contrast to the latest tax reductions, which will put $10.7 million into Southlanders' pockets.

"New Zealand can be the Pacific Tiger. But we can't afford to forget what makes the economy tick. The basics still matter and that means keeping inflation down, having flexible labour markets, keeping our economy open and competitive, making sure Government spending is under control, and lowering taxes," said Mr English.
