Treasurer Bill English today challenged Labour's finance spokesman Dr Cullen to explain his comments regarding giving workers new rights to strike.

"Dr Cullen was quoted on National Radio last week (26 August) as saying: "If Air New Zealand pilots want to strike, it's their individual choice. Democratically that's their choice and the present law prevents them from exercising that choice."

"It is against the present law to organise strikes in support of people on a different collective contract. This is to stop the sympathy or secondary  
strikes that we used to see regularly.

"Dr Cullen's statement does give the strong impression that sympathy strikes may be back on the cards under a Labour government, in spite of Ms Clark's  
and Mr Hodgson's assurances that this is not the case. If this isn't what Dr Cullen means, he should spell out exactly what he does mean," said Mr English.
