Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today released details of the attire for the APEC Leaders' Retreat in Auckland.

"The official outfit consists of black woollen trousers, a black long-sleeved polo shirt, and a black sailing jacket. Both tops carry the New Zealand silver fern.

"The polo shirt, designed and manufactured by Snowy Peak of Christchurch, is made of 100 per cent merino wool.

"The sailing jacket, designed and made by Line 7, is inspired by our competitive edge in world yachting and as current holder of the America's Cup. It tells the world of New Zealand's all round confidence, our sporting ability and our export success.

"The fine woollen trousers, also made in New Zealand, set off the outfit.

"I believe the Leaders' attire is an expression of the passion and strength of "Awe Black". It is contemporary in a fashion sense and is the colour proudly worn by all of New Zealand's leading sports teams.

"The essence of pride for all New Zealanders is captured in the striking silver fern on both of the tops.

"The Leaders' attire at APEC '99 tells New Zealand's story: ambitious, competitive and proud - Awe Black," Mrs Shipley said.
