Labour's willingness to consider the Alliance Party's proposed land tax proves that a vote for Labour will deliver New Zealanders with a costly booby prize, according to Rodney MP Lockwood Smith.

The Alliance has proposed the introduction of a new land tax to fund its tertiary education policy. The tax would be levied on the unimproved value of commercial land above $500,000.

"The Alliance's loopy land tax is poorly conceived. Jim Anderton probably thinks he's rather clever taxing land-owners for tertiary education costs. But the reality is that it's Rodney's small businesses that will suffer, because landlords will simply pass the tax burden on to tenants," Lockwood Smith said.

"The policy is just another signal of the left's contempt for private enterprise, which creates more and better jobs in the Rodney District. New taxes always effect those that can least afford them, and the new tax means less wealth, and less jobs in Rodney.

"But what's truly surprising is the Labour Party's decision to consider the new tax in Labour's infamous ‘taxation review'.

"Labour is in a difficult position going into the General Election, because it's simply not credible to think that Labour could form a Government without throwing Jim Anderton a bone or two.

"Michael Cullen's reluctance to hit this loopy proposal ‘for a six' perhaps signals his willingness to countenance a land tax under a Labour-Alliance Government.

"This policy shouldn't even be considered, but under a Labour-Alliance Government, it will be placed on the table for serious discussion.

"Labour voters should start watching infomercials because under a Labour-Alliance Government, we'll all have to get used to hearing ‘But wait ... there's more'", Lockwood Smith concluded.
