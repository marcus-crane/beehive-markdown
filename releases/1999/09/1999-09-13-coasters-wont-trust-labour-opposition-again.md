"The Labour Opposition has a history of making promises before elections then breaking them as soon as they get the chance," said SOE Minister Tony Ryall.

"West Coasters, and all New Zealanders, know that any promises made by Helen Clark, Phil Goff or Michael Cullen are hollow and meaningless.

"Jim Sutton is the only member of the Labour Opposition with any integrity and courage on sustainable forestry.

"Ms Clark, as Deputy Prime Minister, told the country ‘the West Coast Accord would be honoured' and that ‘it is absolutely essential that we keep faith with existing agreements \[the West Coast Accord]'. So much for Ms Clark's ‘absolute' assurances.

"Phil Goff said soon after signing the Accord ‘this is an historic agreement and one which heralds a new approach to resource decision-making based on dialogue and negotiation to achieve the best interests of the West Coast people and native forests'. Mr Goff's ‘historic new approach' based on ‘dialogue and negotiation' has turned into a nightmare for West Coast people.

"And, now Dr Michael Cullen comes to the Coast with new assurances and promises for Coasters. Coasters will never trust him and his Party again.

"Former Labour Cabinet Minister, Trevor de Cleene, candidly revealed just what the Labour Opposition really thinks when it comes to election promises, saying recently ‘if people are stupid enough to believe parties' \[Labour's] promises, then they don't deserve a vote'.

"National is committed to honouring the Accord. The Government recently announced it has agreed to a sustainable beech industry for the Coast.

"No doubt Coasters will be telling Dr Cullen just what he can do with Labour's latest promise," said Mr Ryall.
