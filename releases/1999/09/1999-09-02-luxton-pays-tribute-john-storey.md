Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today paid tribute to the work that Dairy Board Chairman John Storey has done both through his chairmanship of the multi-billion dollar New Zealand Dairy Board and his contribution to the industry generally.

"Mr Storey's contribution over a large number of years at both Dairy Company and at Dairy Board level has been very significant and invaluable. He has been able  
to lead the industry in focussing on its future strategic approach to improve dairy farmer incomes and I am sure that this will be acknowledged over time," Mr  
Luxton said.

"While local dairy farmers have exercised their democratic vote, many at the same time will be sorry to lose Mr Storey's experience and leadership at this  
time of significant strategic change."
