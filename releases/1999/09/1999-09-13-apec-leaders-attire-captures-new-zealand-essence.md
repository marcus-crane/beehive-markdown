Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage, says the official outfits for the APEC leaders captures the essence of New Zealand.

"The fine woollen fabric combined with the silver fern on black is truly emblematic of New Zealand," Ms Hasler said.

"The jacket and trouser concept is stylish, modern and original. I can only compliment the designer for capturing the sense of casual chic New Zealanders are so good at.

"I'm sure the leaders will be proud to wear these outfits in their everyday life."

Ms Hasler whose own dress preference is for black is also a proponent of a silver fern on a black background as New Zealand's national flag.
