Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today outlined three areas where Government and Maori together are making good progress for Maori.

"Land grievance issues need to be brought to a conclusion. New Zealand has grown up in the last decade, confronting its past and facing the future. We will see further significant Treaty settlements between now and the election.

"New Zealanders both pakeha and Maori want issues settled so we can all move ahead.

"To date, real progress has been made and many longstanding grievances have been settled. All New Zealanders can celebrate the success we have all achieved and look ahead with confidence knowing that these issues have been dealt with.

"To build New Zealand's future we must have the confidence and determination to put issues behind us."

Mrs Shipley told the Maori Women's Welfare League annual conference in Waitangi that the Government is looking forward to Waitangi Day next year, and again was determined to make progress.

"I am looking forward to seeing issues concerning the Waitangi Treaty grounds resolved for next year's commemorations, and hope that negotiations can be concluded to achieve this.

"Article one of the Treaty saw both Treaty partners committing themselves to one government. In doing so, our nation's flag must symbolise what we share in common. At Waitangi the New Zealand flag must fly on the centre flagpole next year and every year beyond.

"Having said that, over time I hope that we can accommodate other flags on the Treaty ground if the Taumata Kaumatua of Te Tai Tokerau and the Waitangi Day Organising Committee were to agree. There are other flags which carry great historic and symbolic importance and should have a place on this important national day."

Mrs Shipley also reiterated the Government's commitment to help close the gaps in areas of health, education, justice, welfare, employment and housing between Maori and other New Zealanders.

"The gap remains frustratingly wide in some areas, but good progress is being made. We'll continue to make progress if Maori leaders and Maori families and government commit themselves. All around New Zealand I find examples of this.

"New Zealand is a strong and diverse nation. Maori have a central role in our political, economic, social and cultural life ? present and future. There is a renewed sense of confidence and purpose emerging which is important for all New Zealanders.

"But we cannot rewrite history. We must learn from it in order to move on.

"National has lead the way in dealing with our history in order to build a strong and united New Zealand. I am proud that we have succeeded in doing that," said Mrs Shipley.
