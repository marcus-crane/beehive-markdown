Hon Marie Hasler, Associate Minister for Accident Insurance, says figures contained in the 1998/9 annual report, released today, show ACC's Prevention, Care, Recovery programme is working.

"Figures show a 7% reduction in new claims and the number of long-term claimants receiving weekly compensation has reduced by 5000," Ms Hasler said.

"Clearly, not as many people are being injured, but those who are, or have been, are receiving effective care, treatment and case management.

"This 25th year of accident insurance in New Zealand has been one of outstanding success.

"The introduction of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 and the changes this has brought about, combined with the outstanding results achieved by the Accident Compensation Corporation make this a significant year for all New Zealanders."

"Not only is the accident rate lower, but the Corporation is continuing to increase the number of long term claimants returning to independence. This is leading to a reduction in premiums across all accounts, including the residual claims levy.

"ACC staff are to be congratulated on the positive results achieved by the organisation. These results, across all areas of ACC, have been achieved at a time of huge change for the Corporation.

"I believe all New Zealanders will benefit as a result of the continued success of ACC. Fewer accidents, more people returning to work or independence and the resulting lower premiums means reduced costs for all New Zealanders."

Ms Hasler said the introduction of the Accident Insurance Act and the resulting changes within ACC, have had a significant impact on staff. However, staff had achieved positive results in an environment of change as well as reducing operating costs.

"All ACC staff are to be congratulated on these results," Ms Hasler said.
