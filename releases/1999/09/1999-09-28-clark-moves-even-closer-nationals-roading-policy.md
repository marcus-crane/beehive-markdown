After years of criticising National's roading proposal Better Transport, Better Roads, Labour Leader Helen Clark is moving closer and closer to endorsing it, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

"She's already said Labour would support the building of new toll roads by private companies, which is something we have been advocating for some time. She's also come out saying Labour would work with local authorities as we have and will continue to do," said Mr Williamson.

"Now she's talking about a single roading authority for Auckland. We've been advocating between four and eight roading entities to manage roads which would include one to deal with Auckland.

"I wonder whether Labour have any plans of their own, or will merely keep endorsing National."
