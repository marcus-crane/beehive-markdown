Fisheries Minister John Luxton today totally rejected claims from Forest and Bird's Barry Weeber that New Zealand's Orange Roughy is fished unsustainably.

"These claims are totally irresponsible. New Zealand works hard to ensure that it's fisheries are managed sustainably and are recognised as world leaders in the area of substainable fisheries management".

"I totally refute claims that I am not prepared to take action when a stock is under threat. As Minister of Fisheries I have a statutory responsibility for ensuring that all New Zealand's fisheries are managed sustainably. I do just that".

Mr Luxton said that while New Zealand can proudly promote its Orange Roughy as being managed sustainably, other countries cannot. "This must give New Zealand fish products a leading edge in world markets".

"If Barry Weeber is concerned about endangered species, he would be better off protecting the endangered Labour Party members who are under threat of extinction in places like the West Coast."
