New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has described the inauguration today (Nigerian Time) of new democratically elected Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo as a major turning point in the history of Nigeria, and the beginning of a new era for that country.

"The majority of Nigerians wanted to see this day, which is the dawning of a new, democratic era for Nigeria . By virtue of its sheer size, Nigeria can now be a force for good throughout West Africa," said Mr McKinnon, who attended today's ceremony in Abuja.

"Among the 25-30,000 people attending the inauguration, outgoing President Abubakar was clearly the hero of the crowd for his part in delivering democracy to Nigeria. He deserves congratulations for the steady hand he brought to the country following the death of former military President Abacha.

"General Abubakar is a modest man and one of the few in the military to be trusted by the people of Nigeria."

Mr McKinnon said that the new President, while clearly supported by the people, nevertheless faced immense challenges.

"He has his hands full but he is committed to sorting out corruption and to seeing Nigeria embark on a path of steady growth," Mr McKinnon said.

Most of Africa's Heads of State, including President Mandela of South Africa, attended the inauguration, along with Prince Charles representing the United Kingdom and Rev. Jessie Jackson from the United States. Mr McKinnon attended the inauguration in his role as Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) which played a key role in bringing democracy to Nigeria.
