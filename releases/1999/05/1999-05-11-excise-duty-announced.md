Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control Minister John Luxton, today announced an increase to the rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages.

"This annual adjustment to the rates, based on the 1.010 percent increase in the Consumers Price Index All Groups - Excluding Credit Services in the 12 months ending 31 March 1999, would add about one cent to the tax on a jug of beer, two cents on a bottle of table wine and 17 cents on a 1125ml bottle of whiskey", Mr Luxton said.

The new excise rates, which come into force on 1 June, will raise approximately $4 million in a full year.
