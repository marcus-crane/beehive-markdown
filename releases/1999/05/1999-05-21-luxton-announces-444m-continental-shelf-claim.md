Minister in charge of Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), John Luxton, today announced budget approval for LINZ to spend up to $44 million over eight years to determine the extent of New Zealand's Continental Shelf.

The information from the marine surveys will underpin New Zealand's submission under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to establish the precise outer limits of the ocean floor under our jurisdiction.

"The rights to the sea bed resources of the Continental Shelf will have huge potential benefits for future generations. This project can be compared to the United States purchase of Alaska in 1867, where the benefits of gold and oil have flowed into the 20th century."

"Before our submission can be finalised, LINZ must commission detailed marine surveys of an ocean area equivalent to the size of Western Australia. These surveys require a specialist vessel which is equipped to measure the depth, slope, and depth of sediment of the sea bed."

Any one of these factors could form the basis of the UNCLOS submission.

"Once the limits of the shelf are established, we can then plan the management of seabed resources such as the hydrocarbons in the north west area of the Shelf, " Mr Luxton said.

New Zealand has until 2006 to lodge its submission. LINZ will call tenders for its first survey from the year 2000.
