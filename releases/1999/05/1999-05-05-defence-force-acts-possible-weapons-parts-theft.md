Allegations of theft of weapon parts and ammunition from the Trentham Camp weapon repair facility, which may have led to the unlawful manufacture of weapons, are being treated extremely seriously, Defence Minister Max Bradford and Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Carey Adamson said today.

Mr Bradford and Air Marshal Adamson said Police had been immediately alerted once the allegations had been drawn to the Defence Force's attention. The weapon repair facility is managed under contract by Serco Project Engineering Ltd (SPEL).

Police, assisted by Military Police, today executed a number of search warrants in Trentham Camp Upper Hutt, Linton, Waiouru and the Auckland region.

Mr Bradford and Air Marshal Adamson said the Army would not have full details of any alleged offending and whether any army personnel were involved, until enquiries were completed.

"We regard this matter extremely seriously."

The Army had suspended, with the co-operation of SPEL, the weapon repair element of its contract with SPEL, pending the completion of the investigation.

It had also initiated a comprehensive audit of the weapon repair facility as well as the stocks of weapon parts and ammunition, Mr Bradford and Air Marshal Adamson said.

All media enquiries relating to this matter are being handled by the Army's Public Relations officer, Major Bede Fahey, 025 443-404.
