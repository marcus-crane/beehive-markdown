An informal gathering in Johannesburg of New Zealand and South African business people, traders and sports professionals has decided to establish a networking group, encouraged by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon

Representatives of a range of companies met with the Minister this week in Johannesburg to explore how New Zealand 's growing trade with South Africa can be further expanded. Participants shared trading experiences and identified a number of obstacles to trade; foremost among them being tariff barriers to New Zealand's dairy and meat exports.

"This problem was recognised by a Commission set up last year by both Governments to further the two-way relationship, and efforts are underway to try to ease this difficulty for exporters.

"I encouraged the business community in South Africa to build on the sound base that had been established. The New Zealand Government fully supports the contribution of exporters in building up confidence in each other's markets, which has a positive effect on the overall relationship," Mr McKinnon said.

Trade between New Zealand and South Africa stands at around NZ$172 million, and is roughly in balance. New Zealand currently exports nearly $88 million worth of goods to South Africa, of which about 45 percent is manufactured goods.

"However, there has been impressive growth of around 62 percent in two-way trade since South Africa became a democracy under President Mandela in 1994, and that momentum looks set to continue. Tourism has become an important element in the economic relationship, with tourist flows already considerable," Mr McKinnon said.

The gathering in Johannesburg included New Zealand High Commissioner to South Africa René Wilson and Trade New Zealand's Johannesburg Representative Michelle Cohen. Also attending were veteran All Black Don Clarke, former All Black coach Laurie Mains and former New Zealand cricket captain Ken Rutherford.
