Associate Minister of Health Hon Georgina te Heuheu today emphasised the Government's message that the health system had seen the end of major reform, and that all the Government's energy was going into improving the health of New Zealanders.

"I want to thank New Zealanders for bearing with us during the reform process. Its important that we now get on making the structure deliver better care for families and communities."

"The Government's focus is ensuring that each and every New Zealander has confidence and certainty that they will receive the right care by the right person at the right time.

"The Hospital Services plan covering hospital services for the next three years and the Roadside to Beside plan for emergency and accident care are key planks in our approach to ensuring stability of services." She said, "Yesterday we announced the new telephone HealthLine and funding for PlunketLine. These initiatives are good news for families."

"I am pleased to be part of a Government that gets on with the job of investing in the health of New Zealanders."

"More money than ever before is going into our health services. In real terms there is 40% more money going into health now than in 1990. That's a real increase of $300 per person.

"The new money means our hospitals are delivering 22,000 extra operations a year as part of putting the booking systems in place. In 1997 there were 4,700 cardiac operations up almost 8% on the previous year and 6,668 joint replacements up more than 5%.

"People are happy with the care they are getting. The latest New Zealand Health Survey shows that nine out of ten adults reported being either very satisfied or satisfied with the way they had been looked after by the people they had seen for health care or advice in the past year."
