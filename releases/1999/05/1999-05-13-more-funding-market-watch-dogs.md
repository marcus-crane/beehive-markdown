New funding of $7.639 million to strength the Commerce Commission's market watchdog role was announced by Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today.

"This funding, which will be spread over three years, will allow the Commission to be more proactive in monitoring market place activity," Mr Bradford said.

"A closer watch will be kept on natural monopolies, including network industries, to ensure that innovation is not stifled by anti-competitive behaviour," he said.

The Commission will receive an extra $1.328 million a year from 1999/00 onwards to strengthen enforcement of the Commerce Act and the Fair Trading Act.

In addition, it will receive a litigation expense allowance of $0.281 million in 1999/00 and $1.688 million from 2000/01 onwards.

Mr Bradford also announced increased funding of $1.07 million over three years for the Securities Commission.

"Investor confidence is important to encouraging investment in New Zealand's securities markets.

"Ensuring we have good securities market regulation, that conforms to international best practice, and strong regulations enforcement are key elements in maintaining this confidence," he said.

"The funding change represents a significant increase in funds available for enforcement.

"It will allow New Zealand to contribute more effectively to international discussions on securities market regulation and ensure New Zealand's voice is heard.

"It will also allow the Commission to contribute to the comprehensive review of the Securities Regulations," Mr Bradford said.

The Securities Commission will receive $0.281 million a year to increase its enforcement functions.

The Commission also receives an additional $0.113 million in 1999/00 and 2000/01 to enable it to effectively contribute to the current review of the Securities Regulations 1983.

Finally, an additional $0.113 million will be provided in 1999/00 to ensure that New Zealand's point of view is put at international discussions on regulation of securities markets.
