"The agreement on East Timor signed today by the Indonesian and Portuguese Foreign Ministers represents a significant political breakthrough in the future of East Timor," said Foreign Minister Don McKinnon. Two other important agreements were also signed on security arrangements and modalities for the ballot on 8 August.

The Minister recalled that the two Governments had been negotiating under United Nations auspices for many years, and he commended the parties to the talks on bringing them to fruition.

"However there is still a great deal of work to be done to ensure that the East Timorese are able to vote on the autonomy package in an atmosphere of safety and calm, without intimidation," the Minister noted.

"It is vital that the Indonesian Government fulfil its commitment to maintain peace and security in East Timor and in particular bring under control and disarm militia groups that have terrorised people in recent incidents and act with impunity against the express intentions of the Indonesian authorities themselves. There is a big challenge to restore order so the United Nations is able to work freely to implement these agreements."

"I am especially pleased to hear that United Nations staff are already on their way to East Timor. Their presence will be an enormous confidence booster."

"New Zealand will step up its discussions with the UN and other interested countries to finalise how we can contribute to the United Nations presence in East Timor. I will be updating my Cabinet colleagues immediately after my return."

Mr McKinnon was speaking from Jakarta after his meeting with President Habibie at which he reinforced the international community's concerns about the situation in East Timor. He also discussed political developments in advance of next month's crucial General Election in Indonesia.
