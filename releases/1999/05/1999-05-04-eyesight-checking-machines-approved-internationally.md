Eyesight checking machines used by driver licensing agents have been approved internationally, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

He was responding to claims made earlier today by Optometrists Association president John McLennan that the machine was not that reliable.

"There are 26,000 of these units used throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. The Federal Aviation Authority uses them in the United States," Mr Williamson said.

He said a number of groups were consulted on the use of the machine in New Zealand, including the Optometrists Association.

"In October 1998, when the Optometrists Association was told of the machine's preference, they agreed that it was a good machine."

Trials conducted over the last week indicated an 18 percent failure rate, but a large majority of those involved knew they had eye problems, so the result was not surprising," said Mr Williamson.

"The fact is that if you can't see properly, you shouldn't be driving."

Mr Williamson said the machines performed a cost-effective function, checking how well drivers could see at a distance and to their sides.

"If a licensing agent picks up a problem, the applicant will need to show a medical or eyesight certificate before a licence is issued."

"The checking of eyesight is an important road safety measure, and an important aspect of the new driver licensing regime," said Mr Williamson.
