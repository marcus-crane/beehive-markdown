"The latest New Zealand health survey report, Taking the Pulse, paints a good picture of the health services available to New Zealanders, with nine out of ten adults satisfied with their overall health care," Minster of Health Wyatt Creech said today.

"I welcome the report which was launched today by the Ministry of Health. It gives us an accurate view of what is really happening in health in New Zealand.

"It is a summary of people's real life experiences, rather than anecdotes that are often relied on in discussions about our health services.

"It will prove to be a valuable resource for all those in the health sector, telling us where New Zealanders are at with their health status, and how they use the services available.

"It well help us to make changes where they need to happen.

"In the health utilisation section it shows that nine out of ten adults were either very satisfied or satisfied with their overall health care and the same amount were either very satisfied or satisfied with their last GP visit. Only four percent reported being either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied."

Mr Creech noted that a recent NBR poll also showed people's improved perceptions of the standard of health care they are getting. The May 21 survey showed 55% thought the standard of hospital services was good.

"Taking the Pulse pulls together information on a range of health risk behaviours like alcohol use, high blood pressure, smoking and physical activity, it illustrates how New Zealanders themselves rate their physical and mental health status and also shows their perception of the health services on offer."

Taking the Pulse is available from all public libraries, will be posted on the Ministry of Health website (www.moh.govt.nz) or can be purchased from the Ministry of Health for $30.
