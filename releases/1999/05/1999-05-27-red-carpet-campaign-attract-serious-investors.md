Today's strategy launch to target serious investors to bring their big ideas, capital and skills to New Zealand will benefit our country greatly, said Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

"New Zealand has a wealth of smart, innovative people but they need serious investment from overseas to make the most of their potential. This is a determined strategy to bring big investors here to get the next lift for New Zealand," she said.

"Discover New Zealand" is a high quality package to excite and inform a select number of wealthy overseas investors who have expressed an interest in New Zealand.

The package is made up of a series of practical booklets with a CD-Rom produced by the New Zealand Trade Development Board. It provides information ranging from the New Zealand economy through to lifestyle and case studies of successful local and offshore companies in New Zealand.

Alongside this targeted package is a publication called 'About New Zealand' that provides a picture of life in New Zealand. It has been produced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to answer queries from potential visitors and investors.

"The strategy is part of the Government's drive to attract more job-creating investment, announced by Trade Minister Lockwood Smith last October. It is also a component of Enterprise and Innovation Minister Max Bradford's Five Steps Ahead strategy to progress New Zealand's knowledge based economy.

"Now is the time to make the most of New Zealand's moment in the international spotlight from big events this year such as APEC, the America's Cup and the Millennium," said Mrs Shipley.

Potential investors are not just interested in balance sheets when making decisions about whether to invest here. Our quality of life is attracting people and giving us the edge over other nations competing for these same investors.

"Attracting solid overseas investment is essential if we are to create an environment that provides opportunities for future generations. That is the key to encouraging young, highly skilled New Zealanders to remain in New Zealand," said Mrs Shipley.
