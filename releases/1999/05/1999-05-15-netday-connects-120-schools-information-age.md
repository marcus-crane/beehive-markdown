Education Minister Nick Smith commended the 120 schools and thousands of volunteers who spent today installing cable networks throughout their school.

"Schools have got to keep pace with the information technology revolution if our children are to gain the skills to work and live in the 21st century. While some schools have embraced 'Star-Trek' technology, most are closer to the horse trek era. My challenge is to encourage all schools to be equipped and confident with information technology."

Dr Smith joined 20 volunteers at New Zealand's oldest school in Wakefield installing 1600 metres of state of the art cabling. Wakefield School's new network has three hubs and two outlets in each room. The effort is being mirrored in over 120 other schools in the NetDay initiative. NetDay is a community, school and business partnership to assist schools in interconnecting classrooms and schools to the Internet.

"There is a sense of history in installing state of the art cabling on the dawn of the new century in New Zealand's oldest school. There is also an interesting parallel in that 70 years ago a group of volunteers dragged power cables through the school to introduce the then latest technology - electricity."

The Government has launched an IT Strategy for schools that includes a major investment in professional development, a new online resource centre and assistance for a computer recycling scheme. A goal of having every school connected to the internet by year's end has also been set.

"The challenge for schools in keeping up with the demands of the information age are huge. Community and business help is essential. The Government is also going to have to do more to help schools."
