Associate Minister of Health, Hon Tuariki Delamere, will host a hui in Island Bay on Wednesday, June 9, to promote discussion in the pharmaceutical industry on new drugs that are becoming available and how they should be funded.

The hui, to be held at Tapu Te Ranga marae, will be chaired by the Minister and attended by representatives of a number of the major pharmaceutical companies; PHARMAC, the government's drug-buying agency; PHARMAC'S professional advisors; the Health Funding Authority and the Researched Medicines Institute.

"Two previous hui involving the industry have been highly successful and it is my hope that this meeting will achieve similar results," said Mr Delamere.

The themes of the hui will be "New drugs - what are the X-factors that make some truly innovative?" and "How should they be funded?"

Media note: The hui is closed to the media, but reporters are welcome to attend at 5.15pm to interview the participants at the end of the meeting.
