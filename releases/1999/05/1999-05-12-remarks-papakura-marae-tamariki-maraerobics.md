Background

Tamariki Maraerobics is a television series based on the successful Te Hau Kori a Rehia Tamariki Maraerobics Team which has members aged from 11 to 13 years.

Maori is the language of instruction.

The programme designers have a vision of a cultural lifestyle where health and exercise are as much a part of daily life as eating and sleeping.

It is a lifestyle we should want to live, that we can be proud of and want to pass on to future generations.

We should all want Maori people to be fit, and to identify with healthy lifestyles and people. We should want our children to think, "We are Maori, therefore we are healthy, we are fit".

The origins of the exercises in Maraerobics can be traced to influence from haka, poi, waiata-a-ringa (action songs), Kopikopi (hand games), weapon drills and whaikorero.

The future of Maraerobics will be influenced by its impact on young people, their aspirations and a dynamic approach to Maori culture, it is a future my Government is confident in.

An 8 week series was successfully screened on ETV in 1997. The response, with even this limited broadcast was significant.

Since then the team has matured, its talent has improved and its profile has increased through school and sports visits, and with national Television exposure with performances on What Now! And the 1998 MDC Maori Sports Awards.

Ad Breaks / Health and Safety Commercials

Ad Breaks are interspersed throughout the programme but they are not for standard commercials but are Health and Safety messages on a range of high priority issues, including:

- Injury prevention
- Smoking
- Seat belts and child restraints
- Dental health and care
- Road Safety
- Smoke Alarms
- 5 + a day
- Cold water treatment for burns
- Vehicle speed
- Glue ear checks
- Not leaving kids in cars unattended

These messages are presented in Maori by the Tamariki Maraerobics team members and it is hoped some well recognised Maori personalities and Sports men and women.

These visual images play an important role in providing messages for kids by kids.

Our hope is that this form of peer education will make these messages "cool" to the target audience and will bring attitudinal change amongst the children and their families towards these health issues.

Hopefully children will adopt these kids as role models, and learn to value people who are not that much different to themselves.

A number of the messages just promote healthy lifestyles, e.g. brush your teeth twice a day, wear a helmet, wear a seatbelt.

And some of the messages promote behavioural issues like child abuse or parents leaving unattended children in cars in carparks at the supermarket or pub.

These messages can be installed in children so they can know that this is not right.

Children seeing messages where the older sisters and brothers help their younger brothers and sisters allow them to become "local" role models in the future.

Television Broadcast

The target audience for the series are Maori people aged from 3 to 25 years, the secondary target audience in non-Maori in the same age group.

From the perspective of Tamariki Aerobics Marae style, fun is how we hope to encourage more participants, who in turn receive direct benefits to their health.

If it's fun then there is an increased chance they will do it everyday.

It is through this medium of fun and entertainment that we place the health and safety ads - it gives the tamariki a chance to rest and it makes them attentive and wide-eyed to the messages that are coming up.

Aerobics by nature is much like "Simon Says .... put your right foot in, put your right foot out".

The instructor is very influential, their commands have a hypnotic effect on the participants.

If an instructor says - "put your right foot in", you're not going to stick your left hand up - you will be out of place and look uncoordinated.

So you try your best to follow the same. Instructors doing these aerobics routines are now saying to their audience: Remember:

- wear a seat belt
- put your helmet on
- don't play with matches and lighters
- brush your teeth twice a day
- never ever smoke
- wash your hands after going to the toilet - before eating food

If the important messages they need know about - staying alive and enjoying a quality life - are heard many times, children will hopefully remember what the right thing is all the time.
