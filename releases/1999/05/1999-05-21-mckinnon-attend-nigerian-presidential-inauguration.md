Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will attend the inauguration of the new democratically elected Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, in Abuja on 29 May.

President-elect Obasanjo was elected in February this year. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), of which Mr McKinnon is Vice-Chairman, recently concluded that the elections provided a sufficient basis to lift Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth. This decision was endorsed unanimously by Commonwealth Heads of Government this week.

"It will be an honour to attend the inauguration of President-elect Obasanjo. Nigeria's recent past has been a sad one. Outgoing President Abubakar deserves our congratulations for the role he has played in returning Nigeria to democracy and thus to the Commonwealth family of nations. Our presence at the inauguration will underline this," Mr McKinnon said.

The Foreign Minister will also briefly visit South Africa where he will launch the NZ/South Africa Business Circle on 24 May, and will pay 1-day visits to Lesotho and Swaziland (25 and 26 May) to discuss bilateral and Commonwealth business.

Mr McKinnon will meet French Foreign Minister Vedrine and other Ministers in Paris (1-2 June), and Italian Foreign Minister Dini and Trade Minister Fassino in Rome (2-3 June).

"Italy and France are both important to New Zealand, as trading partners and as key members of the European Community, and I will take the opportunity of reinforcing our ties with these two countries, as I did with Germany earlier this month."

Before returning to New Zealand, Mr McKinnon will visit Malta (3-4 June) to meet President de Marco, Prime Minister Fenech Adami, and Foreign Minister Borg.

Mr McKinnon departs New Zealand on Saturday 22 May and returns to New Zealand on Sunday 6 June.
