Police Minister Clem Simich today expressed his deepest sadness upon learning of the death of Constable Murray Stretch, who was killed on duty last night while investigating a burglary in Mangakino.

"My profound sympathies go out to Constable Stretch's family and friends, especially his partner, his former wife and his two sons during this time", said Mr Simich.

"I know Constable Stretch's colleagues and the Mangakino community will also be shocked by this senseless tragedy and my thoughts are with them too.

"Constable Stretch's death highlights the risks and dangers of frontline policing and the dedication of police officers to their duty. "The people of New Zealand are indebted to police officers like Constable Stretch for the work they do", Mr Simich said.

"A police officer since 1994, Constable Stretch was a respected and valued member of the Mangakino community. His contribution to policing and youth at risk initiatives will be greatly missed.

"I know the wider police family will feel his loss and will ensure that Constable Stretch's family and friends are supported as they come to terms with his death."
