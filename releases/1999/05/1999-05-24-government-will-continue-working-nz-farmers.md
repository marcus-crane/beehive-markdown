Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight that she was looking forward to meeting Meat New Zealand Chairman John Acland tomorrow.

"Meat producers can be assured that this Government is making every effort to pursue the United States to be responsible in relation to the US lamb imports.

"Indeed before Mr Acland went to the United States I had personally written to President Clinton putting New Zealand's case. This Government will continue lobbying at the highest possible levels right up until a decision is taken.

"Any suggestion that New Zealand isn't taking the lamb issue seriously because of Mike Moore's World Trade Organisation bid are off the mark.

"Government Ministers and myself together with our Ambassador in Washington, Rt Hon Jim Bolger, have been actively involved in a strategy to get the United States to make a fair decision.

"I have been pleased that Government Ministers and officials have been working closely with Meat New Zealand and Federated Farmers in putting a compromise position to the US Government and industry leaders.

"I intend to continue to work to achieve the best possible result for New Zealand farmers.

"If the decision is detrimental to New Zealand, this Government will consider all its options including taking a case to the World Trade Organisation," said Mrs Shipley.
