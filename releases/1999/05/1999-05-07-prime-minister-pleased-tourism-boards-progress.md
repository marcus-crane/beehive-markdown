Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she was pleased the New Zealand Tourism Board was considering all its options on the recovery of payments to two former board members.

"I am pleased that they have asked to work with the Government on facilitating the best resolution to this issue, and that is what we will be doing.

"I agree with the board that a joint effort between the Tourism Board and the Crown looks to be the best path to secure a resolution," Mrs Shipley said.

"I have asked new Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith to pick up the issue and work with the Tourism Board and the person or people the Government nominates to work on this issue."
