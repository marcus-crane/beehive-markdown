New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel began two new initiatives this weekend to assist the Bougainville peace process, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Five Army engineers left for Bougainville last weekend to supervise construction work for the small community of Waikunai, while On Sunday 25 young people from Bougainville arrived at Burnham Military Camp in Canterbury to undergo a 10-week youth training programme.

Both projects are being funded by New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA).

Mr McKinnon said it was pleasing to announce these new initiatives one year after the Bougainville Ceasefire Signing on 30 April 1998.

"On this first anniversary of the Ceasefire, it is particularly pleasing to announce more initiatives to help Bougainville along the road to peace. It is a sign of New Zealand's continued willingness to support the peace process through our NZODA programme as well as by our contribution to the Peace Monitoring Group.

"We have been working on these initiatives for some time. While New Zealand has been actively engaged in assisting the Bougainville leadership find solutions to problems which have emerged since the Lincoln Agreement was signed last year, we also wanted to work at the grassroots level on Bougainville, where the heart of many of these problems lie."

Mr McKinnon said the engineers would initially supervise the construction of a double classroom near Wakunai, on the east coast of Bougainville.

"Engineers from Linton Army Camp have been preparing for the trip since March, after visiting Bougainville to discuss the project with the Wakunai community," he said.

"The concept is to assist with the rebuilding of infrastructure lost during the conflict, while also generating some income in the area by hiring local labour. At the same time, it will provide the engineers with valuable work experience in the Pacific Islands," he said.

The youth training programme at Burnham, with assistance from Aranui High School, is designed to assist former combatants in the transition to a post-conflict society.

"This course has been specifically developed from the Army's Limited Service Volunteer (LSV) programme and is aimed at teaching the trainees individual and team-building skills, while also instilling discipline and self-esteem," Mr McKinnon said.
