The return of New Zealand Defence Force's medical team and Hercules from the Balkans has nothing to do with money, Defence Minister Max Bradford said today.

"Helen Clark's suggestion that it is due to "meanness over money," is totally wrong.

"Miss Clark is looking for a conspiracy, but with a caucus like hers that is to be expected."

"Her comments indicate a remarkably short memory.

"On April 12, when Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced the aircraft and personnel would be sent to the Balkans, she said the contingent would return by the end of May.

"It was clearly stated the deployment was for 30 days only.

"It was always envisaged the aircraft would return by the end of this month as it is due for a major servicing," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford said New Zealand was following the example of other countries such as England, which is scaling back its military medical presence and allowing civilian agencies, such as the Red Cross, to take the lead in assisting refugees.

The cost of sending the aircraft, loading and medical teams to the Balkans was about $1.2 million, he said.
