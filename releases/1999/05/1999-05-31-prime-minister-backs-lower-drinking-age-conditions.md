"New Zealand 18 and 19-year-olds should be trusted to drink alcohol in pubs and cafes. New Zealand must achieve a change in drinking culture. More effective enforcement and much stronger penalties for liquor licence holders will also be necessary," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight.

"I personally support lowering the drinking age from 20 to 18 years with two conditions;

1.that photo identification is used for proof of age; and 2.that much stronger penalties are introduced, such as the removal of liquor licences from hosts who sell alcohol to underage drinkers.

"New Zealand must achieve a change in our attitude to alcohol consumption, with a move towards responsible and moderate drinking. Binge drinking at booze barns is a thing of the past. We now have a very sophisticated and exciting cafe culture that is enjoyed by families and individuals throughout New Zealand.

"If we are to achieve this we must be realistic and face up to the fact that 18 and 19 year olds are drinking. They must be encouraged to drink safely.

"This change can be brought about by successful education campaigns like those of the Alcohol Liquor Advisory Council. We need to keep the pressure up to ensure society maintains a responsible attitude towards alcohol.

"Families must also take much more responsibility in controlling the access to alcohol by their young people. Parents must also share the responsibility of knowing where their young people are in the early hours of the morning.

"The time is right for change. We have a new high-integrity identification system in the new drivers' licences which means people can't easily lie about their age. Bar operators should now be able to verify the age of drinkers with more confidence," she said.

Mrs Shipley outlined her personal views on liquor laws to about 500 secondary students at a youth forum in Christchurch this evening. Parliament is currently considering the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill which proposes lowering the drinking age, which will be a conscience issue for MPs.

Mrs Shipley stressed that simply changing a law was not the only answer.

"For example, we have introduced tougher measures to combat drink driving but these have only worked because of a change in the mindset of society.

"I am confident this attitude will be picked up by 18 and 19 year olds as we recognise their rights as adults.

"While I know there are some who argue for no change, they do nothing to achieve an improved or more realistic approach to the consumption or supply of alcohol.

"We must do so based on strong values of personal responsibility and a confidence in the type of society we are able to develop into.

"We have an opportunity to challenge our society's attitudes to drinking. Let's not waste it," Mrs Shipley said.
