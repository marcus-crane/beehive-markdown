Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control Minister John Luxton today commended Forest Research for their commitment to forest health and biosecurity, when opening their new quarantine facilities in Rotorua.

"This state-of-the-art facility is a significant investment in an area of strategic importance to the forestry sector. It is the only one of its kind in the country and provides the forest industry with the best quarantine services available. It is also one of the first facilities to meet MAF's new plant pest quarantine standards."

"The Government spends $82 million a year on biosecurity. We take our commitment to protecting our borders very seriously. New Zealand has one of the best biosecurity risk management systems anywhere in the world. "

"As a trading nation there will always be risks, but our border protection systems are designed to minimise and manage these risks. This $500,000 facility adds to our investment in biosecurity and will go a long way towards protecting the health of a $2.6 billion industry."

The new facilities include a plant pest diagnostic laboratory, which will identify insect and fungal pathogens intercepted at our borders, and invertebrate quarantine containment rooms which will be used to develop control methods, or to rear natural enemies for the control of forest pests already in New Zealand.

The premises are also extremely secure. No material leaves the quarantine rooms without being treated first, either by freezing, soaking in bleach, autoclaving, or incinerating.

"This facilities will help secure the health of New Zealand's commercial and indigenous forest estates, into the new millennium. It will also help protect our farming sector from biosecurity threats, " Mr Luxton concluded.
