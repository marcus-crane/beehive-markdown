"The new hospital developments in Auckland announced today will ensure people have access to better services that can keep pace with future changes to modern medicine," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"The investment in Auckland hospital services is an investment for all New Zealand.

"As a nation we are reliant on Auckland Healthcare hospitals to provide the more complicated hospital services and treatment.

"The project involves big improvements to the current way services are delivered.

"It holds huge potential for staff, patients, Aucklanders and the rest of New Zealand.

"Not only will the eight storey hospital and new "ambulatory" medical centre mean modern facilities, but they will mean better co-ordination and delivery of patient care.

"For example acutely ill people won ?t be transferred between hospitals as currently happens meaning patient safety is increased.

"The Government is committed to giving the public certainty and confidence that the mix and quality of health services are appropriate to the needs of today and the future, and achieving stability and reliability in service coverage.

"The new hospital developments in central Auckland, and plans for expanded services for the west and north of Auckland are evidence of that commitment,' Mr Creech concluded.
