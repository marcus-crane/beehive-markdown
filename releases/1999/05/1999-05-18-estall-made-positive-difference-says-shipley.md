Roger Estall made a positive difference to the Fire Service and helped save more lives through the changes he succeeded in implementing, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight after Mr Estall tendered his resignation as Chairman of the Fire Service Commission.

"Mr Estall has made a significant contribution in modernising the Fire Service and improving the safety of New Zealanders and their property.

"He has, over recent weeks, offered to step down if it would help make progress in further modernising New Zealand's approach to reducing fire risk. It is with great reluctance this offer has been accepted, given the real progress that was being made.

"Mr Estall leaves his role with the knowledge that fewer people have died from fires as a result of his positive work.

"There were 19 fatalities from fires in the year to 30 April, down 21 per cent on the previous year, and rural fires have dropped 23 per cent over the same period.

"Mr Estall has performed admirably amid an environment of bitter and unjustified criticism."

Mrs Shipley said Mr Estall was working with the Fire Service Chief Executive to resolve differences between the Commission and the Fire Service which arose earlier this year.

"Unfortunately, certain people tried to derail this process by personally attacking Mr Estall. Those attacks are totally unfounded and unjustified and the statistics stack up in Mr Estall's favour. The benefits of his work will endure long beyond his stepping down."

Mrs Shipley said the Government's acceptance of Mr Estall's resignation would allow for a clean break and a new start.

The Government hopes to appointment a new chairman as soon as possible, the Prime Minister said.
