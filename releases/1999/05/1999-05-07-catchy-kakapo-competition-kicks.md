Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched a competition to name this season's record-breaking additions to the kakapo population - four females and two males.

"With a record number of chicks born this year, we need help finding names for all of them! Six chicks in one year is a record - especially the four precious females, which will be crucial for the survival of the species. These chicks bring the total number of kakapo left in the world to 62, with only 26 females among them."

Dr Smith and Kerry McDonald, Managing Director of Comalco New Zealand, the Kakapo Recovery Plan sponsor, wrote to all Southland Primary Schools this week encouraging their students to enter as most of the kakapo live on islands off the coast of Southland. However, the competition is open to all school students and New Zealand residents.

"New Zealand faces a huge biodiversity challenge in trying to ensure the survival of our endangered species. This competition is a way we can connect with our young New Zealander's and bring conservation issues into the classroom."

In addition to the satisfaction of naming a chick, individual winners will be invited to visit the kakapo chicks in their new homes in the wild. They will also win a one-year membership to Forest & Bird's magazine and Kiwi Conservation Club. Mr McDonald said Comalco would provide an additional prize of $1000 to the school of any student who thinks up a winning entry.

Dr Smith also said the most successful kakapo mother, Lisa, is on the move this Mother's Day. Lisa, mother of three of the female chicks, is being transferred from Little Barrier Island to Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds. The move of kakapo was part of DOC's new management regime. Pulsed management, or providing extra food every couple of years, might be the next advancement with kakapo recovery. The first pulse would happen in 1999, hopefully prompting breeding in the 2000/2001 season. Five of her male buddies from Little Barrier were also on the move - they're off to Whenua Hou (Codfish Island), off the coast of Stewart Island. Whenua Hou was freed of rats this year.

Entries for the naming competition close on 31 May, 1999. Winning entries will be chosen by a panel of judges representing the Kakapo Recovery Programme partners, Comalco New Zealand, Forest & Bird, and the Department of Conservation (DOC) and local iwi, Ngai Tahu and Ngati Wai. The winning names will be announced on World Environment Day, June 5.
