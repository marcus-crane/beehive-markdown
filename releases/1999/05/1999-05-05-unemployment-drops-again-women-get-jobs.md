Another drop in unemployment confirms the economy is on the right track and business confidence is strong, said the Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

Today's release of the Household Labour Force Survey saw the official unemployment rate fall from 7.7% to 7.2%.

Large numbers of women taking up full and part-time work were the major driver behind today's lower unemployment figures. Female unemployment fell 10% over the first three months of this year. This is also reflected in the numbers on the DBP, which fell 4,000 in the first three months of this year.

"For all the doom and gloom spun by the opposition - who claimed unemployment would hit 9% - we've seen 15,000 more people get jobs in the March quarter than the December one.

"The economic policies of this government have helped businesses out there create 5,000 new full-time jobs, and 12,000 part time positions, " Mr Sowry said.

"We're talking about 15,000 people in new jobs, in growth areas like agriculture, forestry, fishing, health and communications services.

"And I'm particularly delighted to see the trend in Gisborne and Hawkes Bay turning the corner - after today's 2.3% drop, unemployment in those areas is now below the national average at 6.6%."

Mr Sowry said the economy was picking up speed and he looked forward to more falls as the impact of Government's employment policies, like one-on-one case management, take effect.
