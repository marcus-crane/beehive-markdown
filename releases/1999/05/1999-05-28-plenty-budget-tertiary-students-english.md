Finance Minister Bill English rebuffed suggestions that there was nothing in the Budget for tertiary students when he attended a student forum at Otago University in Dunedin today.

"Funding for tertiary education, including student support, is projected to be nearly $2 billion in the 1999/2000 year, an increase of more than $80 million from this year. Tertiary funding will have increased by more than $230 million in the last five years.

"These big increases are being driven by increases in student numbers. The number of Government-funded full-time equivalent places has increased by 31 percent since 1990.

"From this year the Government has removed the cap on Government-funded places in tertiary education. That means that anyone who wants to go to on to further study can do so, whether they've just left school, are from a minority group, or are an older second-chance student.

"The Government has made a trade-off and decided we want to see everybody who wants to do tertiary study being able to do so, rather than restricting the numbers and paying more for each student.

"This policy has worked. In 1991 there were around 142,000 students in tertiary education. Last year there were 214,000. More New Zealanders are getting advanced qualifications and that is what this Government wants to see. We have to lift our skills and our knowledge base and that's what we are doing," said Mr English.
