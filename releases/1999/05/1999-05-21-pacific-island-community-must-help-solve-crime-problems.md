Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said Pacific Island leaders and their communities held the key to reducing crime problems  
among young Pacific Island men.

At a Pacific Island Youth Justice Seminar in Papatoetoe, Mrs Shipley said Government agencies must involve community  
groups in determining local solutions for offending by Pacific people.

"The Pacific Island community is over represented in crime statistics, and we must find ways to reduce this high rate of  
offending.

"Criminal convictions for Pacific men increased by 71 per cent from 1990 to 1996.

"There is an urgent need to break the cycle so that criminal offending by Pacific men does not become an intergenerational  
problem."

Mrs Shipley said the high attendance at the seminar reflected a genuine commitment by the Pacific Island community to solving the crime problems of Pacific people.

She said the Government's Strengthening Families strategy and other key initiatives in yesterday's Budget would help to reduce criminal offending. Some of the Budget initatives include:

- neighbourhood safety programmes in Whangarei, Lower Hutt and Otara.
- extra $41 million for Family Start.
- extra $19.7 million for eight targeted enforcement police teams.
- extra $1.3 million for programmes to reduce bullying in schools.
- extra $21.7 million for alternative education for expelled students.
- extra $10.4 million for 70 social workers in 175 schools.

Mrs Shipley said there were many great Pacific Island role models in New Zealand, particularly high profile sports stars like many of today's All Blacks.

"But equally we have a high number of young Pacific men in trouble - people who are perhaps role models themselves for future generations.

"And we've got to do something to turn this around.

"The Pacific Island culture is rich in tradition and beauty and it must use that richness to instill pride and goodwill in the Pacific youth of today so that they may become All Black role models for their children, and not another statistic," Mrs Shipley said.
