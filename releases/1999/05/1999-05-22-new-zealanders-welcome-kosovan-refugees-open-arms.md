The first of 200 Kosovan refugee families arrived in Auckland today to a more certain future, safe environment and a warm welcome from New Zealanders, said Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

"These 22 families have come a long way from a dangerous war-torn homeland to settle in a new country and we will do everything we can to provide them and their children with a safe and secure future.

"There has been an outpouring of concern by New Zealanders and overwhelming offers of accommodation, assistance and donations for the Kosovan refugees settling here. This shows once again New Zealanders extraordinary generosity to others who are in need," said Mrs Shipley.

I feel sure that New Zealanders will continue to make every effort possible to ensure that these new arrivals feel welcome in their new communities, she said.

"New Zealand is pleased to be able to extend the hand of hospitality at this difficult and tragic time in Kosovo. The Immigration Service is working closely with the Albanian community as well as community and government agencies to ensure the refugees can settle here as soon as possible.

"We are offering these families resettlement on a permanent basis, but should they choose to return to Kosovo at a later time when peace is restored, we will help them in that process.

"In the meantime our hard working immigration team in the Balkans will continue their search for further relatives of Albanians based in New Zealand," said Mrs Shipley.

These new arrivals will be eligible for support services to help them and their families to settle, and access to the range of welfare and health benefits that New Zealand extends to all refugees. The 22 families will spend up to one week at the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre, before moving out to live with relatives in Auckland.
