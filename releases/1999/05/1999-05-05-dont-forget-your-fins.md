A summer reminder from the Minister of Youth Affairs to boogie boarders: don't forget your fins.

Mr Ryall said surf lifesavers around the country are picking up boogie boarders caught by strong currents or rips.

"Many beaches this summer have unusually strong currents, and this is surprising many beach-goers and boogie boarders. It makes sense to use a pair of fins. Fins are safer by making it easier to get back to shore.

"Using a boogie board without a pair of fins is like riding a bike without a helmet. It's just not safe."

Mr Ryall, a keen boogie boarder himself, practises at beaches in his Bay of Plenty electorate.
