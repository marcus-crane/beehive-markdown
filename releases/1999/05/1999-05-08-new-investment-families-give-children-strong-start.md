Giving new born children a strong and healthy start to life is the aim of four new Family Start programmes in Hamilton, Invercargill, Whakatane and Kawerau, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

"Investing in children is a key focus for this Government. This investment together with our aim to have all children reading, writing and doing maths by age nine, and free doctors visits for children under six will all help to ensure our future generations are stronger.

"Once running at full speed, these early intervention services will help up to 558 families a year in Hamilton, 164 families in Kawerau/Whakatane and 248 in Invercargill.

"Family Start will provide help to families who most need it, around the time a baby is born. It is a brilliant concept whereby a worker walks alongside the family for up to five years to help them develop parenting and household management skills.

"It is an intensive and comprehensive programme that looks at the family's total needs. It also co-ordinates access to a wide range of Government and private services for the family's benefit.

"These are skills that many families take for granted, but for some families such intensive help could mean the difference between a strong healthy child and one with very poor health and poor skills.

"By investing in this help at the beginning, we are increasing the odds of these families raising strong, healthy children in a positive home environment. This will benefit their communities and society as a whole," Mrs Shipley said.

Family Start is already working very successfully in Whangarei, West Auckland and Rotorua, with a similar service called Early Start operating in Christchurch.

The service is delivered by the most appropriate group for each area. In West Auckland, for example, Te Whanau O Waipareira Trust and Pacifica Health Fono deliver the care.

"The success of Early Start along with positive indications from the current three Family Start programmes already operating, has convinced the Government to further invest in these four new locations.

"We are likely to announce further Family Start sites in the Budget," Mrs Shipley said.

Family Start is a preventative programme providing support for families at the outset rather than waiting until a crisis occurs.

"It does not duplicate family help services already operating in each community, rather its purpose is to ensure families get all the help they need to break cycles of disadvantage and give their children a healthy start to life," Mrs Shipley said.

Early feedback from families involved in the programme has led the Government to take the next step and extend the service to centres throughout the country.

"Families involved in the programme have told us it is making a real difference to their lives and that of their children," Mrs Shipley said.

Family Start is part of the Government's Strengthening Families strategy, coordinating health, education and welfare services to families through one service rather than a multitude of different services.
