Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today released the priorities for the Government's review of personal and  
corporate insolvency laws.

Mr Bradford said the review would have a parallel, two-stage process and take place over a 24-30 month period.

Priorty would be given in the first the 12-month stage to issues causing significant unnecessary costs and problems, Mr  
Bradford said.

These included voidable transactions, "phoenix" companies (companies which are similar in substance to a company  
recently put into receivership or liquidation with outstanding obligations to creditors and operate the same business),  
cross-border insolvency and current statutory preferences.

The Law Commssion had published a report on cross-border insolvency and had recently provided a report to the Ministry  
of Commerce on statutory preferences.

Work in these areas would be based on these Law Commission reports.

As part of the work on statutory preferences, the review would consider the position of employees, Inland Revenue,  
sub-contractors/suppliers in the construction industry following the repeal of the Wages Protection and Contractors' Liens  
Act, and farmer suppliers when meatworks and other agricultural processing or distribution concerns go into liquidation, Mr  
Bradford said.

Issues that would be examined during the review's second stage included consideration of the role of the State and  
enforcement mechanisms in insolvency proceedings, alternatives to bankruptcy for consumer debt and estates with little or  
no assets, voluntary administration procedures, directors' duties in relation to insolvent or financially distressed companies,  
insolvent partnerships, abuse of trusts and statutory management, Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford noted that the numbers of both bankruptcies (insolvent individuals) and insolvencies (insolvent companies)  
were trending upwards, and that when financial failure occurred most unsecured creditors received a nil payment from the  
assets of the debtor.

The review would examine the reasons for this trend and whether current legislation was achieving the desired balance, Mr  
Bradford said.

"Insolvency laws should encourage early intervention when financial stress becomes apparent and provide maximum returns  
to creditors.

"However, it is also important that insolvency laws do not stifle innovation, responsible risk taking and entrepreneurship by  
excessively penalising business failure," he said.
