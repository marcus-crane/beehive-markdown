The Minister of Health today urged people to have their say on plans for labelling of Genetically Modified Food - with the deadline for submissions the end of the week.

"The Government has been working hand in hand with Australia to ensure we have a workable and sensible system of labelling Genetically Modified Food," Mr Creech said.

"We're consulting on what people think of the plans. The consultation document which has been available for the past three weeks encourages New Zealanders to have a say on labelling.

"It also lays out some of the issues surrounding getting a workable labelling regime in place.

"The planned new labelling regime would help ensure people make informed choices when they buy food. This is positive - but it also has other implications.

"There are many issues to make decisions on including juggling cost factors, trade implications and compliance.

"We are working through each of these issues step by step and want as many New Zealanders as possible to think about these issues as well and tell us their views."

The consultation ends on Friday and submissions will be used when the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) considers recommendations for labelling in early August.
