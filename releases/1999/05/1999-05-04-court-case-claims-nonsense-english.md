Finance Minister Bill English said today claims he was seeking special treatment to avoid giving evidence in a court case were nonsense, and that he was doing everything he could to protect the taxpayer from paying out millions of dollars unnecessarily.

"Southern Cardiothoracic Institute believe they suffered significant losses when the cardiac unit was set up in Christchurch. In the last two years they have made a number of attempts to persuade the Crown to pay them up to $7 million in damages. They're now claiming $2.41 million and the Crown does not believe any of their claims are justified.

"On the advice of Crown Law I am taking every legal step possible to ensure the Crown wins this case because I believe the millions of dollars would be better spent on heart operations than on dubious claims about loss of future profits.

"In my view SCI may believe that they can embarrass the Government into paying them millions of dollars to which they are not entitled by getting us into court during election year.

"I am more than willing to give evidence in the case. I am following a legal procedure requesting an adjournment similar to one in common use for anyone who is unavailable to give evidence. What I have done is ask the Speaker to certify that I am required to attend Parliament during the time the case is scheduled to go ahead," said Mr English.
