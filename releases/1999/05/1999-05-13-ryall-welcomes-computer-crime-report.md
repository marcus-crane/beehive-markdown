Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, has welcomed the Law Commission's report into Computer Misuse, released today.

"The Commission's report is a significant contribution to the work currently being done on the many legal issues raised by the rapidly expanding use of computer technology", said Mr Ryall.

"The legal issues raised by developments such as the internet and e-commerce are complex, dynamic and pressing. In response I have asked that the Law Commission make this area a priority for its work programme this year.

"The Law Commission report identifies four elements that it believes should be addressed in any legislation dealing with misuse of computers:

unauthorised interception of data stored in a computer;  
unauthorised accessing of data stored in a computer;  
unauthorised use of data stored in a computer;  
unauthorised damaging of data stored in a computer.  
"In April this year the Government announced its intention to introduce amendments to the Crimes Act to protect computer owners from unlawful access to their systems and dishonest use of the data and information stored on their computer systems.

"The proposed new offences announced in April are:

accessing a computer system for a dishonest purpose;  
attempting to access a computer system for a dishonest purpose;  
damaging or interfering with a computer system; and,  
unauthorised access to a computer, commonly known as 'hacking' or 'cracking'.  
"I have now received advice that these proposed offences, will address the recommendations of the Law Commission, although not necessarily using the same terminology.

"A draft Bill including the first three proposed offences is expect by the end of June 1999. However, the proposed offence of "hacking" or "cracking" raises a number of complex issues and will require further consultation and policy development before drafting.

I have decided to introduce the first three proposed offences as soon as possible, rather than delay their introduction until the "hacking" provisions are completed", Mr Ryall concluded.
