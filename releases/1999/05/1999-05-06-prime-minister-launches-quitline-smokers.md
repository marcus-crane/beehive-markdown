Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today launched a new 0800 telephone service called "Quitline" for people who want to give up smoking.

Mrs Shipley launched the new service at the New Zealand Post Te Puni Mail Centre, which is a smokefree workplace and a major supporter of Quitline.

"Smoking is a dreadfully addictive habit, causing the highest number of adult deaths world-wide," Mrs Shipley said.

"The annual death rate from smoking (4,500) in New Zealand is about eight times greater than our annual road toll. Half of all Maori adults smoke, and 400 die from smoking related illnesses each year.

"And sadly 19,000 young New Zealanders will take up the terrible habit this year, as in past years."

Mrs Shipley said the way to curb this trend was through programmes like Quitline and other initiatives such as smokefree advertising, health campaigns run by the Health Sponsorship Council, and proactive smokefree employers like New Zealand Post.

"Companies like New Zealand Post are setting a great example of a progressive smokefree workplace and I challenge other organisations to follow their lead."

Mrs Shipley congratulated the Health Sponsorship Council, the Cancer Society and Te Hotu Manawa Maori for developing a Quit Group to trial a quitine service in Waikato and Bay of Plenty. The Health Funding Authority was impressed with the results and has expanded Quitline nation-wide.

"I wish to thank the HFA and the Quit group members for making this community vision a reality. I hope every smoker calls 0800 778 778 to start on the right track to quit. Chances are it could save your life."
