Gilbert Myles is displaying "typical New Zealand First paranoia" by falsely alleging the Government has been holding secret meetings over the appointment of Vector Ltd directors, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says.

Mr Bradford said there had been no "secret meetings" and urged Mr Myles to read Vector's latest establishment plan, which clearly set out who could and could not be directors and how they would be appointed.

Mr Bradford told Parliament today the appointment of Vector directors was a matter for the company directors and trustees.

He later released the summary of the findings of the Ministerial Inquiry into the Auckland power failure, which stated it was undesirable for Auckland Energy Consumers Trust members to be appointed to the Vector (previously Mercury Energy) Board.

Mr Bradford also released the guiding principles of Vector's establishment plan, including principle 3 (see page 5 of attachment), which states:"No trustee will be eligible to be a director to avoid any potential conflict of interest and mixing of roles...the criteria for selection of directors will be agreed between the Board and the Trustees to ensure the right mix of skills at board level." Attached: Power failure report summary (1 pg) plus 4 pgs of Vector establishment plan document.
