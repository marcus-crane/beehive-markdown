Lockwood Smith has announced new appointments to the Tourism Board on his first day back in New Zealand as new Minister of Tourism.

"As new Minister, it's important that I act quickly to ensure that the Tourism Board is equipped to operate effectively. Obviously, a key step in this process is ensuring that the Board has a full panel of directors with appropriate skills and experience," said Dr Smith.

The new appointments to the Tourism Board are:

Bronwyn Monopoli, a Nelson-based accountant with experience on a number of Boards including the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation Ltd, Housing New Zealand Ltd and the Nelson Polytechnic. Her current role on the Board of Trade New Zealand brings an excellent linkage between trade and tourism;  
Wally Stone, Chief Executive of Whale Watch Kaikoura. Mr Stone played a leading role in the development of the venture which, from very modest beginnings, is now widely recognised as one of New Zealand's leading tourism attractions assisting in the development of a region of New Zealand;  
Dr Murray Horn is currently Managing Director of ANZ (NZ) Ltd. This position and his former position as Secretary of the Treasury brings very senior public and private sector experience, and governance skills to the Tourism Board.  
"These appointments together bring a valuable mix of commercial, financial and tourism experience to the Tourism Board. They are appointments of the highest calibre, and I'm looking forward to working with the Board to achieve its objectives," said Dr Smith.

"Today's appointments resolve one of the key issues within my new portfolio. I am making these announcements today as I am determined to have the Tourism Board and the tourism industry looking to the future with confidence," Dr Smith concluded.
