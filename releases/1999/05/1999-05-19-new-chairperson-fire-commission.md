The new Chair of the Fire Service Commission will be Margaret Bazley, Director-General of Social Welfare and former deputy chairperson of the State Services Commission, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder announced today.

She will replace Roger Estall who announced his resignation last night. Mrs Bazley will continue in her current role as Director-General of Social Welfare while carrying out her new responsibilities.

Mr Elder said Mrs Bazley will bring many years' outstanding experience and record as a senior public servant to her new role.

"In her time with the public service she has been responsible for a number of change programmes within government organisations under her control," Mr Elder said. "She has an outstanding record in restructuring organisations and working closely with unions in order to achieve change.

"The Government has every confidence that Margaret Bazley, as Chair of the Fire Service Commission and with the support of her co-commissioners, will pick up the work of modernising the New Zealand Fire Service and bring it to completion.

"We are committed to seeing that the Fire Service serves levy payers well by delivering an up-to-date fire safety strategy that reduces deaths from fire and property loss, and maintains a modern fire-fighting capacity.

"With the appointment of a new Chair, the Fire Service Commission will be able to get on with its work in completing this important modernisation task."
