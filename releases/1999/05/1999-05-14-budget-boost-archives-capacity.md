Funds in this year's Budget will give National Archives an extra 20 years' storage for government records and enhance the security of material it already holds, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, announced today.

Archives House in Wellington already holds some 65 kilometres of records but the building was due to run out of usable space at the end of this year. The decision will allow National Archives to continue taking in new holdings, Mr Elder said.

The funding will enable one floor of Archives House to be "climate controlled" and another floor to be made safe for records, providing sufficient storage for the next 20 years' acquisitions. The total capital cost, spread over two years, is $3.268 million (inc GST).

Mr Elder, said he was delighted with this decision.

"In protecting the significant records of government activity, National Archives provides a very important service to the citizens of New Zealand," he said. "The records give New Zealanders the means to keep government accountable and they represent a most significant part of our national heritage."

The minister said that together with almost $2million spent this year on providing a new roof and earthquake strengthening for Archives House, the latest decision signals the commitment of this government to protecting the invaluable heritage and constitutional assets of National Archives.

Among the treasures held by National Archives are the Treaty of Waitangi and the Women's Suffrage petition, both recognised by UNESCO as documents of international significance.
