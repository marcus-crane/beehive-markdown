A claim by TrustPower that electricity prices could rise because of low generating capacity is nothing more than a self-serving beat-up, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

"As a number of industry commentators have already said, this is just a beat-up by TrustPower to justify its price increases.

"The market knows that TrustPower paid well above market rate for a number of the generation assets it purchased and it seems these chickens are coming home to roost.

"TrustPower has always opposed the power reforms from the day they were first talked about.

"This latest TrustPower statement is just another in a long list of statements blaming everything that is happening in the electricity market on the reforms.

"Their campaign is beginning to wear rather thin," Mr Bradford said.
