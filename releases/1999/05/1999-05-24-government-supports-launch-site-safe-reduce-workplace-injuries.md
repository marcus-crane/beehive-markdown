Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today launched Site Safe - a new initiative to reduce the number of injuries on building sites.

Mrs Shipley and Mr Bradford visited the construction site of the new Westpac Trust Stadium in Wellington prior to the official launch of Site Safe at Parliament.

"Site Safe is a positive industry initiative, supported by Government, that aims to turn around New Zealand's appalling track record in construction site accidents and injuries," Mrs Shipley said.

Construction-related deaths in New Zealand rose 70 per cent in the past year.

"If we can make a dent in the number of injuries on our construction sites, this will make a huge difference to construction workers and their families, and the whole community.

"Site Safe is as much about attitude as it is management skills and training. It will help to create a 'safety culture' at work, backed up by proper training and education."

Mr Bradford said the changes to ACC legislation on 1 June this year would provide further incentives to employers in the construction industry to create safer workplaces.

"In 1997 the construction industry paid $155.7 million in ACC premiums largely because of unsafe workplaces. Employers will have the incentive to reduce their premiums by providing a safer work environment."

Site Safe was developed in August 1998 with the appointment of Executive Director Iris Clanachan, a former Assistant General Manager of the ACC Injury Prevention Unit.

The organisation develops best practice guidelines for health and safety management in the workplace and is funded by membership fees, sponsorship and the sale of educational products.
