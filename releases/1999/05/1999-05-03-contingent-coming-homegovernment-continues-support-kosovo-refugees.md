The Minister of Defence, Hon Max Bradford, today announced that New Zealand's contribution to the humanitarian crisis in the Balkans would alter in nature to meet the changing needs of the Kosovar refugees.

"Our Hercules crew and Joint Medical Team have done a wonderful job thus far, working virtually around the clock shifting over 160 tonnes of food and supplies and treating up to 400 patients per day.

"Now that Non-Government Organisations such as the Red Cross are taking the lead in the refugee camps, and NATO has increased its transport ability, our presence on the ground is not so necessary," Mr Bradford said.

"The New Zealand contingent can leave safe in the knowledge they have performed a valuable humanitarian service."

New Zealand medical staff are expected to leave refugee camps in Macedonia on Wednesday to join the aircraft in the United Kingdom.

They are expected return to RNZAF Base Auckland on the C130 Hercules by next Wednesday orThursday.

Mr Bradford said the focus now needed to shift to refugee relocation.

"Already the New Zealand Immigration Service has put a huge effort into getting details from New Zealand-based Albanian families of relatives who are at, or believed to be at, the border with Kosovo.

"Shortly, a team of Immigration officials will leave for Macedonia to locate these relatives and arrange for their passage to New Zealand, if that is their desire.

"It is hoped the first refugees will arrive in New Zealand before the end of the month. Further details of extra Government spending to assist the smooth relocation of the refugees will be announced within the week," Mr Bradford said.

"New Zealand will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in Kosovo, and will consider any further request for assistance on a case by case basis depending upon resource constraints.

"I believe New Zealand is doing its best to provide humanitarian relief for Kosovo refugees and we can be proud that individual and Government donations, medical treatment of the injured, transport of much needed relief supplies and refugee resettlement will significantly help the victims of this tragic situation, Mr Bradford said."
