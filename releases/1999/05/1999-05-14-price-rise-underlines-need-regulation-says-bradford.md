The price increases announced by First Electric are disappointing, but prove the point that a few monopoly lines companies are abusing their position, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

"This is exactly why the Government will be introducing lines company price controls soon.

"The power reforms have provided consumers with more choice. Competition will increase in the future. But, in the meantime, we will regulate monoply lines companies to make sure consumers are not being fleeced," Mr Bradford said.

First Electric announced today it was forced to increase its prices because of the failure of monopoly lines companies to lower their prices, despite these companies having lower costs of doing business under the reforms.

Despite the price rise, First Electric remains the cheapest electricity retailer nationwide.

Mr Bradford said consumers should remember that lower electricity prices were available if they switched to suppliers like First Electric or Contact.

Many in the industry, as well as the Consumers' Institute, had repeatedly stated the power reforms would lead to lower prices and greater choice for consumers.

While most electricity companies were embracing the changes willingly and in a spirit of delivering a better deal for consumers, there were some who were not, Mr Bradford said.

"Some lines companies have taken the opportunity of their monopoly position, and the launch of the reforms, to grab higher profits at the expense of their consumers.

"One retail company seems to be hell-bent on spooking the electricity market and consumers with a campaign of disinformation regarding future generation capacity and the impact of the reforms," Mr Bradford said.

"My strong advice to consumers is to simply ignore these games and shop around for a better deal if you think your power company is giving you a raw deal.

"The Government will be dealing with monopoly lines company abuses in a very short while," he said.
