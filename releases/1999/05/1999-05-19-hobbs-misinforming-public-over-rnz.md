Labour's Marian Hobbs continues to misunderstand the constitutional relationship between Government and Radio New Zealand (RNZ), the Minister Responsible for Radio New Zealand, Hon Marie Hasler said today.

Speaking in response to Ms Hobb's statement that Government was set to demand $1.5 million from RNZ, Ms Hasler said, "Ms Hobb's criticisms are false and her research is unbelievably sloppy.

"She has misinformed the public - there has never been a demand for $1.5 million.

"The public, RNZ's shareholders, can have no faith whatsoever in Ms Hobb's repeated mistake-ridden bluster.

"Labour's vague and as usual figure-free promises guarantee nothing."
