Research, Science and Technology Minister Maurice Williamson leaves for a trip to the United Kingdom tomorrow in response to an invitation from the British Government, who are paying for the visit.

"The British Government are very keen to exchange ideas about knowledge economy issues and are particularly interested in our Foresight project. It's a great opportunity for me to learn from what they're doing in fields such as biotechnology, information technology and tertiary education."

While in the area, Mr Williamson will also make brief visits to Ireland and Finland, and return to New Zealand on May 30.

"These two countries are regarded as two of the most knowledge-based economies in the world and a great deal can be learnt from how they became so innovative," he said.

Mr Williamson said issues such as why students in these countries were opting for science and technology careers in such large numbers would be discussed, as the answers could well benefit New Zealand.

"We've got a first class programme arranged including meetings with seven senior Cabinet Ministers from the three countries and world leading private sector businesses such as Intel and Nokia," he said.
