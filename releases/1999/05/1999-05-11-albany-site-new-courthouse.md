The final stage of a major courthouse modernisation programme for Auckland was announced today by the Minister for Courts, Hon Georgina te Heuheu.

'Albany has been chosen for the site of the much needed new, purpose-built North Shore District Court,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

'The new $18 million courthouse will serve the current and future needs of the communities located from the Harbour Bridge in the south to Orewa in the north.'

'The Albany site was chosen because it offers the best long term solution to the provision of court services for the North Shore/Rodney District, which is currently the fastest growing area in New Zealand with forecast population growth of up to 46 percent from 1996 to 2021.'

Mrs te Heuheu said the site chosen for the new courthouse is situated on elevated land fronting Don MacKinnon Drive. The site is close to the other commercial developments, services and civic designated areas in the new Albany commercial centre, and will be easily accessible by both private and public transport.

'The new $23 million Manukau District Court is currently under construction. The Waitakere District Court underwent an extensive $3 million refurbishment last year.'

'The new North Shore District Court at Albany, along with the new Manukau District Court and the existing Auckland and Waitakere District Courts will provide greater Auckland with a network of large, modern, well designed and well appointed court facilities,' Mrs te Heuheu said.

'Well designed and modern courthouses mean a more friendly and safe environment, more efficient processing of cases, and better service for the community.'

Mrs te Heuheu said the Department for Courts is now drawing up detailed plans for the new courthouse. Tenders will be let by the end of the year and construction will start in February next year. It is hoped to have the new courthouse in operation by June 2001.

'The existing cramped and overcrowded North Shore District Court, operating from leased premises in Huron Street and Anzac Avenue, Takapuna, will close once the new courthouse is operational. The satellite District Courts at Papakura and Pukekohe will remain,' Mrs te Heuheu said.
