Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today gave the go ahead for a new state-of-the-art public hospital in central Auckland, to be up and running by 2004.

In addition, a new "ambulatory" centre - an advanced day surgical hospital and outpatient medical centre providing non urgent services, day surgery, outpatient care and rehabilitation services - will be established nearby in Green Lane.

"This is an important new hospital development for New Zealand at large as well as for Auckland. Auckland Healthcare hospitals not only provide care for Aucklanders on a day-to-day basis, but provide specialist treatment for other New Zealanders with some of the most complicated illnesses.

"The new hospital buildings will improve the delivery of care. Clinicians and staff will have a better, more modern and efficient working environment and patients will know they are getting their health care delivered in an efficient up-to-date manner," Mrs Shipley said.

The new 710 beds are in addition to Starship Hospital, and the 90 beds for those people needing acute assessment and elderly care.

"The Government has also made a commitment to improving inpatient mental health services on the new hospital site. "This redevelopment of Auckland Healthcare's hospitals has a price tag of at least $250 million. The total cost will be finalised as part of the tender process over the next few months.

"It is the single biggest new investment in a hospital development. The Government has set aside equity funding, and the Crown intends to build, own and operate the hospital. We will continue to consider other options in the future should they lead to a greater number or range of better health services so that New Zealanders get the best health care possible.

"I am also announcing today plans to expand the hospital services in north and west Auckland.

"Auckland is set to grow by 40 percent over the next 20 years. The central Auckland hospital services are only part of the picture. As Auckland gets bigger we will need to provide at least 130 extra hospital beds in the north and west of the city.

"As a nation we have to be realistic about where and when we need to invest in bricks and mortar to deliver health care for all New Zealanders.

"New hospitals, wards, health centres are opening all the time across the country, providing better health care for the people they serve.

"Over the past five years there has already been $920 million extra spent on upgrading and modernising hospitals and health centres. Up to another $1 billion will be invested over the next three years.

"The Government is strongly committed to seeing that New Zealanders have the best care possible and our investment in the health sector is a clear demonstration of this.

"This project dates back to my days as Minister of Health. The full circle is now complete and I am pleased to be able to give it the final sign off today."
