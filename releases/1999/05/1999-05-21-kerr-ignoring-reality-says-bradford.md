Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr is ignoring reality in claiming no electricity lines companies are using  
their monopolistic positions to make excessive profits, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says.

"Mr Kerr's comments are driven more by his desire not to see any form of regulation of monopoly lines companies than it is  
by any objective or independent analysis of what lines companies are capable of doing or have done.

"Unlike Mr Kerr, I have been receiving all sorts of information about practices in the industry, both positive and negative.  
"We will all see who is right when the proposed regulatory framework is implemented," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford also responded to Christchurch City councillor Denis O'Rourke's acknowledgement that his council must bear  
some of the blame for recent Christchurch power price increases. Cr O'Rourke said the council was 10 per cent to blame  
and the Government 90 per cent.

Mr Bradford said Cr O'Rourke had the figures around the wrong way. "It is 90 per cent the council's fault, and 10 per cent  
the Government's for believing that community-owned lines companies would look after the interests of their consumers,"  
Mr Bradford said.

The Christchurch City Council owns the monopoly Orion electricity lines company, which has failed to pass onto electricity  
retailers, and hence consumers, its lower costs of doing business under the power reforms.

Last year the council sold the electricity retail arm of what was then called Southpower to TransAlta for $171 million.  
TransAlta has said Orion's lines charges were the reason it recently increased domestic power prices by 13 per cent. Mr  
Bradford said the prices Orion and its owner Christchurch City Council was charging represented a major profit grab. "This  
has been shown by Orion's $30 million expected profit for the year to March 2000 - almost 21 per cent higher than forecast  
for the year to March 1999.

"There is no sign that electricity consumers, who are also ratepayers, are going to get back any of the proceeds of the  
Southpower sale - the $171 million for example - by way of a distribution or rebate to consumers, like has occurred with a  
number of other electricity trusts," Mr Bradford said.
