A preliminary check of Fire Service Commission spending on the most significant legal and publicity costs indicates they are justified, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, said today.

Mr Elder asked Internal Affairs Department officials for an urgent report after concerns were raised about the costs at a select committee financial review of the Fire Service.

"The Department has not had time for a detailed report and I am seeking further information," Mr Elder said.

"However I am advised that the costs of direct publicity and advertising for a wide range of fire safety education information and programme services do not seem unduly high.

"The expenditure represents less than half of one per cent of total Fire Service expenditure. Given the increased focus of the Commission on fire prevention activities this level of spending for all internal and public information activities seems reasonable."

Mr Elder said compared with other public bodies the Fire Service Commission is not a big spender on public relations.

The Alcohol Advisory Council, for example, disbursed $2.8 million in 94-95 and $3.17 million in 95-96 for the promotion of its campaign to encourage drinking in moderation and to reduce alcohol-related problems. It raised some $6 million a year from levies for its activities.

Mr Elder said the legal costs of the Commission also did not appear to be out of line. In the period July 97 to March 99 the total was $1.3 million, comparable with what was spent in the two years, 1995 to 1997, by the preceding Commission.

"Under the previous commission legal costs averaged $56,000 per month," Mr Elder said. "Under the present commission they are just under $64,000 a month, reflecting the greater activity that's taken place."

A third of the commission's legal expenses over the past two financial years, $447,000 was for "normal" overhead items.

"This does not seem unduly high in absolute terms," Mr Elder said, "given the size and extent of the Fire Service's operations, the relative lack of internal legal expertise and the increasingly contractual and risk-conscious environment of modern business practice.

"The single biggest legal item concerned the SITE project which co-locates the 111 communications system with the police. This accounted for almost a quarter of total legal expenditure over the two years and was a decision taken by the former Commission.

"The bulk of the remaining $587,000 or 43 per cent of legal costs arise from protracted legal actions concerning collective employment contracts, and the expenses of the Commission for legal counsel at the Parliamentary Select Committee's inquiry into the Commission."
