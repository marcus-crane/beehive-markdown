Draft Arts Curriculum Launched

Education Minister Nick Smith today launched the draft arts curriculum statement at Nelson Central School, saying the arts in schools will never be the same again.

"The new curriculum recognises that art is not just about crayons and paint, but is also about dance, drama, music and the visual arts. This new approach is very exciting and will help ignite the creative spirit of the next generation. We are planting the seeds for the successors to Jane Evans, Kiri Te Kanawa, Peter Jackson, Suzie Moncrief and the Finn Brothers."

The Arts Curriculum is the last of the seven key learning areas, identified in the New Zealand Curriculum Framework. The seven key learning areas are language, maths, science, technology, social sciences, health & physical education, and arts. There has not previously been an arts curriculum but only loose syllabus statements that make no mention of dance or drama. The new curriculum will focus on students' learning outcomes rather than the specifics of what and how teachers will teach.

"This is a significant step forward for the recognition of the arts in New Zealand. While it is a draft, most schools will be teaching the new curriculum next year although it will not become compulsory until 2002. The final curriculum document will take into account feedback from the arts' community and the practical experience of schools in its delivery."

"The Government has backed up the new curriculum with an investment in professional development of $6 million over the next two years for art teachers to ensure they have the skills to deliver the new curriculum. This is in addition to quarter of a million dollars for the development of support materials for teachers. A further challenge on my agenda is to ensure our schools have the buildings and facilities to be able to provide the opportunities to develop the artistic talent of our young people."
