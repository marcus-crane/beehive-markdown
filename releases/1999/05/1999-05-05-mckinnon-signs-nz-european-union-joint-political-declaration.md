Foreign Minister Don McKinnon signed a Joint Declaration of Relations between the European Union and New Zealand in Strasbourg yesterday.

Signing for the European Union were Vice President of the European Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, and the German Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, G ünter Verheugen. Germany currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.

The Political Declaration is an agreed statement of principles which guide the future relationship between the European Union and New Zealand. The declaration confirms the importance of this relationship and the cooperation that exists between the parties on a wide range of international economic and political issues.

New Zealand has been a very active player in Europe for a long time. With the European Union being our second largest economic partner, we clearly have substantial interests at stake here. This Political Declaration formally confirms the depth of this relationship and the importance which both sides attach to its further development, as the European Union itself expands and further integration occurs, Mr McKinnon said.
