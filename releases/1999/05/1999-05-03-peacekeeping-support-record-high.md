Public support for the active involvement of New Zealand's armed forces in peacekeeping is at its highest ever, Defence Minister Hon Max Bradford said today.

Releasing the results of an annual UMR Insight poll, Mr Bradford said public support for Defence Force peacekeeping had risen steadily from 73 percent in 1994, when polling first began, to 85 percent in April this year.

"The survey was taken at a time of high publicity for the NATO bombing of Serbia and the plight of Kosovar refugees, which could partly account for the 6 percent increase over last year's figure (79%)", he said.

Ninety-four percent of those polled considered the security of Australia to be very or fairly important to New Zealand - also the highest figure since surveys began in 1994.

"Support for a strong and effective armed force has remained consistently high at 70 percent, and again was particularly high among those under 30 (73%),"Mr Bradford said.

"New Zealanders are not fools - they look at the world about them, their region in particular, and see uncertainty.

"They see war in the Balkans and a threat to global security in the Gulf, as well as the need for stability in East Timor, and between India and Pakistan.

"Our forces need to be trained and equipped for peacekeeping, to work with Australia, and to underpin the security of our region.

"The polls are consistently telling us New Zealanders recognise this and the Government is ensuring that it happens with a substantial boost to defence spending," Mr Bradford said.

The poll also found that:

Eighty-seven percent of New Zealanders considered the security of the South Pacific to be very or fairly important to New Zealand - again the highest figure recorded.  
Seventy-six percent considered the security of South East Asia to be very or fairly important to New Zealand.  
Support for strong and effective armed forces was highest among homemakers (77%) - predominantly female - and weakest among professionals/managers and those earning $55,000 a year or more (62% and 63%).

The UMR Insight survey is commissioned by the Ministry of Defence every April from a representative sample of 750 New Zealanders aged 18 and over.
