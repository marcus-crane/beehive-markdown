A ban on the importation and supply of cannabis utensils as part of a crackdown on illicit drugs is a step closer, Minister of Health Wyatt Creech said today.

Currently utensils such as bongs can be imported or sold, but cannabis use is illegal.

The Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the Customs Department and New Zealand Police are advertising in the public notices in major metropolitan newspapers advising of the proposed ban which is to be implemented later this year.

A Gazette Notice will be issued in June to prohibit the importation and supply of cannabis utensils pursuant to section 22 (1A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.

"The public notice sets out possible "cannabis utensils" that could be included in the Gazette Notice once it is finalised next month."

Retailers and importers will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal to ban on:

bongs  
hash pipes  
head pipes  
hubble-bubbles  
hookahs  
water pipes  
"The move is in line with the Government's national drug policy to minimise harm caused by illicit drug use to both individuals and the community. We currently have an inconsistent situation where the drug cannabis is illegal, yet it is not illegal to import and sell paraphernalia which is clearly intended for illegal drug use".

"Once final decisions are made retailers will have the opportunity to dispose of existing stock," Mr Creech said.
