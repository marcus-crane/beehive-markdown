Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control Minister John Luxton, today announced that the Government has made available $20,000 for research aimed at finding pasture species or varieties which are resistant to webworm. A study will also be established to see how the webworm survives the winter in Northland.

"The extensive pasture damage caused by the tropical webworm, was evident on my recent Northland visit. I was very concerned by it and wanted to look at how we might combat such a pest."

This initial seeding money has been approved for this financial year.

"This research is the first step towards helping Northland farmers overcome the damage caused by this pest. I am also working with other organisations in the agriculture industry to get a continuing work programme underway. This is a similar response to the approach taken last year for an ongoing approach to the clover weevil," Mr Luxton said.

The work will be undertaken by AgResearch and follows the initial study funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
