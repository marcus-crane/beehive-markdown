The merger of Massey University and Wellington Polytechnic would provide thousands of students with better access to a  
wider range of study opportunities, Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford said today.

At 5pm at Wellington Polytechnic Mr Bradford announced the Government had approved the disestablishment of Wellington  
Polytechnic so it could be incorporated into Massey University.

"The merger is not only exciting for Wellington students but also extramural students and those studying at Massey's  
Palmerston North and Albany campuses. It will bring together the specialities of both the institutions," Mr Bradford said.

"For example, Massey science and technology students will now be able to study design or music subjects provided by the  
Wellington Polytechnic as new programmes are developed after the merger.

"Students able to take on a wider range and combination of subjects will also be of great benefit to industry," he said.

Mr Bradford said the merger would place Massey University and Wellington Polytechnic and their students in a strong  
position for the knowledge-based future. He said it was vital that tertiary providers took the opportunity to position  
themselves for challenges facing the sector in the next century.

"The decision has come after extensive scrutiny of the proposal which had the support of over 70 per cent of public  
submissions."

The approval of this merger was also in line with the policy announced in the 1998 White Paper on tertiary education, which  
stated that mergers would be approved by the Crown where they were expected to lead to improved educational, strategic,  
or financial outcomes, he said.

The merger will take place on 1 July 1999.
