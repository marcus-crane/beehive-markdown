In a first for New Zealand, Finance Minister Bill English will be going on-line on Budget day to answer questions from New Zealanders about Budget 99.

"This is a unique opportunity which allows any New Zealander with Internet access to talk directly to the Government about what is in the Budget.

"In the past only those who have been able to go to business breakfasts and other organised functions have been able to question Ministers directly about the Budget. With on-line access anyone can take part from anywhere in New Zealand.

"I look forward to 'talking' to as many people as possible on-line this Thursday. I'm sure there will be a lot to talk about with all the initiatives the Government is taking to increase New Zealand's prosperity and provide more security for families," said Mr English.

Mr English will be on-line from 4pm to 5pm on Thursday 20 May at www.xtrachat.co.nz.

The official Budget 99 website will be at www.budget99.govt.nz and will contain details of all the initiatives in Budget 99, plus links to the full budget documents on the Treasury site. Material will be uploaded onto the site once the Treasurer's Speech concludes at approximately 3pm on Thursday 20 May 1999.
