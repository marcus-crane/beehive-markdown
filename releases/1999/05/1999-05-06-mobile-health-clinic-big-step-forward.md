"The new mobile health clinic "Te Waka Hauora" for the West Coast has the potential to make big improvements to the health of locals," Health Minister Wyatt Creech today.

"I am pleased to have been able to help launch "Te Waka Hauora" a mobile clinic that will travel the length and breadth of the South Island's West Coast to make certain locals get access to basic health advice.

"I want to see more initiatives like this. I want to see more people thinking about how to nip in the bud any health problems or illness to stop them from becoming more serious conditions.

"The mobile health clinic will initially traverse from Karamea to Haast to raise awareness about the need for people to think about their lifestyles and how to keep healthy.

"The clinic will eventually take health services direct to the communities.

"This is an innovative response from the Health Funding Authority needs to Maori health needs on the West Coast

"Sometimes it is very difficult for people to take time off work to go to their doctor, or they try to put their health issues to one side while they get on with dealing with the day to day needs of their families.

"The mobile clinic will remind people that they need to look after their health, and will make it easy to get a check up."
