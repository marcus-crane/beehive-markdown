Finance Minister Bill English said today he was surprised the Labour Party had got caught up in a private company's efforts to extract $2.41 million of taxpayers' money in compensation out of the Government.

"Last week the Labour Party was expressing outrage about $340,000 paid unlawfully to two former directors of the Tourism Board. This week it appears to have got caught up in a private company's efforts to extract $2.41 million of taxpayers' money out of the Government over a dubious claim about future loss of earnings.

"This is either an extraordinary case of double standards, or the Labour Party's finance spokesman has been duped by a clever lawyer.

"The background to the issue is that the Southern Cardiothoracic Institute believe they suffered significant losses when the cardiac unit was set up in Christchurch. In the last two years they have made a number of attempts to persuade the Crown to pay them up to $7 million in damages. They're now claiming $2.41 million and the Crown does not believe any of their claims are justified.

"SCI is now trying to use the threat of media interest in the case to pressurise the Government into reaching a behind-the-scenes settlement out of court. There is a clear implication to this effect in a letter from the lawyer acting for SCI.

"For its part, the Crown is applying for an adjournment of the court case because it is set down for a date when the House is sitting. I am very happy to give evidence in this case, but I cannot do so while the House is sitting and have asked the Speaker to certify that I am required to attend Parliament during the time the case is scheduled to go ahead.

"In a somewhat bizarre turn of events, my request for this certificate has prompted Labour's finance spokesman, Dr Cullen, to accuse me of trying to obstruct justice and 'trifling with the political process for political reasons'.

"Nothing could be further from the truth. I am determined to take every legal step possible to avoid the taxpayer paying out millions of dollars on dubious claims about future loss of earnings.

"The letter from lawyer Grant Cameron states that 'there are substantial issues of both public interest and commercial consideration in this litigation which will naturally excite considerable media comment and speculation.' It then proceeds to list 10 issues, including the 'funding of public health generally' and 'other perceived inadequacies of the health reforms' that might be raised during the court case and excite media interest.

"In my view Mr Cameron is overplaying his hand. However, what is most extraordinary about the issue is that the Labour Party has decided to help him by getting more publicity over the case.

"I am releasing copies of both Mr Cameron's letter to the Solicitor-General and my letter to the Clerk of the House which show clearly the sequence of events," said Mr English.
