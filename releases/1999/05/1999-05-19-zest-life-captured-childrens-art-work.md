Children's painting showing their zest for life is a fitting way to raise awareness for skylight, the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Marie Hasler, said when opening a children's art display in the Beehive foyer today.

"Life is Beautiful, the theme for this exhibition, has been captured in colour, diversity and fun by the young people taking part in this competition in support of skylight," Ms Hasler said.

"I am delighted to open this exhibition to raise awareness for skylight, the first organisation in New Zealand to focus on helping children and young people to handle the impact of loss and grief in their lives."

Established by the Children's Grief Centre Charitable Trust, skylight, as well as offering direct support to young people will also train teachers, health professionals, care-givers and counsellors.

Following the exhibition in Parliament, the art will be on show at Capital E in Civic Square. A radiothon on Friday 28 May is being held in Wellington to further raise awareness and funds for skylight.
