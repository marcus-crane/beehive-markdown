Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced appointments to the New Zealand Conservation Authority (NZCA). The Authority has thirteen members representing a broad range of interests, including one as a nominee of Ngai Tahu as prescribed in the Ngai Tahu Settlement Act.

"I am very pleased to welcome five new members to the Authority. For the first time the very far south is represented with the appointment of Margaret Hopkins of Stewart Island/Rakiura. The other new members are Peter Geddes of Whangarei, Lorraine Stephenson of Dannevirke, Peter Archibald of Queenstown and Apirana Mahuika of Gisborne."

The five new members join Sir Duncan McMullin, who is continuing as the chairperson, Annette Lees, Edward Ellison, Gordon Ell, Craig Potton, Kath Dickinson, Marian van der Goes and Kerry Marshall, who have been reappointed.

The NZCA is an independent body that represents the public's long-term interest in conservation at a national level. It provides the Minister of Conservation and the Department of Conservation with independent, expert advice on national conservation planning, policy and management issues.

"George McMillan, John Klaricich, John Davies and Murray McKee are retiring from the NZCA this year and I wish to thank them for their tireless efforts advocating for conservation on behalf of the public. It is a very important job and they have made tangible contributions they should be proud of."

The NZCA has a wide range of functions set out in legislation. Over the next few years, many of the plans which govern the management of New Zealand's national parks are being reviewed and will go to the NZCA for its consideration and approval.
