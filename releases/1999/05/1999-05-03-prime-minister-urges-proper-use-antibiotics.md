Prime Minister Jenny Shipley launched a health campaign today aimed at curbing the inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs as New Zealand embarks on another winter.

"It is time to explode the myth that antibiotics are a cure-all for winter ailments. They are not.

"Antibiotics cannot cure viral infections that cause coughs, colds and the

flu. They are only effective at treating bacterial infections.

"Too many people get prescriptions for antibiotics when they should actually be using the age old remedy of rest and plenty of fluids.

"This can be supplemented with paracetamol, steam inhalations, decongestants, throat lozenges and gargles."

Mrs Shipley said it was critical for people to use antibiotics correctly to ensure their effectiveness against bacterial disease.

"The misuse of these drugs actually reduces their effectiveness ? meaning people need increasingly potent and expensive antibiotics to cure simple ailments.

"The growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics has huge repercussions for our health as a nation and the entire world.

"We must work together to explode the myth that antibiotics can cure everything, and ensure people use them correctly to protect their effectiveness for future generations," Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley congratulated PHARMAC, the Independent Practice Associations and the Pharmacy Guild for joining forces to launch the campaign against the misuse of antibiotics.

The campaign will cover the whole of New Zealand, accompanied by cartoon posters, brochures on colds and flu, and colouring in books for children.
