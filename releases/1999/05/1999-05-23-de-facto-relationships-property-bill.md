"The Government has asked the Government Administration Select Committee to defer consideration of the De Facto  
Relationships (Property) Bill until the conclusion of the Same Sex Relationships Discussion Paper process early next year",  
Justice Minister, Tony Ryall said today.

"The Labour Party has indicated it will move an amendment to see any De Facto Relationships Act extended to same sex  
couples.

"Within the next eight weeks the Ministry of Justice will release a comprehensive discussion paper on the legal issues  
surrounding same sex relationships.

"It would be the height of arrogance for the Parliament to vote on these matters while the public were still responding to a  
discussion paper on these very issues.

"Because of the dwindling number of sitting days before the General Election it is most unlikely the De Facto Relationships  
Bill will be enacted.

"But, the Government does consider it important to provide legislative support in dealing with the division of property after  
a relationship breakdown.

"We would expect speedy progress once the discussion paper process is completed early next year", Mr Ryall concluded.
