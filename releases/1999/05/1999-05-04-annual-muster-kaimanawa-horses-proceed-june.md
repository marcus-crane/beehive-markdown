Minister Invites Expressions of Interest to Adopt Horses

Conservation Minister Nick Smith today confirmed that an annual muster of Kaimanawa horses would again occur this June to keep numbers to the 500 agreed in the Kaimanawa Horse Management Plan.

"Results of a recent census in April 1999 show the numbers of horses has grown to 622 and so approximately 100 horses will be mustered again this year. Whenever possible we will be seeking homes for the mustered horses from interested members of the public but if homes are unable to be found, the horses will be sent to the abattoir."

A major muster of over 1000 horses occurred in 1997 to reduce the population to the agreed sustainable limit of 500. Following this major muster, it was agreed that there would be a smaller annual muster to keep numbers within the agreed limits. A census in May 1998 showed an increase to 622 and in June 1998 107 horses were mustered off the land. This year's operation is part of the ongoing management originally agreed to by interested parties including the Kaimanawa Wild Horse Preservation Society.

"No-one's interests are served by allowing the population to expand uncontrolled. The horse numbers would grow until their food source was exhausted and sufficient horses starved to death. In the process, the unique red tussocks and plants like the Kaimanawa forget-me-not of the central plateau would be destroyed. The management plan is a common sense compromise that ensures both the survival of the plants and horses."

The mustered horses would be made available to any members of the public who met approved animal welfare considerations. The process has been tightened up to ensure all horse buyers comply with the animal welfare check following one farmer last year who left horses without adequate food.

"I am committed to finding homes for as many of the mustered horses as possible. The one tragic incident last year must be balanced against the over 200 owners who have successfully adopted a Kaimanawa horse. Animal welfare considerations must be given the highest priority. That is why the approval process has been improved and why veterinary support will be present at all times during the muster."

The muster of appropriately 100 horses would be carried out, weather dependent, during June. Advertisements seeking expressions of interest from potential owners for the mustered horses would be placed in all the main daily newspapers in the next few weeks.
