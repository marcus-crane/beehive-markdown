The Minister of Justice the Hon Tony Ryall announced today that he is establishing a ministerial enquiry to enquire into the circumstances which resulted in DNA material belonging to a person who was not involved in two separate criminal cases, was said to have been found at both scenes.

"I am satisfied that both the Police and the scientists at the ESR laboratory have made an intensive and thorough investigation into the facts of this incident. Nevertheless I have concluded that an independent enquiry is justified taking into account the importance of DNZ profiling in many criminal trials" Mr Ryall said.

Mr Ryall said that the public must have confidence in the procedures adopted when samples are taken and subsequently analysed.

"The investigation to date indicates that the DNA profiling procedures that have been put in place are to a very high standard. We have to try to find out what, if anything, went wrong" Mr Ryall added.

"There is nothing to suggest that a widespread problem affecting other cases has been identified but where human involvement in a process is involved there is always a possibility of error. If we can improve the process in any way we should do so", Mr Ryall said.

The Minister said that the persons to conduct the enquiry and the terms of reference will be settled shortly so that the enquiry can begin without delay. He expected the enquiry would take about two months.
