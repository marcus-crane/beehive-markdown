Legislation will be introduced to the House today to allow flexible, innovative ways of marketing new motor vehicles", Justice Minister, Tony Ryall said.

"The Motor Vehicle Dealers Amendment Bill, 1999, will make it possible for sellers of new cars to use marketing tools like the internet and direct television sales to reach their customers", said Mr Ryall.

"The issue came to the Government's attention after action was taken against Daewoo Automotive New Zealand direct marketing its products.

"The amendment will allow licensed motor vehicle dealers to conduct business at any place and removes the requirement for the personal supervision of the licensee's new motor vehicle business.

"All political Parties represented in the House are supporting the progress of this amendment as quickly as appropriate.

"The amendments will not affect the rules governing second-hand motor vehicle dealers.

"A separate Motor Vehicle Dealers Bill, to replace the outdated Motor Vehicle Dealers Act 1975, is already before the Commerce Select Committee.

"However, it is unlikely this Bill will be enacted during 1999.

"The Government and other Parties want to progress this relatively straight forward amendment in specific legislation", Mr Ryall concluded.
