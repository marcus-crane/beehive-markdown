Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today announced the creation of a $500,000 WorkSafe fund to promote health and safety in the work place.

"There have been 39 deaths caused by workplace accidents so far this financial year", Mr Bradford said.

"This is a slight improvement on the 46 deaths at the same time last year, but is still unacceptable.

"By itself, money will not eliminate workplace death and injury. What is needed is a culture change by industry and employees.

Businesses need to own the problem, and own the solution," Mr Bradford said.

"The Government is willing to assist with solutions, and providing the WorkSafe fund is one means to do so.

"The fund will be used to develop innovative educational products and safety programmes to improve the workplace health and safety of employees, particularly those in key risk industries such as forestry, farming and construction. This will be the Government contribution to an industry initiative," Mr Bradford said.

The fund will be open to applications from any individual, group or organisation and will be administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Service (OSH) of the Department of Labour.

Mr Bradford also announced that from 1999/2000 onwards measures would be put in place to ensure that all money collected from employers under the Health and Safety in Employment (HSE) Act 1992 is spent on work place health and safety.

"The Government is committed to ensuring that OSH expenditure matches revenue, so that employers pay no more than they need," said Mr Bradford

"From 1999/2000 onwards any part of the HSE levy not spent on administering the Act will be recorded in a dedicated account, and the funds used to pay for any under-recovery in future years".

Additional Information

WORKSAFE Fund

The WorkSafe Fund will be open to any group or individual with the proviso that the outcome is beneficial to an industry sector, rather than an individual firm.

The fund will be used to promote industry "best practice" in health and safety management through the development of guidelines, solution based information and subsidised training to support small businesses, assistance to industry safety organisations and research.

Requests for support from the contestable fund will go through an application process handled by OSH. The maximum funding level is $50,000 per applicant. A target of one quarter of the fund will be set aside for projects requesting $15,000 or less. Projects will be funded up to a maximum of 70 percent of cost. An independent advisory group of industry and workplace health and safety experts will assess applications.

HSE Levy

In recent years, growth in workforce size and pay levels has resulted in the HSE levy collecting more than OSH is allocated to administer the Act. To reduce the over-collection, the HSE levy was reduced from 6 cents per $100 of liable earnings per employees to 5 cents on 1 April this year. As the levy cannot be set in half cents even at this level, there will still be some over-collection of funds. Therefore the Government has agreed that from 1999/2000 onwards any part of the levy not spent on administering the HSE Act will be recorded in a notional account, known as a memorandum account, and the funds used to pay for the under-recovery of the levy in future years.
