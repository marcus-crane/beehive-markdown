Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today presented awards to 10 top French-speaking students for winning the "Tour du Monde de la Francophonie" competition to promote relations with France and to show the diversity of the French-speaking world.

As part of their award, all of the winners will tour the world's French-speaking countries including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Senegal, Morocco, Canada and New Caledonia.

Mrs Shipley congratulated the winners who beat 210 other students from 65 schools.

"These awards provide an excellent opportunity for students of the French language to experience life in countries where French is the predominant medium for communication.

"They will not only get to learn the language, they will get to live it and experience the rich cultures associated with it."

Mrs Shipley said the students would be fine ambassadors for their country and their tour would help to further promote New Zealand and France relations.

The winners of the "Tour du Monde de la Francophonie" awards include: Kate Archibald, Thames High School Alexandra Crawford, Samuel Marsden College Rasalind Dawson, Taradale High School Eammon Deverall, Birkenhead College Anisha Grover, Wellington Girls' College Ester Jang, Christchurch Girls' College Joy Ramirez, Epsom Girls' College Hannah Ross, Columba College Arun Stephens, Hutt Valley High School Catherine Stobbie, Westland High School

The students will be accompanied by teachers Muriel Willem from Kamo High School and Judy Lafdal of Christchurch Girls' College.

The "Tour du Monde de la Francophonie" competition is organised by the French Embassy and the New Zealand Council for Teacher Education.
