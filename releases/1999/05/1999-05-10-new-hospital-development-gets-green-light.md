The go ahead has been given for new investment to revamp Grey Base Hospital in Greymouth.

"I am pleased to be able to announce that Coast Healthcare has been given approval to get on with a $5.5 million dollar redevelopment of Grey Hospital," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"When I visited the West Coast last week I got a brief taste of the way the current buildings were working for staff and for patients. "The redevelopment has the potential to deliver big improvements for them and for services.

?The project includes the new purpose designed sub-acute mental health facility to accommodate patients at Seaview.

"The paediatrics and maternity wards will be merged into a Family Health Unit and surgical services and theatres reconfigured to facilitate day stay surgery. An assessment treatment and rehabilitation unit will be established within the hospital.

"The Government is committed to giving the public certainty and confidence that the mix and quality of health services are appropriate to the needs of today and the future, and achieving stability and reliability in service coverage.

"The redevelopment of Grey Base Hospital is part and parcel of that commitment," Mr Creech said.
