Education Minister Nick Smith wants bullying eliminated from New Zealand schools and is committing $1.3 million over the next three years to help schools get on top of the problem.

"Bullying has been part of school life for generations but cannot be tolerated. The victims are emotionally traumatised and can be driven from school. In the worst cases, bullying can lead to suicide. The bullies will graduate on to domestic violence and assault if not confronted. If we are to become a less violent society, we need to start in the playground."

The Specialist Education Services Eliminating Violence programme works in schools with students, teachers and parents on violence prevention strategies that identify problems and how to deal with them. 24 primary and 16 secondary schools per year will be part of the programme for each of the next three years. Schools will apply to participate, and those with ERO reports indicating difficulties will be given preference.

"It is no good blaming schools with bullying problems. Bullying is difficult to overcome and is often a symptom of what is taking place beyond the school gate. The Government, boards, teachers and parents need to work together to ensure that all students feel safe and welcome at school."
