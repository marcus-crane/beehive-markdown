Health Minister Wyatt Creech today assured pregnant women that there was no threat to the long standing policy of free maternity care for women. "Women have a right to free maternity care. There is no question about that.

"The Health Funding Authority is vigilant in acting on any complaints or accusations that women are being charged for maternity care in the public system.

"Neither the Government not the HFA tolerates this.

"Some doctors have tried to ask for 'donations' from pregnant woman. The Health Funding Authority considers this to be a co-payment and therefore will not be permitted.

"The HFA automatically audits any complaint against a GP who may be trying to charge for maternity care.

"The comment from an Auckland doctor that "the road is open for maternity services charges for GPs" is wrong," Mr Creech said. "The Government position has not changed."
