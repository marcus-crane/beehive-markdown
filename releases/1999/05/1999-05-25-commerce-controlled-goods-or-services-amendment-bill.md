QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Purpose of the Price Control Regime

What is the purpose of the Bill?

The Bill does two things:

It places electricity line businesses under price control; and  
it updates the provisions in Part IV of the Commerce Act to allow for  
modern price control (such as CPI-x).

What is the problem with electricity line businesses?

Electricity line businesses are network natural monopolies. They only have weak incentives to minimise costs and prices  
and to ensure adequate security of supply.

If this problem is not addressed, consumers will face unduly high prices and/or inferior service. Nor will the benefits arising  
from other parts of the electricity reforms - e.g. the introduction of competition in generation and retail - flow through fully  
to consumers.

The objective is to ensure that electricity line, like other parts of the industry, face strong incentives to be efficient, akin to  
competition.

Consumers throughout most of New Zealand can choose their retailer but they have no choice of line company. There is  
likely to be national retail companies competing in all markets soon.

Have line businesses been abusing their position?

Line charges are increasing, not falling. Line charges for domestic consumers (using 6000 kWh/yr) have increased from  
around 4.5 cents per kWh in 1995 to 5.5 cents per kWh in 1999. The contribution of line charges to the bills of domestic  
consumers has increased from 34 per cent in 1995 to 39 per cent in 1999.

Companies have been paying well in excess of Optimised Deprival Value (ODV) for line businesses, and the ODVs of some  
line businesses are higher than they would be if they had been done in a fully rigorous manner. If these trends are not  
constrained there will be further upward pressure on line prices. These issues will be reviewed by the Commerce  
Commission in administering the control regime.

Have line businesses put up their prices in 1999?

Yes. Some line businesses have effectively put up their prices. In particular, many have sold meters without reducing their  
line charges. They also usually no longer read meters, bill individual consumers or operate call centres. Instead of passing  
on these reduced costs, they are taking higher profits.

Transmission costs have also fallen for many line businesses. Transpower has reduced its ODV by 20% or $450 million this  
year. As a result, it has reduced its average prices by nearly 3%. Some line businesses have failed to pass on any reductions  
in transmission charges.

Is this the reason why electricity retailers have put up prices?

TransAlta has blamed price increases solely on effective increases in line charges by Orion in Christchurch, and United  
Networks in Wellington and Auckland.

At this stage we do not know with certainty how true this is which is why the Commerce Commission will be asked  
objectively to analyse the situation for all lines companies.

First Electric's new prices are still 7 to 15 percent cheaper than those of its competitors. But First Electric's charges would  
be lower still but for effective line charge increases.

In summary, line prices should be falling, not rising, as:

line charges generally no longer need to cover the cost of meters and the like;  
the increase over time in the amount of electricity conveyed means that line costs (most of which are fixed) should be falling on a cents per kWh basis;  
line companies are introducing efficiency improvements; and  
transmission prices are coming down.

Have line businesses been warned they may face price control?

Yes. Government policy statements in June 1995 and April 1998 indicated the Government would introduce price control if  
market dominance by electricity line businesses was abused.

On 7 April 1998, the Government said that "line businesses which do not face competition will face increased risks of price  
control if they don't deliver the best possible prices to consumers".

Further, on 16 December 1998, the Government said that "it is serious about implementing price control on line companies if  
they don't reduce costs and prices."

What has happened to the "specific thresholds" scheme?

Late last year, the Government announced its intention, in principle, to put in place arrangements for electricity line  
businesses that comprised a "specific threshold" or ranking scheme. Consistently poor performing line businesses were to be  
automatically subject to price control after two years.

Submissions and independent advice on the scheme was that, based on current data, it was not possible to take into account  
factors outside the control of line businesses. It has therefore been concluded that the specific thresholds scheme should not  
proceed at the present time.

The discussion document issued in December 1998 set out the proposed regime for public consultation.

Design of the Regime

What is CPI-x?

CPI-x involves the regulatory authority (in New Zealand's case the Commerce Commission) developing a formula for  
capping the prices or revenue of the line business so that price or revenue increases in one year do not exceed the percentage  
increase in the Consumers Price Index, minus "x".

X, which is set for a pre-determined period, is the level of efficiency improvements firms should achieve. It incentivises  
firms to do even better as they can keep additional profits if they exceed this target.

The regulator can also set service quality standards. This may be necessary to ensure that the companies do not cut standards  
to increase their profit levels.

Is CPI-x used by any other countries?

All other OECD countries that have deregulated their electricity industries have used some form of price control on their  
line businesses.

The CPI-x approach was developed in the UK in the 1980s. Since then it has been widely adopted by other countries. It is  
generally considered to work well in comparison with other methods of price control. In particular, it introduces a proxy for  
competition on companies which operate in markets where competition is limited or non-existent.

CPI-x avoids the cost-plus approach which is characteristic of rate of return (or profit control).

As recently as 20 May 1999 the UK Office for Electricity Regulations said that it "...reaffirms the benefits of \[CPI-x] as the  
principal price control mechanism. This has encouraged \[line businesses] to find improvements in the quality of supply and  
to achieve significant savings in distribution costs. For example distribution operating costs have fallen in real terms by a  
quarter between 1995 and 1998, while at the same time there have been significant improvements in quality of supply."

What is the relationship between the price control provisions of the Commerce Act and the price control provisions in the  
Electricity Industry Reform Act?

The Electricity Industry Reform Act contains powers to impose price control on line charges to domestic and rural  
consumers should increases in line charges to these groups be considered unreasonable. The Reform Act provisions deal  
with potential equity concerns.

The provisions in the Commerce Act deal with efficiency concerns, and can cover all line charges. These provisions are  
therefore more suited to dealing with excess costs and any profit taking by the companies.

Operation of the Regime

What is the role of the Commerce Commission?

The Commerce Commission will be responsible for administering the control regime. The Commission will develop and  
implement the appropriate revenue or price regime and undertake ongoing monitoring and review of businesses under  
control.

How will the Commerce Commission be funded?

The Government is to provide $2m in additional funding to the Commission in 1999/2000. The legislation will also provide  
powers to introduce regulations if appropriate to levy lines businesses in the future to meet on-going costs.

What is the timing for the introduction of price control?

The Commerce Commission will be required to implement the new regime by 31 December for the 7 largest line companies,  
which together supply 70% of customers. Price or revenue authorisations must be provided for the remaining line companies  
by 31 March 2000.

To protect consumers, the Commerce Commission will also be able to require refunds to consumers of any overcharging  
since 1 April 1999.

Will the proposals also apply to Transpower?

Transpower will be included in the regime. However, the Commerce Commission will focus on local line businesses first.  
The Commission will be required to authorise prices for Transpower by 30 June 2000.

How will quality be assured?

Under price control, it is possible that line companies will attempt to recover the revenue forgone by reducing the reliability  
(and therefore the cost) of supply.

Under the new regime, the Commerce Commission can set minimum quality standards and provide incentives for companies  
to exceed service quality standards. The Commission can also require companies to compensate consumers for breaches of  
minimum service quality requirements. The compensation might, for example, take the form of refunds or future deductions  
from bills.

What about rural line businesses and others with high cost networks?

The Commerce Commission will take into consideration any unavoidable costs faced by line businesses when it determines  
"x".

This regime and the reforms generally, do not require full cost recovery from each sector, each class of consumer or each  
customer within a line network. Companies can continue to cross subsidise their rural (or other customers) to reflect social  
or other objectives.

The Electricity Act 1992 requires lines businesses to maintain existing lines until 2013.

What about line businesses that are already efficient?

The Commerce Commission will take into consideration the efficiency of each line business when it determines the "x".

The Commerce Commission may decide at any time not to apply the regime to an individual firm where the Commission is  
satisfied that this would be efficient and that the interests of consumers would not be adversely affected. Unless the  
Commission continued to be satisfied to this effect, it would be required to reinstate the regime on that business.

Will the regime on line businesses be reviewed?

After the regime has been in place for 12 months and at any time thereafter, the Commerce Commission may recommend to  
the Minister that the regime no longer apply.

The Commission may make such a recommendation only where it is satisfied that discontinuation would be efficient and that  
the interests of consumers would not be adversely affected.

Will the Information Disclosure Regulations still be required?

Companies will still need to provide significant information on the costs, profits and reliability of their natural monopoly  
operations. It is still to be decided whether the information will be provided publicly under the Electricity (Information  
Disclosure) Regulations, or whether information will be provided exclusively to the Commerce Commission under its  
powers.

It is likely that other components of the disclosure regulations - for example, line charges and asset management plans - will  
remain in force.

What will happen next?

Legislation will be introduced today. The Bill will then be referred to the Commerce Committee to allow interested parties  
to make submissions.

Other Components of the Reforms

Are the other components of the reforms working?

The Government's decision to split ECNZ is ensuring strong competition in the wholesale market, to the benefit of  
consumers. Wholesale prices have fallen from about 7 cents per kWh to about 2 or 3 cents per kWh since the end of March  
when competition began.

Further, many electricity consumers who have changed suppliers are paying less than they were before the reforms were  
announced a year ago. Despite First Electric's price increases, consumers are still better off in areas where First Electric  
competes and are paying less than before the reforms. First Electric currently supplies customers in many major centres and  
intends, as do other retailers, to compete throughout New Zealand.

What is the Government doing to ensure effective retail competition?

Effective retail competition is a critical objective of the Government's electricity reforms. Retail competition is occurring  
but consumers are finding it difficult to evaluate the merits of competing retailers.

The Government has decided to contribute funding to help establish an information facility to be operated by a respected  
independent organisation to assist consumers evaluate which electricity retailer best meets their needs. Discussions are  
currently taking place with potential providers of the facility. This is expected to be up and running by the end of July.

Doesn't ownership separation of line and energy businesses fix the problems with electricity line businesses?

The ownership separation requirements of the Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998 directly target impediments to  
competition in electricity retailing. They do not, however, directly target the lack of competitive pressure on profits, prices  
and supply security in electricity line businesses.

Are other countries separating lines and energy?

Countries such as United Kingdom, USA, Australia and Norway have separated or are in the process of separating in one  
form or another line businesses from competitive businesses.

The OECD also recognises the merits of ownership separation. A recent official publication entitled The OECD Report on  
Regulatory Reform notes that restructuring ownership greatly facilitates the introduction of competition.

WHAT IS "CPI - X" AND "SLIDING SCALE" PRICE CONTROL?

CPI - X

CPI - x is an incentive-based form of price/revenue control.  
Changes in price or revenues of controlled goods or services are limited to:

the increase in a general price index, such as the Consumers Price Index (CPI);  
minus a factor (x) determined by the regulatory authority (Commerce Commission in New Zealand) to reflect anticipated efficiency gains or productivity growth which will lower the cost of producing the regulated goods and services.

The regulatory authority, in consultation with the companies producing the controlled goods or services, determines the anticipated efficiency gains. This x factor may be different for individual companies to reflect the varying levels of efficiency or may be identical across an industry. The x factor is generally set for five years at a time.  
Companies have an incentive to further reduce costs (increase efficiency) below the target level as the company will be allowed to retain the higher profit created by this reduction in costs.  
Incentive-based price control provides incentives to improve efficiency but also provides an incentive to increase profits by lowering service quality. This is dealt with in a number of ways:

Under the new regime the Commerce Commission can set minimum quality standards;  
The Commission can provide for incentives for companies to exceed service quality standards;  
The Commission will also have the ability to require companies to compensate consumers for breaches of minimum service quality requirements.

The CPI-x formula can be applied to the price of specifically identified goods or services (setting an actual or maximum price), to the revenue from a basket of goods and services, or to the total revenue of a firm producing controlled goods or services.  
The regulatory authority may also include a factor to adjust for cost increases outside the control of management.

Sliding Scale

Sliding scale regulation enables a trade-off between prices charged to consumers and the rate of return to shareholders. For example, a shareholder might be allowed to retain the profits that result in a high return on capital if the prices charged are below the level implied by the CPI-x formula.

COMMERCE (CONTROLLED GOODS OR SERVICES)  
AMENDMENT BILL  
OVERVIEW

General Purpose

The Government is concerned to ensure that businesses operate efficiently and deliver fair prices to consumers. To this end,  
the aim of this Bill is to subject businesses which face limited competition to similar pressures and incentives to improve  
efficiency, prices and service as those applicable to businesses in competitive markets.

Part IV of the Commerce Act currently provides for price control. The Bill updates the price control provisions of the  
Commerce Act and gives the Commission increased flexibility in administering a control regime. It also places electricity  
line businesses (including Transpower) under a control regime.

The Bill is presented in four clauses which are described below.

Clause 1 (page 2) relates to the short title and commencement.

The Bill amends the Commerce Act 1986. It is planned that the Act will come into force on 1 July 1999.

Clause 2 (page 2) relates to the ways in which goods or services can become controlled, or cease to be controlled, under the  
Commerce Act 1986.

The clause carries forward the current mechanism in Part IV for placing goods or services under price control. Under the Commerce Act 1986, once goods and services are under a control regime they cannot be supplied except in accordance with an authorisation from the Commerce Commission. Controls can be recommended by the Minister and implemented by Order in Council (section 53), if the Minister is satisfied that:

goods or services are being supplied or acquired in a market in which competition is limited or is likely to be lessened, and  
it is necessary or desirable for these goods or services to be controlled in the interests of users, consumers or suppliers (ie suppliers to the controlled business).

The Bill carries over the existing provisions of section 54 and also introduces new provisions relating specifically to electricity line businesses, namely:

electricity line business activities (including Transpower) are declared to be controlled under the Act (sections 52 and 54B). The Bill contains a detailed definition of the line business activities. The definition reflects the Electricity (Information Disclosure) Regulations;  
the Commerce Commission is required to make authorisations by 31 December 1999 in the case of the 7 largest line companies 31 March 2000 in the case of the other line companies and 30 June 2000 in the case of Transpower New Zealand Limited (section 54C);  
the Commerce Commission can exempt particular individual electricity line businesses from the control regime, if it is satisfied that this would be efficient and that the interests of consumers would not be adversely affected. A power to promulgate regulations for fees for exemption applications is included (section 54E);  
the authorisation for electricity line business activities remains in place initially for at least 12 months (section 54F(2);  
after the authorisation has been in place for 12 months, and then at any time thereafter, the Commerce Commission can recommend to the Minister that the control regime for electricity line business activities no longer apply. The Commission must be satisfied that this would be efficient and that the interests of consumers would not be adversely affected (section 54F);  
the Minister, on the recommendation of the Commerce Commission, can suspend or remove electricity line businesses from the control regime by Order in Council. Alternatively, the Minister can direct continuance of control for electricity line business (section 54G).  
if a decision is made to suspend the application of the control regime ("suspension order") the Commission must report annually to the Minister on whether electricity line business activities should continue to be controlled. If there is no decision removing electricity line business activities from control ("exit order"), the regime will again apply to electricity line business activities once the suspension order is revoked (section 54G(3) and (4)).

Clause 3 (page 10) relates to the actual controls that can be imposed in respect of controlled goods or services.

The clause carries forward, with amendments, the existing authorisation provisions (ie the price setting provisions) of sections 70 to 74 of the Commerce Act 1986.  
The amendments give greater flexibility to the Commerce Commission to make authorisations with respect to any goods or service. The amendments will permit incentive-based revenue/price control. Associated powers to set service requirements, impose penalties for breaches of service standards and set incentives for improvements in service quality are included.  
The Bill (section 70) specifically enables the Commerce Commission to:

authorise prices or revenues;  
use methods or formulae (such as CPI-x type formula or sliding scale type price regulation);  
set quality standards that apply to controlled goods or services; and  
include incentives to improve or maintain the quality of the goods or services supplied.

The Commission can authorise a provisional price ("provisional authorisation") for controlled goods or services pending the making of a final determination under section 70 (section 71).  
The Bill allows the Commerce Commission to impose conditions to deal with situations where consumers, users or suppliers of any controlled goods or services are overcharged or quality standards are breached (section 70C). The situations where these conditions can be utilised are where:

prices determined by the Commission are lower than prices charged under a provisional authorisation, or  
quality standards set by the Commission are breached;

The conditions may:

provide for payment of refunds, future deductions, specified amounts, or compensation;  
require the supplier to ensure, to the extent practicable, that the persons who have been affected by the higher prices or revenues or breach of quality standards receive the benefit; and

With respect to the supply of electricity lines business activities only, enables the Commission to backdate to 1 April 1999 any payments reflecting the above conditions (section 70D).

The Bill gives the Commission the power to undertake investigations and efficiency audits in making and administering authorisations (section 70F).  
The Bill will enable levies to be charged to cover the cost of administering the controls (section 74A).

Clause 4 (page 16) makes amendments to the Commerce Act 1986 that are consequential upon the above.

Other Changes to the Commerce Act

The Government is committed to having an effective Commerce Act. The Commerce (Controlled Goods or Services)  
Amendment Bill, relating to control of goods or services, is one of two or possibly three amendments to the Commerce Act  
expected to be passed during 1999.

Proposed changes to the penalties and remedies provisions of the Commerce Act 1986 are to be introduced to Parliament by the end of May. These provisions will apply to activities affected by the Commerce (Controlled Goods or Services) Amendment Bill.  
Officials are currently analysing submissions to a discussion document on the adequacy of the Commerce Act's competition thresholds, particularly those for mergers and dominant firm conduct. Policy decisions will be made by Government by the end of June.

INFORMATION FACILITY TO ASSIST CONSUMERS CHOOSE AN ELECTRICITY RETAILER

The Government proposes to contribute funding to the development and operation of an information facility to assist  
consumers evaluate which electricity retailer best meets their needs.

Competition is the key

Effective retail competition is a critical objective of the Government's electricity reforms. It is clear that where strong retail  
competition is occurring lower prices are available to consumers compared with prices a year ago.

Boosting competition

Retail competition is not yet flourishing or as widespread as it could be. Consumers are finding it difficult to evaluate the  
merits of competing retailers with only limited switching occurring. Competition will drive prices down but only if  
consumers exercise their ability to choose.

Helping consumers to help themselves

Some of the difficulties faced by consumers are:

Not all electricity retailers serve all areas and it is not always clear to consumers which retailers are available in their area.  
Comparing between companies is complicated, because of the complexity and variety of tariffs and the need to weigh up price and non-price information, such as the terms and conditions of contracts.

The Government will contribute financially to help establish an information facility that will make the task of comparing  
retail options much simpler for consumers.

How the new facility will help

Consumers will be able to go to one source, to obtain clear comparative information that is reliable and directly relevant to their choice of electricity retailer.  
The information will be available in electronic, paper and verbal form.  
The costs to consumers of obtaining the information will be nil or negligible.  
The information will be presented and made available in a way that makes it accessible to all consumers in New Zealand.

When will it happen?

Discussions have already been held with some potential providers of this facility and proposals have been sought.  
The information facility should be up and running before the end of July 1999.  
At that time it will be advertised nationally.
