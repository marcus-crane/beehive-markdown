Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, has today released Terms of Reference under which the Law Commission will review New  
Zealand's laws on adoption.

"Many groups and families dealing with adoption have expressed concern that our adoption laws are out-of-touch with  
modern New Zealand", said Mr Ryall.

"The Adoption Act was written in 1955 and many of its provisions are archaic.

"This review will be of considerable interest to New Zealanders. The issue of whether provision should be made for other  
persons, including grandparents, to have access to adopted children will draw particular public interest.

"The Commission will produce a discussion paper by October this year. This report will then be released publicly and may  
be used as a reference for making submissions to the Commission.

"The Commission's final report is expected by 31 March 2000. "Specifically, I have asked the Law Commission:

"To review the legal framework for adoption in New Zealand as set out in the Adoption Act 1955 and the Adult Adoption  
Information Act 1985 and to recommend whether and how the framework should be modified to better address contemporary  
social needs.

In particular, the Commission is asked to consider:

- The principles that should apply in relation to adoption;
- Who may be adopted;
- Who should be permitted to adopt, including whether there should be any restrictions on step parent or inter family adoptions;
- Who should be required to consent to an adoption;
- Whether an adoption order may be cancelled by an adopted person;
- Whether there should be a statutory right of review for those refused approval as suitable applicants to adopt a child;
- Whether there should be a period for revocation of consent by birth parents;
- Whether the jurisdiction of the legislation should be limited to those cases where one or other party is resident in New Zealand.
- The recognition of overseas adoptions including the effect of section 3 of the Citizenship Act 1977;
- Whether special recognition should be given to Maori customary adoptions or any other culturally different adoption practices;
- Whether provision should be made for future contact between natural parents and other persons including grandparents, adoptive parents and the adopted child;
- The scope of applications under section 23 of the Adoption Act for information from the court;
- Whether the scope of the Adult Adoption Information Act 1985 should be expanded to cover a wider range of persons;
- At what stage should an adopted child be entitled to information about his or her identity;
- Whether the current procedures under the Adult Adoption Information Act are still appropriate.

The Commission is not asked to examine past or current social worker practice under either the Adoption Act 1955 or the  
Adult Adoption Information Act 1985".
