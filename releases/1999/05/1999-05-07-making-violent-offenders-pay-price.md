"Longer sentences, tougher bail laws, tighter parole conditions and Police targeted enforcement teams are key to the Government's strategy to make violent offenders pay the price for their actions", Justice Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"It's disappointing that, between 1997 and 1998, violent crime rates have remained static, and have not fallen like other crimes. There were 106.6 violent offences per 10,000 population in both 1997 and 1998.

But, violent crime has dropped in the Waikato, Auckland City and Central police districts.

However, offences are up in Northland, Counties-Manukau and Canterbury. Police Targeted Enforcement Teams are already planned for these three areas. Depending on local priorities, these teams will target violent crime and property crime like burglary and car theft.

"At the same time, the Government is putting in place initiatives to keep violent offenders well away from law abiding New Zealanders.

These include:

Longer sentences for those committing "home invasion" crimes, which will increase maximum penalties for violent offenders by an extra three to five years.  
New bail laws will put the onus on the offender to argue why they should get bail, instead of Police arguing why they shouldn't. Better information will be available to judges on an offender's history to gauge if they are suitable for bail.  
Extending the powers of judges to specify longer non-parole periods for a wider range of crimes.  
"Those who choose to commit violent crimes will be caught. They will find they have less chance of bail. They will also face longer terms behind bars with less chance of parole ", Mr Ryall said.
