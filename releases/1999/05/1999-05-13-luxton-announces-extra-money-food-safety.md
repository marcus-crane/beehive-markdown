Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today announced extra funding in this year's Budget for food safety assurance. The funding covers the cost of establishing a single Food Assurance Authority, in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

"The new agency will provide greater consistency and improved consumer confidence in food safety. To date there had been no single agency in New Zealand focused on food safety. MAF has focused mainly on food for export, while a small unit in the Ministry of Health has concentrated on food for the domestic market."

"Each has been regulated differently, enforced differently and costed for compliance differently. This has caused overlaps and confusion for consumers about who to approach. It also creates a confusing regulatory environment for industry.

"The new regime should ensure greater consistency in all these areas. The Food Assurance Authority will have responsibility for integrating food administration and regulation, protecting public health, and facilitating access to markets for food products."

The establishment of the new stand-alone authority involves the transfer of food administration work and a dozen key head office staff from the Ministry of Health to MAF.

$185,000 has been allocated for relocation, accommodation, and information technology, with an extra $92,000 per annum for on-going costs. A further $563,000 has been allocated for each of the next three years to shift the regulatory environment from a prescriptive one, to one where industry takes responsibility for producing foods that are fit for purpose using risk based management programmes.

The single agency is just one part of a package of structural, legislative and administrative changes designed to enhance food safety. Currently there are barriers to industry groups wishing to implement effective food safety programmes because of overly complex legislative requirements.

"Over the next two to three years The Food Assurance will be working with consumers and industry groups to ensure that we have effective risk based programmes delivering safe food for New Zealanders. This regime will also ensure cost effective production of food for export," Mr Luxton concluded.
