The Government will be introducing legislation into Parliament on Wednesday May 26th, to implement a regulatory framework on monopoly electricity lines companies, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

Details will be released early next week, Mr Bradford said. At their request, a representative group of lines companies met with Mr Bradford today to discuss a different regulatory proposal the companies have put to the Government.

"Discussions will continue in the meantime, but the proposal will need to be significantly improved before I can contemplateputting it to my Cabinet colleagues," Mr Bradford said.
