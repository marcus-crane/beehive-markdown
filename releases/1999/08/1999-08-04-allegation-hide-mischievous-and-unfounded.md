An implication by Rodney Hide that Inland Revenue conceals or destroys information to keep it from the Ombudsman was mischievous, irresponsible and unfounded, Revenue Minister Sir William Birch said today.

"This ACT Party spokesman goes out of his way to misrepresent straightfoward matters as if they were a conspiracy against the nation. The twist he has put on this is unjustifiable and will not improve his credibility.

"The quotation he presented comes from a briefing document for new staff joining the Special Audit Section of IRD, which is responsible for taxing income derived from drug-dealing and all other forms of criminal activity.

"He omits to say that this particular section is headed ‘Other Agencies' Files'. It briefs new staff on how to handle files provided by the Police and similar agencies, to take account of their very confidential status.

"The information in those files is protected by the Official Information Act. It can legally be withheld from public release. It is, however, always available and is always released on request, to the office of the Ombudsman.

"I am advised that when the use of the information to Special Audit has passed, then IRD very properly destroys such files. But a note identifying the data and source is kept, and the data remains available from the original source.

"Mr Hide's suggestion that IRD runs two sets of files to conceal material where release to to the public is required by law, or to conceal information illegally from the Ombudsman, is incorrect and contemptible

"If Mr Hide goes on making such irresponsible allegations, there is no way he can retain his credibility. He will end up calling in question the credibility of the ACT Party as a whole," he said.
