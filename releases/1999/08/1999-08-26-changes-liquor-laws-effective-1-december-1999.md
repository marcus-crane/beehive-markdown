"The major changes to the sale of liquor in New Zealand will take effect from 1 December 1999," Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"There appears to be some confusion about when certain measures will take effect, and I want to clarify the situation for everybody.

"1 December 1999 is the start date for the:

· lowering of the drinking age;  
· use of evidence of age cards;  
· sale of liquor on Sundays;  
· sale of beer in Supermarkets and other outlets;  
· new penalties for outlets selling liquor to people under age; and,  
· new infringement notice regime for certain offences.

"The Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill (No.2) will not be finally passed until it has its third reading, expected today.

"When introduced in November last year the Bill proposed a commencement date of 1 October 1999.

"Changes to the licensing regime, which are also included in the Bill, will take effect from 1 April 2000.

"Anyone interested in the sale of liquor should read the legislation carefully as there are a number of more technical and administrative amendments that become effective at different dates," Mr Ryall concluded.
