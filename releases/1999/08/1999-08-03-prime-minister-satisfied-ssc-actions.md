Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she was satisfied with the actions of the State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham regarding the performance of Work and Income NZ (WINZ) Chief Executive Christine Rankin.

'I share the public's irritation and intolerance of ill-considered and inappropriate public expenditure and I expect it to stop.

'The Commissioner has concluded that there was a lack of financial discipline in organising the Taupo training event and that WINZ does not have a clear understanding as to what is acceptable expenditure of public money.

'I support the Commissioner in the actions he proposes to take, which include censuring Ms Rankin for her conduct, reassessing the payment of a bonus to Ms Rankin and requiring WINZ to reinforce appropriate standards for the expenditure of public money.

'I am also pleased that the SSC Commissioner will be reinforcing this latter point to all State Sector Chief Executives.

'While the public service has a difficult job to do, they must be held accountable as to how they spend public money.

'I am satisfied that this has now occurred in terms of the State Service Commissioners review of events in the WINZ case,' Mrs Shipley said.
