For Immediate Release

The Government agreed today that it will inquire into what can be learned from the INCIS computer project, Finance Minister Sir William Birch and Police Minister Clem Simich announced tonight.

They said major investments were being made in information technology to take advantage of unprecedented opportunities for improvements in systems efficiency in both the private and the public sectors.

"The Government has a huge interest in modernising public sector information technology. The public are entitled to know that all of the parties involved in such investments have performed adequately," they said.

"We believe that lessons can be learned by studying the INCIS project. Based on legal and commercial advice, we do not intend intitiating that work until pending litigation is settled or resolved.

"The Crown's legal advice is that there is no impediment to such an undertaking, once either the Court proceedings have been concluded or a settlement has been reached," the Ministers said.
