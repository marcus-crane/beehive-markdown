Consumer Affairs Minister Peter McCardle has welcomed the decision by Telecom to replace unused portions of pre-paid phone cards.

"My position was clear and critical from the start. I believe Telecom had a moral obligation to reimburse cardholders after deciding to update its phone technology. Consumers should have had the right all along to use up their current cards when it suits them, or get a refund," he said.

"Having maintained that message through continuing contact with the company, I applaud Telecom's change of heart.

"As a result of the turnaround, everyone wins. Thousands of its customers will certainly be pleased, and Telecom is to be congratulated for its decision," he concluded.
