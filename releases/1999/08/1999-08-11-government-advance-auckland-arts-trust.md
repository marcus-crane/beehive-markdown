Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today assured Auckland mayors and their councils interested in the creation of the Auckland Local Authorities Arts Trust, that the National-led minority Government does intend to progress the Bill into law when the House reconvenes on 24 August.

"The Local Government Amendment (No 8) Bill, to facilitate the creation of the Auckland Local Authorities Arts Trust, would have passed much sooner had the Alliance Party allowed it to be progressed as part of a Supplementary Order Paper associated with the Auckland Domain Bill, but they chose not to.

"We have had to run a full parliamentary process for this Bill instead," the Prime Minister said.

"The Hon. Christine Fletcher, who has strongly advocated the passing of the Bill, asked that she be present in the House when the Bill was progressed and  
the Government is keen to see that this occurs in the week of 24 August."

The Prime Minister made it clear that she wanted Auckland interests to be confident that it was the Government's intention to create this opportunity for  
Auckland and she was hopeful they would plan accordingly.
