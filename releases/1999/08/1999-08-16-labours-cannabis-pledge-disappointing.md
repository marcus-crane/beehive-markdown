Minister of Youth Affairs, Tony Ryall, said today that he was disappointed at Labour's pledge to review New Zealand's cannabis laws.

Tim Barnett MP announced Labour's policy yesterday while opening the New Zealand opioid treatment conference in Christchurch.

"Young people need leadership and boundaries on the problem of drug abuse," said Mr Ryall.

"Schools, parents and communities up and down New Zealand are trying to deal with cannabis abuse and the effect drugs are having on our young people.

"This announcement sends exactly the wrong message to young people and undermines the efforts of those trying to deal with the problem. It's very disappointing," Mr Ryall concluded.
