Treasurer Bill English today released figures showing projected changes to Vote: Police over the next five years.

"This year's budget of $840.536 million includes one-off funding of $6.782 million for APEC and the Americas Cup. The difference of $24.022 million  
between this year's budget and next year's indicative budget of $816.514 million includes this one-off funding as well as the savings expected from  
the Police Review.

"After 2000/01 the budget is projected to increase to $820.648 million because of an increase in the funding provided for police cost pressures.

"Indicative budgets have not been finalised for subsequent years so they are the same as the 2001/02 year," said Mr English.

The information was provided in response to a Parliamentary Question from the Labour Party.
