A partnership of effort is needed to defeat heart disease," said Hon Georgina te Heuheu at the official opening of the 47th annual scientific meeting of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, today at the Michael Fowler Centre, Wellington.

"We can all take responsibility for simple things - walking to the shop, not driving; reducing the amount of fat we eat; and stopping smoking," Mrs te Heuheu said.
