Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services has urged Helen Clark to restrain renegade abour MP Tim Barnett from making cannabis easier for young people to get hold of.

Yesterday Tim Barnett pledged Labour would review cannabis laws and re-write the national drug action plan.

"On one hand he blamed Government for contributing to this country's drug problem, but on the other hand he says Labour will make it easier for kids to get cannabis," Mr Sowry said.

"Helen Clark needs to confirm or deny that this is Labour policy."
