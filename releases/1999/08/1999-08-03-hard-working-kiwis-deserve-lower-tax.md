Tax will be a major election issue this year because New Zealanders care about how much tax they pay, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Helen Clark and the Labour Opposition are afraid of the tax issue and are trying to talk it down. They don't want it to be a major election issue because they are planning to put taxes up.

"National has cut taxes and will cut taxes again by growing the economy. A growing economy creates jobs, better incomes, and more tax revenue for the government.

"If governments are careful with that money they can fund all the services people need - and leave more money in families' pockets by cutting taxes. That's what New Zealanders deserve.

"Labour has yet to learn that you can't spend more and more taxpayers money without taking it from somewhere.

"They will promise anything to anyone, anytime, anywhere. But who's going to pay? Someone always has to pay for political promises if they are to be kept.

"National has been keeping tally of those spending promises. Very soon all New Zealanders will know what Labour's promises cost, and see that there is a huge gap between what they say and what they will do to fund these promises," said Mrs Shipley.
