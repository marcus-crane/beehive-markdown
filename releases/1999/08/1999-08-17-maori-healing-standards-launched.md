Associate Minister for Health Georgina te Heuheu today launched standards to ensure quality service for traditional Maori healing practices.

"In launching these standards today we are recognising the value that continues to be placed on traditional healing as part of the spectrum of health care which people choose to use. The standards are designed to ensure that there is consistent practice in clinics throughout the country," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Having health services Mäori people feel comfortable using is an important part of addressing the disparity in health statistics between Mäori and Pakeha," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Increasingly in recent years, GPs, traditional healers and Maori nurses have been working alongside each other to provide a range of services that people feel comfortable in using."

These standards will assist healers to enhance the work that they do, by ensuring the quality and safety of the valuable services that they deliver.

They cover referrals to other health services, record keeping, rights and responsiblities of the patient, staff training, networking with other providers and the safe preparation, storage and labelling of medicines.
