Education and Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched NIWA's Sea and Learn Programme on board the 28 metre research vessel Kaharoa, at Kings Wharf in Wellington. The first pupils to take part in the programme arrive on board this morning from Palmerston North Girls High School.

"The Sea and Learn programme provides a great opportunity for senior students to experience real life science and interact with practising scientists who work on the research vessels. Competition for places on the programme has been intense with over 80 schools applying for 18 places, and only 12 students from each school able to have a place on their school's trip. This shows just how worthwhile schools see this type of programme."

This is the first year NIWA has run the programme. The students will take part in experiments at sea and be part of a full marine science experience. Activities on each day trip will include sampling micro organisms, learning about navigation technology and the physical structure of a water column. NIWA is about to begin a corporate sponsorship drive for the programme.

"This programme is a great way to show students that marine science can be a fun experience, and maybe even a career option. All activities are linked to the school curriculum."

"I would like to commend NIWA on their proactive approach to enhancing students' knowledge of marine science. This programme has involved input from a number of NIWA's scientists and the enthusiasm of our schools and students demonstrates what a great job they have done."
