"I have been advised that Helen Clark's accusations in Parliament about surgical practices and 'a second bungled operation' at Auckland's Ascot Hospital are wrong," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

Mr Creech said he had asked the Health Funding Authority to follow up the claims about Ascot Hospital made by Helen Clark.

"While the Health Funding Authority has to preserve the privacy of the patient it does advise me that the claims being made are incorrect."

The HFA advises that:

\* any surgical complications have not been found to have been related  
to the surgical technique employed during surgery,

\* the person's admission to Middlemore Hospital was in no way related  
to any care or procedure received from Ascot Hospital,

\* nothing has occurred that would necessitate a report to the HFA by  
Ascot regarding breach of contract or quality of care.

"The Labour Leader has irresponsibly levelled all sorts of accusations at Ascot - without checking the facts.

"This is a disappointing attempt to score cheap political points. The public should expect better."
