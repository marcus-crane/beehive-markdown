"The Employers Federation is right when they warn higher taxes and repealing the Employment Contracts Act will cost jobs", says SOE Minister Tony Ryall.

"Yesterday's news that unemployment is continuing to fall is positive news.

"But more can be done. Lower taxes, fairer employment laws, and low interest rates are vital to job growth.

"Yet Labour-Alliance's plan to hike taxes and government spending will put this positive future at risk.

"The people who know job creation best say higher taxes and unions back in the driving seat are disasters for job seekers.

"The Employers Federation warning is a timely reminder that all the gains of the past few years are at risk from the party of yesterday's people with yesterday's ideas.

"Labour-Alliance and the unions will cost jobs", said Mr Ryall.
