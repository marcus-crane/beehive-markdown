The new agreement signed yesterday between the Children, Young Persons and their Families Agency (CYPFA) and the 'Umbrella Groups' representing social service organisations is a major step forward, said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services.

"I'm delighted with the progress and know this new contract will lead to a much stronger relationship between Government agencies and the voluntary sector," Mr Sowry said.

"I'm also confident it will ensure taxpayers get best possible value for money from funding to the voluntary sector organisations."

There is now only one contract to fund the umbrella organisations, instead of the three individual contracts that were previously in place.

And equally importantly, the areas in which the three organisations' services were overlapping have been sorted out, and $10,000 has been set aside to research the linkages between the voluntary sector and Government.

"I'd like to reiterate the importance of the voluntary sector in delivering social services in partnership with government," Mr Sowry said. "It's a relationship which will continue to flourish, and I thank the umbrella groups for working with CYPFA and myself towards this goal."
