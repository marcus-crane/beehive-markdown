"This Government is serious about managing young offenders so that they're kept safe, get the help they need and have the best chance to get their lives back on track," said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services.

He made the comments at the announcement of the proposed site for the new Youth Justice Residential Centre in Auckland.

"This 40 bed centre will increase the number of beds available by 15 from the 25 in Auckland at present, and builds on other new youth justice facilities.

The 30 bed Palmerston North facility opens in November and the site selection process for the new facility in Christchurch is well underway.

In addition, a specialist treatment unit for adolescents who have sexually abused was opened in Christchurch last month and building of a new purpose built care and protection facility in the Wellington region begins in November. This 20 bed facility will include a specialist unit for children and young people with conduct disorders.

?This Government has been committed to the Residential Services Strategy which will see the number of beds available in our youth justice and care and protection facilities increase from 100 to 166.?

?The community needs to remember that the proposed new Auckland facility will be purpose-built and secure. The public can have confidence that centres like this make it much easier for CYPFA to contain and manage our young offenders."

Mr Sowry said he is hopeful that all people involved in the youth justice sector will support this new secure facility.
