The Minister of Health today said he would be seeking further advice from the Ministry of Health and the Health Funding Authority about the best way of making progress with controlling cancer in New Zealand.

"A workshop of experts being held in Wellington will help advise health officials on the way forward.

"Over recent years a lot of effort has gone into specific programmes such as breast screening, cervical cancer screening and tobacco control to try to reduce the incidence of cancer.

"Deaths from cervical cancer have dropped by around six per cent a year since the introduction of the national screening programme in 1991.

"Now that these programmes are in place it is timely to look at the next step.

"The Government has an open mind on the best way forward and will be watching the outcomes and advice from the workshop closely.

"The Ministry of Health is supporting the workshop and is awaiting advice from these experts on options for the future," Mr Creech said.
