New Zealand's themes for APEC this year were consistent with many of the objectives sought by world trade union leaders, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley met labour union leaders attending the 5th International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) Asia Pacific Labour Network Conference in Wellington.

"As Chair of APEC, we are as committed as the labour unions, to ensuring that the benefits of the APEC process flow through to working people."

During the meetings the Prime Minister received the Conference's Final Statement and undertook to pass it to other APEC Leaders before the APEC Economic Leaders' meeting in Auckland, next month.
