The selection of Clayton Cosgrove as the Labour candidate for the Waimakariri seat has once again highlighted the differences between the right and left wings of the Labour party, said Hon Roger Sowry, Leader of the House.

Helen Clark's begrudging acknowledgment that Mr Cosgrove was the duly selected choice of the selection panel is hardly welcoming for her newest candidate.

I wonder whether Ms Clark would have been more vocal if the chosen candidate had come from the trade unions?, asked Mr Sowry.

It's clear from Ms Clark?s reaction to Mr Cosgrove?s selection that there are huge divides between the right and left wings of the Labour party. I seriously question Ms Clark?s ability to work effectively with her own members let alone those of a Labour-Alliance coalition.
