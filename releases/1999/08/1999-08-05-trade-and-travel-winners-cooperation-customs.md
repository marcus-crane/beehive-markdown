Customs can improve the speed of clearing both people and goods whilst enhancing security with cooperation between countries, Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control David Carter said today

Mr Carter opened the Apec Customs Sub-committee today in Rotorua

"New Zealand has an excellent bioscecurity and border control record that we will not put at risk.

"However, with cooperation, it is possible for Apec customs to improve their speed of clearing people and goods and their ability to ensure safety and security. Together improved speed and security are important keys to the future growth of both trade and travel among Apec economies," Mr Carter said.

"In this information age, people expect fast, safe movement through borders.

"Whether for business or for travel, people are less tolerant of long queues and endless form-filling than they use to be.

"The cooperation Apec economies are showing on customs procedures is a good sign in meeting people's expectation and facilitating business development in the region," Mr Carter said.

"This is work that cannot be done in isolation. The Apec sub-committee on customs procedures is an important forum for furthering the harmonisation and simplification work.

"It makes sense for countries to simplify and harmonise their procedures so data collected for exporting purposes in one country can also meet the needs of the importing country.

"Improved ease and speed of clearance through customs coupled with lower costs and enhanced security will be good news for everyone from travellers, to exporters and importers," Mr Carter said.
