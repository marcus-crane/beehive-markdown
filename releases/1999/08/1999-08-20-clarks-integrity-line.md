Helen Clark appointed Labour Party cronies to plum jobs just days before the 1990 General Election," SOE Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"Helen Clark's comments in this morning's Dominion that a government "should not seek to shackle a new administration with political appointments" are nothing more than a hypocritical attempt to con the New Zealand public.

"In October 1990 the Labour Government, of which Helen Clark was Deputy Prime Minister, appointed Labour Party cronies Reg Boorman and Lloyd Falck to plum jobs on the Earthquake and War Damages Commission.

"The appointments were for three years, and Ms Clark's Government made them just three weeks before a General Election she and every other New Zealander knew Labour had no hope of winning.

"Mr Boorman was a former Labour MP for the Wairarapa. In 1988 he was disqualified from standing as an MP for five years after being found guilty of corrupt practice.

"Lloyd Falck on the other hand was a failed candidate for the Labour Party Presidency.

"What is more, Helen Clark, personally appointed Mr Ken Gray to the Health Sponsorship Council, just eight weeks before the 1990 General Election. Mr Gray was an unsuccessful Labour Party electorate candidate.

"In addition Labour made dozens of Power Board appointments just days before the election and confirmed Mr Harold Titter to a senior civil servant role as Secretary of Defence, also eight weeks from polling day.

"Ms Clark's comments today show her statements are unreliable and she lacks personal integrity. She is prepared to do one thing while in Government then say completely the reverse while in opposition.

"This latest insight into her personal integrity comes just days after an admission on Wednesday night's Holmes show that Ms Clark would break the promise she personally made as Deputy Prime Minister to honour the West Coast Accord.
