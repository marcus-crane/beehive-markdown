Christchurch GATT Watchdog organiser Aziz Choudry and the Crown have reached a settlement of Mr Choudry's damages against the Crown for the entering of his home by two Security Intelligence Service officers in July 1996.

The settlement follows a Court of Appeal ruling that there was at the time no power of entry of private premises pursuant to an interception warrant granted by the Prime Minister pursuant to section 4A of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969.

The Crown has now apologised to Mr Choudry for the illegal entry of his home.

The settlement involves a payment to Mr Choudry of substantial damages and payment towards his legal costs. All other terms of the settlement are confidential to the parties.
