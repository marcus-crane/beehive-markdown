Tourism Minister Lockwood Smith has announced new appointments to the New Zealand Tourism Board.

The new appointments are :

Peter Stubbs, a partner of Auckland-based law firm Simpson Grierson. Peter Stubbs is the President of the Events and Sponsorship Association of New Zealand, a member of the Hamilton City Council's Event Fund Allocation Team, and a member of the Auckland City Council committee responsible for awarding contracts for large scale Auckland Domain events for 2000-03;

Mike Tamaki, Managing Director of the Tamaki Maori Village in Rotorua. Mike Tamaki was on the Board of the New Zealand Tourism Industry Association in 1998-99, and the Rotorua Tourism Advisory Board in 1997-98.

"These appointments together bring a valuable mix of commercial, legal and tourism experience to the Tourism Board," Dr Smith said.

"They are appointments of the highest calibre, and I'm certain that the Tourism Board will value the skills and experience of the new members as it rolls out its Global Marketing Strategy in New Zealand's offshore markets.

"I also want to express my appreciation of the work of outgoing Board members Sir Howard Morrison and Jennie Law, who have both made valuable contributions to the work of the Tourism Board," Dr Smith concluded.
