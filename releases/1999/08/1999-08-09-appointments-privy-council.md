An announcement has been made by the Office of the British Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street, London, that The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve that:

Notes for Editors

1 Appointment to the Privy Council is for life and members are entitled to use the title "The Right Honourable" (abbreviated to "The Rt Hon") before their name.

2 The two new appointments bring the total number of New Zealand members of the Council to 38. A full list of Privy Counsellors is attached.

3 Apart from the Prime Minister who is traditionally appointed to the Council, other Ministers are appointed on the basis of seniority or length of service, or both.

4 The Chief Justice has traditionally been appointed to the Privy Council. This practice enables the Chief Justice, like Judges of the Court of Appeal, to sit on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from time to time.

5 Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council is the Sovereign's inner advisory committee on executive matters of state in the United Kingdom. Appointments to the Council are made by The Queen on the advice of the British Prime Minister and are held for life.
