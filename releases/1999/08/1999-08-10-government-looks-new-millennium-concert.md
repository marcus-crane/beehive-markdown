The Government is considering ways to guarantee a new centrepiece for Gisborne's Millennium celebrations with a free dawn concert on the beach featuring Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra being one option that could be considered.

Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she had been approached by broadcasters and Gisborne interests who said that, because of difficulties surrounding a commercially-run paid concert, a new initiative should be considered.

Mrs Shipley said the Government had received an "attractive proposal" for a free dawn concert featuring Dame Kiri.

"It would be a great shame for the people of Gisborne and all New Zealanders if the dawn concert featuring a great New Zealand icon could not go ahead.

"New Zealanders want to celebrate the Millennium in style, so we're looking seriously at the proposal. The concert would be a great event for New Zealanders to enjoy and be proud of. It also offers the potential of international television coverage.

"At the same time, I'm not prepared to risk taxpayers' money so we're being very prudent."

Mrs Shipley said it would take a few days to consider whether the new project could go ahead.
