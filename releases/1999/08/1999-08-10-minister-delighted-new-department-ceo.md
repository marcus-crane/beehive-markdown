The appointment of Jackie Brown as the chief executive of the new Children, Youth and Family Services department has been welcomed by Social Services Minister Roger Sowry.

"The move to create a stand-alone department totally focussed on the well-being of children and families is the result of a great deal of work, and it's a first for New Zealand."

"I have total confidence that Ms Brown will lead the new department ably into the new milennium, providing better and more comprehensive services for New Zealand's most at-risk families."

Mr Sowry said the new department had a critical job which could shape the future of society by helping our most troubled children and teenagers.
