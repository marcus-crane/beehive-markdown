Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says the Bright Future Package represents a challenge to all New Zealanders, Government included.

"Today we have launched a blueprint for the years ahead. Bright Future is about helping ourselves and future New Zealanders to prosper.

"It is about sharing a vision and working to achieve it.

"As part of this, I am today announcing the formation of the Innovate New Zealand Council, to provide guidance for Government on how to approach the issues and opportunities that will face New Zealand in the 21st century.

"The Innovate New Zealand Council will take a lead in bringing together the education, research, business and government sectors. Members will be chosen for their experience and knowledge in a range of sectors, and also for their ability to communicate widely to all New Zealanders.

"We are giving the Innovate New Zealand Council a strong communications brief, so that all New Zealanders can be involved in the current thinking on a range of issues affecting our future growth and prosperity," Mrs Shipley said. "At the same time we will reassess the role of the Enterprise Council."

"I am particularly pleased that the Bright Future programme sees the introduction of the Prime Minister's Awards. One of the most important ways Government can encourage innovative thinking is by recognising those who are successful, and who are leading the knowledge economy.

"The Prime Minister's Awards are a way for Government to identify success and foster it as an example for others. It is important that we all - business, Government, and the public - share a common definition of success and are involved in celebrating it. The Prime Minister's Awards are a step forward in making that happen."

Mrs Shipley said that the Bright Future initiative to network with successful New Zealanders working overseas, was long overdue.

"We are proud of Kiwis who are successful in a large range of fields overseas, and we want them to pollinate New Zealand and New Zealanders with the ideas and success strategies they have learnt from around the world. Bright Future will help build and maintain links with these people.

"Ideally, we also want to attract some of them back home, to base themselves in New Zealand. With today's technology, you can run an international business from Lumsden, instead of London, and enjoy New Zealand's enviable lifestyle.

''A newsletter for expat Kiwis working overseas will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, and will encourage New Zealanders in other parts of the world to contribute to the success of their homeland."

The Prime Minister said that a planned promotional campaign would give those with great ideas, but who lacked self confidence and self esteem, examples and incentives to spur them on to achieve their own ambitions.

"Bright Future is about sharing success and encouraging it. Everything we can do to inspire people to think about the future and their role in it, is worth doing," the Prime Minister said.
