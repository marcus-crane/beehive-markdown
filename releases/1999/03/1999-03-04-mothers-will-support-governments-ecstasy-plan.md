The Minister for Courts and Associate Minister of Health, the Hon Georgina te Heuheu, says mothers across the country will understand the Government's determination to take a tougher line against the drug, Ecstasy.

The Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley, announced yesterday that the Government wants Parliament to reclassify Ecstasy from a Class B to a Class A drug, putting it into the same category as heroin, cocaine, and LSD.

Mrs te Heuheu says that this will signal very clearly to young people, their parents, and the public that Ecstasy is a serious drug that should not be treated lightly.

"I have different priorities to the sociologists and commentators who have criticised the plan as an emotional, rather than a common-sense, approach", Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Our young people are our future. It is important that the message is clear to everyone. A drug like Ecstasy can ruin the lives of our young people".

"If reclassification can help send out that message, then it is the right thing to do", Mrs te Heuheu said.

"I do not think that there would be a mother anywhere in the country who would disagree with Mrs Shipley", she said.

Mrs te Heuheu says that the police confirm that a major difficulty with Ecstasy is convincing its users that it is harmful. The more serious classification will help that message get through.

She says that the National Government has a co-ordinated approach to the battle against drugs and is very serious about the need to come down hard on drug dealers, especially those preying on schools.
