Growth of 0.7% in the December quarter of 1998 - in line with market expectations - confirms that a solid economic recovery is well underway, Treasurer Bill Birch and Finance Minister Bill English said today.

"We all know that the drought and Asian economic crisis made for a very difficult start to last year.

"However today's figure, following on from growth of 0.6% in the September quarter of 1998, shows New Zealand bounced back in the second half of last year.

The Ministers said it was encouraging that growth in the December quarter was lifted by both internal demand and exports, and that business investment had picked up.
