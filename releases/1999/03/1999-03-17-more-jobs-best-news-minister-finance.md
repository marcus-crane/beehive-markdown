More jobs being advertised was the best possible news a Minister of Finance could hope to get, Finance Minister Bill English said during today's debate on the Budget Policy Statement.

"More jobs are tangible proof that the country is heading in the right direction and the best possible news that I could have as Minister of Finance. The latest survey shows the number of job advertisements in the three main centres is up nearly 3.5% on a year ago. Newspaper editors are reporting a jump in revenue from job adverts.

"High levels of business confidence and new investment are key steps towards growth, but the real benefit for the country is when new jobs are created.

"New Zealand is moving out of last year's recession and a recovery is underway. Confidence has lifted in all sectors except agriculture.

"This is obviously good news for the country. But an economic recovery is not an invitation to gloss over some of the underlying economic issues this country faces such as low savings and declining rural and provincial incomes.

"I want to be part of a forward-looking Government which has the courage to grapple with these difficult issues and to work with New Zealanders and their communities to find solutions," said Mr English.
