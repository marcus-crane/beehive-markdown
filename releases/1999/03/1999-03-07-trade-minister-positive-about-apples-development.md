Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has welcomed Australia's decision to undertake a new risk analysis on the importation of New Zealand apples.

At their meeting in Wellington in December 1998, Dr Smith and the Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer committed themselves to finding a process for the timely resolution of the issue. This followed the release of the Australian risk analysis earlier that month which had confirmed the ban on New Zealand apple exports to Australia.

"This is a positive development", said Dr Smith.

"I understand that the Australians will explore the least trade restrictive measures which might be put in place to provide the appropriate level of protection from pests and disease they do not have.

"It is hoped that we will have a result by the end of the year", said Dr Smith.
