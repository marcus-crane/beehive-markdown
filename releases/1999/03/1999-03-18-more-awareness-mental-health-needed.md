Health Minister Wyatt Creech today launched two initiatives designed to help dispel some of the myths about mental illness and support those dealing with mental health issues.

Mr Creech was in Auckland launching the Mental Health Foundation's website www.mentalhealth.org.nz and the Schizophrenia Fellowship's Code of Family Rights.

"One of the big problems surrounding mental health is a lack of understanding and awareness about the effects of mental illness.

"Making more people aware and knowledgeable will help dispel some of the myths and over-reactions to mental health issues.

"I applaud the Mental Health Foundation for establishing the country's first mental health website, providing user-friendly information on mental disorders and treatments, support groups and organisations, prevention, media issues, discrimination against mental health consumers, upcoming events, advocacy, policy issues and statistics.

"This week is also Schizophrenia Awareness Week. The Schizophrenia Fellowship's Code of Family Rights will be a useful tool to help families provide support.

"As a rule there is nothing like having a supportive family when someone gets sick. But serious illness, including serious mental illness puts extra pressure and strain on families. The Code is designed to help ease some of the strain.

"A lot of mental health concerns are based on ignorance. The more we can do to help expand people's knowledge and understanding, the better off we will be in the long term."
