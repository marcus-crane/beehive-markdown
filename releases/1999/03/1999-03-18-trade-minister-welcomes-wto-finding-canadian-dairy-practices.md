Trade Minister Lockwood Smith today welcomed reports that a World Trade Organisation (WTO) Disputes Settlement Panel has ruled that Canada's cross-subsidy dairy programmes are inconsistent with its WTO obligations.

New Zealand had asked the WTO to rule on Canada's 'two-tier' pricing structure which was being used to provide 'low-cost' milk to processors for export sales.

The panel's report, which has yet to be officially circulated, has affirmed that the Canadian scheme is an export subsidy, and is in breach of the WTO Agreements.

"I've always been confident that New Zealand has a strong case, and I'm delighted that the WTO panel has seen merit in our arguments," said Dr Smith.

"The WTO panel has established an important principle in affirming that states can not use these sorts of subsidy schemes to undercut competitors in international markets.

"While WTO processes have yet to be completed, the panel report can be seen as a very positive development.

"It's helpful to have such guidance as we move towards a new WTO round", said Dr Smith.

Although the WTO panel report has gone New Zealand's way, it is possible that the Canadians may appeal the decision.

"We would expect to get a reading on Canada's intentions over the coming weeks. If Canada were to appeal the decision, the WTO time-table would require the appeal process to conclude before the end of this year", said Dr Smith.
