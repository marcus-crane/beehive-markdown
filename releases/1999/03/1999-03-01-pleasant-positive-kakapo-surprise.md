Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced the surprise arrival of 2 kakapo chicks on Pearl Island, giving the third successive year of success for the Kakapo Recovery Programme.

"This is fantastic news and a very pleasant surprise. The kakapo remains the most endangered species of parrot in the world with only 55 birds remaining. Over the past 15 years we have averaged less than one chick per season and, in 11 of the last 16 years, have had no chicks."

The Kakapo Recovery Team had not expected kakapo chicks this year, after their shift from Codfish Island and because kakapo only breed once every 3-5 years. Kakapo were removed from Codfish Island with other native bird species as part of an intensive rat eradication programme on the Island. While it was expected there would be a short term loss to the recovery programme, the long term benefits to the kakapo of Codfish Island being rat free was seen as worthwhile.

"Alice was the first bird in the recovery programme to breed, back in 1981. Since then she has produced six chicks. Alice laid three eggs in 1997, one of which was successfully raised and is now living on Pearl Island, and it was not expected that she would produce eggs again this year. It is a real bonus that these eggs are fertile and now hatching."

The sex of the chicks will be determined by DNA, collected from the egg shell, and will take about three weeks. The hope is that one or both of these chicks will be female, as these are desperately needed to boost the breeding capability of the kakapo population in the future.

"To have chicks three years running is a huge vote of confidence in the Kakapo Recovery Programme. Comalco, Royal Forest and Bird and DOC staff deserve a real accolade for each of their contributions in turning the tide for the kakapo."
