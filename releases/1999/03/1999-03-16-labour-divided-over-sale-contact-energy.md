"The Government's new approach to publicly floating state businesses has really struck a chord with New Zealanders", said Tony Ryall, SOE Minister.

"A staggering 175,000 New Zealanders have registered an interest in buying shares in Contact Energy", Mr Ryall said.

"The Contact sale builds on the success of the Auckland Airport float, which included 68,000 New Zealand investors, and the Capital Properties float which attracted 31,000 New Zealand investors.

"It is abundantly clear, that the people of this country not only support the sale of non-core Government businesses, but also want to be a part of those business in the future.

"Labour's position on asset sales is considerably less clear.

"The Labour leader publicly stated that the 40 percent 'cornerstone' share of Contact should be retained in public ownership. But Labour's finance spokesperson, Dr Michael Cullen, said that the cornerstone share should be publicly floated.

"The Alliance, Labour's political bed-fellow, doesn't support any sales, and has in fact indicated it wants to re-centralise businesses by buying some back. I wonder how much taxpayer money they will pay to re-centralise Forestry Corp and Telecom", said Mr Ryall.

"The lack of cohesion in the Labour-Alliance bloc, testifies to the philosophical divisions within the left.

"Given that Labour has had eight years in opposition, it is remarkable that they are still throwing policy together on the hoof. Eight years and no ideas," Mr Ryall concluded.
