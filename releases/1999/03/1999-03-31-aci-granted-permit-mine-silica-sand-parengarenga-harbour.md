ACI NZ Operations Ltd has been granted a permit allowing it to continue mining silica sand from Parengarenga Harbour, Northland, Hon Max Bradford, Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, announced today.

ACI has been mining silica sand from Parengarenga Harbour for some 75 years. The sand which is of particularly good quality, is used for glass production in ACI's Penrose, Auckland, plant.

ACI already has a coastal permit granted by the Northland Regional Council which allows it to undertake mining. This addresses matters related to the effects of mining on the environment. Since 1996, it has also been required to hold a mining permit under the Crown Minerals Act.

In granting the mining permit, Mr Bradford said he had particularly taken into account in his evaluations issues raised by tangata whenua related to the mining permit. Te Aupouri and Ngati Kuri iwi have tangata whenua status at Parengarenga.

"I received and took into consideration submissions forwarded by Maori both opposing and in favour of mining. My officials attended several hui with tangata whenua," Mr Bradford said.

"The decision to grant the permit took into account all views expressed by Maori and I consulted with my ministerial colleagues and within government," Mr Bradford said.

"The decision was made weighing up all the competing considerations. On balance I decided that the grounds were established to grant the permit."

The mining permit will allow ACI to again use New Zealand silica sand in its glass production process. It has had to import sand over the last 18 months.

Two hundred people are employed at ACI's Penrose plant which produces glass packaging for a range of products. The Penrose plant also processes recycled glass collected from throughout New Zealand.

There will be mining of about 50,000 tonnes of silica sand per year. It is extracted from the Parengarenga Harbour by barge and towed to Auckland.

The mining permit has been granted for 12 years.

Mr Bradford said that Ngati Kuri have a Treaty of Waitangi Claim lodged which relates to the effects of silica sand mining from Parengarenga on Maori. He said that the granting of the mining permit will not affect consideration of this Treaty claim.
