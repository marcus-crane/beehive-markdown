Enterprise and Commerce Minister, Max Bradford, says latest statistics show that petrol prices are continuing to decrease.

Mr Bradford today released the latest edition of the twice-yearly Energy Data File (EDF) prepared by the Ministry of Commerce.

Included in the January 1999 edition is an analysis of petrol importer margin trends (the margin between import and retail prices), updated through to the September quarter of last year.

Mr Bradford said that the July 1998 edition of the EDF showed that the petrol importer margin had decreased by about 1.6 cents per litre per year since 1996.

"The January 1999 EDF which contains more recent data shows an even greater decrease - the margin has been falling at a rate of 3.2 cents per litre per year since the second quarter of 1996.

"I fully expect the price competition brought about by Challenge's entry nearly a year ago, by Gulf since last December and by Liberty later this year, partnered with further falls in the margin will see lower prices for consumers," Mr Bradford said.
