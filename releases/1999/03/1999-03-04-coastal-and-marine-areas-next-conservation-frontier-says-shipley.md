Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said coastal and marine areas would be the next conservation frontier in the new millennium.

Mrs Shipley met world renowned environmentalist David Bellamy at Island Bay Beach today where they discussed environmental issues, including marine conservation and a proposal to establish a marine reserve on Wellington's South Coast.

"As we look to the new millennium, the focus for conservation policy will be the better management of our coasts, oceans and fisheries.

"New Zealand has the fourth largest ocean management responsibilities in the world. We need to know and manage these areas better to avoid some of the mistakes we made on land.

During the meeting at Island Bay, Mrs Shipley showed Dr Bellamy parts of Wellington's South Coast that are being investigated for inclusion in a marine reserve.

"This is a good place to start - in Wellington's own back yard which was once badly polluted by sewage waste. I support and endorse the efforts of the Marine Reserve Coalition to find a community-wide consensus on boundaries for a reserve, and a management plan for the future of the South Coast.

"Properly managed marine reserves are good for the future of our coastlines and the replenishment of our fisheries stocks.

"We will talk to Maori and the local community about this proposal, but it looks worth considering," Mrs Shipley said.

A draft application for the marine reserve is expected to be lodged with Conservation Minister Nick Smith by May 1999.

More than 30 per cent of New Zealand's land area is set aside for conservation purposes, while less than one per cent of the ocean under New Zealand's control is protected.

As leader of the National Party, Mrs Shipley said she was proud of the party's Bluegreens policy taskforce launched in August last year, to develop environmental policy and monitor National's performance on environmental issues.

The Bluegreens will be holding their inaugural forum at Parliament and the WWF Treehouse, Botanical Gardens on Friday 5 and Saturday 6 March. For more information contact Tracey Stratford, ph (03) 547 2314.
