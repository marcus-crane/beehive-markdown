Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced that extensive protection works for Aoraki/Mount Cook village are underway and will be completed by July.

"Aoraki/Mount Cook is an icon of New Zealand and a major tourist destination. It needs to be brought up to an appropriate standard worthy of its world heritage status. People living in the village, as well as visitors, will benefit from this up-grading."

A contract was recently signed between Works Civil Construction Limited Timaru and the Aoraki/Mount Cook Development Company to complete the geo-technical work, which includes up-grading public areas and protecting the village from natural disasters

"A 1995 natural hazards report revealed significant threats to the village from the Black Birch and Glencoe catchments. Without protection works completed on these areas the Mackenzie District Council was not willing to grant building consents for new structures and might move to close some existing buildings."

As a result of the report, DOC and Tourism Milford Limited (owners of 'The Hermitage') have reached agreement on how to fund the geo-technical work, as well as the subsequent development work. TML has raised a $1.5 million loan to pay for immediate works, which will be repaid from levies and fees, including a charge for long term car-parking.

"This work is the first stage of a longer term plan to redevelop the Aoraki/Mount Cook village. It will ensure the safety of the site and lift the restriction on improvements and alterations to existing buildings. The next phase will be to upgrade visitor facilities like the public toilets, visitor centre, and car-parking areas to make Aoraki/Mount Cook a first class visitor destination."
