Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will lead the New Zealand delegation to the State Memorial Service for former Samoan Prime Minister Tofilau Eti to be held in Apia tomorrow (Monday New Zealand time).

Mrs Shipley is expected to deliver a eulogy at the service. Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Don McKinnon will also attend the service, along with other MPs from the Government and other political parties. The delegation will include members of the New Zealand Samoan community and diplomatic representatives.

"Tofilau Eti was a distinguished Prime Minister and an esteemed regional leader in the South Pacific," Mrs Shipley said.

"He worked tirelessly over decades to build the special friendship between Samoa and New Zealand. It is fitting that his passing should be marked with very senior and diverse political representation from New Zealand."

A special Air Force flight will take the New Zealand delegation to Apia tomorrow morning and return early on Tuesday morning.

The Memorial Service is expected to be held at approximately 4pm tomorrow afternoon New Zealand time. His funeral and burial took place in Samoa today.
