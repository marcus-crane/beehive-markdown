The Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control today released the Fisheries White Paper (Proposed Nature and Extent of Fisheries Services for the 1999/2000 Financial Year). This document outlines the estimated costs and draft budgets required to ensure the sustainable use of New Zealand 's fisheries.

The purpose of this document is to enable the Minister to consult with stakeholders on the services the Ministry of Fisheries proposes to purchase or produce in the 1999/2000 financial year. The Minister will confirm the nature and extent of fisheries services, relevant funding levels and the resulting levy order for 1999/2000 based on this document, feedback from the consultation process, and further reprioritisation work.

'I understand that stakeholders expected to be consulted on the nature and extent of fisheries services under the amended legislation. However, as the legislation is unlikely to be enacted until October 1999 I am obliged to consult under the provisions of the current legislation.' The Minister said.

Compared to 1998/99, the differences in activities are:

A proposed increase in research spending from the research planning process of $6.199m; and  
A changed level of effort arising from both the implementation of the fisheries reforms and the 'front end' of the Fisheries Act 1996.  
'The increase in research spending and the focus on implementing the parts of the Act that are concerned with environmental protection show that the Government and the Ministry remain committed to the principles of sustainability enshrined in the Act', the Minister said

In order to implement the fisheries reforms and the 'front end' of the Fisheries Act 1996 the Ministry has had to reprioritise its activities. The Ministry is now also undertaking a further reprioritisation exercise. The Ministry will report to stakeholders on this exercise prior to the plenary in April 1999.

The Minister said that he and the Ministry will consult with stakeholder groups over the next couple of months before finalising fishery services for the 1999/2000 financial year.
