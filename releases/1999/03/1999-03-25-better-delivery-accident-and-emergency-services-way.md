The Health Minister today released a plan to improve services for anyone involved in an accident or emergency to ensure they get speedy access to the right treatment.

This key document provides a "best health practice" structure for service provision in the future.

"The aim is to give all New Zealanders, no matter where they are, the best chance of receiving quality acute and emergency services.

"People requiring services in an accident or emergency can expect the right care, at the right time, in the right place from the right person," MrCreech said.

"All providers involved in pre-hospital and hospital care should be viewed as collaborative networks.

"The plan would establish five regional networks which incorporate all hospitals and providers involved in trauma and emergency work within a defined geographic area.

"At the hub of each network will be one of the country's five tertiary hospitals. The spokes will extend through secondary hospitals, sub-acute units (one step down from secondary hospitals) and health centres to all rural health professionals," Mr Creech said.

The Roadside to Bedside plan sees:

five regional networks involving all those associated with pre-hospital care, emergency transport and all hospitals; the delivery of patients to the nearest hospital capable of providing definitive care, or local management if that is most appropriate; the co-ordination of all services involved in the management of acute health needs; an appropriate emergency transport system; safe practice guided by agreed guidelines, protocols and standards workforce development; and access to telecommunications and a rapid response to emergency situations.

"When the Hospital Services Plan was being put together it was decided that one of the most important building blocks of a hospital system was the arrangement of accident and emergency services.

"'Roadside to Bedside' provides a blue print to take this idea into the future. It provides a helicopter view of how best to co-ordinate our accident and emergency services."

The document is being released jointly under the logos of the Ministry of Health, the Health Funding Authority, the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation and the Council of Medical Colleges in New Zealand.

The Health Funding Authority has established a project team and has a committed budget to put the Roadside to Bedside framework into practise. A National Advisory Committee which has had its first meeting today will oversee the project team's work. The team includes senior health officials, Ian Civil - a trauma specialist from Auckland Healthcare; Geoff Hughes, Clinical Director of the Wellington Emergency Department John Ayling, CEO of the NZ Ambulance Board; Jim Ross, a rural GP and Sarah Little, Charge Nurse Manager, Children's Emergency Department, Starship Hospital has been approached to serve on the committee.
