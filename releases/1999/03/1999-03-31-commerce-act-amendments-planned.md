The Minister for Enterprise and Commerce Max Bradford says he will be releasing a discussion document tomorrow on amendments to sections 36 and 47 of the Commerce Act.

Mr Bradford says the National-led Government will not be supporting any half-baked Bill such as that proposed by Alliance's Laila Harre.

"The discussion document proposes changes to the mergers and acquistions sections of the Commerce Act. These changes must be seen in reference to the penalties and remedies sections of the Act, which are being drafted at the moment," Mr Bradford said.

Section 36 of the Act prohibits dominant firms from using their market power to exclude competitors.

Section 47 prohibits mergers that have the effect of acquiring, or strengthening dominance.
