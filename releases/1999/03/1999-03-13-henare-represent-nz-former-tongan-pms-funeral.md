Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare will represent New Zealand at the funeral of former Tongan Prime Minister His Royal Highness Prince Fatafehi Tu'ipehalake, in Nuku'alofa on Saturday 17 April.

Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said New Zealand was saddened by the death of the Prince who is the brother of His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV.

Prince Fatafehi Tu'ipehalake was Prime Minister of Tonga for 27 years from 1965 to 1991.

"New Zealand and Tonga have enjoyed a very warm relationship for many years and Prince Fatafehi Tu'ipehalake played an important role in maintaining that relationship.

"We are saddened by his death and he will be missed by the Tongan people as one of their longest serving leaders," Mrs Shipley said.
