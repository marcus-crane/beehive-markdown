Helen Clark has never criticised the insidious drug culture which wrecks thousands of New Zealand families every year, said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

"There are a lot of intellectuals out there who think cannabis and designer drugs do not harm young people. Well, they should know better," Mr Sowry said.

The thousands of disadvantaged families seen by social services and the justice system have multiple problems - almost always one of these is drug or alcohol abuse.

"I'm stunned that Labour is prepared to risk childrens' lives, by not supporting this tough plan the Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has outlined," Mr Sowry said.

Police are targeting enforcement in areas where crime is bucking the overall downward trend, and this Government has increased police by 880 since 1990 - whereas the last Labour government cut police numbers. By the middle of next year we will have 7000 police officers.

Mr Sowry said it's critical all political parties support the police in their anti-drug work, not whip the rug out from under their feet.

"Helen Clark should stop knocking the police and support all efforts to prevent drug abuse and catch the people responsible for destroying New Zealand families."
