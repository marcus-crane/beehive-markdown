Enterprise And Commerce Minister Max Bradford Says Research Showing That only 11 per Cent Of New Zealand Firms Believe That Crown Research Units (cris) And research Associations Are Valuable Sources Of Assistance Is Most Disturbing. "It Demonstrates A Need For A More Focused And Integrated Approach To Harness the Innovation In New Zealand's Research Establishments And Business," He said. Speaking At An Industrial Research Ltd's Management Forum In Wellington This morning, Mr Bradford Commended The Cri For Its Work Creating Innovative commercial And Scientific Products. "but Much Of Its Work Is Not Being Embraced By The Companies That Really Need it," He Said.

"A Recent Study Of The Manufacturing Sector By The Ministry Of Commerce Which found That Only 11 Per Cent Of New Zealand Firms Believe That Cris And research associations Are Valuable Sources Of Assistance Is Terrible Considering The technological Firepower Of Cris.

"Two Things Needed To Help Direct Research Resources More Efficiently Are: A better Focus Of The Government's More Than $600 Million A Year Research And development Spending; And A Stronger Partnership Between Industry And Cri's.

"But These Are Not Things The Government Can Do Alone, And They Will Be Key points Canvassed With The Research Community, Tertiary Institutions And business at The Series Of Nationwide Forums Being Held In April And May.

"The Forums Are About Getting A Much Better Focus From The Research Sector, tertiary Sector And Business To Achieve Much Better Economic Growth Rates And improving Our Standard Of Living."
