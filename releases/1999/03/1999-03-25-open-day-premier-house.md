The refurbished public areas of Premier House will be open to the public this Sunday, March 28, from 10 am to 4 pm, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Premier House belongs to the people of New Zealand. This is a chance for everyone to see the much improved public areas that are used for some official Government business including welcoming international visitors, and for charitable fund-raising events," Mrs Shipley said.

Premier House, the official Prime Ministerial residence at 260 Tinakori Road Wellington, is maintained and administered by the Department of Internal Affairs' Ministerial Services Unit.

Since 1990 an estimated 200,000 New Zealanders have attended functions there. After almost a decade of heavy use, the public areas of Premier House were judged by Ministerial Services to be in need of a spruce-up. The main reception room, dining room and other rooms available for public use have been upgraded, including new light fittings, replacing worn and damaged furniture, repainting and redecorating, within the allocated budget of $215,000.

No money has been spent on the private upstairs quarters used by the Prime Minister's family.

"The interior decorator who was responsible for selecting the colours, lighting and furnishings, Denis Walton, has done a beautiful job. The result is a warm and comfortable setting where I'll be proud to welcome guests on behalf of all New Zealanders.

"I am pleased that I am able to invite New Zealanders to visit Premier House," Mrs Shipley said.

Visitors will be able to see the antique dining table which has been recovered from storage and restored as part of the refurbishment. The table is originally from old Government House, and had been used for many years in Parliament's debating chamber until the restoration of Parliament House.

Also on display is a selection of New Zealand original art, kindly loaned by the Rutherford Trust, and a collection of photographs of the history and previous residents of Premier House.

The open day is being organised by the Life Education Trust.

"Life Education Trust does a tremendous job in educating our young people about the realities of drug use. It deserves the support of all of us," Mrs Shipley said.

Premier House will be open from 10 am to 4 pm on Sunday March 28. There will be an entry fee of five dollars per person (children under 12 free). All proceeds will go to the Life Education Trust.

"I hope as many people as possible will take the opportunity to see the improvements to Premier House and in doing so support this worthwhile charity," Mrs Shipley said.
