The Minister of Finance, Bill English, ACC Minister Murray McCully, and Minister of State Owned Enterprises, Tony Ryall, announced today that the new SOE being set up to compete for workplace accident insurance cover had been formally incorporated.

"This is a significant milestone in the preparation for opening the delivery of accident insurance for employers and self-employed people to competition from 1 July 1999. The SOE will underwrite cover and will face the same regulatory requirements as private insurers in the market."

With incorporation also came the appointments to the Board of the new SOE, they said.

The Ministers announced that the current chair of the SOE establishment unit, Michael Cashin, would be the new chair of the SOE Board, and current director, Peter Fitzsimmons would also continue as a director of the insurer.

"Mr Cashin and Mr Fitzsimmons have laid strong foundations for the on-going success of the SOE and their knowledge will be invaluable as the SOE establishes itself in the market," the Ministers said.

"They are to be joined on the Board by Dr Tom Marshall, Peter Kiely, Graeme Wong and Jane Huria.

"Dr Marshall, a GP, is a current director of Tairawhiti Healthcare Ltd and Mercy Hospital.

"Peter Kiely is a partner in law firm Kiely Thompson Caisley, while Graeme Wong is the executive chairman of Southern Capital Ltd.

"Jane Huria is the chair of Ngai Tahu Properties, a director of Huria Associates and Transpower NZ Ltd amongst others.

"The new appointments bring a mix of skills to the Board that will stand it in good stead into the future," the Ministers said. They will take effect later this month.

The SOE would enter the market when the creation of the company infrastructure was completed they said.

Media release - From @Work Insurance

NEW INSURER FOR WORKPLACE ACCIDENT INSURANCE MARKET

@Work Insurance is the name of the state-owned insurer that will compete in the workplace accident insurance market. The market opens from 1 April. The SOE was formally announced today by Government.

Chairman Michael Cashin said:

"@Work Insurance is a specialist provider of workplace accident insurance for employers and the self-employed. We will not operate outside this area in which we have specialist skills.

"@Work Insurance will compete in the market for people who want workplace accident insurance from 1 July this year.

"We will provide competitive products and services. Our research indicates employers want flexible products tailored to their circumstances and that helps them with minimising workplace accidents and thus premiums. Employers are not necessarily driven solely by price.

"Our formal establishment as an SOE allows us to finalise details and get ready to open for business. We will announce more details then."

Michael Cashin, chairman of the establishment unit for the new SOE, is confirmed as chairman of @Work Insurance. Peter Fitzsimmons OBE, also an establishment director, also transfers to the new Board.

News media backgrounder

@Work Insurance - New Zealand's specialist workplace accident insurer

1\. Role and purpose of @Work Insurance

@Work Insurance is a specialist supplier of workplace accident insurance. Established as a State Owned Enterprise by the Government in March 1999, the company's role is to provide employers and the self-employed with workplace accident insurance for employees or themselves. Shareholding ministers are the Minister for State Owned Enterprises and the Minister of Finance.

Workplace accident insurance remains compulsory in New Zealand. Employers must choose an insurer to cover their employees from 1 July. They cannot remain with ACC. Self-employed can choose a new insurer but if they decide not to, they will continue to be covered by ACC after 1 July.

@Work was set up following changes to accident compensation law (Accident Insurance Act 1998). The changes will promote a more competitive and responsive accident insurance market by allowing insurers to offer competing workplace accident insurance policies. Insurers, including @Work, have to be registered for this purpose.

As a specialist insurer, @Work concentrates solely on the design, development and provision of workplace insurance. It does not offer other forms of insurance.

2\. Market entry

@Work is in the process of finalising plans and operations to enter the market once the competitive market has opened. Until this time, due to the competitive nature of the market, it is unable to discuss details of its products, services or operations. Further information will provided on entering the market.

3\. Staffing

@Work will announce the appointment of its CEO shortly. Following on from its incorporation, the company is in the process of appointing permanent staff.
