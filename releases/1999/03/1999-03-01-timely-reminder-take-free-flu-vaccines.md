"The identification of cases of the Sydney A strain of influenza is a timely reminder for people at risk to take advantage of free flu vaccines," Minister of Health Wyatt Creech said today.

"From today (March 1) the free flu vaccines are being extended to people with chronic illnesses.

"The Government introduced free flu vaccines for all New Zealanders 65 years and over two years ago.

"Now is the time to get immunised, before the winter bugs hit," Mr Creech said. "Prevention can save lives and money.

"We spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year treating people with illnesses that could have been nipped in the bud early on," Mr Creech said.

"This year's immunisation covers the Sydney A strain that has caused many cases of influenza and deaths in the Northern Hemisphere.

"The flu vaccines are there, available free to up to 700,000 New Zealanders. I urge people to contact their local health centre and take advantage of the vaccines."
