Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced that the Pohatu Marine Reserve on Akaroa Peninsula had cleared its last statutory hurdle.

"The Pohatu Marine Reserve is the exciting culmination of hard work and negotiation among conservationists, fishers, land owners and iwi. There is widespread support for this, the first Canterbury reserve. It is great that the Government has come in behind a local initiative and that it has such a high level of local support."

The Minister of Conservation approved the establishment of the reserve prior to Christmas, and he has now received the concurrence of the Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson and the Associate Minister of Food and Fibre, Hon David Carter, as required under the Marine Reserves Act.

"This is the last hurdle in a long process spanning nearly a decade. The reserve will now be surveyed and prepared for Gazetting. I am hopeful that this work can be done prior to winter, and a formal occasion arranged to open the new reserve."
