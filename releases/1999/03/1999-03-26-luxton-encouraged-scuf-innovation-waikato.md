Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today congratulated Anchor Products on the innovation and market focus of their new $13 million investment at Hautapu, which he officially opened.

"The new Scale Up Facility signals a number of firsts for the Dairy industry both in New Zealand and around the world. The combination of new technology and state-of-the-art facilities allows Anchor Products to turn the marketing opportunities into a reality."

"I commend the company on the setting up of this new facility which will provide more opportunities to design products tailored to market needs."

The new SCUF Facility allows the NZDG to develop of a range of specialised new protein products. These include high value protein products such as Whey Protein Fractions (WPF), Whey Protein Isolates (WPI) and Protein Hydrolysates.

Whey Protein Fractions are sought after for their extremely specialised nutritional and pharmaceutical properties. Protein Isolates are mainly used in the sports nutrition market, either as a ready-to-take drink or in powder form for body building.

"The SCUF Plant is a clear sign that New Zealand Dairy is at the leading edge of this development work. This is good news for the Dairy Industry and good news for Waikato dairy farmers," Mr Luxton concluded.
