Stronger links between educational institutes, science, research and our enterprise sector will ensure that students from schools like Marlborough Girls College are graduating with the peak academic fitness that enterprise demands, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley visited her old school Marlborough Girls College to open a new gymnasium, new guidance rooms and four new science labs. She was a pupil there from 1965-68 before studying at Christchurch Teachers College.

"I am delighted this new development includes more science facilities. In a small way the future of our economy depends on facilities like these.

"New Zealand's future success depends on the strength of our knowledge base. This means lifting our game and keeping pace with the frontrunners. It also means encouraging girls to get interested in, and excel at science.

"It is essential that young New Zealanders - in particular young women - are training for the future, not studying for the past.

"This Government believes it is critical that education and enterprise are linked more closely. There is no point young people studying for skills that enterprise no longer values or requires.

"Schools, polytechnics, training institutes and universities need to work closer with enterprise if New Zealanders are to have the skills to keep our nation up with the rest of the world," Mrs Shipley said.

New Zealanders rightly regard themselves as resourceful but in a more knowledge-based society which is quickly globalising and competitive, this will not be enough, said Mrs Shipley.

"It is vital to strengthen our creative skills, innovative, language and marketing skills as individuals and as a nation. It is up to us all to work smarter and keep pace with the frontrunners. The world will not wait for us to catch up," said Mrs Shipley.
