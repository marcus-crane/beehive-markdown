Associate Health Minister Tuariki Delamere said today he was astonished to hear that the Alliance Health spokesperson, Phillida Bunkle, would support a ban on transplant surgery.

According to Mr Delamere, Miss Bunkle made her comments in Wellington on Thursday night at a public meeting to discuss genetically engineered foods.

A member of the audience, who described himself as a 'Creationist', wanted to ban all forms of cross species manipulation including such common medical procedures as heart, kidney and liver transplants. "Miss Bunkle told an astonished audience that she, too, had reservations about such procedures.

'For Phillida Bunkle to publicly and openly express her support for such lunatic beliefs speaks volumes about the type of political philosophies that find solace within the Alliance,' said the MP for Te Tairawhiti.

'Thousands of New Zealanders have lived longer and healthier lives because of the amazing developments in transplant surgery. Cornea transplants, heart transplants, lung transplants are now routine. To think that if the Alliance was to get into Government they would contemplate making such medical procedures illegal is indeed frightening.'

The Minister went on 'Throughout this parliamentary term Miss Bunkle has gone around the country making all manner of unsubstantiated claims about the health system.

"Now that Labour and the Alliance have publicly announced they intend to try to form a coalition government, Miss Bunkle is beginning to reveal her true agenda. I call on Annette King to state whether or not she and her Labour colleagues will be supporting Miss Bunkle in her efforts to ban transplant surgery.'
