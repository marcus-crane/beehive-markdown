"Like all New Zealanders, I am shocked and saddened at these senseless killings in Uganda of defenceless people. The government will do everything we can to work with the international community to help bring the murderers to justice," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will take up the issue up at every opportunity when he travels to Africa next week.

"In the meantime, parts of Africa remain volatile and dangerous places to visit. I urge any New Zealanders wanting to travel there to contact MFAT before going, or if already overseas contact New Zealand's nearest High Commission, Consulate or Embassy," Mrs Shipley said.
