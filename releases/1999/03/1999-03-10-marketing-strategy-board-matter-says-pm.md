The management of the New Zealand Tourism Board's global marketing strategy was entirely a matter for the Board, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said tonight.

"Taxpayers have funded the Board to develop a global marketing strategy to attract tourists to New Zealand and make maximum mileage from New Zealand's opportunities in the lead up to the millennium and beyond.

"I note that the Board has made an assurance that this strategy is still on track and I look forward to seeing them deliver," Mrs Shipley said.
