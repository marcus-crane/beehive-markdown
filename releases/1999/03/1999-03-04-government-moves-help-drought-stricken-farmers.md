Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said the Government had put together a package to assist South Island farmers hit by the ongoing drought.

"We have been actively monitoring the situation and have received regular updates on the plight of farmers coping with the drought. A number of Ministers, including myself, have visited the area and seen for ourselves just how serious it has become.

"For Otago this is no ordinary dry period. The drought is well into its second year, and the local people and the Drought Relief Committee are doing an excellent job but they require assistance from the nation as a whole.

"Last month we approved an $80,000 relief package for Otago farmers including $20,000 for the North Otago Adverse Events Trust, and a grant of up to $20,000 to match donations from the public.

"We have reassessed the situation, which has spread to Clutha and South Canterbury and we have approved funding for co-ordinating drought relief work in those regions. The details were announced today by John Luxton Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control.

"We have also decided to co-ordinate a range services to help farmers, which includes help from the army and the possibility of using conservation land for grazing. Conservation Minister Nick Smith will visit the affected region on Thursday to talk to conservation groups and farmers about the idea.

"The Government will continue to work closely with the Drought Relief Committee in Otago in developing solutions for both the immediate future and in the longer term.

"We know that the drought has taken its toll on the rural communities in the South Island and we are concerned to alleviate the situation for farmers and their families. We simply must not allow this area to deteriorate, and for the long-established communities to be driven off the land because of these unusual climatic conditions," Mrs Shipley said.
