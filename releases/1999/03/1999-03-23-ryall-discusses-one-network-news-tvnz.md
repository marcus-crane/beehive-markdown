State Owned Enterprises Minister, Tony Ryall, has discussed matters arising from last year's changes to One Network News, with TVNZ chairman, Rosanne Meo.

"This is an operational matter, and therefore the responsibility of the TVNZ Board", Mr Ryall said.

"TVNZ utterly rejects the suggestion that the news-reading change has cost the company $20 million.

"I have been assured by the chairman that the value of TVNZ has not been affected", Mr Ryall concluded.
