Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon announced today that New Zealand will contribute NZ$150,000 towards preparations for forthcoming elections in Indonesia.

'New Zealand is happy to play a part in bringing about free and fair democratic elections in Indonesia. These will be held on June 7 and will be a critical step toward stability and democracy in that country,' Mr McKinnon said.

"New Zealand's contribution will be used to support the work of the non-partisan team of well-respected community leaders appointed to prepare the ground for the establishment of the new Election Commission (KPU).

"The team is engaged in verifying political parties and drafting guidelines for the KPU, including those relating to voter registration, vote counting and reporting, and the KPU's relationship with the Indonesian Government.

'We are also working to identify other opportunities for NZ to assist which may include the provision of technical expertise or assistance in the areas of voter education or the training of electoral officials,' Mr McKinnon said.

Assistance from the international donor community for financial and technical assistance for the elections will be provided to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Indonesia which has agreed to coordinate and monitor all international donor assistance for the general election.

New Zealand's contribution will be funded from the bilateral New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme to Indonesia which totals $5.1 million.
