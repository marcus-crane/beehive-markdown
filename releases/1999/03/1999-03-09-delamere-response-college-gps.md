Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said tonight, "I will not respond to Dr Wiles' petty personal attacks on me as that would obscure the real issue.

"My challenge to Dr Wiles, the GP's and their Environmental Working Party is the same as that I have offered to all those 'experts' who have declaimed on the issue of labelling of GMF's.

"How would they define a genetically-modified organism and how far down the processing chain would they go where the labelling of these foods would be mandatory?

"I have stated before that I support the labelling of GMF's as long as it can be done in a practical and workable way. Even the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council of Ministers, when it voted last December to require labelling of GMF's, conceded it did not know how to define a GMO.

"Dr Wiles concedes he has minimal expertise in this area and the College's Environmental Working Party says the information it has is 'far from complete'.

"The College's call for a precautionary approach by the Government is vague, ill-thought out and unhelpful. Does a precautionary approach mean that we ban all foods from our shores where we have a suspicion they might possibly have some GMO content? I'm certain the consumer would not welcome the empty shelves that would result.

"My call to the College of GP's is to contribute to this very important debate with facts and rational argument, not hasty slogans and personal attacks," concluded Mr Delamere.
