Foreign Minister Don McKinnon concluded his visit to Kenya today saying that the relationship between the two countries was in excellent condition.

"From the meetings I had with Head of State, President arap Moi, Foreign Minister Kategaya and other Ministers, it was clear New Zealand is held in high regard here.

"The Kenyan Government are interested in aspects of New Zealand public sector reform and will be seeking more information on some specific issues relating to this at a later date.

"I also meet with the principal agent for the New Zealand Dairy Board in East Africa, who believes that dairy exports to the region will double in the next two years, which is a positive sign."

Mr McKinnon spoke with New Zealanders working in the commercial, agricultural and scientific areas in Kenya, as well as church missionaries working in the country.

"All spoke of the challenges of working in Kenya, but were positive about the possibilities emanating from the country. All were expecting a favourable economic turnaround in the Kenyan economy in the near future."

Mr McKinnon spoke to an audience of about 6000 at a Commonwealth Day celebration in the Northern High Country town of Kakameea.

"President Moi gave the principal address where he indicated Kenya's was supporting my candidature to head the Commonwealth Secretariat, which was gratifying."

The President, Mr McKinnon and High Commissioners from Commonwealth countries planted a tree in the Kakameea Town Gardens to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the modern Commonwealth.
