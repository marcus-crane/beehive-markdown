Health Minister Wyatt Creech today applauded the Mental Health Foundation for developing the Practical Guide to Coping with Suicide, which was launched today.

"Suicide is an extremely complex problem. There is no one cause and no one way to address it. It will take a collective approach to bring the suicide numbers down and this is what the Mental Health Foundation's new publication is about.

"1997's youth suicide statistics are very similar to the previous year's. There were 142 people aged between 15 to 24 years of age who died by suicide in 1997 compared to 143 in 1996.

"While these figures are still too high, we can at least note that the numbers appear to be plateauing. We are still losing too many people through suicide and it is something which we as a community must address together.

"The Government put the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy into action last year. It is a direct response to New Zealand's unacceptably high youth suicide rates. It provides a framework for government and non-government agencies together to develop effective ways to prevent suicide amongst young people."

The predominant focus of the Strategy is to increase awareness and identification of mental health problems which link to suicide and to promote preventative and help seeking attitudes, not only amongst young people, but everyone.

"For the initiatives to work they have to have the support and understanding of communities, parents, teachers and of course politicians. We have decided to set up a group of Ministers to ensure there is enough political clout behind the Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy to turn the words into action," Mr Creech said.
