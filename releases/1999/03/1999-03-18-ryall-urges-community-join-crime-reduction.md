"Local communities need to form partnerships with the Government to provide long-term solutions to crime", Justice Minister, Tony Ryall said today.

"There has been much talk of policing, enforcement and sentencing lately and all these are vital components in reducing crime", he said.

"But, it's important we do not lose sight of the need for positive early interventions to turn young offenders and at risk kids away from a life of crime", said Mr Ryall.

The Minister made his comments while in Hawera where he was addressing a meeting to elect an Executive Committee to the proposed Hawera Safer Communities Council.

Of particular concern to the Hawera community is the level of youth offending, especially when compared to nearby New Plymouth, which has had a SCC since October 1995.

According to available statistics the following numbers of youths have been through the Courts in past two years.

New Plymouth Hawera  
1996/97 287 110  
1997/98 269 198  
6.3% decrease 80% increase

"The Safer Communities Council (SCC) initiative was implemented by Government to allow local communities to take a greater role in reducing crime and breaking the cycle of crime in their own areas", Mr Ryall said.

"Programmes supported by SCCs include mentoring programmes, neighbourhood projects, support for teenage parents to get back into education, and youth initiatives in Maori communities.

"A large chunk of this work receives substantial taxpayers' money through our SCC programme", said Mr Ryall.

Additional support is provide by sponsoring bodies of SCCs , such as District and City Councils and Iwi groups.

Since1993 the network has grown from four communities to over sixty in early 1999.
