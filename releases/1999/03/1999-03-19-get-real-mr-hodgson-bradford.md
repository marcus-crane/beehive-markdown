Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says Labour's energy spokesman should stop trying to confuse the public about the electricity industry's lines and energy trading businesses.

Responding to a statement this afternoon by Labour's Pete Hodgson about electricity line charges, Mr Bradford said: "For God's sake Mr Hodgson get real and stop trying to misrepresent the facts."
