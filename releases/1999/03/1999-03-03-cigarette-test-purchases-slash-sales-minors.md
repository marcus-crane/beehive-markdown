Test purchases of cigarettes by under 18 year old volunteers appear to be slashing illegal sales to minors.

Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today provisional figures from the Ministry of Health show that the sale rate to volunteers has fallen to under five percent for the period July 1998 to the end of January 1999.

It is believed that the drop off in sales is due to growing awareness among retailers of the controlled purchase operation (CPO) programme.

'As more and more test purchases are carried out, it is increasingly likely that retailers will know someone who has been visited in a CPO. There has also been considerable media coverage of the programme and education of retailers, most of whom are aware that a CPO could be carried out on their premises at any time.'

Since CPOs began in late 1996, over 2000 retailers have been visited, resulting in 165 sales. Sale rates for the first two years of the programme were around 10 percent of total visits, however this figure has fallen considerably over the past six months.

To date, over 80 retailers have been successfully prosecuted for selling tobacco to minors.

As well as the test purchases, smokefree officers have spent a considerable amount of time educating retailers about the law relating to sales of cigarettes. In addition, in August 1997, the Ministry of Health sent a pamphlet to every tobacco retailer which emphasised that tobacco should not be sold to minors.

There have been few defended hearings as a result of sales of tobacco products to minors during a CPO, as the majority of retailers plead guilty.

Of the recent hearings, entrapment has been used as a defence three times (that is, the retailer argued that they were 'entrapped' into doing something they would not otherwise do). In all three cases this defence did not succeed.
