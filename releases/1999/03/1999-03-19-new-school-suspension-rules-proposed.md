Education Minister Nick Smith today launched proposed new rules for school suspensions for consultation at a Conference of Nelson Principals, and invited schools and parents nationwide to study and comment on the proposals.

"We need to strike a careful balance between maintaining high standards of behaviour in our schools and trying to reduce the number of suspensions. The 12,000 suspensions last year are too many. The challenge is to reduce this number without lowering the minimum acceptable standards of behaviour. The suspension rules are part of this answer."

The rules are designed to make the process of suspensions fairer and more flexible. A new option of standing down students for up to ten days per year is introduced. The proposed rules also set down the steps a Principal and Board of Trustees are required to follow when considering a stand-down or suspension.

"I am confident schools will generally welcome the changes. Schools have previously been limited in their choices on how to deal with students with severe behaviour problems. These rules give schools more options and clear guidance. Schools should also feel reassured that the proposals do not in any way lower the standard of acceptable behaviour."

"Drugs, violence and abusive behaviour are community problems that today's schools are forced to confront. Clearer suspension rules are only part of the solution. Other work to help address these issues include the new teams of Resource Teachers of Learning and Behaviour. These teachers will help deal with behavioural problems before they get to the point of suspensions. We also need to develop alternatives to schools for those youngsters whose behaviour is too disruptive for the traditional school environment."

The proposed set of rules has been sent to all schools for comment, and copies are available at all Ministry of Education offices. Ministry staff will be available to assist interested people if necessary.
