New Zealand consumers have a right to know what is in the food they are eating, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"New Zealanders are demanding information about artificial additives, and increasingly they want to know whether their food contains genetically modified products."

Mrs Shipley said she set up a group of Ministers three months ago to find practical ways to address these concerns. The Ministry of Health was working with other government agencies, scientists and manufacturers on the issue. New Zealand was also working closely with Australia to develop a uniform approach.

"This is a real concern for families. I intend to see we go as far as we can to meet their expectations.

"It is a very complex area and finding answers will be difficult. We have to consider consumers' needs alongside the information that scientists and manufacturers can supply about food content as we come up with a practical and effective solution," Mrs Shipley said.

The challenge would be to find a workable system that gave consumers faith in the food they bought, without adding to its price.

Mrs Shipley she had discussed the issue during her visits to North America and Europe early this year, and with Australian Prime Minister John Howard during his visit to New Zealand last month.

Science was moving rapidly and it was important to develop a labelling regime that kept up with developments and gave consumers information that was both useful and credible, Mrs Shipley said.
