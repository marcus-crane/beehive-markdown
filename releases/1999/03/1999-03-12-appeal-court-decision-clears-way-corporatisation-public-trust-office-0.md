Treasurer Bill Birch and the Minister in charge of the Public Trust Office, Tuariki Delamere, said today the Court of Appeal's ruling on the ownership of the Office's reserves has all but removed the last barrier to giving the Public Trust greater commercial and competitive flexibility.

In a unanimous decision, the full Court of five judges upheld last year's ruling by Justice Heron in the High Court that there is no legal or equitable private interest in the PTO's reserves.

"It is a strong and clear judgement which, barring any further appeal, means we can get on with the process of corporatisation, as we announced in December last year," the Ministers said.

"Corporatisation will allow the PTO to operate under the same rules and to offer the same mix of services as any modern trustee company," they said.
