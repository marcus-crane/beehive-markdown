New Zealand's Greenshell Mussel Industry increased exports in the 1998/99 year by 36 per cent to $117.68 million dollars despite the Asian crisis and are expecting greater returns next year, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

"This is an outstanding effort, with rewards that directly benefit aquaculture producers, local processors, local traders and marketers in regions like Marlborough and Tasman," Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley visited Havelock to announce the industry's record export figures and to launch the Greenshell Mussel Industry's voluntary code of practice which is the first of its kind in the world.

The Environmental Code of Practice sets out the standards by which the greenshell mussel industry should operate to remain responsible custodians of the marine environment.

"Our thriving mussel industry is a champion model of how mussel farmers can increase their production, exports and earnings while also being environmentally responsible.

"This is an impressive balance of cooperation and competitiveness which sets an example for other industries, and other countries who are interested in following New Zealand's lead," Mrs Shipley said.

The industry's export figures reflect the importance of the industry to New Zealand's overall economy:

In 1981 Greenshell Mussel Industry exports were $2.6 million. By 1990 this had grown to $34 million. In 1997 exports more than doubled to $86.4 million. In 1998 exports exceeded $117 million.

"Greenshell mussels are now New Zealand's second most valuable fish export, behind hoki."

The industry has also created employment, equivalent to more than 1,600 fulltime jobs in Northland, Stewart Island, Nelson and Marlborough, with more expansion expected.

"There is every sign among mussel growers and processors that their confidence and investment in their industry is well placed, with strong and sustainable growth. Production tonnage is expected to increase at 7 per cent per year through to the year 2000," Mrs Shipley said.
