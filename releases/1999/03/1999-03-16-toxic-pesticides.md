GREENPEACE PRESS STATEMENT ON BASEL CONVENTION

BACKGROUND

1\. You have requested a briefing on a press release issued by Greenpeace today. The press release relates to the potential export of some toxic pesticides.

POTENTIAL APPLICATION TO EXPORT HAZARDOUS WASTE

2\. A consortium of 6 regional councils has called for tenders for the disposal of some hazardous waste (110 tonnes of pesticides) currently held in storage. The consortium wants the hazardous waste disposed of because of the environmental risks and costs associated with its continued storage.

3\. It is likely that the successful tendering company will seek authorisation to export the hazardous waste on the basis that there is currently no domestic disposal facility available in New Zealand and therefore the most cost effective and environmentally sound solution is export to a country with appropriate disposal facilities.

NEW ZEALAND'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BASEL CONVENTION

4\. The Basel Convention seeks to promote a global effort to reduce the generation of hazardous wastes. The Convention sets outprocedures to be followed when hazardous wastes are traded and recognises that some transboundary movement of hazardous wastes can make a positive contribution to the management of the global environment.

5\. New Zealand is a Party to the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal. The Ministry of Commerce, acting on authority delegated from the Minister of Commerce is the New Zealand competent authority under the Convention. This means the Ministry authorises any trade in hazardous waste.

6\. There is no formal export licencing system of the type alluded to in the Greenpeace press statement. The Ministry of Commerce as competent authority is obliged to:

check that the exporter has ensured that countries of destination and transit have given their prior informed consentto any shipment of hazardous waste; determine whether proper consideration has been given to whether the disposal or recovery process in the country of destination will be managed in an environmentally sound manner; determine whether the exporter has considered the effectiveness and efficiency of any domestic alternatives.

7\. If such authorisation is sought the Ministry of Commerce will prepare a detailed report and forward it to you for your consideration. The Minister for the Environment also has a close interest in trade in hazardous waste and he would need to be consulted. It would be inappropriate to intervene in an independent tender process being run by the regional councils.

PROPOSAL TO BAN TRADE IN HAZARDOUS WASTE

8\. Parties to the Basel Convention have discussed adopting anamendment to the Convention to ban all exports of hazardous wastes from OECD countries, the EC and Liechtenstein to non-OECD countries.

9\. The trade ban has been enthusiastically supported by Greenpeace and consistently opposed by New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Korea and Japan. So far only a few countries have ratified the ban.

10\. The ban will not come into effect until three quarters of the Parties have ratified it. Greenpeace's allegation in its press statement that granting an application to export hazardous substances would breach the Basel Convention is inaccurate.

REASONS WHY NEW ZEALAND OPPOSES A BAN ON TRADE IN HAZARDOUS WASTE

11\. The ban is unnecessary. The Basel Convention already provides a mechanism for Parties to take steps to unilaterally ban importation of hazardous wastes. Many developing countries have alreadyimposed import bans, particularly with regard to imports of waste for final disposal. The Convention also creates legal obligations on other parties to prevent the export of wastes to countries which have imposed an import ban.

12\. The proposed trade ban did not sufficiently explore less trade disruptive and less costly alternatives such as strengthening the application of the Convention's existing "prior informed consent" mechanism used to identify and prevent undesirable trade.

13\. A trade ban is likely to distort the aims of the Basel Convention by preventing trade which contributes to recycling of hazardous wastes which is both environmentally sound and economically important. Moving from a prior informed consent based system to a prohibition on trade is likely to encourage the increased use and extraction of virgin materials and may also, by reducing market value of recyclable material, act as a disincentive to recycling.

14\. A trade ban is a poor precedent. The distinction between OECD and non-OECD nations is an inappropriate basis on which to establish a trade barrier, as it bears no necessary relationship to the capacity to deal appropriately with hazardous waste.

HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP DOMESTIC DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR TOXIC PESTICIDES

15\. Ever since the regional councils collected up toxic pesticides in their region and began to store them they and the Ministry for the Environment have been attempting to find ways to safely dispose of the material within New Zealand.

16\. The regional councils first raised the option of exporting the material in 1996. At that time the Minister for the Environment wrote to the councils requesting that they continue to store the material for approximately six months to give businesses the opportunity to establish a waste disposal system in New Zealand. The Ministry for the Environment has been negotiating with an Australian company ADI on the development of such a facility in New Zealand.

17\. Nearly three years later a viable waste disposal system has still not been established in New Zealand. There have been a range of problems including developing appropriate waste disposal technology, and achieving economies of scale (New Zealand has relatively small stocks of hazardous waste and information on its chemical composition is very poor).

18\. Officials understand that ADI tendered for the job of disposing of the regional councils' waste but has not set up a plant in New Zealand and will not be able to do so without some guarantee of a supply of hazardous waste sufficient to make its operations economically viable. This would require supplies of hazardous waste from organisations (including the regional councils and government) who have waste to dispose of. Such a guarantee would effectively grant ADI (or any other business given the supply) monopolistic rights. Officials consider that this option raises issues relating to the efficient disposal of hazardous waste.

19\. There are environmental risks associated with continuing to store the toxic pesticides. The councils have already arranged for them to be stored for an additional three years at significant cost.

20\. Many overseas countries which generate significant volumes of hazardous waste such as France and the Netherlands have well established efficient and environmentally sound hazardous waste disposal systems which provide alternative disposal options.
