Justice Ministry statistics prove the need for the Government's proposed shake-up in the granting of bail to people who are accused of committing offences while already on bail for previous charges, Justice Minister, Tony Ryall said today.

Mr Ryall referred to findings from a Justice Ministry report that showed that, one fifth of people on bail re-offended while on bail. The report also found that, "where a person committed an offence while on bail and was charged with that offence before the case for which they were on bail for was finalised, the bail for the original charge was continued in 86 percent of cases".

'This proves the need for the legislation, currently being drafted, that will make it much harder for prisoners who re-offend on bail to be granted continuing bail.

"In such cases the onus of proof will be on the re-offender, not the police, to argue the case for bail.

"The Government will also improve judges ability to make bail decisions by making more information available to them about previous offences on bail and breaches of bail conditions", Mr Ryall said.
