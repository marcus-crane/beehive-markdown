The incredible interest stirred up by four New Zealand fashion designers recently at London Fashion Week will provide energy and leverage for our whole apparel and textile industry, including our fibre producers, says Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

"I relish seeing contemporary New Zealanders on the cutting edge of creativity and innovation. The work of these four designers is stunning and they deserve the recognition they are attracting in fashion capitals like London.

"The international fashion media and fashion industry is clearly impressed. They are talking of our fresh designs, of a distinctive New Zealand style emerging and referring to the New Zealand phenomenon," Mrs Shipley said.

The Apparel and Textile Federation today honoured the four fashion design houses - World, Zambesi, Nom D and Karen Walker - at a reception in Auckland.

"Our fashion industry is much larger than just these four designers. However, their tremendous efforts in London effectively spearheaded a campaign to show Europe just some of the distinctive, innovative and dynamic clothes that are being created every day back home.

"New Zealand has a history of exporting our quality raw materials, rather than using our innovative ideas and creativity to produce and export better quality and highly saleable finished products.

"These four designers have successfully shown Europe just what quality and originality kiwis are capable of producing. It was terrific to see that many of the garments shown featured New Zealand products, in particular wool. This marks a step forward in an increasingly important relationship that adds value to this country's produce, to the benefit of both individual businesses and the country as a whole," Mrs Shipley says.

In the past 10 years, export earnings for the apparel and textile sector have increased more than 500% to $170 million in 1998. This has happened at a time when industry protection has been steadily reducing.

"Many leaders in the industry have been able to develop market niches that are yielding generous returns.

"The success from London demonstrates the enormous benefits of industry and Government, through Trade New Zealand, working together to put ourselves on the world stage. I urge these designers to celebrate their success, they are literally at the cutting edge of New Zealand design," said Mrs Shipley.

In May, another seven New Zealand designers will hit the world stage, showing their designs at Australian Fashion Week.
