Former All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick, former world squash champion Dame Susan Devoy and author Alan Duff are among the nine  
members of the Prime Minister's APEC Advisory Council announced today.

The council would help communicate the benefits of APEC and advise the Government on its plans for the year, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley  
said.

"These people will give valuable feedback and practical advice. Thanks to the work this council and others have already done, we've made good  
progress putting together a programme for the year that will do New Zealand proud."

The council members are offering their services voluntarily. The members are:

- Former Trade Minister and APEC Business Advisory Council Chairman Hon Philip Burdon,
- Council of Trade Unions Secretary Angela Foulkes,
- Comalco Managing Director Kerry McDonald,
- Company director and former Wilson and Horton Chief Executive John Maasland,
- Research economist and New Zealand Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Chairperson Kerrin Vautier,
- Carter Holt Harvey Chairperson Sir Wilson Whineray,
- Sean Fitzpatrick,
- Dame Susan Devoy,
- Alan Duff.

Some council members will help with an APEC education programme in schools. Others will be talking with business and other groups.

The council will complement the work of two other groups advising the Prime Minister on APEC matters:

The Prime Minister's APEC Art and Culture Advisory Group

The Prime Minister's APEC Spouses' Programme Advisory Group The Spouses' Programme Advisory Group is putting together a programme  
for the spouses of visiting APEC Leaders and Ministers.

Its members are Burton Shipley, Clare de Lore and Heather McCaskey, the spouses of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and  
Trade and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade respectively. The fourth member is Lance Bickford, Chief Executive of Tourism Auckland.

"It is important that we prepare a programme for the spouses that showcases the best we have to offer," Mrs Shipley said.

The membership of the Arts and Culture Advisory Group, chaired by Jenny Gibbs, was announced earlier this year.

The members of all three groups are unpaid.
