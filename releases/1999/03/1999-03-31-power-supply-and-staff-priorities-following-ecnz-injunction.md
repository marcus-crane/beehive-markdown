"The Government will work with ECNZ and the three new electricity SOEs to ensure continuity of power supply following today's granting of an injunction stopping the planned split of ECNZ", SOE Minister, Tony Ryall said today.

"The injunction creates a number of difficulties and risks that will have to be carefully managed", said Mr Ryall.

"A priority will be clarifying the situation for the many staff who were due to commence employment with the new State Owned Enterprises tomorrow.

"The Government has appealed the High Court decision. The Appeal will be heard tomorrow morning.

"In the meantime arrangements are being put in place to continue the orderly operations of ECNZ's generation facilities", Mr Ryall concluded.
