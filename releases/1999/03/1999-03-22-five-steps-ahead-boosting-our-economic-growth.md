A series of 23 forums will being held around the country in April and May to help boost our economic growth, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford announced today.

The locations are: Whangarei, Auckland Central, Auckland South, Auckland West, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Taupo, New Plymouth, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Masterton, Gisborne, Napier/Hastings, Wellington Central, Wellington - Kapiti, Blenheim, Nelson, Greymouth, Christchurch, Timaru, Dunedin and Invercargill.

"As a nation we traditionally pride ourselves on our 'number eight wire' creativity," Mr Bradford said.

"But our world is changing so rapidly that a future based on number eight wire mentality is simply not enough, any more than a 'she'll be right' philosophy was 20 years ago.

"Our future prosperity in an increasingly sophisticated world will come from a commitment to education and research, and attracting and encouraging the innovative people who can put new ideas to work for New Zealand. "We must embrace the concept of a 'knowledge-based economy' where our wealth is created by turning good ideas into reality. We must lift our skill levels through innovation and partnerships.

"It is not just the Government alone that has a role here. For New Zealand to be really successful into the 21st Century, we all need to be working together - those in business, farming, industry, education, research and Government."

This is why the Five Steps Ahead forums are being held, Mr Bradford said.

"They will be an opportunity for people to learn, share ideas and forge new partnerships between business, government, and research and tertiary institutions," Mr Bradford said.

"The Government is committed to creating an environment that facilitates innovation, encourages business investment and creates wealth. This is reflected in our recently announced five-point plan for accelerating growth."

The plan involves:

lifting New Zealanders' skills and New Zealand's intellectual knowledge base; better focusing the direction of the Government's effort in research and development; improving access to risk and investment capital; ensuring regulations and laws support, not frustrate, innovation; and promoting success, and building a supportive culture for creative and innovative New Zealanders. "The forums provide a focus for business, education and research leaders to work more closely together to lift our economic growth and the standard of living for all New Zealanders," Mr Bradford said.
