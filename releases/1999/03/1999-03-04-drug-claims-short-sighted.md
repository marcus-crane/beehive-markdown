"The needs of young people are driving the decision to reclassify Ecstasy as a Class A drug," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Claims that toughening up on Ecstasy is election year puffery and that the reclassification is unwarranted are wrong.

"We have a chance to act now to stop Ecstasy from becoming an established part of New Zealand culture. We are not going to sit on our hands and let young people get trapped into the drug scene as is happening overseas.

"The decision to reclassify Ecstasy is part of the action plan to give effect to the Government's National Drug Policy - which was released in July last year. Since then the Ministry of Health has been working with other agencies and experts in the hard drugs area. Concern from communities, parents and schools about Ecstasy has been fed into this work.

"The Government has been advised on a technical basis to make this move as a precautionary approach and to stop young people from dabbling in Ecstasy.

"I have no doubt that most parents and schools support that," Mr Creech said.
