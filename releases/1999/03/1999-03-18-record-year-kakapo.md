Four chicks and seven fertile eggs so far!

Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced 1999 was shaping up as a record year for kakapo with four healthy chicks born so far and seven fertile eggs waiting in the wings.

"Kakapo breeding this year has been phenomenal. The population has reached 60 for the first time in nearly 20 years, and may even break 65. Four healthy chicks is fantastic news and is the most chicks we 've ever had in one year - and it's likely we'll easily top this with seven fertile eggs waiting to hatch."

"This level of breeding was certainly not expected this year so it's a surprise and an unexpected bonus. This year is also different because the birds that have bred are all in places where there are risks to their eggs and chicks from pests like rats. That's why we've taken them to the Burwood unit in Te Anau. They'll be returned to predator-free islands once they're old enough to look after themselves."

"I must congratulate all the partners in the Kakapo Recovery Programme, Comalco, Forest & Bird and DOC, for their commitment through the difficult times with kakapo. It's great to be able to celebrate these wonderful additions and see the benefits of our investments in time, money and emotional attachment."

Managing Director of Comalco New Zealand, the Kakapo Recovery Plan sponsor, Kerry McDonald said he was delighted at the news. Since it started its sponsorship in 1990 Comalco have contributed substantially in excess of $1million. While there is little to show for the investment in equipment, research and the like, there are now encouraging signs that the project is on the right path and that it has a very real chance of being successful.

"There's been another important discovery this season, in addition to the births - kakapo can lay more than one clutch of eggs a season. Some fertile and infertile eggs were taken from two birds, Suzanne and Alice, who then mated again and produced more fertile eggs. This increases our odds of further securing the future of kakapo after they came so close to extinction" Kerry McDonald said.

Forest & Bird's Conservation Director Kevin Smith said there was a third unexpected bonus - the rediscovery of a precious female bird on Little Barrier Island that hadn't been seen for several years and was presumed dead.

"Not only was Lisa found alive and well, but she had a nest with three fertile eggs. She's the mother of the latest two additions, which bring the total population of kakapo to 60 along with the birth of Alice's two male chicks two weeks ago. The sex of the latest two chicks will be determined in the next week. Lisa's third egg is due to hatch in the next few days" Kevin Smith said.

DOC's Kakapo Recovery Plan: 1996-2005, sponsored by Comalco New Zealand Ltd through the Threatened Species Trust administered by the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, aims to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of kakapo. It also aims to establish another two or more populations that may require ongoing management.

"New Zealand faces a huge challenge in stopping a whole range of species becoming extinct. The Kakapo Recovery Programme has been a flagship for the Department in bringing a species back from the brink. Its success is not just important for kakapo but is an inspiration to other lower profile recovery programmes" Dr Nick Smith said.
