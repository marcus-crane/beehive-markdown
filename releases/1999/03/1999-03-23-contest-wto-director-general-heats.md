Trade Minister Lockwood Smith has confirmed reports that the Moroccon candidate for the position of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has withdrawn.

"The withdrawal of former Trade Minister Hassan Abouyoub from the WTO Director-General contest is no great surprise in light of the report of the Chair of the General Council on 17 March which showed that Rt Hon Mike Moore and Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand were ahead of Morocco's candidate", said Dr Smith.

"This withdrawal is significant in terms of narrowing the field of candidates. It reflects positively on the consensus building process of the WTO and we continue to believe that Mike Moore is very well placed on merit to attract consensus.

"Mike has support from a broad geographical range of WTO Members - from large and small, developing and developed. Coming from a small country, he knows the importance of agreed multilateral rules to ensuring that all countries have their interests taken into account.

"Mike also has the best experience of GATT, WTO and international trade issues. He would be a strong voice for the WTO. His campaign is predicated on being guided by the wishes of the WTO Membership and on maintaining the sound, effective management of this Organisation".

"We will continue to use our best efforts to support Mike Moore's candidature", said Dr Smith.
