Minister of Justice, Tony Ryall today confirmed that the Court officials had been unable to uncover any information regarding the alleged destruction of two dogs in late 1998, following an alleged incident in which the dogs were loosed by the occupier of an Auckland house upon two intruders.

The Papakura Police have also confirmed that they have no record of the alleged incident.

"There has been a great deal of comment on this issue", Mr Ryall said.

"However, I believe the lack of information to date is a salutary lesson to all involved that it is important to gather one's facts before making public comment.

"I remain open to any further information regarding this case.

"Should further information become available I will give it serious consideration", said Mr Ryall.
