More than 175,000 New Zealanders had registered interest in purchasing shares in Contact Energy by 4 pm this afternoon, Treasurer Bill Birch, SOE Minister Tony Ryall and Minister responsible for Contact Energy Lockwood Smith said today.

They said they were delighted at this level of response from New Zealanders interested in purchasing a slice of the energy company. Sixty per cent of the company is being offered to New Zealanders by public float.

"Those who registered an interest before 5 pm today will receive twenty-five per cent more shares than the minimum public allocation if the float is oversubscribed. People who did not priority register can still buy shares when the offer opens".

Although priority registration closes tonight, the final number of expressions of interest will not be known until all forms have been processed. Ministers expect to release final numbers when they become available later this week.
