Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced a $1.6 million agreement between the Crown and the Aorangi Awarua Trust in the Central North Island to protect over 5,000ha of native forest, tussockland and wetlands.

Mr Smith said there had been much tension throughout two decades of negotiation between the land owners and Government departments and the kawenata or covenant represented a huge step forward for both conservation and relationships between Maori and the Crown in the area.

The 5,142ha of land, which includes the sacred mountain, Aorangi, is to be protected under Nga Whenua Rahui, a fund established by the Government in 1991 to protect land in Maori tenure.

Mr Smith said the beauty of Nga Whenua Rahui, which is headed by the paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa, Tumu te Heuheu, is that it puts emphasis on continued Maori control, ownership and management of the land.

The Aorangi- Awarua block, which lies inland from Taihape has over 1000 owners belonging to the Ngati Hinemanu Hapu of Mokai Patea. Much of the property is covered in native bush and it is significant for being one of the last privately owned tracts of indigenous forest in the area.

Aorangi- Awarua Trust chairman Ike Hunter says the trust is delighted that after more than 20 years of hard work agreement has finally been reached.

"It is a great relief to have reached this point. For the trust it signals a new beginning and the financial ability to develop our taonga (treasure). The covenant will benefit our people. It has created the opportunity for us to develop the block of land for eco-tourism and this will also provide us with the ability to create jobs."

Mr Smith said he welcomed the plans of the trust to protect the land so it could be shared with future generations.

"DoC will be there to help, strengthening the partnership that has been forged with the trust in recent years."
