The Minister of Finance, Bill English, ACC Minister Murray McCully, and Minister of State Owned Enterprises, Tony Ryall, announced today that the new SOE being set up to compete for workplace accident insurance cover had been formally incorporated.

"This is a significant milestone in the preparation for opening the delivery of accident insurance for employers and self-employed people to competition from 1 July 1999. The SOE will underwrite cover and will face the same regulatory requirements as private insurers in the market."

With incorporation also came the appointments to the Board of the new SOE, they said.

The Ministers announced that the current chair of the SOE establishment unit, Michael Cashin, would be the new chair of the SOE Board, and current director, Peter Fitzsimmons would also continue as a director of the insurer.

"Mr Cashin and Mr Fitzsimmons have laid strong foundations for the on-going success of the SOE and their knowledge will be invaluable as the SOE establishes itself in the market," the Ministers said.

"They are to be joined on the Board by Dr Tom Marshall, Peter Kiely, Graeme Wong and Jane Huria.

"Dr Marshall, a GP, is a current director of Tairawhiti Healthcare Ltd and Mercy Hospital.

"Peter Kiely is a partner in law firm Kiely Thompson Caisley, while Graeme Wong is the executive chairman of Southern Capital Ltd.

"Jane Huria is the chair of Ngai Tahu Properties, a director of Huria Associates and Transpower NZ Ltd amongst others.

"The new appointments bring a mix of skills to the Board that will stand it in good stead into the future," the Ministers said. They will take effect later this month.

The SOE would enter the market when the creation of the company infrastructure was completed they said.
