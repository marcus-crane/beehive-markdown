Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Minister of Women's Affairs Georgina te Heuheu today renewed their efforts to see more women, especially Maori women, appointed to decision-making bodies.

"We are pleased to see the number of women being appointed to government bodies gradually increasing. In 1998, 35 per cent of the appointments approved by Cabinet were women, compared to 25 percent in 1993. However there is still room for improvement," Mrs Shipley said.

At an International Women's Day function this morning, Mrs Shipley and Mrs te Heuheu introduced eight Maori women, selected for their skills and experience, to key decision-makers from the public and private sector.

"These women have been identified by the Ministry of Women's Affairs as having the skills and abilities to make a valuable contribution to local and national government boards, tribunals and committees," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Maori women have long been leaders in their communities. Each of the women here today is a leader in her field, and has been nominated by her iwi authority because of her proven leadership and decision-making abilities within her community, including her whanau, hapu and iwi. They all clearly have the potential to participate at very senior levels of decision-making both in the public and business sectors, " Mrs te Heuheu said.

Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said it was particularly appropriate that this function was being held on International Women's Day.

"In New Zealand, we can be proud that women are continuing to make very real progress. However it remains a challenge to ensure the diversity of our community is reflected in participation in decision-making at all levels of our society.

"Initiatives such as this which support and promote women are close to my heart. These women clearly have what it takes, and I know there are many more in our community who have a contribution to make. As long as our society fails to make the best use of the skills and abilities of women, we are short-changing ourselves," Mrs Shipley said.

The women come from Rotorua, Hicks Bay, Tolaga Bay, Whakatane, Dannevirke, Palmerston North and Wellington (details attached).

Today's event is the second part of a Ministry of Women's Affairs project called Maori Women in Decision-making. In April last year, part one of the project introduced Maori women from business and professional backgrounds. Several of these women have subsequently been appointed to boards and others are under consideration for appointment.

To increase the pool of women available for appointment and their understanding of governance, the Ministry of Women's Affairs has developed a series of one day seminars which are held in association with regional organisations such as the Hamilton Enterprise Agency, Taranaki Work Trust, and the Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce. Further seminars are planned for around New Zealand in 1999.

The Ministry has also worked closely with the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit in the development of a series of two-day seminars for potential crown company directors. To date three seminars have been run by the Institute of Directors. Women have made up over half the participants at each seminar.

NB: Today's breakfast function is at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, 48 Mulgrave Street, Wellington, starting at 7.15 am. The Prime Minister and  
the Minister of Women's Affairs will speak briefly after 8 am.
