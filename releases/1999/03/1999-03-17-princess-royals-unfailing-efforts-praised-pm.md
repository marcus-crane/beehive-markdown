The Prime Minister today officially welcomed Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal to New Zealand and praised her tireless efforts to  
advocate support for needy children throughout the world.

The Princess Royal was honoured at a formal lunch hosted by the Prime Minister in the Grand Hall, Parliament Buildings. Her Royal Highness is  
visiting New Zealand until Thursday 18 March. She last visited New Zealand in 1995 as President of the Chartered Institute of Transport.

"I am an unashamed royal supporter, along with many New Zealanders. We have been spoiled somewhat lately with the visits of the Duke of  
York late last year.

"New Zealanders are traditionally strong supporters of their royal family and take great delight when honoured with a lengthy visit such as  
Princess Anne's.

"This year the Commonwealth celebrates its 50th anniversary. The Commonwealth's work in the promotion of good governance and democracy  
has been consistent and valued for many years.

"Most recently it played an important role in supporting restoration of a democratically elected government in Nigeria. New Zealanders are proud  
to be part of such an important group that continues to support democracy for all," said Mrs Shipley.
