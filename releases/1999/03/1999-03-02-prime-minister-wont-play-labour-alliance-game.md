Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today said that she would continue to refer Labour and Alliance Members to her previous statements on tourism matters.

"The Labour-Alliance bloc have set a personal dirt agenda for this year and I do not intend to play their game," said Mrs Shipley.

They had denied her the right to make a personal explanation to the House, when she sought leave to do so twice last week, Mrs Shipley said.

"As long as they ask me to repeat answers I have already given, I will refer to the statements I have already made both outside the House last week and at the weekend with a media statement.

"In the meantime I am getting on with governing the country.

"The overwhelming message I am getting is that New Zealanders want me to get on with real business and that's what I intend to do," Mrs Shipley said.
