Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today reassured New Zealand women that they have four brands of fully subsidised second generation oral contraceptive pills to choose from, if they have concerns about the pill they are currently on.

'Fewer women are now being prescribed third generation pills as a result of reports that these may be associated with a higher risk of blood clots and advice from the Ministry of Health to prescribe second generation pills,' said Mr Delamere.

'Women who are concerned about being on third generation pills have the choice to switch to one of the fully funded second generation brands which will save them money.'

Mr Delamere said PHARMAC, the Government's pharmaceutical drug-buying agency, listed two fully-subsidised brands of second generation pills in 1997 and another two last year. None of the third generation are fully funded. In total, there are 27 different choices of oral contraceptives, four fully-subsidised and the rest receiving partial subsidies.

To ensure there are no barriers to contraception, women on lower incomes have access to a the full range of oral contraceptives with no extra charges 'It is important for women and doctors to realise there is a choice for them,' the Minister said.
