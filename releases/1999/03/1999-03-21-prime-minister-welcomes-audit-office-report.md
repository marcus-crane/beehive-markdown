Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed the Auditor General's report on the Tourism Board.

"It is a very useful report. It is comprehensive. It raises matters for the Tourism Board which they will wish to consider, and wider issues for the Government that will get prompt attention.

"It clearly disposes of the extravagant claims made by the Leader of the Opposition.

"The Minister of Tourism did not order the payments to retiring Board members. He did not seek confidentiality from them. The payments were not hush money.

"It is clear the Minister was driving the Tourism Board very hard, as he should have been because he was concerned about its performance in the run-up to a critical year for New Zealand tourism.

"He had a valid concern about the Board's performance, and the Tourism Board Act gave the Minister very little room to move.

"The size of the exit payments to the chairman and another director has been questioned ? rightly so in retrospect.

"In the Auditor General's opinion, the exit payments, of $200,000 to the chairman and $140,000 to the other resigning member, were unlawful. But the Auditor General accepts that neither the Board nor the Minister were aware of that.

"The Board genuinely believed the payments were justifiable and were the best response to an untenable situation.

"It is clear that the Board had sought legal advice and was acting in good faith. I accept that.

"In retrospect, it would have been wiser for the Minister to consult his Cabinet colleagues when he found himself in this predicament.

"However, I have looked at the issues carefully and I have concluded that nothing I have read in this report causes me to reconsider his role as Minister of Tourism.

"I remain confident that he will continue to demand the highest levels of performance for the sake of New Zealand tourism. Indeed, over recent weeks I have been encouraged by the progress that has been made by the Minister and the Tourism Board in advancing the plans for promoting New Zealand tourism.

"I also have great confidence in the new chair and chief executive of the Board. I believe an excellent programme is being put together.

"The Auditor General's report has identified some important issues relating to the Tourism Board and other Crown entities that need to be clarified. The Government has been working on these in the light of the Auditor General's reports in 1996 and 1998.

"After the recent events involving the Tourism Board and the Fire Service, more work is underway."

She said she had today contacted the Solicitor General for his advice on:

Whether the exit payments were lawful;  
The issues raised by the question of recovering the money;  
Any other legal issues raised by the report which the Prime Minister should be considering.

"The State Services Commission and other central agencies will be asked to report urgently on issues that arise out of the report," Mrs Shipley said.

"I have asked the responsible Ministers to review the work that has been done on Crown entities and identify what else we need to address. In essence, we have to clarify what is Boards' business and what is Ministers' business.

"We need to be sure that all these entities are clear about their jobs and that Ministers can ensure they are delivering maximum value for money," Mrs Shipley said.

The work will focus on issues affecting Crown entities including:  
responsibility  
accountability  
purchase agreements

"It is my intention to have the public sector recommendations on Crown entities independently reviewed. The Government will then take whatever actions are necessary.

"I am confident that the Tourism Board will now get on with the important work of promoting New Zealand."
