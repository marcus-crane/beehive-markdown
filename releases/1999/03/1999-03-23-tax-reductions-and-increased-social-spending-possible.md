Finance Minister Bill English said today that tax reductions did not mean threats to spending on core social services.

"It is not an either/or choice. If the country does well we can have tax reductions and increased social spending and that is the Government's aim.

"This Government has delivered significant tax benefits since 1996, especially to low and middle income families, while at the same time increasing spending on core social services such as health, education and the police.

"Over the last two years around $3 billion has gone into taxpayers' pockets which the Government would otherwise have taken. At the same time spending on social services has increased significantly. In five years spending on health has gone up from $4.5 billion to $6.2 billion and education by about the same.

"These tax benefits have resulted in real gains for working families. A family earning $35,000 with four children under 13 is now getting $118 more every week through tax reductions and extra family assistance. When you add savings from low interest rates, say $56 savings on a 20-year table mortgage of $80,000, this family is $174 a week better off than it was in 1996.

"A family earning $45,000 with two teenagers and one child still at primary school is $164 a week better off than it was in 1996. This is made up from $45 in tax reductions, $49 in extra family assistance, and $70 savings on a 20-year table mortgage of $100,000," said Mr English.
