The Minister of Civil Defence, Jack Elder, is on his way to Alexandra to inspect damage and meet fire-fighters who have battled the two huge grass and scrub fires in Central Otago.

As a result he has had to cancel plans to address the United Fire Brigades Association Conference in Invercargill this afternoon.

Mr Elder will be joined in Alexandra by Roger Estall, Chairman of the Fire Service Commission and be shown around by the Southern Region Fire Commander, Steve Turek.

The fires, which began yesterday afternoon, spanned 80 square kilometres in the Waikerikeri Valley, 14 kilometres northwest of Alexandra and 150 square kilometres in the Knobby Range between Alexandra and Roxburgh.
