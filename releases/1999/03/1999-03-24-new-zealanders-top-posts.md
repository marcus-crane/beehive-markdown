To even consider appointing a non-New Zealander to either of the critical positions of Secretary of Defence or Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade would expose a regrettable cultural cringe mentality still haunting the New Zealand bureaucracy, the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Marie Hasler said today.

"I am convinced, however that there is no need for legislation to cover the point and that the advertising overseas is simply a way of reaching expatriate New Zealanders," Ms Hasler said.

"These are positions of leadership, requiring as an essential ingredient a deep and intrinsic sense of national identity that can only really be obtained by being a truly committed New Zealander.

"Both Richard Nottage and Gerard Hensley are exceptional citizens and I am confident that there are others within the country with similar potential."
