A joint New Zealand-Australia currency was not on the agenda of the CER taskforce looking at issues between the two countries, Prime Minister  
Jenny Shipley said today.

"This is not a currency taskforce. A joint currency is not on the agenda," Mrs Shipley said.

A Weekend Herald story today incorrectly quoted the Prime Minister as saying the taskforce would look beyond the issues outlined by Mrs  
Shipley and Australian Prime Minister John Howard during his visit to New Zealand last month.

The taskforce agenda, agreed by the two leaders and confirmed by Mrs Shipley today, would focus on:

- Barriers and costs to trans-Tasman investment;
- Child support arrangements;
- Social security arrangements;

It would also examine future directions for CER, including further steps within CER to strengthen economic ties, and extending CER?s links with  
other countries.

The strengthening of economic ties within CER did not include consideration of a joint currency, Mrs Shipley said.

"A unified currency is not being considered," she said. "I have always said I see no reason why we should consider it."

The taskforce is being managed within the Prime Ministers' respective departments and will report to them within three months.
