Associate Minister for Food and Fibre, Hon David Carter, will tomorrow visit properties north of Gisborne involved in the East Coast Forestry Scheme.

The future of the Government-funded scheme will be considered by Cabinet in the next few weeks, and Mr Carter said he wanted to see first-hand the effects forestry planting had had on the erosion-prone coast before any decision was made on the scheme's future.

"We need to be sure that planting trees on the East Coast is having the desired effect stabilising the coast, and that no other option would work for the region."

"The East Coast suffers a scale of erosion that is unique both internationally and nationally. The district contains more than 25 percent of the land considered to be severely eroding in the North Island, in an area which covers less than 8 percent of the island."

"Without Government support it's probable much of the severely-eroded land on the East Coast would slip away into the sea."

Mr Carter will view the properties with MAF assistant director general, forest management, Murray McAlonan and Randolph Hambling, manager of the East Coast Forestry Project.

The Minister will view 14 properties, meeting with some of the foresters involved in stabilising the coast.
