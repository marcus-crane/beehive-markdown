"Labour leader Helen Clark offers no ideas whatsoever for turning young people from a life of crime. In the last eight years Helen Clark has never mentioned a plan to deal with young offenders. Her comments today are pure electioneering and ambulance chasing" says Justice Minister Tony Ryall.

"When last in Government Helen Clark's answer to youth offending was to abolish borstals and dedicated youth detention facilities. Ms Clark wanted no one under 20 in detention. She was part of a cabal which cut police numbers, reducing the likelihood of catching young criminals. She voted against longer sentences for rape and tougher bail provisions.

"National on the other hand has a comprehensive approach to reducing crime, and youth crime in particular.

We have invested heavily in early intervention helping families under pressure;  
We have invested in crime prevention and back the work of the hundreds of community groups tackling these problems;  
We have increased police numbers by almost 900 to increase the likelihood of being caught. Most crimes rates are reducing;  
We are investing in increased secure facilities and have a plan to build six youth prisons throughout the nation.  
"Panicked by the public reaction to their dirt campaign, Labour are desperately attempting to show they care about youth offending. In the last eight years Helen Clark has never mentioned a plan to deal with young offenders. In fact most of her colleagues have an ideological aversion to asking young people to take responsibility for their actions. Her comments today are pure electioneering and ambulance chasing" observed Mr Ryall.
