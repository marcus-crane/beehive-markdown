Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today announced details of the Government assistance package to drought stricken South Canterbury and Clutha farmers.

"I have approved $48,500 for co-ordinating the drought relief work in South Canterbury and $38,000 for the Clutha District. The funding is for the work of the drought relief committees and the rural trusts that have been operating in those areas to help farming families in financial difficulties."

The South Canterbury and Clutha District drought committees have been consulted and have assisted in the package's preparation. The funding will provide technical support. As the situation develops, the Minister will consider whether any further help is needed.

"I encourage the drought relief committees to work closely with local government. I'm heartened by the Dunedin Mayor's proposal to set up a Mayor 's fund to attract donations from people who want to help rural people through their present difficulties. The Government supports self help and where this is forthcoming, Government funds can be provided."

"There needs to be good communication between the relief agencies. The drought relief committees have a key role to play in keeping people informed people and developing strategies to deal with the problems. Farmers need to continue to realistically assess the situation on their own farms, seek advice if necessary and continue to manage down stock numbers where necessary," Mr Luxton concluded.

This announcement is one of a number of measures the Government is taking to assist farmers in drought hit areas. On Thursday Associate Minister for Food and Fibre, Hon David Carter, will meet farmers in drought areas of North Otago and South Canterbury accompanied by Otago MP Gavan Herlihy. Conservation Minister Nick Smith will also be in the area to see first hand how farmers are faring under continuing drought conditions.
