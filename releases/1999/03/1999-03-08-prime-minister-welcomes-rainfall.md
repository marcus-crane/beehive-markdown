Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she was delighted and relieved that rain had finally arrived to the Otago region which has been plagued by drought and fires.

"The rain will be a great relief to farmers and those who have been fighting the hot spots in Alexandra.

"The drought has been one of the most severe in history and everyone has been praying for rain. One MetService observer in Southland summed up the feeling of hope brought by the rain when he said: "Hallelujah, it's pennies from Heaven"."

The MetService recorded 12.7mm of rain at Alexandra from 1pm to 5pm and it has issued a severe weather bulletin for the region. Up to 90mm of rain is expected in some areas of Eastern Southland, the Eastern ranges of Otago and South East Otago through to midday tomorrow.

"Rural fire fighters say the rain will help scale down the situation in Alexandra, where 10,000 hectares has been burnt. They are hoping for more rain overnight, and plan to continue with their infra-red monitoring of hot spots in the morning.

"This latest rainfall might not be the total drought breaker, but it will definitely make a positive impact on the land, and it comes at a good time.

The region really needs a few more periods of good rainfall. In the meantime the Government will continue to work with farmers to manage the drought," Mrs Shipley said.

The weather is expected to fine up again by Wednesday with some rain mostly to Coastal areas.
