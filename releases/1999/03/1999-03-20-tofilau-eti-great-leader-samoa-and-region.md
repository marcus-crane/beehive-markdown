Former Samoan Prime Minister Tofilau Eti was a truly great leader of his people and will be sadly missed throughout the Pacific region, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Tofilau died on Friday after a long battle with cancer. He had been Samoa's Prime Minister from 1982 to 1998.

"New Zealanders will miss him as one of our own Pacific family," Mrs Shipley said. "Our hearts go out to his family and to all Samoans, both at home and in New Zealand, at this sad time.

"New Zealand and Samoa are so close, it as if we have lost one of our own," Mrs Shipley said.

During his long term in office, he had been a strong supporter of the Treaty of Friendship between Samoa and New Zealand, the only such agreement New Zealand has with any country.

Tofilau was one of the few international leaders whose retirement from office was acknowledged by a unanimous motion in the House of Representatives.

The closeness of the New Zealand-Samoa link was marked this month when Tofilau's successor, Tuila'epa Sailele Malielegaoi, visited New Zealand.

Mrs Shipley said New Zealand authorities were awaiting word from Samoa on arrangements for the former Prime Minister's funeral or memorial service.

New Zealand's representation at any service will be announced shortly.
