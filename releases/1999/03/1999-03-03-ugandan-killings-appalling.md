Foreign Minister Don McKinnon has described the killing of two New Zealand tourists and six others in Uganda as appalling and senseless.

"The New Zealand Government sends its condolences to the families of the two New Zealanders killed yesterday.

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working with its counterparts to ascertain the exact circumstances of the killings. These remain unclear, but preliminary reports indicate that the Hutu rebels were responsible. We would obviously be most concerned if the hostages died as a result of any Ugandan army efforts to rescue them.

"I will be seeking further clarification of this from my Ugandan counterpart in Kampala next week".

Mr McKinnon said he strongly advised New Zealanders thinking of travelling to this part of Africa to take extreme care and to be conscious of the uncertain security environment in several parts of the continent.

"I have previously advised New Zealanders travelling to this part of Africa to take care and to try and stay in a group. But clearly after yesterday's tragic events, there is no guarantee of safety even in a group situation.

"New Zealanders intending to travel to Central Africa, or any other area of the world where it is known there is unrest, should contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to seek travel advice. New Zealanders already overseas and planning to visit potential trouble-spots should contact their nearest New Zealand or British diplomatic post", Mr McKinnon said
