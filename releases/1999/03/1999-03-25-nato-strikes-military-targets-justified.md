NATO's intervention in Kosovo was a grave step but justified and inevitable in the circumstances, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said following today's decision by NATO to commence air-strikes against military targets in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Mr McKinnon said NATO members had become increasingly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Kosovo during the winter, and frustrated by the impasse reached during peace talks in France.

'Last Friday Kosovo authorities signed up to the terms of the peace agreement brokered by the six nation Contact Group but President Milosevic has refused to sign and will not agree to a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.'

Mr McKinnon said the peace talks had been accompanied by a build-up in hostilities in recent weeks between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as the two sides sought to maximise territory in advance of any ceasefire.

However the plight of the civilian population was acute and with FRY troops massed on the borders of Kosovo, the situation had now reached crisis point, he said.

'President Milosevic has been repeatedly warned of the consequences of escalating the conflict in Kosovo. The Contact Group and NATO has gone to every length to bring about a peaceful solution to this crisis,' Mr McKinnon said.

'New Zealand hopes that any NATO action will contribute to resumed negotiations between the parties to the conflict. We want to see relief for the misery of the people of Kosovo and a peaceful and durable negotiated solution based on the terms of the agreement brokered by the Contact Group,' Mr McKinnon said.
