Minister for Courts, Georgina te Heuheu, today launched a computerised system which will modernise the Maori Land Court administration, and provide easily accessible and accurate Maori land information.

"This is a significant day for the Maori Land Court and Maori land owners and Administrators," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"Two million two hundred and sixty nine thousand and one (2,269,001 ) land ownership interests have been computerised. Fifty percent of those interests are in the Waiariki region alone," she said.

At a ceremony in the Waiariki Court, Rotorua, the Minister spoke about the uniqueness of the Maori Land Court and its record.

"The Maori Land Court record is unique," Mrs te Heuheu said. "It has been necessary to design and build a unique information technology system".

"Planning for this system began two and a half years ago, and today sees the completion of this system which has been designed, built, and successfully tested on time and within budget. This is an achievement for the Department for Courts and the Government," she said.

Maori land owners can expect reduced administrative processing times of Court applications and reduced title search times. "It is also important for the archiving of the paper record which has been under threat of deterioration due to its age", Mrs te Heuheu said.

Waiariki, being the final registry to have the system rolled out, now means that the first national database of Maori Land title and ownership details is complete.

"This means Maori will not have to travel long distances to access title information anymore, so there is a real benefit for the people".

"It is fitting that this should be rolling out just before the Millennium," Mrs te Heuheu said.
