Commonwealth Day is our opportunity to celebrate New Zealand's membership of the largest and closest-knit family of nations in the world, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said.

"We have a shared history, a shared view of democracy and human rights, a shared language, and a shared belief that more is achieved by working together than alone.

"Commonwealth Day this year is all the more special because 1999 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the London Declaration, the founding ocument of the modern Commonwealth.

"Since 1949, the Commonwealth has changed dramatically. Membership has increased from 8 to 54, and the Commonwealth now accounts for 1.7 billion people, one quarter of the world's population.

"The unique characteristic of the Commonwealth is the association of people, which is the source of the organisation's strength. Many New Zealanders belong to professional, sporting, and other bodies which unite them with other Commonwealth citizens all over the world. These are connections which we make voluntarily and from which we derive considerable pleasure and benefit.

"I pay tribute to Her Majesty The Queen who has been Head of the organisation for 47 of these last 50 years, providing us with a living symbol of the free association which binds us.

"The Commonwealth has grown and prospered over the last 50 years, and oved with the times. I am confident that the organisation's next 50 years will be qually successful, and we in New Zealand will remain committed to the ommonwealth and all that it stands for," Mrs Shipley said.
