The Lottery Grants Board has made $1.2 million available for the new Ashburton Aquatic Park, the Board Chairman and Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder announced today.

The park, being developed about 15 kilometres southeast of Ashburton near Tinwald, includes provision for a 77 hectare lake with international standard rowing and water ski facilities.

Mr Elder said there is currently no water based multi-sport complex in the South Island which can be used all year round.

"The only international standard 2000 metre rowing course is at Lake Ruataniwha in the MacKenzie district which can't be used during the winter months," he said. "Kerrs Reach Christchurch has a 2000 metre rowing course, but this does not meet international standards because it doesn't follow a straight path. Severe low winter temperature mean most of the South Island's interior lake facilities close for the winter season."

Mr Elder said that while the Ashburton complex opens up all sorts of exciting opportunities for rowing, it will not only be of benefit to sporting organisations. "It will provide tremendous recreational and fitness opportunities for everyone because of the proposed lakeside facilities of walkways, fitness trails, running and cycling tracks," he said.
