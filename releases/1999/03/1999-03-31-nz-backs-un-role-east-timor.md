Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that New Zealand fully backs the key role the United Nations has in working through a settlement of the East Timor issue, after a meeting with Mr Francesc Vendrell, a senior UN official closely involved with the negotiations on East Timor 's future.

'Mr Vendrell and his team are working on arrangements for a direct ballot of the East Timorese people on the autonomy offer the Indonesian Government has made.

"Provided agreement can be reached next month on the autonomy proposal, a UN team could arrive in East Timor from the beginning of May. That would be a very important confidence building step in reducing tensions and fostering a climate of reconciliation between the East Timor factions.'

'I confirmed to Mr Vendrell New Zealand's willingness to contribute to a UN presence in East Timor and our intention to continue to send development assistance there.

'I also discussed with Mr Vendrell our concerns about the level of tension and violence in East Timor, especially the part being played by armed militia groups. The UN certainly recognises the priority that must be given to disarming and reconciliation processes and these issues are also being addressed in the context of the UN talks.

'Indonesia deserves credit for the changes and reforms President Habibie has initiated - including his flexibility on East Timor with the autonomy proposal and his willingness to contemplate independence. It is crucial that in this period ahead, Indonesia works constructively with the United Nations to ensure that a ballot can take place in a free and fair environment, in which violence and intimidation are absent. It is vital to get people from both pro- and anti- groups to lay down arms and work for a peaceful future.'

'It is premature to say exactly what assistance New Zealand might be able to provide, but at this stage the discussion is focused on election expertise and monitors. Much will depend on the outcome of negotiations this month and other talks in the challenging period ahead," Mr McKinnon said.
