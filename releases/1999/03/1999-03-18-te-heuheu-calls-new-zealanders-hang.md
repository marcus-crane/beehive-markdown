The Hon Georgina te Heuheu, Associate Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, today called on New Zealanders to hang in and keep faith with the Treaty settlement process.

Mrs te Heuheu was responding to the results of a survey published in the Evening Post on Wednesday this week, which showed that some New Zealanders did not believe Treaty of Waitangi grievances should be settled.

"Of course there are some who don't fully understand the process. And, it is only to be expected that there might be a sense of Treaty fatigue", Mrs te Heuheu said. "But invariably, the many New Zealanders that I meet and talk to show a growing appreciation of what the Government is endeavouring to do".

"What we're talking about is our shared future. It's important that we address the grievances of the past so that we can go forward together as New Zealanders united in our future", Mrs te Heuheu said.

"I want to thank New Zealanders for their support. The Treaty settlement process is complex and requires time, effort and, above all, patience", she said.

"New Zealanders can be proud of what we're doing in our country. And yes, we need to continue to show tolerance and patience towards this process and each other." She said.

"The National Party is committed to seeing the process through in a timely and appropriate manner. Both the Government and Maori are working as hard as they can to secure a resolution to these matters", Mrs te Heuheu said.
