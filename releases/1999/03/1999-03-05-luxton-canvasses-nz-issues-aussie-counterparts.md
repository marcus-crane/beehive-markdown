Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today hailed as successful, his bilateral discussions with Hon Mark Vaile, the Australian Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

Speaking from Adelaide John Luxton said the meeting provided an opportunity to monitor progress over New Zealand access issues such as apples, salmon and foodstuffs. Discussion also covered lamb access to the United States, diary products to the European Union and genetically modified foods.

John Luxton also met with Australian State and Federal Ministers as part of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ).

"A range of critical issues including gene technology, dairy industry reform, food safety, the wool industry and meat quality were discussed. ARMCANZ also addressed the possibility of further reforms in the Australian dairy industry. Australian Dairy representative, Pat Rowley outlined for us the push for further reform and how best to manage the challenges ahead. The likelihood of rapid change in the Australian Dairy industry in the next 18 months means the New Zealand dairy industry will need to prepare itself to meet that challenge."

Also on the agenda was the work of the Australian Future Directions Taskforce on wool, the demututalisation of Wool International, and the rationalisation of wool selling centres.

Mr Luxton said State and Federal bodies including the Australian and New Zealand Food Standards Council were developing a joint response to recommendations for a complete overhaul of food safety regulation in Australia. Mr Luxton also noted the role of ANZFA in setting in setting a common approach to food standards under CER.

"All Ministers were mindful of the need to maintain the highest health standards possible to promote high levels of consumer confidence in the safety of food product. A three year plan to improve meat and safety hygiene was agreed and the strong message from Agriculture Ministers to consumers was the meat industry was serious about improving safety levels."

ARMCANZ Chair and Federal Agricultural Minister Mark Vaile said the Ministers noted the huge potential gains gene technology promised Australian agriculture and trade, while recognising the need for appropriate regulation. "Gene technology is a worldwide development and we need to ensure that Australia takes advantage of the science. The challenge for Australia is to maximise the benefits and to minimise any possible risks," he said.

Mr Luxton said New Zealand was having to address the same issues. "If we are to keep New Zealand's competitive advantage as leading agricultural producers, we need to recognise both the opportunities and the risks involved in gene technology," he concluded.

From Australia Mr Luxton heads to Rome and Morocco for further bilateral talks. He will visit Morocco at the invitation of the Moroccan Government who are interested in establishing a relationship with the New Zealand fishing industry.
