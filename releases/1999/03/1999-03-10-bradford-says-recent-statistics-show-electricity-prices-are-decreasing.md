The Minister for Enterprise and Commerce Max Bradford says the National-led Government's electricity reforms have already led to a decrease in electricity prices.

The Statistics New Zealand electricity price indices for the December 1998 quarter show that the household index decreased 1.9 per cent when compared to the September 1998 quarter, while the commercial index fell 2.2 per cent.

Mr Bradford says these figures show quite a different picture compared with previous trends illustrated in the latest edition of the Energy Data File (EDF) prepared by the Ministry of Commerce. Its figures up to the end of March 1998, show the national average real electricity consumer price rose over 4 per cent.

"However I expect the next national average electricity consumer price will reflect the same downward trend in electricity prices that the latest Statistics New Zealand figures show," Mr Bradford said.
