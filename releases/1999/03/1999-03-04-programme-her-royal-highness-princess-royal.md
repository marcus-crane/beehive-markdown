Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal will visit Auckland, the Waikato, Wellington, and Linton Military Camp this month, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"Princess Anne has a very full schedule which enables her to meet many New Zealanders from many walks of life during one of the most important years for our country.

"The itinerary also enables Princess Anne to visit local organisations for which she is patron," Mrs Shipley said.

The Princess Royal's four-day programme will begin with a parade by Youth Members of the Order of St John at Auckland's Aotea Square on Monday 15 March and end with a visit to Linton Military Camp on Thursday 18 March.

On Wednesday Princess Anne will visit the Mission to Seamen in Wellington and meet the Chartered Institute of Transport of New Zealand, of which she is Patron. On this day she will also attend a luncheon at Parliament hosted by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. Before lunch the Princess Royal will present the Royal Commonwealth Society essay competition awards.
