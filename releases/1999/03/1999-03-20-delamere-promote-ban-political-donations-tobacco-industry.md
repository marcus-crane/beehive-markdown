Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today announced his intention to try to make it illegal for political parties and politicians to accept any form of contribution, monetary or otherwise, that can be sourced back to the tobacco industry.

Speaking from Washington DC, where he is attending an international policy conference on children and tobacco, Mr Delamere said, "Too often throughout the world, legislators themselves are the problem in that they have allowed themselves to be financially exploited by an industry that purveys death and illness.

"It is imperative for legislators' credibility that the public know they are not beholden to the tobacco industry at any level and I have challenged delegates at this conference from all over the world to consider promoting legislation in their countries to ban the practise."

Mr Delamere will seek a place on the government's legislative programme to promote his plan and will ask Te Tai Hauauru MP, Tukoroirangi Morgan, to consider adding it to the Member's Bill relating to smoking he is currently sponsoring.
