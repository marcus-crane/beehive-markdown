Trade Minister Lockwood Smith departs New Zealand today for Japan, China and Singapore.

Dr Smith's visit to North Asia and Singapore follows his visit to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia in February to promote New Zealand's objectives for APEC 1999.

"In order to achieve our policy objectives for APEC 1999, New Zealand needs to build momentum behind APEC's work. Visiting these influential economies now will contribute toward achieving concrete outcomes from APEC 1999," said Dr Smith.

Dr Smith's programme in Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore involves meetings with counterpart Ministers, Foreign Ministers, senior officials academics and the business sector to help build a feeling of involvement in the APEC process.

"My visit to South East Asia in February reinforced the importance of discussing our objectives for APEC with member economies. I expect this trip will be equally valuable. I will share our themes and objectives, and listen to each economies specific views and concerns," said Dr Smith.

New Zealand's objective of broadening support for the APEC process will be advanced through a series of round-table discussions. Dr Smith will chair meetings with APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) representatives, key business people and academics. These discussions aim to cement in real involvement in the APEC process by its key stakeholders across the region.

Dr Smith will also address a meeting of the Australia New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ANZCCJ), and visit the New Zealand stand at the China International Higher Education Exhibition. Dr Smith returns to New Zealand on Wednesday, 17 March 1999.
