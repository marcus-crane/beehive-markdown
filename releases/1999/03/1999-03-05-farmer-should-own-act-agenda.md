Central Otago farmer Gerry Eckhoff should be called to reconcile his demands for increased Government spending with his own political philosophy, says Food and Fibre Associate Minister Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter reacted angrily this morning to Mr Eckhoff's criticisms of the money Government awarded yesterday to South Canterbury and Clutha for drought relief.

"I understand Mr Eckhoff is seeking the ACT Party nomination for Otago."

"Mr Eckhoff accompanied ACT MP Owen Jennings to Otago yesterday to a farmer's Field Day, and both promised the world to farmers. Yet this same party is telling business audiences in Wellington and Auckland that they want to reduce Government expenditure and cut taxes further."

"How can ACT be credible when their politicians and sympathisers are telling farmers one thing and businesses another?"

Mr Carter, who visited parts of North Otago and South Canterbury yesterday, said the two drought-relief packages were anything but "publicity stunts", and were well accepted by the farmers he met with in the regions.

"We have taken very seriously the worsening situation in the south, but farmers and the local communities now need to take the initiative. Government money alone won't solve the problem."

"Gerry Eckhoff needs to reconcile the ACT agenda with his call for increased Government spending, before attempting to represent the feelings of Otago farmers on this issue."

"His suggestions at the moment are more akin to Alliance policies. Maybe he should throw his hat in with them!"
