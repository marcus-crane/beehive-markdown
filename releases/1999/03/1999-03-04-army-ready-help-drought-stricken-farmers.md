Defence Minister Max Bradford says the Army is on standby to assist drought stricken farmers in Central Otago.

Mr Bradford said the Army has moved water delivery equipment and personnel to Burnham in readiness if requested by the local Drought Relief Committee.

"Army delivery trucks and storage bladders are available to be used to supply rural homes in the drought effected areas, similar to last year's operation to help Marlborough's farmers," Mr Bradford said.

"While the drought in Central Otago is on a far larger scale than that of Marlborough and will require a different approach, the armed forces are on standby to also provide labour if required, just as they assisted with this week's fire fighting efforts in Alexandra."
