So-called revelations by the Alliance today about the Government's water services review are both factually incorrect and nearly four months out of date, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says.

"It's bizarre that only apparently today has the Alliance found the review's terms of reference, which were made available at the same time the review was announced in November," Mr Bradford said.

"This seems typical of the Alliance - which must be either congenitally inefficient or are manufacturing information which anyone with an ounce of common sense can see through."

Mr Bradford said he had made it very clear at the time the water services review was announced on November 27 last year that the review was not about privatisation. The review was enthusiastically supported by Local Government New Zealand at the time.

"It is a long-term review to ensure safe, secure and efficient water supply, and about finding the best way of managing and maintaining water and wastewater infrastructure," Mr Bradford said.

"The Government believes the ownership of local authority water and wastewater infrastructure is a matter for local communities todecide."

Mr Bradford released a copy of the letter he sent to all majors when the review as announced.
