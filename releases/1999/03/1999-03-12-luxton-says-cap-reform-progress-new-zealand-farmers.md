Today's announcement by European Union Farm Ministers of a reduction in farm subsidies, is a step in the right direction Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control Minister John Luxton said today from Europe.

EU Farm Ministers have agreed to a package of policy reforms which will reduce, over time, expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy and a move towards world prices for agriculture.

"The package is welcome but the move towards world prices will be slow," Mr Luxton said.

"I am sure the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries of which New Zealand is a part will be analysing the EU decisions in detail with an eye to how they will fit into the next WTO Round."

"We will be making our joint views known in due course," Mr Luxton concluded.
