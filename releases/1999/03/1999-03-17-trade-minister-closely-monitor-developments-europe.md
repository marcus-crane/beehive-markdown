Trade Minister Lockwood Smith, on his return from Asia today, has assured exporters that he will closely monitor political developments in Europe following the resignation yesterday of all 20 members of the European Union's Executive Commission.

"The developments at the European Commission are unprecedented," said Dr Smith.

"Europe is a significant market for New Zealand, worth close to $4 billion dollars, or 18.21 percent of our exports.

"New Zealand is discussing a number of ongoing trade issues with the Commission. But at this stage, we are not concerned that the resignations will have a negative impact on New Zealand exports to Europe.

"New Zealand's exports are covered by WTO commitments between the European Union and New Zealand, and these will remain.

"We expect to keep working with the Commission at senior officials level. We may experience some delays, but Europe will not grind to a halt as a result of yesterday's developments.

"Exporters should be assured that New Zealand will keep a close watch on developments, and will continue to work on trade access issues with Europe through our existing relationships within the Commission", said Dr Smith.
