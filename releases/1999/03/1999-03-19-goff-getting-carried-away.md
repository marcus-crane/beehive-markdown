"Phil Goff's call for MPs to start criticising Judges is going way too far", Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"According to a report in the Evening Post today, Labour's justice spokesman Phil Goff wants to change the conventions which restrain politicians from publicly criticising judges", Mr Ryall said.

"In doing so he is willing to destroy a fundamental plank of New Zealand's constitution and ultimately threaten every New Zealanders right to fair impartial justice. All for the sake of trying to look tough on law and order.

"His call is either incredibly naive or simply diabolical.

"Judges do not only impose sentences on the guilty, they protect the rights and freedoms of every New Zealander, impartially and without prejudice. They have sworn an oath to do justice without fear or favour.

"The logical conclusion of Labour's justice stance, is trial by the public, politicians and the media.

"I urge all New Zealanders to think about the dire consequences of having the media and politicians decide the fate of those accused", Mr Ryall concluded.
