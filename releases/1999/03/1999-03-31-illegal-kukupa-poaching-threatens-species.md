Conservation Minister Nick Smith is angry at signs of kukupa (New Zealand woodpigeon) poaching early in the fruiting season and said the Department of Conservation was already receiving information about poaching activities in forests. He has instructed the Department to beef up their surveillance early in response to the threat.

"I am outraged that people would kill these birds when they are under such serious threat. Do these people want to drive the species to extinction' Do they place no value on their children and grandchildren being able to appreciate these birds' Not only are kukupa important in their own right, but they are vital to the survival of our forests. They are the last bird able to spread the large seeds of a number of trees like taraire and puriri."

Kukupa numbers have declined 50% since 1980 and were given Absolutely Protected status in 1921 although illegal hunting of the species has continued in Northland. Birds are shot mainly for food but are also known to be sold or raffled for monetary gain.

"Last week a kukupa with a gunshot wound in its thigh was picked up by a conservation officer in the Waipoua Forest. The bird was eventually put down by a Dargaville veterinary surgeon following extensive surgery which was unfortunately unable to save the animal 's leg."

Under the Wildlife Act 1953, it is an offence to hunt or kill kukupa. The maximum fine is $1500 plus $100 for each bird taken. The Department of Conservation runs an 0800 number which members of the public can ring to report any suspicious activities - 0800KUKUPA (585872). All calls will be treated in confidence.

"The Department of Conservation will be putting every effort into catching and prosecuting those that are destroying kukupa. If we are to win the war against these environmental vandals we need the support of the Northland community. I urge the community to keep their eyes and ears open and report any signs of kukupa poaching."
