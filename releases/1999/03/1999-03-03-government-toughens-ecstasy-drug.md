The Government is to toughen its stand against people who use or sell the illicit drug Ecstasy, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

The Ministerial oversight group responsible for developing the National Drug Strategy have recommended that Ecstasy be reclassified as a  
Class A drug, resulting in much higher penalties.

Mrs Shipley said today that the Government would be seeking support from all parties in Parliament for the move.

"This Government will do everything it can to stop the hard drugs market from expanding in New Zealand."

The new classification will put Ecstasy in the same class as other illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine and LSD.

"It is important that young people get a clear message that this is a dangerous drug, not something they can use for fun.

"The Government will seek to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to reclassify Ecstasy as a Class A drug. I hope the whole of Parliament will  
support this move."

Mrs Shipley said use of Ecstasy had increased dramatically in the last two years. Before 1997 there had only been occasional seizures by  
authorities, but since March 1997 almost 12,000 tablets had been intercepted.

Lifting the classification of Ecstasy will bring stiffer penalties for those caught importing, selling or using the drug, Mrs Shipley said.

The maximum penalty for importing or supplying a Class A drug is life imprisonment, compared with 14 years for a Class B drug. For using, the  
penalty is a maximum of $1000 or 6 months imprisonment, compared with $500 and/or three months jail for a class B drug.

Mrs Shipley said the decision to reclassify Ecstasy was a key part of the Government's programme to implement the National Drug Strategy.  
Further details will be released shortly.
