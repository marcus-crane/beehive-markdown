Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today labelled the Green Party as needlessly alarmist in its growth hormone press release.

"The two BST applications have been in train since 1994 and 1996 respectively. The process of the Animal Remedies Board is rigorous to protect New Zealand's key agricultural industries. The implications of the use BST will be fully assessed before any decision is made."

A number of hormones have been previously approved for sale in New Zealand for improving growth in cattle. They are not widely used and there are strict regulations controlling their sale and use.

"BST has been banned in Canada and the European Union on animal welfare grounds, but is registered for use in the USA."

"I am aware that the Animal Remedies Board has referred the application to the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee to consider the animal welfare aspects of the use of these compounds. They have also requested further toxicological information."

The new Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act will require a thirty day public consultation process before registration of any agricultural compound or animal health product occurs. It is expected that the ACVM Act will be implemented in mid-April.

"If consultation process provides sufficiently robust scientific evidence that registration should not occur, then it won't proceed. It's as simple as that," the Minister concluded
