Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton said today that the press releases coming out of Jim Sutton's office were tired, recycled and confused just like the Labour Party.

"It's the same old stuff that he put out last month and the month before that. I guess he hopes second time lucky. My advice to Labour is rather than borrowing National's ideas and rehashing old press releases, how about some enterprise and innovation? How about new policies, in fact any policies and how about some fresh ideas?"

For example:

"So long as the boards keep doing their job well and retain the support of producers and levy payers, they will continue to enjoy the support of Labour."

"So long as the boards keep doing their job well and retain the support of producers and levy payers, they will continue to enjoy the support of Labour."  
(3 February)

"John Luxton's claim is the very opposite of truth. It is bizarre." &lt;

"What is bizarre is that Jim Sutton thinks he can get away with this," Mr Luxton said.

"It's clear where the Government stands on issues like producer boards and the need to improve farm incomes, but what does Labour stand for? In the last 6 months Jim Sutton has said many things, but which should voters believe? Is he playing to Phil Goff or is he playing to Helen Clark? Or is he sitting on the fence and hedging his bets?"

"I've never been a great devotee of it (single seller marketing) myself although I did support the plans for the wool-marketing review in the 1970s." (Jim Sutton on RNZ Country Life 22/8/98)

"Of course, over time, there will be changes to producer board legislation to ensure New Zealand responds to the ever-changing global marketplace." (Jim Sutton release 11/9/98)

"That was then but now Jim Sutton says that he supports producer boards but with certain qualifiers. Well which one is it? Labour are trying to be all things to all people. But a leopard doesn't change its spots. For the last nine years Labour's Jim Sutton has been saying that farmers must become more market orientated, isn't that exactly what I've been saying?"

"The facts speak for themselves, Labour may say one thing now, but you can bet before the election Jim Sutton will have reverted to type. The reality is that Labour has nothing new to say, and when they do say something either they've borrowed it from us or cut and pasted it from elsewhere, Mr Luxton concluded.
