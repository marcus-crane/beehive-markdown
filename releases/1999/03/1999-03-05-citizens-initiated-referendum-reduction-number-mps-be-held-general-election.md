The Minister of Justice Tony Ryall has today announced that an indicative referendum on the question of whether the size of the House of Representatives should be reduced from 120 members to 99 members will be held on election day.

The petition was promoted by Mrs Margaret Robertson under the Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993. The Clerk of the House certified that the petition had been signed by at least 10% of eligible electors on 8 February 1999, which means that an indicative referendum must be held. The Speaker presented the petition to the House of Representatives on 17 February 1999.

"There are two main reasons for the Government's decision that the indicative referendum should be held on election day.

"First, it will ensure a high voter turnout, as voters will be attending the polling booth for the general election. We want as many New Zealanders as possible to share in this important decision.

"Second, the cost of the indicative referendum will be considerably lower than the costs for holding a stand alone poll. As much as $8 million is likely to be saved by this option. The lower costs will be because polling booths, staff, and other resources for the general election will be able to also service the indicative referendum.

"The process for setting election day as the date for the referendum is likely to involve two steps, as it is not legally possible for an Order in Council to appoint election day, per se, as the date of the referendum before the date for the general election has been set. The date of 18 December 1999 has therefore been appointed, by Order in Council, as the date for the indicative referendum. That date has been chosen as it is the last possible day under the Constitution Act 1986 for the next general election. However, it is very unlikely that the election would be held on that date, given its proximity to Christmas. Accordingly, when Parliament is dissolved and the election is declared, the Order in Council will be revoked and replaced with an Order in Council appointing election day as the date of the referendum" said Mr Ryall.
