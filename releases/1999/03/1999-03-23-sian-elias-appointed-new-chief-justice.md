Justice Sian Elias is to be the new Chief Justice of New Zealand, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

She will take up her appointment in May, upon the retirement of Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum.

"Sian Elias is being appointed because of her outstanding legal ability, her empathy with the community in all its diversity and the leadership and  
foresight she will bring to this role," Mrs Shipley said.

"At the age of 50, she is in the vanguard of a new generation of leaders in the New Zealand judiciary. She is a modern judge with a strong sense  
of the challenges New Zealand will face in the future."

Justice Elias was admitted to the Bar in 1970. She has appeared in a wide range of courts and tribunals including the Court of Appeal and the  
Privy Council, and served as counsel in one of the most long and complex commercial cases in New Zealand, the Equiticorp case.

She served both as defence counsel and a prosecutor before her appointment as a High Court judge in 1995.

"Perhaps the most outstanding contribution Sian Elias has made to New Zealand law is her advocacy on behalf of Maori before the courts and  
the Waitangi Tribunal," Mrs Shipley said.

"That took vision, courage and commitment. The respect she has built among Maori as a result of that work is of lasting importance for us all."

Mrs Shipley also paid tribute to Justice Elias's commitment to human rights and community work, including neighbourhood law office work and a  
period as a director of the Environmental Defence Society.

Mrs Shipley paid tribute to Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, who has been Chief Justice since 1989.

"His learning, his intellect and his passionate commitment to judicial independence will be long remembered," she said.

"The appointment of Justice Elias, following Sir Thomas's term, continues the high standards of integrity and commitment that New Zealanders  
expect of the judiciary."
