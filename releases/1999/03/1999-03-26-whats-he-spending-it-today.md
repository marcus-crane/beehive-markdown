Finance Minister Bill English said the Labour Party's tax policy was not credible and even leader Helen Clark publicly admitted that.

"Labour's finance spokesman Dr Cullen is trying to convince people that his promised tax increase will pay for all the expectations Labour is creating around its spending promises. Helen Clark knew that wasn't credible when she asked North & South magazine 'what's he spending it on today?'.

"Dr Cullen is a clever man, but he has backed Labour into a corner with a tax policy that just doesn't add up.

"If Labour was in Government it would come under huge pressure to spend more from its supporters and from its coalition partner the Alliance. There is no way Dr Cullen can meet these expectations with the tax increase he has promised.

"The Alliance at least has been much more honest about what its policies will cost. Jim Anderton has said that Labour couldn't possibly promise to address the needs that the Alliance would address with that tax policy.

"Dr Cullen has so far only promised tax increases for people on incomes over $60,000. But the real question is who would be next to face tax increases when the pressure comes on to spend more. The answer can only be middle income New Zealanders earning between $30,000 and $50,000.

"It's time Dr Cullen faced the fact that his tax policy is not credible," said Mr English.
