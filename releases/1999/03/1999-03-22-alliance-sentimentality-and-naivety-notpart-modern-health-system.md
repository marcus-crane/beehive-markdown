The Alliance is living in the past," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today in response to the Alliance Hospital Plan.

"The Alliance's Hospital Plan is a confused mix of sentimentality and naivety, with no credibility in a modern health system. As usual the numbers don't add up.

"The Alliance says $200 million a year of public money is being poured into private hospitals. Most of the public money in private hospitals is for long term hospital care for the elderly. Who will pay for that? The Alliance plan would lead to wasteful duplication in services.

"The Alliance is driven by ideology not logic. It is obsessed with the involvement of 'private' providers - but GPs, rest homes and pharmacists have been 'private' for years.

"In true Alliance fashion its Hospital Plan is still several decades behind reality. The Alliance has not caught up with the fact that more buildings do not mean more or better services for people. Technology has changed treatment dramatically over the years and will continue to do so.

"In my electorate for example Dannevirke does not need a district hospital. There would be very few locals who thought the area did. The response so far from Dannevirke has been laughter - they thought the Alliance was joking.

"The Alliance is also several decades behind with its costings. How it plans to build six new hospitals, staff them, pay for services, pay for free doctors visits for everyone, administer the $6 billion that goes into health services for $70 million more a year is anyone's guess.

"To say they can do all this by re-allocation of existing funding is a joke. Services will suffer.

"The Alliance needs to get its head out of the sand. Most New Zealanders would be concerned about spending hundreds of millions of dollars building hospitals which aren't needed, aren't clinically sustainable and where there would be real doubts about their safety.

"The Alliance's attempt to counter the Government's Hospital Services Plan which provides a comprehensive approach and certainty for communities about their hospitals shows how out of touch the party really is.

"The Government is committed to a network of public hospitals and is upgrading and replacing those that need it. Almost $1 billion has already been invested with close to another $1 billion expected to be invested in improving hospital infrastructure over the next few years."
