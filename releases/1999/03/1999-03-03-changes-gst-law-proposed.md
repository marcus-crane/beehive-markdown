Proposed changes to GST law are set out in a tax policy discussion document released today by Treasurer Bill Birch and Revenue Minister Bill English.

"GST now brings in $8 billion a year, nearly a quarter of all government revenue. A recent review of the legislation has highlighted several areas where change may be needed," the Ministers said.

"We want to reduce compliance costs, bring the law up to date with developments in the commercial world, ensure that it does what it was intended to do, and close loopholes that lead to loss of revenue."

Proposed changes include:

Raising the GST registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000 a year. This would allow 25,000 individuals and small businesses to stop accounting for GST if they wished. Other GST thresholds would also be raised. Improving the rules for adjusting GST to reflect private use of business assets. Strengthening anti-avoidance legislation to stop people structuring transactions in such a way as to gain tax advantages. Tightening the rules on GST refunds, especially in relation to second-hand goods. Preventing zero-rating of services consumed in New Zealand but contracted for overseas. An example would be educational courses provided here but paid for by non-resident parents. Introducing numerous clarifications of the law in key areas such as financial transactions and software.

"The Government wants to act particularly quickly to close the loophole that allows 'exported' services provided in New Zealand to be zero-rated.

"Because we want to introduce the necessary legislation into Parliament as soon as possible, submissions on this proposal will close on 26 March. Submissions on the other proposals close on 30 April," said Mr Birch and Mr English.

The proposals are detailed in the tax policy discussion document GST: A Review, which is available from Bennetts Government Bookshops and on the Inland Revenue Website at www.ird.govt.nz.
