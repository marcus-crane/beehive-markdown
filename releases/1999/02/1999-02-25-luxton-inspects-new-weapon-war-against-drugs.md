Border Control Minister, John Luxton, will be at the helm of the new Customs patrol vessel HAWK IV when he joins the crew for a brief tour of duty off Tauranga Harbour tomorrow (Fri. 26/2).

Mr Luxton will be accompanied by members of the local media and will be given a demonstration of the capabilities of the new vessel which he launched last September.

"The Government is firmly committed to fighting the menace of illicit drugs, to prevent a hard drug market becoming established in New Zealand," said Mr Luxton.

"We recognise that we have an obligation to all New Zealanders to ensure that the best possible measures are put in place to prevent the introduction of products or drugs which cause irreparable damage to the social fabric and general well being of our society", he said.

The recent commissioning of the HAWK IV was a clear indication of the commitment of the Government to maintain strong and effective border control programmes.

"The last two major drug seizures in Australia were both carried out at sea, and therefore we cannot be complacent about drug shipments entering New Zealand in this manner. The fact that 440 kilos of heroin, on a mother ship, and more than 200 kilos of cocaine on a yacht, were both intercepted is very real evidence of an existing drug threat to this country.

"The Government has an ongoing commitment to the protection of our national borders, and to get tough on drugs. This vessel is an important part of that commitment. It will enhance Customs' ability to respond quickly to suspected violations at our border.

"HAWK IV is equipped with the latest hi tech electronics to assist in the detection by offenders. Heat sensor cameras, radar, global positioning systems and night vision binoculars are all on hand for the officers on board.

"The New Zealand Customs Service is not just a group of professionals who stop travellers at the airport on their way in and out of the country. Stopping illegal border activities around our coastlines is a major role of the Service and already since it was commissioned Hawk IV is more than proving its worth," he said.
