Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, said today that Labour had its head in the sand over what APEC would deliver for New Zealand businesses and New Zealanders.

Mr McKinnon was responding to comments made by Ms Clark that the Government was obsessed with free trade.

"What the Government is obsessed with is creating opportunities for exporters and jobs for New Zealanders. We cannot achieve this in isolation from the rest of the world," he said.

"APEC is about making it easier to do business overseas. The 21 APEC members account for 57% of the world's economies and 70% of our trade. Ten of our top 12 trading partners are APEC economies. It is one group we definitely want to be a member of."

Mr McKinnon stressed that APEC is a partnership for business and employment growth, a partnership for recovery in the region.

"It's a pretty simple equation. Profitable businesses means more jobs for New Zealanders and income for Government to spend on health and education."

It's ironic that Labour criticises this given they advocate additional spending of tax dollars!

Ms Clark appears confused, is genuflecting to the Alliance, and wants to have a bet each way.

She has previously been reported as supporting APEC, but now appears to be against breaking down barriers for New Zealanders to sell their products overseas.

Today, in one breath, Ms Clark slams the Government for pursuing the APEC agenda of opening up markets to exporters and eliminating barriers to trade, yet in the next breath she says more focus is needed on economic cooperation and development ? and being more sensitive to the concerns coming out of Asia.

"What she says APEC needs to do, is actually what it is doing."

Mr McKinnon said that the long-term benefits to New Zealanders of freeing up trade around the region were substantial.

For example in the fish and forestry industries alone it is estimated that the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers will add around 130 million dollars a year to New Zealand's 3 billion a year APEC region trade in those commodities.

"With this confused, head in the sand attitude Labour will surely stifle job creation and improved standards of living for everyone."
