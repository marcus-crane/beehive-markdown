On Thursday, 18 February 1999 in answer to a question from the Honourable Dr Michael Cullen about a dinner I had with Dr Kevin Roberts, Chief Executive Officer of Saatchi & Saatchi, I gave an answer which included the following statement:

"The dinner that I had with Mr & Mrs Roberts was a dinner between myself and my husband and Mr Roberts and his wife. We did not even discuss politics, let alone tourism."

I regret that the statement just referred to, given in the cut and thrust of oral questions in the House, did create an element of confusion and I now wish to clarify the position.

The statement that "we did not even discuss politics" was wrong in that, as I explained in my answer to a further supplementary question from the Honourable Phil Goff during the same "questions for oral answer" session, we did talk about how political parties could become peak performing organisations and how the interests of political parties could be further advanced.

In the final part of my answer to Dr Michael Cullen, I said that at the dinner with Dr and Mrs Roberts we did not discuss Tourism Board business. That statement is totally correct and I stand by what I said in the House.

I am aware that in a letter dated 8 September 1998 which Dr Kevin Roberts wrote to Mr Paul Winter, Chief Executive of New Zealand Tourism Board, Dr Roberts referred to a timetable for a strategy presentation from his company to the Tourism Board. In the fifth paragraph of that letter, Dr Roberts said:

"I confirmed the above timetable during my dinner with the Prime Minister and also on the following day at a meeting with the Prime Minister, Wyatt Creech, Roger Sowry and Murray McCully.

I can tell you that the Prime Minister and her key colleagues were extremely positive and enthusiastic about what I had to say on New Zealand tourism and I believe will be fully supportive of the recommended strategy."

The statement by Dr Roberts that he confirmed the strategy presentation timetable with me at the dinner referred to above is totally incorrect. At no time during the dinner did we discuss the timetable or any other matters relating to the Tourism Board.

On the following morning Dr Roberts met with myself and a small group of senior Ministers. Neither prior to the meeting when I greeted Dr Roberts in my office, nor at the meeting, was there any discussion of the contract between the Tourism Board and Saatchi and Saatchi. At that meeting we discussed matters relating to my party, its performance and that of other political parties. We talked about Dr Roberts' ideas on peak performance and how they could be applied to my work.

There was discussion in passing about the contents of a speech that Dr Roberts had made on 28 August which had received widespread media coverage and was the source of some stimulating public debate. Some ideas in the speech concerning matters including the flag and the name of the North and South Islands had caught the attention of the MPs present. Dr Roberts indicated they were some of a number of ideas that he was working on. No formal support was sought for those ideas, nor was any given.

I am aware that Dr Roberts has issued a personal statement dictated from Argentina in which he accepts that the statement in his letter dated 8 September 1998 to the Chief Executive of the Tourism Board about having confirmed his company's proposed timetable during the dinner with me on 31 August was wrong. I note that Dr Roberts has taken an early opportunity to correct the matter.

I regret the distraction that this business has caused to the Government and the Parliament, and to the important work of attracting tourist dollars to New Zealand. We must now get on with our work.
