Jim Anderton's suggestion that there was some relationship between a meeting with Mr Kevin Roberts and the government decision to provide $12.5 million additional funding for the Tourism Board is baseless and totally false, Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"It seems also to have escaped the Opposition's attention that no money has been paid to Saatchi and Saatchi from the Tourism Board.

"The documents I released on Monday night show that the issue of extra funding for tourism was a serious matter for the Government at the beginning of last year, when the impact of the Asian Crisis on the industry were apparent.

"It was also clear through last year that New Zealand had a one-off opportunity to promote itself through the series of events here in 1999 and 2000. Ministers were saying this publicly.

"In July, in response to a request from the Prime Minister to review our approach to external linkages, the Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested there may be a case for a major promotional effort in 1999.

"The Minister of Tourism commissioned a paper on this matter from a working party on 17 July.

"On August 7 - three weeks before any meeting with Mr Roberts - the then Treasurer, Hon Winston Peters, said in a speech in Queenstown that details of funding to promote tourism would be part of a package to help exporters and job growth as a response to the Asian Crisis.

"On 25 August, still prior to any meetings with Mr Roberts, I submitted a paper to Cabinet's strategy committee pulling together a series of initiatives, including promotion of tourism, as a response to the Asian Crisis and to promote growth.

"That paper was released to the media in January, and again on Monday night. "The paper that went to cabinet committee on September 8 from the Minister of Tourism, that Mr Anderton and Helen Clark want to portray as sinister, was part of the work programme that followed.

"The media is well aware of this timeline.

"So too are the Opposition.

"They will also know that the $12.5 million approved by the government now sits with the Tourism Board so that it can be used in the way the Board believes best promotes New Zealand tourism.

"There is absolutely no link between funding for that advertising company and any meeting between Mr Roberts and Ministers.

"This series of events may not make a ready soundbite. "Mr Anderton and Helen Clark know that.

"They have decided that their disastrous policies mean they will attack the Government in election year by simply slinging mud.

"The Government will continue to set out the facts, and to work to ensure that New Zealand does not miss out on the tourism and investment opportunities provided through events this year leading to the Sydney Olympics in 2000."
