The Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, John Luxton, said the Government is becoming increasingly concerned by the impact of the spreading drought.

'While the situation is most critical in North and Central Otago, many other areas throughout New Zealand are starting to be severely affected,' he said.

The drought was developing in South Otago, Southland, Canterbury and even on the West Coast of the South Island. The North Island was also suffering.The Manawatu/Rangitikei region was very dry, affecting dairy production in particular. Milk flows were also falling quickly throughout South Auckland, Waikato and Taranaki.

"Some dairy farmers are already on once-a-day milking, and this is disastrous at this stage of the dairy season," Mr Luxton said.

Despite excellent rains in mid January, the East Coast from East Cape to Wairarapa was again drying out. New Zealand pastoral farmers desperately needed rain, and he had been impressed with their management responses to the situation around New Zealand, he said.

However, when further support was required, the Government was willing to work with and help local drought relief committees, the rural support trusts, local government and other organisations seeking to alleviate the impact of the drought. The people in these organisations were already doing a wonderful job, and it was the Government's role to support those local initiatives - not to take them over.

"The Prime Minister and I have already said that the Government is willing to complement the work of local organisations involved in the drought response, and we are willing to consider further ways in which this can be done," he said.

In the worst hit areas, there was growing concern over the ability to feed and water stock, and if dry conditions continued, large-scale action could be necessary. Domestic water supplies were now being affected in some areas, but it was heartening to hear of the proactive response of local authorities assisting their communities to maintain water supplies.

"The drought follows a series of poor seasons for farmers, and while the Government expects them to meet the business risks associated with farming, it already has a rural welfare package from Work and Income NZ in place to ensure that essential living needs for farming families will be met," he said. "These can be accessed through Rural Trust co-ordinators."

Mr Luxton said he was receiving regular reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the developing situation and its impacts for both farming and the New Zealand economy.
