Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford says claims that the number of university students dropped last year are not correct.

"The facts are that the Ministry of Education's figures show there was about a 1.5 per cent increase in the number of tertiary students between mid 1997 and mid 1998, despite the falling number of school leavers in recent years and the decline in overseas students studying in New Zealand," Mr Bradford said.

"Enrolments are estimated to increase four per cent this year, and by an estimated two per cent in each of the following years."

Mr Bradford said the Ministry of Education's most recently published figures also show:

The number of tertiary enrolments was reported as 214,228 as of 31 July 1997 (including 106,486 university), and 214,351 as of 31 July 1998 (107,937 university). During the data collection process in 1998, anomalies of some over counting, double counting and under-reporting of part-times students were found in the 1997 figures. When adjusted for data anomalies, the figures show 211,100 tertiary enrolments as of 31 July 1997 (106,700 university), and 214,351 as of 31 July 1998 (108,937 university). When also adjusted to count only New Zealand students, the figures show 203,500 tertiary enrolments in 1997 (101,650 university) compared with 207,130 in 1998 (103,093 university). There was a 1.8 per cent increase in all New Zealand student tertiary enrolments between 1997 and 1998. There was a 1.4 per cent increase in New Zealand university enrolments between 1997 and 1998. The number of school leavers has fallen from nearly 58,000 five years ago to just over 50,000 in 1997 because of demographic changes. The number of overseas tertiary students dropped 7.1 per cent between 1997 and 1998 - mainly because of the Asian economic crisis. New Zealand has a very high participation rate in tertiary education - on current rates, an estimated 69 per cent of New Zealanders will have enrolled in the public tertiary sector by the time they reach the age of 25, and when private training establishments are included the figure reaches close to 90 per cent.
