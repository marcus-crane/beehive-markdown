Repeat traffic offenders face tough new penalties as a result of laws that take effect on, Monday March 1.

Transport Minister Maurice Williamson says the new laws target serious traffic offenders who:

repeatedly drink then drive  
repeatedly drive while disqualified or  
are careless, dangerous or reckless drivers.

"These changes are in line with the New Zealand public's attitude towards repeat and serious traffic offenders. They send a clear message that the Government is serious about making New Zealand's roads safer. Dangerous drivers need to get the message: their behaviour is unacceptable."

"Dangerous driving kills. It's that simple. Especially when alcohol is involved. Last year, alcohol contributed to more than a quarter of road deaths."

Key elements of the changes are:

Persistent drink drivers will face tougher penalties for third and subsequent offences. Maximum fines will rise from $4500 to $6000, while the maximum prison term will go from three months to two years. These offenders also face losing their license for a minimum of one year instead of six months.  
Dangerous reckless or careless drivers who cause injury or death, and drivers who fail to stop after a serious accident could now receive a maximum fine of $20,000 (previously $6000), a maximum prison sentence of five years and a minimum one year disqualification from driving.  
Careless drivers who cause injury or death in aggravating circumstances (such as drink driving or speeding) could receive a maximum fine of $10,000 (increased from $4500), a maximum prison sentence of three years and a minimum one year disqualification.

The changes to the Land Transport Act also include increases in speeding fines and parking infringement fees.

Mr Williamson said that the increased fines and penalties will work with other new measures, such as photo driver licences and roadside licence suspension (expected to come into force on May 3 1999) to crack down on road criminals and make New Zealand roads safer.
