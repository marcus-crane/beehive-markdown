Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will present an Export Commendation Award to Paeroa company Goldfields Print Limited on Friday 5 February 1999 during a visit to Thames, Waihi and Paeroa.

The Trade New Zealand Export Commendation will be presented at the offices of Goldfields Print, on State Highway 26 in Paeroa at 2.30 pm.

"As part of my programme of visiting exporters throughout New Zealand, I am pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate the management and staff of Goldfields Print," Dr. Smith said.

"Goldfields, a company specialising in commercial printing and stationary production, provide evidence of our continuing competitiveness in export markets, and the strong contribution of exports to employment and economic growth in New Zealand.

"The company was initially formed with three staff. It now provides 30 jobs, with 20 of these involved in export operations.

"Goldfields has been recognised by Trade New Zealand for achieving solid growth in export sales over the past five years in the Australian market. In 1997/98, the company boosted its export sales by 12% to $1.3 million. They are projecting a further increase in export sales to $1.6 million for 1998/99."

The award ceremony is part of a broader itinerary for Dr. Smith on 5 February involving calls in Thames, Waihi and Paeroa. Dr. Smith will call on companies from the manufacturing, electronics and primary production sectors as part of an ongoing programme of visits to exporters.
