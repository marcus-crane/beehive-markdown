Education Minister Nick Smith today launched the education blueprint for health and physical education saying the document had greater potential to improve the health of New Zealanders than hundreds more doctors, hospital beds or medicines.

"Health is about lifestyle. Too many New Zealanders prematurely die from smoking, obesity, alcohol, drug abuse and suicide. The new curriculum will make a real difference by equipping young New Zealanders with the knowledge and skills to lead healthier lives."

The health and physical education curriculum will be compulsory for all students in years 1-10 from the beginning of 2001, but its implementation will begin this year. The curriculum sets out the skills and knowledge required on issues about food and nutrition, mental health, sexuality education, physical activity, sport education, outdoor education, body care and personal safety.

"Academic skills are important but they are little use to the pupil killed in a drink-drive accident or who has committed suicide. Life skills have got to be part of a modern education."

The Minister acknowledged that the most controversial part of the curriculum would be that on sexuality education.

"Victorian attitudes to sex education have rightly been rejected. New Zealand just can't ignore its appalling teenage pregnancy and abortion statistics. The new curriculum provides a balanced approach that is realistic about the pressures facing young people but also ensures they are aware of the health and emotional risks."

"Developing the new curriculum has involved extensive consultation and debate over a very long period. It is time to get on with the job. The Government will be putting a lot of effort into supporting teachers applying the new curriculum in New Zealand's 2700 schools. This initiative done well will help save the lives of thousands of New Zealanders and improve the quality of life for thousands more."
