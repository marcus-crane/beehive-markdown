Revenue Minister Bill English said today an advertising campaign launched last week by the Inland Revenue Department was aimed at 150,000 low to middle income working families eligible for tax help.

"An estimated 150,000 working families are eligible for Family Assistance and we want as many as possible to benefit from this.

"For the 1998 tax year about 125,000 working families are expected to pick up their entitlement, which means there's potentially 25,000 who could still benefit. The amount of assistance depends on the number and age of children in the family and on the family's income. The maximum assistance ranges from $47 each week for a younger child, to $75 a week for 16 to 18-year-olds.

"Inland Revenue's own research shows that people are keen to see Family Assistance advertised more widely and they nominated television as the most preferred communication medium. Advertisements are being run on national and regional television, and in daily newspapers for a week from 17 to 23 February.

"Since 1 July 1996 middle income earners have benefited from two rounds of tax cuts and three increases in Family Assistance and this has put a significant amount of money in these families' pockets.

"For example a single income family on $30,000 with two older children has had a total increase in the hand of $100 a week. This family now receives $108 each week in Family Assistance. A single income family on $35,000 with four young children has had an increase in the hand of $118 a week. This family now receives $133 each week in Family Assistance.

"Helping low to middle income families do better for themselves is about giving them real, practical help and this is what the Government's tax packages have been all about.

"More than $1 billion each year is spent on Family Assistance," said Mr English.
