Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today said she was very disappointed that anybody who had any contact or association with her would use it to say she had a direct involvement in any contractual arrangements they may have with Government agencies.

"In the interests of our country I meet with hundreds of New Zealanders and overseas people every month who are enthusiastic about projects they are working on. I take an interest in them. That's my role as Prime Minister.

"But that's a very different thing from saying I ever try to influence the decision-making process on their behalf," Mrs Shipley said.

"I have always been absolutely scrupulous in this regard.

Mrs Shipley also outlined the process through which the New Zealand Tourism Board decided to enter a contract for its global marketing strategy, to dispel the claims surrounding this issue.

"It is clear from the documents I have required to be released that I have not sought in any way to influence issues that were the responsibility of the board.

"Nor has the Government sought to allocate funds for any purpose other than the promotion of tourism."

The contract was let on 3 July 1998 after a six-way tendering process. No political influence was involved. The allegations of an improper relationship between the Tourism Board and the National Party have been proved entirely false. The minutes of board meetings, indeed, show the opposite. The minutes note: "Needs Opposition buy in (not just National Government)." "Should we organise via KR a preso \[presentation] to Shipley asap (in next week). "Do we need buy-in from Helen Clark?"

Mrs Shipley said that when the Tourism Board contacted her office on at least two occasions offering a briefing she declined because she felt it was a matter that should be addressed by the directors of the Tourism Board.

"I have continued to hold that view until today when I understand the Tourism Board is still working to conclude its global strategy with Saatchi & Saatchi."

Mrs Shipley said she understood that the Tourism Board had still not allocated its funding to the contract.

"The Directors have a statutory responsibility under the Act for decisions related to the allocation of funds and are required to report to Parliament on this."

In the case of additional funding for tourism, the Government began considering the matter early in 1998. On 29 June Cabinet instructed that work begin on considering tourism and other options that would help New Zealand weather the economic downturn. The previous Treasurer, Hon. Winston Peters, announced publicly the intention to increase funding for tourism on 8 August.

This was finally agreed to by Cabinet on 28 September and announced on 11 October.

The Cabinet paper and the Tourism Board minutes make it clear that this money was not specifically voted for the Saatchi & Saatchi project. The Tourism Board minute of 12 October quotes: "McCully holding back $12.5 million of additional funding, i.e. not necessary for this project."

Getting an increase in tourist numbers was seen as a sensible response to the Asian economic crisis and was included in the 'Policies for Progress' package, Mrs Shipley said.

She said she was broadly aware of Kevin Roberts's ideas. "Indeed the 28 August speech by Kevin Roberts had been widely publicised and, as I have said, we discussed his ideas in passing.

"At no stage however was I formally asked to consider a proposal which was to be put to the Tourism Board, or approve it in principle."

Mrs Shipley said the only time she sought any formal advice on the strategy was prior to her visit to Europe which included her speech at a Tourism Board function in London.

"I received assurances from Chairman Peter Allport, Kevin Roberts and Therese Anders that good progress was being made and that I could make the speech which the Tourism Board had commissioned with confidence."

Mrs Shipley endorsed the call from the tourism industry and figures such as Sir Peter Blake to end the distraction and get on with the vital work of promoting New Zealand.
