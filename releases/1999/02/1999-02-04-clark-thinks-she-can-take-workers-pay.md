Helen Clark's comments that National is "bribing" people by talking of tax cuts is plain stupid, Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"Workers' wages belong to them. Not to the government - and certainly not to Helen Clark.

"Good government has a duty to ensure people get to keep as much of their pay-packets as we possibly can. That's a very important reason why National stands for lower taxes.

"Ms Clark and Mr Anderton believe that the government has first call on people's incomes.

"For them, your pay-packet is not what you have earned, but what they are prepared to leave you with.

"They are wrong."
