Tourism Minister Murray McCully says people should look at "some very real positive benefits" which have resulted from the Wellington Commonwealth Games bid which was withdrawn today.

"A Commonwealth Games bid was always going to be at the very ambitious end of the scale.

"I believe that Wellington has earned itself an enhanced reputation as a host city for events, and established some partnerships which will ensure quality bids for other events in the future."

"I commend the Wellington 2006 Commonwealth Games Society on the work that they have done to this effect".
