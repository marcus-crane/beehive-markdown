New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Samoa will be career diplomat Mac Price, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Mr McKinnon said the position Mr Price was taking up in Apia was of great importance to New Zealand because of the close relationship the two countries shared.

"We have many close ties with the countries of the South Pacific, and Samoa is one of the closest. The relationship is underlined by the Treaty of Friendship but we also enjoy significant trade links, while the large Samoan community in New Zealand adds a special bond," Mr McKinnon said.

The Treaty of Friendship followed Samoa's independence from New Zealand. In it, New Zealand agreed to be sympathetic to requests from Samoa for technical and administrative assistance. New Zealand largest bilateral aid programme is with Samoa while exports in 1997/98 totalled $45.2 million.

Mr Price's previous postings were Tokyo, Canberra, Jakarta and Noumea and for the last three years he has been Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's Development Cooperation Division.

"Mr Price's present position has involved him in a wide range of issues with a number of Pacific countries. The breadth of his Pacific experience will bring a valuable dimension to his new post," said Mr McKinnon.

Mr Price will take up his posting in March in place of Peter Hamilton, who is returning to Wellington.
