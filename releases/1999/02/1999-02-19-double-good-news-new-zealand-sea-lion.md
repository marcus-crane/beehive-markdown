Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced that New Zealand sea lions in the sub-antarctic ocean do not appear to be showing any symptoms of last year's mystery illness and that a new net escape device was showing promise in reducing sea lion fatalities from squid fishing operations.

"This is a double dose of good news for the New Zealand sea lion. The threatened species, which numbers only about 13,000 animals, is found only in New Zealand waters and we have a special responsibility to ensure its survival. The mass mortalities last breeding season had alarm bells ringing and the fatalities from squid fishing have been an ongoing concern."

In January 1998 a mystery illness struck the sea lions on the sub-antarctic Auckland Islands, causing the deaths of more than 1600 pups and an estimated 20% of adult females. Despite extensive autopsies, no conclusive cause was found for the mystery deaths. Conservationists and fishermen have waited with bated breath to see whether the disease would strike again this season.

"Scientists have reported to me a count of 2867 pups this season with approximately 10% dead. This is less than a fifth of the fatalities last season and is typical of that observed in seasons prior to the disastrous last season. This is welcome news for conservationists and fishermen."

Each year the Minister of Fisheries and the Minister of Conservation agree on a sea lion catch limit in the squid fishery. Last year Conservation Minister Nick Smith and Fisheries Minister John Luxton agreed to reduce the sea lion catch limit by 20% to 67 sea lions as a consequence of the large number of fatalities last season. Further reductions were possible had this year's survey shown an ongoing problem with disease within the sea lion population.

"I am also very pleased that research into developing a marine mammal escape device is showing positive signs and that the fishing industry is looking at installing the devices on some vessels this season."

Sea lions are drowned in squid trawl nets. The fishing industry, Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries have been working on developing new fishing equipment that will allow sea lions to escape from the nets.

"The fishing industry is to be commended for its efforts in trying to find a solution to this dilemma. Nobody wants to see the accidental killing of the sea lion but nor do we want to close down a multi-million dollar squid fishery that provides hundreds of jobs."

Mr Smith said the new device would be trialed this season in the sub-antarctic ocean and reports on its effectiveness will be provided by Ministry of Fisheries and industry observers. He hoped it would prove successful in solving a twenty year old conflict between the fishing industry and conservationists.

"The marine mammal escape device is a real example of kiwi ingenuity and all those involved in its development are to be commended. It offers both the fishing industry and conservationists a solution to an age old problem and they need to continue work together to make it a success."
