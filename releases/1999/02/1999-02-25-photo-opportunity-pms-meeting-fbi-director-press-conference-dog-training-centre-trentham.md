Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will meet the Director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation Judge Louis Freeh, in her Beehive Office at 11am today.

Photographers and television crews are invited to take pictures of the meeting.

Mrs Shipley will also hold a press conference later in the day at the Dog Training Centre at 1.00pm at which she will comment on her meeting with Judge Freeh and discuss the Government's plans to fight drug abuse.

The Prime Minister will also watch the annual national trials of the country's top Police, Corrections and Customs Dogs, who will be tested on obedience, tracking, finding hidden offenders and detaining them.

A special narcotics dog competition will also be run, where teams will work day and night to find a range of narcotics hidden in a variety of places throughout the Wellington area.

The Dog Training Centre is located at the end of Dante Road, Trentham.
