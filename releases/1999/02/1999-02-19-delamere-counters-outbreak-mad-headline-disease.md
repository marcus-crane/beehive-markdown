Associate Health Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, said today's New Zealand Herald report of a 'dramatic u-turn on the labelling of genetically-modified food' owed more to the paper's feverish desire for a controversial story than it did to fact.

"Readers are entitled to doubt the accuracy of the Herald's claims when it cannot even get the correct acronym for the Australia New Zealand Food authority (ANZFA), rather than Ansfa, as the paper would have us believe.

"For the record, here are the facts: Roundup Ready soybeans and Ingard cottonseed have been genetically-modified and were submitted for assessment to ANZFA.

"ANZFA assessed them as safe for human consumption and that they are substantially equivalent to the natural (non-GM) product.

"Under the policies currently in force, as determined by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council of Ministers (ANZFSC), ANZFA's governing body, these two substances do not need to be labelled because they are substantially equivalent.

"However, the Council decided on December 17 last year by majority vote that a new policy would take effect on May 1 this year whereby all food products should be labelled as, definitely GM, possibly GM or non-GM.

This policy is subject to the Ministers agreeing on how to define genetically-modified food.

"Given that the two products in question are unquestionably genetically-modified, it is my opinion they should be labelled as such. Even though New Zealand voted against the new policy last December, the Government takes its commitment to ANZFSC and ANZFA very seriously and, unless the new policy is rescinded, then we should try to honour it.

"This in no way contradicts the New Zealand Government's view that the decisions taken on December 17 are practically unworkable for the vast majority of food products. While "whole" products are easily identifiable, this is not the case where a product may have gone through any number of processes and may contain minute traces of a product that may have originated from a genetically-modified source material," said the Minister.
