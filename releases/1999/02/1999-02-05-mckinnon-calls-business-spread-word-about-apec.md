Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Don McKinnon, today urged business people to take a keen interest in ensuring widespread support for APEC.

In his opening address to the "Capturing the Asia Pacific Conference" held in Wellington today, Mr McKinnon said APEC is very much a partnership with the business community - a partnership for business and employment growth, a partnership for recovery in the region.

"If there is one message I'd like you to go away with today," he said, "it is that APEC is about creating opportunities for business, dividends for shareholders and ultimately more jobs."

Mr McKinnon said that it was a simple equation that a wealthy and prosperous business community means more jobs for New Zealanders and more money to spend on things like education and health.

Mr McKinnon cited examples of how opening up markets, breaking down the barriers to trade, and making it easier to do business within the region would benefit a range of industries include fishing, wine, fashion, technology and manufacturing.

"The logic for opening up markets and making it easier for exporters to do business is compelling - but there are those who will understandably be confused if they are only bombarded by messages from the "anti's."

"That is why you all need to be out there helping spread the word."

Mr McKinnon said the reality is the APEC goals of free trade and investment by 2010 and 2020, provide us with enormous opportunities for growing New Zealand business and ultimately improving job prospects and income for everyone in New Zealand.
