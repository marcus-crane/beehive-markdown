From today, people who may wish to buy shares in Contact Energy can reserve an Investment Statement in advance and, by doing so, become eligible to buy 25% more shares than the minimum public allocation. Details of this Priority Registration programme were announced today by Treasurer Bill Birch and SOE Minister Tony Ryall.

Contact, which generates over a quarter of New Zealand's electricity, is also the country's largest retailer of natural gas. The proposed sale would see 40% sold to a a single cornerstone shareholder and 60% being floated to the public.

Ministers said the Priority Registration programme gave potential investors the opportunity to put their names down in advance for a reserved copy of the Contact Investment Statement.

"Priority registration means that, as soon as the share offer opens in April, a personal copy of the Investment Statement will be mailed directly to each person who has priority registered, along with a personalised share application form.

"Priority Registration is not a commitment to buy shares. But those who join the programme are eligible, if they do ultimately opt to buy, for 25% more Contact shares from the public pool than the minimum public allocation."

The Ministers advised all potential investors, before deciding whether to buy shares, to read the Investment Statement. The level of the public allocation will be set after the public offer closes, likely to be in May. Applications for shares can be made only on the Contact Energy Share application forms which accompany the Investment Statement. They said Priority Registration, expected to provide advance information of potential demand for the Investment Statement, was an important contribution towards a smooth and efficient sales process.

"This is the first time priority registration has been used in New Zealand. It was however used and made a useful contribution towards the success of Australia's public offer, for example, of shares in Telstra.

"Priority Registration opens today and closes at 5pm on Monday, March 15, 1999. Only New Zealand residents will be eligible for Priority Registration and they can priority register only once. They can do so by:

Telephoning the Contact Energy Share Information Line on 0800 CONTACT (0800 266 822), or Clipping the coupon in newspaper advertisements appearing from Wednesday, providing public information about Priority Registration, and explaining how to make use of that opportunity.

"People already on the mailing list of a sharebroker should receive a letter and Priority Registration form automatically by mail. They get the same advantage as people registering by coupon or 0800 number."

The Ministers said the very successful floats of Auckland International Airport and Capital Properties last year enabled tens of thousands of ordinary New Zealanders to buy shares, many for the first time.

"We are equally keen to ensure that every New Zealand resident has an opportunity to invest in Contact Energy, one of New Zealand's largest energy generation and retailing companies," they said.

"To ensure that every interested New Zealander is placed in a position to be aware of this opportunity, an advertising information programme using electronic and print media will begin tomorrow night.

"The Government announced earlier this month that a number of companies who made initial bids as possible 'cornerstone' purchasers of the other 40% of Contact Energy have now been short-listed. "Final bids for the cornerstone shareholding are due by March."
