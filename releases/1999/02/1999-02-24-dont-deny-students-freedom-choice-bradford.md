The Labour Opposition would deny students choice, Tertiary Education Minister Max Bradford said today.

"Labour's associate education spokesperson has made it very clear that his party opposes students having any say whatsoever about whether they belong to a students' association," Mr Bradford said.

"Not giving people freedom of choice is typical of the Labour Party. We see it in their industrial relations policy and compulsory unionism, and again in education policy and compulsory student association membership."

Meanwhile, Mr Bradford said he wondered whether Labour's associate education spokesperson had read the Government's White Paper on tertiary education.

"To claim the White Paper is a 'narrow commercial approach' istotally misleading and mischievous. The thrust of the White Paper is about quality courses for students delivered by financially andeducationally sound providers.

It is also about ensuring that the diversity in our tertiary sector is promoted and encouraged without creating unfairness and inequities, and about ensuring our students get the education they need in a rapidly changing world."
