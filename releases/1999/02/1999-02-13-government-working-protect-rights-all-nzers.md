"My Government is committed to protecting the rights of all New Zealanders, and that's why we are putting on the agenda issues surrounding the legal recognition of same sex relationships," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Speaking at the HERO parade in Auckland, Mrs Shipley said she is aware of considerable debate within the gay community on how best to protect the legal rights of people in relationships.

"This is an important issue, and late last year I asked officials to report by the end of March on the legal treatment of same sex relationships and related issues.

"My Government wants security for all New Zealanders, including the security of knowing your rights are protected in the area of personal relationships.

"Throughout New Zealand, not just in the gay community, families and partnerships come in many, varied forms, and have different requirements for ensuring legal protection of their members.

"It's a complex area, as highlighted by recent court rulings, and is too important to be rushed. It's important that all New Zealanders are involved in an open and honest debate before the Government makes any legislative changes.

Mrs Shipley says the Ministry of Women's Affairs has prepared a report on the way other countries recognise same sex relationships, which has identified a range of legislative models in Europe and the United States.

"This is an issue where we in New Zealand must decide what suits us."

Mrs Shipley congratulated those involved in organising this year's HERO Festival and Parade.

"The Hero Festival is fast becoming one of Auckland's most exciting events. It is a time when everyone can celebrate the diversity in our society. Every gay and lesbian person can feel proud of themselves for the contribution they are making to our society - not just through HERO, but through their everyday lives."

Mrs Shipley also paid tribute to those who support and work with people living with HIV and AIDS, and urged everyone to remember HERO's safe sex message.
