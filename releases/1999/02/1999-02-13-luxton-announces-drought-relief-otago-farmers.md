Food and Fibre Minister, John Luxton today announced details of the government assistance package to drought stricken Otago Farmers.

"The package, worth up to $60,000 for a five month period, was made in response to an application received from Federated Farmers' Otago Drought Committee," Mr Luxton said.

"$40,000 is to go to the Drought Relief Committee which is to represent wide community interests in Otago. $20,000 is to go to the established North Otago Adverse Events Trust. This package compares with the $68,420 requested by the committee.

"In addition to this a further grant of up to $20,000 will be made available on the basis that it match donations from the public.

The government will also work with the committee to ensure the needs of the local community are met.

Mr Luxton made the announcement after seeing first-hand the drought affected areas of Maniototo and Strath Taieri.

"I have been impressed by the resilience shown by farmers and the way they have managed in this very difficult situation over such a long period," Mr Luxton concluded.
