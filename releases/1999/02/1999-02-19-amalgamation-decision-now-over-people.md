"It's now over to democracy," said Hon David Carter in response to the Local Government Commission's decision to recommend amalgamation of the Christchurch City Council and the Banks Peninsula District Council.

"I know the Commission has worked hard analysing the diverse views of submissioners."

"With a full poll to be held later this year, it is now over to the ratepayers of Banks Peninsula and Christchurch City to have the final say."

"The recommendation for amalgation does not surprise me, as I have long held the view that 74 territorial authorities was probably more than a country of 3, 681,546 (as at 1996 Census) people required."

The great majority of ratepayers have sadly been apathetic about this issue so far. I hope they will now inform themselves, and vote for the option that they think their locality will best benefit from."
