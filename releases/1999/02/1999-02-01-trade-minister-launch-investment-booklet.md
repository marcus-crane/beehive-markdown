Trade Minister Lockwood Smith will launch an investment booklet promoting New Zealand in Christchurch this week.

"Invest in New Zealand - The Right Choice", is a joint Foreign Ministry and Trade New Zealand publication, and promotes New Zealand as an attractive and viable investment destination.

The booklet forms part of the Government's strategy to improve New Zealand?s foreign exchange earnings, and follows a number of initiatives announced last October under the "Policies for Progress" banner.

"Investment delivers more jobs and a better standard of living for New Zealanders," said Dr Smith.

"As a small economy, we have to make a greater effort than most to promote ourselves on the world stage, and 1999 provides an excellent opportunity to raise our profile through APEC, America's Cup and Millennium events. This quality publication supports these efforts."

Dr Smith will launch the booklet at the Millennium Hotel in Christchurch at 5.30 pm on Wednesday 3 February at a function organised in conjunction with the Canterbury Employer?s Chamber of Commerce. The launch will be attended by a wide cross-section of business and public sector representatives.
