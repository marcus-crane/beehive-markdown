Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today announced the National-led Government's five-point plan to boost New Zealand's economic growth.

Speaking at a Canterbury Manufacturers' Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting in Christchurch this morning, Mr Bradford said the Government's broad economic framework this decade had allowed innovation and enterprise to flourish in New Zealand.

"But we can do better," Mr Bradford said.

"Our vision is to make New Zealand the best place in the world to do business, and the best place in the world to live and prosper."

Mr Bradford said the five-point plan announced today will promote innovation and create internationally competitive products andservices by:

1.lifting New Zealanders' skills and New Zealand's intellectual knowledge base, and championing the success of winners;

2.better focus and direction of the Government's effort in research and development;

3.improving access to business capital (especially international finance) by the knowledge based economy;

4.ensuring regulations and laws support, and not frustrate, innovation and the knowledge based economy; and

5.actively promote success and help build a culture supportiveof innovation and enterprise.

Mr Bradford said the five-point Government plan was deliberately "embryonic".

"This is because we cannot achieve the plan without being in a forward looking partnership with business. We recognise the Government can do more to help you - business - by getting out of your way, and being there to create the best business environment in the world," he said.

"Next month I will be announcing details of a nation-wide roadshow to outline the fleshed out plan and to ensure we have identified the road blocks and creative ideas to significantly increase our growth rate."

Mr Bradford said there was little doubt about the gains of economic reforms in the past years, including the facts that:

the economy is nearly a quarter larger in real terms than it was in 1991; the deadweight of debt has shrunk from 52 percent to 26 percent of GDP; taxpayers have saved about $2 billion in interest payments because debt has been paid off; interest rates are at the lowest level in 30 years; there are now more than 220,000 jobs than in 1991; and twice as many jobs have been created under National as Labour destroyed in its six years in office.

Mr Bradford also indicated this morning that the Government would be announcing changes to the Commerce Act penalties and remedies regime; will be increasing the focus on research and development expenditure, targeted at increasing New Zealand's growth rate; fostering greater foreign direct investment with particular emphasis on knowledge based industries; and focusing on helping ideas' development in CRIs and tertiary institutions reach the market.

"It is critical that we move further forwards increasing 'the size of the pie", and prosperity for all New Zealanders," Mr Bradford said.
