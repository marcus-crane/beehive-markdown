Only Jim Anderton could come up with the idea of the Government establishing another commercial bank, Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

"Nine years ago, in 1990, the Government had to spend $635 million of taxpayers' money to bail out the BNZ.

"Now Mr Anderton wants to turn the clock back and create another one.

"Every government in the world except for North Korea is trying to get out of commercial businesses. They want to lower the risk to taxpayers and recognise that most businesses run far better in the private sector.

"Obviously Jim Anderton knows better.

"New Zealanders have a wide choice of banks now, including the NZ -owned Taranaki Savings Bank, and interest rates are at 30 year lows.

Why on earth does Mr Anderton think the government has to run one?

"Following Mr Anderton's logic, the government will be running dairies, garages, fashion boutiques, furniture shops, lawyers offices and any other type of business that can't be sustained commercially - all of which will have to be bankrolled by taxpayers."
