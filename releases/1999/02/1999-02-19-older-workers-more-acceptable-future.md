"The Human Rights Act amendment which came into force this month will hopefully lessen the demand on agencies such as Christchurch's Grey Skills," says the Minister for Senior Citizens and MP for Banks Peninsula, Hon David Carter.

On Monday, Mr Carter will meet with representatives of the Grey Skills Group to discuss the prejudices that continue to hamper the employment prospects of older workers.

"It's been a long battle for society to accept that older people frequently want to work longer than they have been allowed to. The new amendment bans age-discrimination in the workplace, and it's my belief that over time older workers will become more acceptable."

"Niche employment agencies for the over-45s may eventually become unnecessary," says Mr Carter.

From 1 February 1999, employers can no longer discriminate against staff on the basis of age, nor can they force employees to compulsorily retire at the age of 65.

Mr Carter said the amendment wouldn't solve all the problems mature workers faced, but it was a realistic start.

"With the amended Act, age no longer exists in employment terms. Employers have to focus on the performance of their employees, rather than age."

Mr Carter said the Grey Skills Group was an employment agency he admired.

"Grey Skills have been extremely successful finding work for older people in Christchurch. However, I'd like to think in the future there will be less over-45s struggling to stay in their careers, as employers start to reconsider their worth."

Mr Carter will meet with Grey Skills representatives at 1.30pm on Monday.
