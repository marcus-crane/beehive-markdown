Finance Minister Bill English welcomed today's release of Statistics New Zealand's "New Zealand Now" report into incomes and said it would encourage a more honest debate about income disparity in New Zealand.

"Many New Zealanders have felt uneasy about the sense of a growing gap between rich and poor. The report shows that income disparities were stable in the early 1980s, then increased significantly between 1986 and 1991, and appear to have stabilised again since 1991.

"It shows that there has been no statistical increase in the proportion of people below the Hikoi poverty measure. The gap widened because higher income households have benefited considerably, while there has been a slight decline for middle income households. Most of this shift occured in the late 1980s.

"Big cuts in the top tax rate in the late 1980s may have contributed to an increase in inequality. Another reason for the top 10 percent being better off is a widely understood premium for skills and knowledge in a changing economy. It is also likely that social changes such as more low income single parent households and more high income double income households will also increase inequality.

"The debate about how to deal with inequality in our society is an important one and one which highlights the difference in approach between the two major political parties.

"The Labour-Alliance policy to tax people who do well might pull down above average income, but it promises only dependency and a poverty trap for people on low incomes.

"National supports people of any income who aspire to do better for themselves and their families. We have a whole range of programmes to do this, like Strengthening Families to empower disadvantaged families, and the Compass programme which right now provides a ladder into work for 16,000 sole parents. Tax initiatives such as the Independent Family Tax Credit have put more money into the pockets of low and middle income earners," said Mr English.
