"This morning Ian Revell notified me that he intended to tender to the Speaker his resignation as Deputy Speaker," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"I discussed the issues with Mr Revell last night and again this morning. I supported him in his desire to be open and forthcoming. I also admire his absolute determination not to bring the Office of the Speaker or Deputy Speaker into question. He wishes to uphold the high standards he and members of the our caucus set for ourselves.

"Mr Revell has consulted widely with his fellow MPs. I believe he has made the right decision today in the interests of Parliament," Mrs Shipley concluded.
