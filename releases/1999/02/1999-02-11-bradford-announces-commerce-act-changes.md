Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford today announced changes to the penalties and remedies sections of the Commerce Act 1986.

Mr Bradford said the amendments will give the Act more teeth to combat anti-competitive behaviour.

"Anti-competitive behaviour cannot be tolerated in New Zealand," he said. "Consumers will benefit from these changes, along with the business community because investor confidence will improve due to more effective and clear legislation."

The package of measures will increase the level and range of penalties available, increase the likelihood of detecting offences, provide greater scope for interim relief and increase the incentive for private actions to be taken.

The changes include:

Widening the ranges of offences that are deemed to be anti-competitive, to include output limitation and market allocation agreements; A maximum penalty of up to three times the value of the illegal gain or 10 percent of the firm 's annual turnover; Prohibiting firms from indemnifying their agents for any breaches of the Act, making these individuals accountable; Giving the courts the discretion to ban offenders from directing or managing a body corporate for up to five years; Clarifying that the courts, when considering applications for interim injunctions under the Commerce Act must give appropriate weighting to the interests of consumers; Empowering the courts to award exemplary damages; Making statutory limitation periods run three years from the date when the cause of action is detected rather than the current three years from the date of the illegal activity; Empowering the Commerce Commission to issue cease and desist orders.

In addition Mr Bradford has invited the Commerce Commission to consider the possibility of introducing a transparent amnesty programme.

The amendments are expected to be introduced in the House in May and will be open to public submission through the Select Committee process.

Mr Bradford said the Act's competition thresholds were also currently under review. Thresholds identify the competition conditions that define the borders between legal and illegal business acquisitions and trade practices. This review will include consideration of the fullest array of remedies for breaches of any new thresholds, or anti-competitive market behaviour.

COMMERCE ACT CHANGES

BACKGROUND

What is the Commerce Act designed to do?

The Commerce Act 1986 aims to promote competition in markets in New Zealand. It does this to secure gains in economic growth, which are critical to improving the standard of living of New Zealanders.

It is the primary legislative tool used to facilitate the competitive process in markets in New Zealand. Its sanctions are designed to provide a deterrent to individuals and firms undertaking activities that restrict competition (that is deterring anti-competitive behaviour).

How does the Commerce Act work to deter anti-competitive behaviour?

The Commerce Act provides a deterrent to anti-competitive behaviour by first setting out offences that define the type ofbehaviour that restricts competition. It then sets out the sanctions that individuals and firms will face if they breach the Act.

Why change the Act?

The Act is being changed to allow its penalties and remedies sections to better combatto better address the worst case anti-competitive scenarios behaviour. At present there is a risk that business considers penalties to be a cost of doing businessto have more impact on the largest firms in New Zealand.

Also, there is a need - to speed up and reduce the cost of Commerce Act associated court processes, and speed up these processes.

What are the changes?

a. Specify offences defined in the Act

Section 30 which deems price fixing to be anti-competitive will be widened so that agreements to limit output and allocate markets allocation will also be considered to be an offencebe treated in the same way.

This will send a strong signal that the worst types of collusivebehaviour will not be tolerated in the New Zealand economy.

(An "output limitation agreement" is an agreement among competitors to produce, process, distribute or sell a limited quantity of goods; or to restrict the number, volume or frequency of services offered. A "market allocation agreement" is an agreement among competitors to divide, distribute, allocate or apportion segments of a market for goods or services by means of customers, suppliers, territory, or time of sale.)

b. Increase Widen the maximum level of penalties and remedies available under the Act

An alternative maximum penalty, for bodies corporate, of up to three times the value amount of the illegal gain will be introduced. This will allow the courts to impose a penalty that is higher than the current $5 million maximum.

In practice the Commerce Commission in its application to the courts will make submissions on whether penalties of up to $5 million, or a greater penalty based on illegal gain should be imposed. The courts will also be given discretion to impose use a penalty of up to 10 percentage of the firm's annual turnover as a proxy for the estimation of illegal gain. This percentage will be up to 10%.

The competition jurisdictions of Switzerland, Germany, the United States and the European Commission all use illegal gain, or some variant of illegal gain, in setting penalties. The United Kingdom has recently enacted legislation, due to come into force in 2000, which will introduce penalties of up to 10% of a firm's annual turnover.

The reason for the change is that existing penalties for bodiescorporate available under the Act are too low for the largest firms in the economy. The maximum level of the penalty for bodies corporate of $5 million is likely to be insufficient in terms of providing a deterringence for the worse case scenarios and forfirms with substantial turnover. In such cases the risk of any penalty, as a consequence of illegal conduct, may be viewed as a ?cost of doing business? where the net gain from illegal behaviour is expected to be positive, even taking reputational losses into account.

Under the Act the current penalty for individuals is up to $500,000, this will be retained. However, the Act will be clarified to ensure individuals are held accountable for any offences they perpetrate. Firms will be prohibited from indemnifying their agents for any breaches of the Act and people who commit Commerce Act offences may be liable to be prohibited from being managers or directors of bodies corporate for up to five years.

While the penalties will be strenghtened the costs won't be passed on to consumers. Competition from competitors will prevent the cost of penalties being passed on to consumers, as businesses risk losing business to others. This creates a strong argument for keeping markets in New Zealand open to competition from existing competitors, from imports and from potential competitors.

The reform package also includes measures to ensure that any sanctions imposed against individuals will pay for their illegal actionscan not be passed on to others. These measures are prohibiting fFirms will be prohibited from indemnifying their agents for any breaches of the Act. Also, the courts will have the discretion to and prohibiting offenders persons who commit Commerce Act offences from being managers or directors of bodies corporate for up to five years. The latter would be a discretionary sanction.

Cartels in some of the larger oligopolistic markets in New Zealand would recover the cost of the penalty in a few weeks, bearing in mind that the maximum penalty will be reserved for serious repeat offences, the $5 million cap, by itself, is inconsistent with the deterrence objective.

c. Remedies available under the Act for private litigants will beclarified

At present the courts are not consistently taking the interests of consumers into account A clear instruction will be given to courts to give appropriate weighting to the interests of consumers whenconsidering applications for interim injunctions. Courts will also be able to award exemplary damages in Commerce Act cases. The Act will be amended to ensure that this happens in every case.

How courts determine an ?appropriate weighting? to the interests of consumers will depend on the circumstances of each particular case. In applications for interim injunctions the different parties would present evidence on the impact on consumers of the alleged anti-competitive conduct. The judge would then make a decision on the weighting to be given to the interests of consumers. The important point in this reform is that in every application the interests of consumers must be taken into account.

The courts will also be able to award exemplary damages in Commerce Act cases.

d. Statutory limitations periods under the Act will be amended

The starting point for the three year sStatutory limitations periods will be changed. The current starting point is the time of the illegal activity. Because a high proportion of anti-competitive activity is carried out in secret, the Government has decided to change the starting point to run from the the date when the illegal activity cause of action is reasonably detected, or ten years, whichever is less. to reduce the time that anti-competitive conduct can remain undetected. Currently statutory limitation periods are limited to 3 years. These amendments will not be backdated but will come into effect when the Amendment Act comes into effect.

e. The Commerce Commission's powers will be extended

The A decision has been made in principle to empower the Commerce Commission will be empowered to issue cease and desist orders. These orders would be a formal administrative injunction to cease illegal behaviourconduct allegedly in contravention of the Act. Cease and desist orders would only apply to restrictive trade practices.

The Commission already has the ability to negotiates compliance deeds with firmscompanies who are allegedly in breach of the Act. These deeds are akin to cease and desist orders. However, cease and desist orders have the advantage that they offer greater levels of transparency in Commission the processes and procedures of the Commission. They also avoid court proceedings, are low cost, provide a way of dealing with are preferable for infringements of the Act which do not justify court action by the Commission, can be introduced quickly and avoid the continuing cost to the economy of a likely breach of the Act.

What other work is planned?

a. The Act's competition thresholds will be reviewed

\- The thresholds identify the competition conditions that define the borders between legal and illegal conduct.where there is potential for significant economic harm from business acquisitions and trade practices. - The main issue relates to mergers and acquisitions. By OECD standards New Zealand's merger threshold is high. The Act does not allow the courts or Commission to block mergers that are likely to promote cartels and other collusive behaviour. This review will consider whether the existing approach continues to be appropriate, taking into consideration the small size of the New Zealand economy.Government has agreed to examine the competition thresholds to move it beyond single firm dominance. This will mean the Act will be able to respond to potentially harmful mergers that could result in collective dominance of a market. For example, small groups of firms achieving joint dominance for anti-competitive outcomes, such as higher prices for consumers.

General questions

When will the work be completed?

All the reforms require legislative amendment and a Commerce Amendment Bill has been included on the 1999 legislative programme.

The thresholds review will be completed in the first half of 1999.
