Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today renewed her call for Government agencies and the community to work together to limit the terrible damage caused by illegal drug use.

"All of us, including parents, teachers and principals, the Police, border control agencies, life skills and health educators and services treating drug addiction, have a role to play.

"Clearly our young people are vulnerable, and I'm deeply concerned at reports that young people were using the drug Ecstasy in a school setting in Auckland.

"I know that parents throughout New Zealand worry about their children being exposed to illegal drugs including Ecstasy and I share that worry.

"I have asked my Ministers of Education, Police, Health and Customs to update me on the programmes we have underway to educate our children about the harms of drug abuse and what we are doing to limit access to all illegal drugs.

" My Government sees this as a high priority. We put a National Drug Strategy in place last year. I want to be reassured that we are doing as much as we can to protect our children.

"I am particularly concerned to see drugs such as Ecstasy coming into the country from overseas in increasing amounts.

"I was pleased to have the opportunity at the weekend to talk to Australian Prime Minister John Howard about strategies for combating drug abuse and we have agreed to work together on this issue. I'm also looking forward to discussing the american experience with the Director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation Judge Louis Freeh, when I meet him tomorrow.

"My Government wants security for New Zealanders, and as part of that we will continue to take a tough line against drug abuse," Mrs Shipley concluded.
