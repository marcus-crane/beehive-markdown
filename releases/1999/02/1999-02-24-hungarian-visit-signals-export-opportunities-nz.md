This week's visit from the President of Hungary Dr Arpad Goncz signals the strengthening of a relationship which offers significant opportunities for New Zealand exports, says Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

President Goncz has this week visited New Zealand accompanied by his wife, and a delegation which includes his Minister of Agriculture and more than 20 business representatives.

"As New Zealand looks to increase our ties with Europe, we fully support Hungary's aim to strengthen its links with western Europe through membership of the European Union and NATO.

"The EU is a vital market for our exports and I hope that trade and commercial links between Hungary and New Zealand will grow steadily in the future.

"New Zealand companies are already doing good business in Hungary, particularly as it is a good base from which to do business in central and eastern Europe. I am aware of at least one New Zealand company which took the risk to invest in Hungary in the early 1980s and their investment is providing good returns.

"New Zealand business people met the Hungarian business delegation at trade seminars this week in Auckland and Wellington to explore further potential trade opportunities in both countries.

"There are particular opportunities for New Zealand within Hungary's large agriculture sector, and I look forward to our strengthening relationship with the Hungarian people," says Mrs Shipley.
