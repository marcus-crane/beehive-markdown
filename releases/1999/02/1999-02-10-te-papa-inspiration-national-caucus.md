The Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Marie Hasler says she is delighted the National Party two-day Caucus meeting starting tomorrow is being held at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarawa.

"What better place to concentrate on strategy than at our own national museum with its uplifting atmosphere," she said. "We will be having, in effect, a two-day cultural retreat.

"While the work load will be full on, I'm sure Caucus members will take the opportunity to see some of the museum's latest exhibitions and imbibe the unique Te Papa experience.

"In this year when we continue to assess our cultural identity Te Papa gives the National Party the right atmosphere to ensure culture stays alive and well as we approach the next millennium and beyond."

Ms Hasler said holding the Caucus meeting at Te Papa signals the commitment of the National Party to arts and culture.

"The National Party is showing the value it places on this country's arts and culture by choosing to hold its caucus meeting at Te Papa, the nation's cultural centre."
