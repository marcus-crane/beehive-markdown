The Government's two-day caucus meeting will prepare MPs to "hit the ground running for a big year for New Zealand," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"We've been laying the groundwork for months and in my entire time in Parliament I've never seen the team so focused, with so much policy work done in preparation for the opening of Parliament."

The two-day caucus will be held at Te Papa tomorrow and Friday.

"Even the venue is inspirational," Mrs Shipley said. "We're working to win for New Zealand and the surroundings will remind us what a great country we're working for."

The caucus meeting will consider much of the policy and strategy work that has been done late last year and over the New Year period.

It will address the big policy areas that will emerge as stark points of difference between the Government and the Labour-Alliance bloc in the run-up to the election.

"Following the work we have done on policy, and the refreshing of the Cabinet line-up, this meeting will be the chance for all caucus members to sign up to the party's directions for 1999," Mrs Shipley said.

As well as policy issues in key areas including tax, law and order, health and education, the caucus will look at party organisation and strategy for election year.

It will include sessions on campaigning, maximising the list vote and targeting winnable marginal electorates.

Two high-profile outside keynote speakers will address the caucus. Sue Wood and Kevin Roberts are both close personal friends of the Prime Minister who have accepted her invitation to speak to the caucus.

"They are passionate New Zealanders with big ambitions for the country, and I want them to fire the caucus with their ideas," Mrs Shipley said.

Sue Wood, director of Sue Wood & Associates public relations company, and a former President of the National Party, will motivate MPs with her personal view on the face of the modern National Party and the presentation of its position of "caring conservatism."

"Sue is highly regarded by the business sector, the party and the Parliamentary team alike," Mrs Shipley said.

The second speaker, Kevin Roberts, is speaking as an internationally recognised advertising executive who has chosen to become a New Zealand citizen and come and live with his family here in this country.

Mr Roberts, the worldwide chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi, will talk to the caucus about his experience in election campaigns worldwide and his strategies to get the best out of organisations.

"As a passionate New Zealander, he likes what were doing in Government as is keen to help us, just as he has already helped a Government strategy group that met during January," Mrs Shipley said.

Mr Roberts was last month named the Outstanding Advertising Agency Executive of 1998 by leading US industry magazine, Frohlinger's Marketing Report.
