Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon John Luxton has refuted allegations from Alliance Leader, Mr Anderton, of a private meeting with the global head of Saatchi and Saatchi as baseless.

"Mr Anderton's tabling of a "bogus letter" alleging that the Prime Minister and I had a secret dinner meeting with the global head of Saatchi and Saatchi to discuss advertising contracts shows a tasteless, desperate and dirty beginning to this year's election campaign by the Alliance Party," Mr Luxton said.

"I have never met with the PR consultant at whose house the meeting is alleged to have taken place. I have never been to her place. I have never had dinner with her."

"I do not believe I have ever met Mr Roberts personally before introducing myself to him at the National Party caucus last Friday," Mr Luxton continued. "I have never had dinner with him and would in no way be involved in Tourism contracts, or even with National Party contracts."

"This Alliance allegation has backfired and shows only the level of desperation in the Alliance Party."

"Frankly, it is dishonest politics," Mr Luxton concluded.
