Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford has welcomedKPMG's global survey on e-commerce, but says the results are of some concern.

The survey is reported to have found New Zealand and Australia will get left behind unless businesses stop talking about e-commerce and get on with making it happen.

"It's a matter of concern that New Zealand businesses don't seem to be picking up the opportunities that e-commerce offers," Mr Bradford said.

"This is something the Government will be taking up with business as part of the recently announced five-point plan to promote innovation and create internationally competitive products and services.

Five-point plan:

1.lifting New Zealanders' skills and New Zealand's intellectual knowledge base, and championing the success of winners;

2.better focus and direction of the Government's effort in research and development;

3.improving access to business capital (especially internationalfinance) by the knowledge based economy;

4.ensuring regulations and laws support, and not frustrate, innovation and the knowledge based economy; and

5.actively promoting success and helping build a culture supportive of innovation and enterprise.
