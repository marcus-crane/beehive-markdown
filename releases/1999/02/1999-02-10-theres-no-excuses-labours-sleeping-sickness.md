Michael Cullen is simply trying to cover up for Helen Clark's inaction over the past ten weeks, said Roger Sowry, Leader of the House.

"While Helen Clark was sitting on the slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro thinking how 'absolutely irrelevant' politics was, Cabinet was meeting and the Prime Minister was working in New Zealand's best interests."

"I fully expect to see more desperate and personal attacks from Michael Cullen over the next few weeks," Mr Sowry said. "That's his style and his track record shows it."
