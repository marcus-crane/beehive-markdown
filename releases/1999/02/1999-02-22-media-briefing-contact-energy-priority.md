As you know, the Government has decided to offer Contact Energy for sale, based on a 40% cornerstone holding, and a public float of the remaining 60% of the company.

That approach should give the company a first class combination: Excellent professional direction highly skilled in the energy business, and a widespread shareholding for the public of New Zealand.

Contact generates more than a quarter of this country's electricity. It is also one of our largest gas suppliers. The company has more than 450,000 electricity and gas customers around New Zealand.

We believe that, under new ownership, Contact will help improve efficiency in this industry, reduce energy prices, make our firms more competitive internationally, and boost consumer disposable incomes.

Contact was formed when ECNZ was originally split into two companies. It began operations on 1 February 1996. In three years, the company has evolved into an integrated and diversified energy company with assets exceeding $1.5 billion.

As you know, on 1 April this year, the Government will take a further step. ECNZ will be split again into three separate SOEs, further developing the competition in the electricity industry.

It is our aim, using competition, to deliver energy at the lowest possible cost to New Zealand users, both business and domestic.

After ECNZ is split, Contact will be our second largest electricity generator. The company already owns and operates eight generating stations-four thermal, two hydro and two geothermal.

An additional state-of-the-art gas-fired power station in South Auckland is due to be commissioned very shortly and a further co-generation station, built in partnership with the New Zealand Co-operative Dairy Company, will be commissioned later this year at Te Rapa.

Contact has the rights to about 43 per cent of the Maui field and to the production from the Tariki, Ahuroa and Waihapa gas fields in Taranaki. It has the largest number of gas retail customers in New Zealand.

The company uses gas to fire some of Contact's power stations-the others use water or geothermal steam. The remaining gas is sold to other electricity generators and wholesalers, and to residential and business customers in, for example, Auckland, Wellington, Hawke's Bay, and Manawatu.

Contact also has electricity generation investments in Australia-a 27.7 per cent ownership stake in Southern Hydro, which owns 10 hydro electric power stations in Victoria, and a minority shareholding in a joint venture to build a gas-fired power station in Queensland. It has operation and maintenance contracts for all its Australian investments.

The Annual Report in the media information kits shows the location of Contact's electricity assets and provides more details about them.

As you know, the Government opted for public floats last year when we sold our interests in Auckland International Airport and Capital Properties. Those floats were enormously successful.

Tens of thousands of Kiwi mums and dads bought shares-many for the first time. It's clear that New Zealanders put a high value on the chance to participate in floats of New Zealand SOEs.

Today, Tony and I want to explain the process by which ordinary members of the public can get off to a flying start, to explore this opportunity, and establish whether they want some of the action.

The process concerned is known as Priority Registration. We haven't used it before in this country, but it has been used very successfully in Australia, for example, as part of the public float of Telstra.

We believe it has a very significant contribution to make here, to the efficiency of our planning and administration of the sale, and also to the convenience and benefit of people thinking about buying shares.

Let me pass you over now to Tony Ryall, Minister for State Owned Enterprises, and let him explain to you briefly, just what Priority Registration is all about.
