Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal will visit New Zealand from 14 to 18 March, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"I am looking forward to the visit, as I did not get the chance to meet Princess Anne when I met the Queen and other members of the Royal  
Family at Sandringham, last month.

"Princess Anne's visit will further enhance the warm relations that New Zealanders have with the Royal Family," Mrs Shipley said.

Details of Princess Anne's visit will be announced at a later date.
