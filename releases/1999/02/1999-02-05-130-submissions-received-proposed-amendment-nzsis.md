The Intelligence and Security Committee responsible for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service legislation has received about 130 written submissions on a proposed amendment to permit NZSIS agents to enter private premises to execute interception warrants.

"The Committee has been asked to hear oral presentations on about half of the written submissions," Prime Minister and Minister in charge of the NZSIS Jenny Shipley said.

"We have set aside two days - 9 and 10 February - to hear the majority of the oral submissions and a timetable for the hearings will be available early next week.

"It is planned to hear submissions in public, unless there are extraordinary circumstances that require a closed hearing for any particular submission," Mrs Shipley concluded.
