The Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon John Luxton, has announced the membership of the independent review team that is to review border control services with the aim of streamlining border agency efficiency and service delivery.

The review team comprises Sir Ron Carter (Chair), Mr Rick Christie and Dr Peter O'Hara. "We have been fortunate to be able to retain the services of such a distinguished and experienced team to undertake this important review. Collectively, the review team has a wealth of knowledge about relevant public policy and sectoral issues. This provides the team with the broad perspective necessary to balance the range of complex issues that will need to be considered in this review", Mr Luxton said.

The review was approved by Cabinet in December 1998. Terms of reference that the independent review team are to investigate and advise on include:

options for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of border control machinery;  
the desirability and viability of amalgamating functions carried out by Government agencies which operate at the border into a single border service agency; and  
the relative costs and benefits and timeframe for implementation of recommendations by the review team agreed by Ministers for further development.  
The review will commence during February. The review team will shortly be inviting submissions from interested parties. Their report is expected to be considered by Cabinet in December 1999.
