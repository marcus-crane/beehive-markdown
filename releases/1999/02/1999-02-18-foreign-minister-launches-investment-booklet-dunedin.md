Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will take the Government's message on Foreign Direct Investment to Dunedin on Friday when he launches a booklet designed to promote investment in New Zealand.

"Foreign Direct Investment was identified as a priority for the Government when the Policies for Progress initiatives were announced late last year," Mr McKinnon said.

"This booklet, Invest in New Zealand - The Right Choice, is an important plank in that strategy."

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand had one of the world's most competitive and open business environments, which was of great appeal for international investors.

"The Otago-Southland region offers a wide range of opportunities in agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, forestry and tourism. By launching this investment booklet in Dunedin we hope to draw attention to these opportunities," he said.

Mr McKinnon will launch the booklet at a lunch at the Southern Cross hotel in Dunedin at noon on Friday, February 19. Key members of the business sector in Otago and Southland, as well as local government representatives, will attend the function.
