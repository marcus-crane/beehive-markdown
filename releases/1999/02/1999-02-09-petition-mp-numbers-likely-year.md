Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she was personally pleased that Margaret Robertson's petition on the size of Parliament had gathered enough numbers to prompt a citizen's initiated referendum.

"The issue of the size of Parliament is an important aspect of the debate on electoral law, and I welcome the fact that people will be able to have their say on it," Mrs Shipley said.

The Clerk of the House, David McGee, said today that the petition had been signed by an estimated 292,000 voters, well over the 10 percent threshold required for a referendum.

"As soon as the petition is presented to the House, officials would work on the logistics of setting in place the referendum required by the legislation," Mrs Shipley said.

She said she expected the referendum to be held this year. Under the Citizens Initiated Referenda Act, a referendum is required to be held within 12 month's of the petition's presentation to the House.

Mrs Shipley said the petition on the number of MPs was likely to be held separately from any referendum on wider questions of electoral law reform being considered by the Government. The National Party was soon to make a decision on that matter, the Prime Minister said.
