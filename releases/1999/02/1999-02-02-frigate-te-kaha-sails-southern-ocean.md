Defence Minister Max Bradford announced today that the NewZealand frigate HMNZS Te Kaha is departing this morning for the Southern Ocean to increase the surveillance effort for vesselsengaged in illegal or unregulated toothfishing.

The frigate deployment is in addition to the Air Force Orion surveillance flights into the Ross Sea region, Mr Bradford said.

"The deployment will also allow the Navy's newest frigate, Te Kaha, to familiarise itself with conditions within the furthest reaches of New Zealand's Exclusive Economic zone," he said.

"The Southern Oceans present some of the harshest conditions any warship is likely to experience. The deployment will increase the crew and vessel's capability to handle its fishery patrol work and other naval tasks in future." Mr Bradford said the decision underscored New Zealand's determination to discourage potential toothfish poachers from threatening the Ross Sea region. No illegal boats have been sighted by the Air Force Orions that have been conducting aerial surveillance during the past few weeks. The presence of Te Kaha will reinforce the message to any would-be illegal toothfishers that they are not wanted, he said.

Te Kaha departs from Auckland at 10am today, sailing for Dunedin where it will refuel on Friday, before sailing for the Ross Sea.

Mr Bradford will personally join the Te Kaha on its Christchurch-Dunedin leg.
