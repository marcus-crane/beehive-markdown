Conservation Minister Nick Smith today said that the agreement with Te Rawhiti 3B2 has been delayed. The 1400ha forested peninsula was to have been formally protected in a $379,000 agreement between the Crown and the Te Rawhiti 3B2 Trust under the Government's Nga Whenua Rahui Scheme.

"I visited Cape Brett this morning and met with iwi on the Te Rawhiti marae. Some of the kaumatua need more time to talk through the agreement. I've heard what they have to say and I've asked the Nga Whenua Rahui Committee to be available to meet with the kaumatua and the Trust to work through any concerns. This is a long term commitment and we need to get it right.

"The beauty of the area is stunning. The spectacular seascapes out towards the end of the Cape are breathtaking. Dolphins are regularly seen close to shore. In short it is a little piece of paradise."

The Nga Whenua Rahui Scheme was established by Government to work with Maori landowners to protect significant natural areas in private ownership. The Kawenata or covenant currently being negotiated in Northland represents a coming together of iwi and conservation aspirations. Once the land is protected it will remain available for the owners to use for eco-tourism enterprises. The protected land runs right up to Rakaumangamanga one of Polynesia's most sacred mountains.
