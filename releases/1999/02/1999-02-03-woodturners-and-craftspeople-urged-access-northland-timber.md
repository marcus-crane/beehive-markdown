New Zealand woodturners and craftspeople have a chance to help the flood-ravaged Northland community financially get back on its feet, says the Associate Minister for Food and Fibre, Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter is encouraging New Zealand craftspeople to consider buying some of the salvaged timber brought down in the recent Northland floods.

"Species and qualities of native timbers that are seldomly available, including kauri, rata, miro, rimu, tarairi, pukatea, rewarewa, puriri and kohekohe have surfaced following Northland's tragic floods."

"As demand for this specialty timber is quite limited in the region, I'm encouraging other New Zealanders interested in native woods to get in contact with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry with a mind to buying the salvaged timber."

"This is a win-win opportunity. Wood turners and craftspeople have a chance to access timbers they otherwise wouldn't and for Northland landowners this is a rare opportunity to boost their incomes, as they rebuild their properties and lives."

Mr Carter said a MAF official had been working in the region for the last week, assisting landowners with the milling of salvaged timber.

"There aren't huge quantities available, so I'd encourage people to get in fast. The species and quality of wood that has surfaced are quite rare and will be highly-sought after."

Mr Carter said interested people should call MAF on (025) 340 755. Local contacts will then be given out.
