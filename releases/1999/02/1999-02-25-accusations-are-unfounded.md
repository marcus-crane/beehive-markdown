The Minister of Civil Defence, Jack Elder, has rejected claims by Labour List MP Dover Samuels that the Government is ignoring the needs of the flood-damaged Hokianga.

"In his broadside of unfounded accusations Mr Samuels ignores the considerable assistance already approved by the Government," Mr Elder said. "This includes enhanced Task Force Green funding of up to $100,000 for cleanup work, $30,000 to the Mayoral Relief Fund and $15,000 for local marae.

"As I told Parliament on Tuesday the Government is committed to working with the community to ensure that appropriate resources are in place.

"Initial clearing of affected rivers has been completed to ensure they're free flowing and cleanup work is now focusing on the large amounts of debris in the upper river catchments and on river banks which present a threat from future heavy rainfall."
