Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will meet the Director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation Judge Louis Freeh, on Thursday.

"Judge Freeh's visit is very timely given that we are considering new law and order measures to stamp out violent crime in New Zealand," Mrs  
Shipley said.

"Our authorities will be able to learn more about crime fighting tactics used by American authorities.

"It will also be an invaluable opportunity to discuss strategies that address emerging drug problems."

The meeting with Judge Freeh comes on the back of a recent visit by Australian Prime Minister John Howard who provided some insight into  
Australia's strategy to fight the illegal drug trade.

"New Zealand has a much smaller drug problem than Australia, but we are mindful of the need for continued vigilance and welcomed the  
opportunity to learn about Australia's border control, and drug education and treatment programmes," Mrs Shipley said.

"It is important for our small country to learn as much as possible from the experiences of our friends in the United States and Australia.

"And we hope to share some of our experiences in a range of areas including law and order," Mrs Shipley said.
