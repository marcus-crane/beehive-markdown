Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said she was delighted to receive personal messages from United States President Bill Clinton and Australian  
Prime Minister John Howard congratulating New Zealanders on the occasion of Waitangi Day, this Saturday.

"Both messages reiterate the close relationship between New Zealand and our ANZUS counterparts, and both recognise the importance of  
Waitangi Day.

"President Clinton again indicated his commitment to more free trade, which we will build on at the APEC meetings in New Zealand this year.

"Mr Howard also reinforced our common goal of promoting more trade between our two countries and throughout our region and the rest of the  
globe.

"I am delighted to receive these messages of goodwill and friendship from the leaders of the United States and Australia on behalf of their  
people and I pass them onto the people of New Zealand.

"It is important that we continue to build on these good relationships and I look forward to hosting both leaders this year," Mrs Shipley said.
