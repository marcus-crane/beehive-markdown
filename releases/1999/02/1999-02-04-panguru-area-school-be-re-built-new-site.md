Education Minister Nick Smith today visited Panguru in Northland and announced that Panguru Area School would be rebuilt on higher land as quickly as possible to ensure the education of the pupils of the flood ravaged community was not disrupted again by such a disaster.

"The cheap option is to fix the school up where it is, but it would be short sighted. It has flooded once and it could well be flooded again. We are better to do the job properly and rebuild the school on higher land."

Panguru Area School was severely damaged by flash floods on 21 January.

Debris and silt up to one metre deep had invaded the buildings and some buildings had shifted off their foundations. All exterior areas of the buildings have been badly affected by silting. The 190 pupil school has not been able to open for the new year.

"Every day these pupils are not at school has them falling behind. The immediate answer is to secure temporary accommodation. I am pleased to confirm that space has been secured at two local marae and the school resource centre that will enable the school to re-open next Monday. Funding has been secured to meet the costs of renting the marae and to transport pupils long distance. While this gets the pupils back learning, the reality is that the buildings and split site will make it very difficult for the school to function properly."

"The Board and management of the school have expressed concern to me about the difficulty of operating the school on multiple sites. A decision has been made to clean up the least damaged of the existing buildings to the point that they can be used for the interim period until the new school is completed. It is expected that this will take 2-3 weeks."

"The long term answer lies in rebuilding the school. Two options have been explored. The building could be repaired and rebuilt on their current site for a cost of approximately $1million, or relocating the school to higher ground at a cost of approximately $2 million. I have sought advise on this from the Ministry of Education and engineers and consulted with the Board of Trustees and Principal. Today I have approved the rebuilding of the school on the new site. While the cost is more expensive, I am convinced it is the wisest investment of the taxpayer's dollar. Nor do I want to see the school face this sort of disruption again in its future."

I am also concerned about the time needed to get Panguru School back to normal. Preliminary advice from the Ministry is that the rebuilding work will take 8 months to complete. I am not satisfied with this timetable and have further instructed the Ministry to explore how the works programme can be significantly tightened. The Government wants Panguru School fully functioning as quickly as physically possible."
