The Government will be hosting a series of regional business forums around New Zealand between March and May to help businesses prosper, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

"The forums, announced by the Prime Minister in her statement to Parliament, will showcase some of the most successful and innovative players in New Zealand business today.

"The forums will be an opportunity for business people to learn and be inspired, and to forge new relationships and share ideas. v "We want to help New Zealand businesses lift their game and this desire is reflected in our five-point plan for accelerating business growth, which was announced last week.

"We wish to discuss this with business and get their feedback on it."

Mr Bradford, also Minister for Tertiary Education, said it is crucial for New Zealand to have an education system that is high quality, relevant and responsive to our rapidly changing world. v "We must be able to lift New Zealanders' skills and our intellectual knowledge base. Therefore, it is important that the business and tertiary education sector work together in designing the courses, the programmes and actions needed for the future.

"In partnership with the Government, this will help us to set clear goals and strategies that will bring New Zealand increased growth and success," Mr Bradford said.
