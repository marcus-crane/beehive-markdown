The discovery of Ecstasy at Auckland International Airport yesterday highlights the need for the Customs Service to maintain a vigilant watch at the border, says the Associate Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon David Carter.

Mr Carter said concerns raised this week over the illicit drug surfacing in New Zealand, including the case at Auckland's Mangere College, were being addressed by the Customs Service.

"We already have programmes in place which concentrate on gathering intelligence on the hard drug market offshore."

"We're working with overseas agencies and have our own Customs officers posted offshore to track the movement of these drugs. Customs have also targeted organised crime groups who are common traffickers of illicit drugs."

"The Prime Minister has also announced this week that Customs will be an integral part of the Government's soon to be announced campaign to prevent the expansion of a hard drugs market in New Zealand."

"The Government will be announcing this programme shortly, which will include health promotion, assessment and treatment services and enforcement initiatives."
