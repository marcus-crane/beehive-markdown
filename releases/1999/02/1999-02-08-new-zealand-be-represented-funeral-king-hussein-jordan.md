Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says New Zealand will be represented at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan.

New Zealand's Ambassador to Jordan, Ian Kennedy, who is based in Turkey, and New Zealand's Honorary Consul in Jordan, Maurice Khalaf,  
will represent New Zealand at the State Funeral later today.

Mrs Shipley says New Zealanders will be saddened at the loss of a champion of peace in the Middle East.

"King Hussein was a man of great courage and vision. He was a source of stability and leadership for his people and region over many  
decades.

"King Hussein's commitment to peace was underlined most recently when in the midst of cancer treatment he made a crucial contribution to  
persuading Palestine's Chairman Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the provisions of the Wye River agreement  
that lays the foundations for peace in the region.

"He leaves a legacy of service and commitment to peace that is unparalleled in the region."

A formal message of condolence to the new King, Abdullah, the Jordanian Royal Family and the people of Jordan is being sent on behalf of New  
Zealand by the Governor General, Sir Michael Hardie Boys.

The New Zealand Government will fly flags at half mast tomorrow in honour of the late King.
