About 100 APEC overseas visitors will experience the attractions of the Wairarapa when they visit for the day on Sunday 7 February.

The visitors, attending the APEC Senior Officials Meeting in Wellington, will spend the day in Masterton and Martinborough. Their itinerary includes an interesting variety of cultural and tourist activities and a taste of the Wairarapa's world-renowned wines.

Wairarapa MP Wyatt Creech said the excursion was a chance for the region to promote itself to a group of influential visitors.

'For most of these delegates, this is their first visit to New Zealand, let alone to the Wairarapa,' Mr Creech said. 'They are senior officials from all 20 of the APEC member economies around the Asia-Pacific region. This is a wonderful opportunity for our region to promote itself to a group of influential international visitors.

'This is yet another chance to showcase the Wairarapa on the world stage. The exposure will help draw attention to the wide range of unique attractions in our region," Mr Creech said.

The visitors will receive a Maori welcome at Masterton Railway Station before visiting Rathkeale College for lunch and entertainment. They will travel to Martinborough in the afternoon, spending time at Stuart Macleod's Beef and Horse Farm for a farm display and a dressage display from top equestrian Tinks Pottinger. Finally, they will visit Te Kairanga winery before returning to Wellington.

The APEC Senior Officials Meeting, the first of three in New Zealand during 1999, is on in Wellington from 1 - 10 February.
