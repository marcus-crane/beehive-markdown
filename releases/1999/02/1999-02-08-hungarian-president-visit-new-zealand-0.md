Hungarian President Dr Arpad Göncz will make a four-day state visit to New Zealand from February 22-25, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced today.

Dr Göncz will hold talks with Mrs Shipley and will also call on the Governor-General, Sir Michael Hardie Boys, and the Maori Queen, Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

The President, who will be accompanied by his Minister of Agriculture and a 23-strong business delegation, will meet the Hungarian communities in Auckland and Wellington and launch a Hungarian Trade Seminar in Auckland.

"It is 25 years since New Zealand established diplomatic relations with Hungary and Dr Göncz's visit demonstrates Hungary's growing interest in New Zealand and our region," Mrs Shipley said.

"The visit presents an ideal opportunity to cement our relationship and I look forward to exchanging views on developments in the Asia-Pacific and Central Europe, and expanding trade and economic ties."

Mrs Shipley said that although New Zealand's trade with Hungary was not large at present, Hungary was negotiating to join the European Union, and as its economy developed, so would opportunities for exporters to develop new markets there.
