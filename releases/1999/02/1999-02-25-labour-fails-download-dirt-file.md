Finance Minister Bill English said today he was still waiting to see the 'pile of papers' that Labour's Trevor Mallard claimed to have on him.

"Labour is running a calculated campaign of personal denigration, led by Helen Clark.

"In the House yesterday Trevor Mallard said he had a pile of paper and that my turn would come. If Mr Mallard wants to threaten me then I challenge him to produce these papers so that Parliament can test the credibility of his threats.

"So far Mr Mallard has not produced any of these papers," said Mr English.
