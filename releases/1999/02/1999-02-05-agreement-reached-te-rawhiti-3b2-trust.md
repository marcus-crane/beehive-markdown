Conservation Minister Nick Smith today announced a landmark conservation achievement at Cape Brett on Northland's East Coast. The 1400ha forested peninsula has been formally protected in a $379,000 agreement between the Crown and the Te Rawhiti 3B2 Trust under the Government's Nga Whenua Rahui Scheme.

"In this deal everyone wins. The forests are protected in perpetuity and restored to their full glory, but ownership and control of the land stays with Maori landowners. Sacred and historic sites are also protected. This beautiful and inspirational place has been saved for future generations."

The Nga Whenua Rahui Scheme was established by Government to work with Maori landowners to protect significant natural areas in private ownership. This is the largest Kawenata or covenant negotiated in Northland and represents a coming together of iwi and conservation aspirations.

Trust manager Richard Witihira said he was not only delighted the land was now protected, but also that it remained available for the owners to use for eco-tourism enterprises. He said the protected land runs right up to Rakaumangamanga one of Polynesia's most sacred mountains.

" Rakaumangamanga is very sacred and very important. It's the pivotal point of the Polynesian Triangle from Hawaiiki through to Rapuni. Oral history tells us that people gathered here at the time of Kupe and the great migration."

Today the Minister signed the Covenant on behalf of the Crown along with representatives of the Te Rawhiti 3B2 Trust Board and the hapu of Ngati Kuta and Patukeha.

"I welcome the plans of the owners to try and restore the land to the state it was in when their ancestors first arrived. DoC will be there to advise and assist wherever they are needed."

Future plans also include acquiring Maori Reserve status for the land, maintaining and developing the interpretive scenic and historic walkway, and establishing other eco-tourism enterprises.
