The Government is giving $20,000 to the Franklin District Council's Mayoral Relief Fund to assist victims of last month's flash flood in Pukekohe, the Minister of Civil Defence, Jack Elder announced today.

Mr Elder said the Council had managed the emergency, which was of similar scale to the Far North flooding, in exemplary fashion. The Council decided a declaration of civil defence emergency was unnecessary.

"There's a high level of private insurance and the council estimates the bulk of the estimated $2 million worth of damage will be met by existing arrangements," Mr Elder said. "But at the community level there are some 140 people requiring ongoing assistance.

"When I met the Mayor just over a week ago she specifically requested a donation of $20,000.

"The Government is pleased to oblige, particularly in recognition of the way the council dealt with the emergency."
