Criminals who violate the sanctuary of the home will face tougher jail sentences, Justice Minister Tony Ryall said today.

"The Government understands the level of public concern about this issue. It's vital we send a strong signal that home invasions will not be tolerated," Mr Ryall said.

The Government decision to take a stronger line against this type of crime will increase the current maximum sentences for home-invasion type offences by three to five years. In home invasion cases where there is a conviction for murder, the courts will be given greater discretion to impose longer non-parole periods.

The new penalties apply to cases where there has been an unlawful entry into a private dwelling where there is any element of violence.

Mr Ryall said the new sentences underline the Government's view that the home should be a place of refuge, protected by the law.

"Our law now recognises our homes are our castles. It is a long held right that we should be safe in our own homes and we will not tolerate those who violate this security."

Mr Ryall said not only will the tougher penalties be a deterrent to offenders, but they will offer a clear message to the courts that the community takes this sort of crime extremely seriously and expects appropriate sentences to be imposed. Legislation bringing in the new penalties will be introduced shortly.
