Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford has welcomed the Commerce Commission's decision to decline Auckland International Airport's application for an exemption to the Electricity Industry Reform Act.

The Commission yesterday announced that it was not convinced that the purposes of the Act would be served if Auckland International Airport Limited was permitted to retain involvement in both electricity line and supply businesses.

"I am pleased to see the Commerce Commission has taken a view in line with the Government's competition policy," Mr Bradford said.
