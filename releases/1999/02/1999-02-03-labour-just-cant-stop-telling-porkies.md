"Labour's wild spending promises and their attempt at a moderate tax policy just don't add up," said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

"Late last year Labour began promising all things to all people in an attempt to hoodwink voters into believing they had solutions to social problems."

"But it's about time Labour realised you can only spend each dollar once - their promises simply don't tally with their finances."

"Anybody who believes they can carry out their health, housing, welfare and education promises with a $330 million tax increase should stand well clear of the window.... they're likely to be hit by a flying pig."

Mr Sowry has launched his own version of Labour's election year logo - with a flying pig superimposed over the Labour name.
