The Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control, Hon John Luxton, has said that the implementation date of the new Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act will be announced in late April..

"The commencement of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act (ACVM) is tied to the start of the hazardous substances part of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (HSNO)," Mr Luxton said.

It is expected that a formal start-up date for the new hazardous substances regime will be announced in mid April.

"MAF will make an announcement on the commencement of the ACVM Act shortly after that," Mr Luxton said.

Mr Luxton said that in the meantime MAF is continuing to communicate and consult with industry over the process for the implementation of the ACVM Act.
