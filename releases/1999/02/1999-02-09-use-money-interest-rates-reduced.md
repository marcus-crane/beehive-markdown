Revenue Minister Bill English said today that the use of money interest rates payable on underpayments and overpayments of tax and duties had been reduced.

The new rates, which would apply from 8 March 1999, would be 10.59% for underpayments and 3.38% for overpayments. They replaced the current rates of 12.48% for underpayments and 4.79% for overpayments.

Use of money interest rates were reviewed regularly to ensure they were consistent with market interest rates. The new rates reflected the recent downward movement of market interest rates, said Mr English.
