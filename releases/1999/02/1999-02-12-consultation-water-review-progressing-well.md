Consultation with local authorities on the water review announced last year is progressing well, Enterprise and Commerce MinisterMax Bradford said today.

The long term review of water services, announced in November last year, is being carried out to ensure safe, secure and efficient supply.

"The Government believes the ownership of local authority water and wastewater infrastructure is a matter for local communities to decide and an open consultation process is now well underway," Mr Bradford said.

The discussions with Local Government New Zealand, and local authorities to date have been constructive in assisting the review team in identifying and gaining a thorough understanding of the key issues.
