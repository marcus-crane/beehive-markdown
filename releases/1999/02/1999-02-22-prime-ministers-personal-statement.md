Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she was determined to see that the tourism industry in New Zealand did not suffer from the current  
political row.

"On Friday last week I directed the relevant Ministers to disclose all the documentation, including the appropriate correspondence relating to the  
current New Zealand Tourism Board debate, other than that which is commercially sensitive.

"This is underway and Ministers will be releasing the material as it becomes available.

"Having asked that all material be released, documents have emerged that require a definitive response on my part.

"I again confirm today that I did not discuss any matter to do with the New Zealand Tourism Board contract with Saatchi and Saatchi or any other  
Government business at dinner with Kevin Roberts on Thursday 31 August last year.

"I made this clear in Parliament last week. I will repeat these facts in a personal statement to the House tomorrow (Tuesday).

"At dinner on 31 August we did discuss my party, its performance and that of other political parties. We talked about his ideas on peak  
performance and how they could be applied to my work," Mrs Shipley said.

"Mr Roberts met me as an individual who wanted to offer his motivational services to help my team and myself become better communicators  
and be more effective," Mrs Shipley said.

"On the morning after the dinner Mr Roberts met with myself and a small group of senior Ministers to talk about the same message.

"Neither prior to the meeting when I greeted Mr Roberts in my office, nor at the meeting, was there any discussion of the contract between the  
Tourism Board and Saatchi and Saatchi.

"There was discussion in passing about the contents of a speech that Kevin Roberts had made on 28 August which had received widespread  
media coverage and was the source of some stimulating public debate. Some ideas in the speech concerning matters including the flag and the  
name of the North and South Islands had caught the attention and imagination of the MPs present. Kevin Roberts indicated they were some of a  
number of ideas that he was working on. No formal support was sought for these ideas, nor was any given.

"My Government is very strict in adhering to rules that make it clear agencies of the Crown - in this case, the Tourism Board - are totally  
responsible for making decisions on proposals and entering in to contracts with any outside organisations.

"Having looked at this matter closely, I believe these rules have been strictly adhered to in this case," Mrs Shipley concluded.
