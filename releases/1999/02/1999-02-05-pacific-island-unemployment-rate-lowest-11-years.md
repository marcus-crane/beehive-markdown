"The latest unemployment figures contain some good news coming out of Pacific Island communities in New Zealand," said Associate Minister of Social Services, Work and Income Peter McCardle.

The unemployment rate for Pacific Island people is now at an 11-year low. It has fallen from 15.4 per cent to 13.3 per cent.

"Clearly this rate is still too high and we must do better, but the trend is positive," Mr McCardle said.

"Labour has a dreadful record in providing jobs for Polynesian New Zealanders. Under the last Labour Government their unemployment rate rose from 8 per cent to 22 per cent. Just disgraceful.

"In contrast, the latest figures show there are 66,400 Polynesian people now in the workforce, which is the second-highest total ever.

"In the December quarter, around 2,000 more Pacific Island jobseekers got work, and the number unemployed fell by 1,500.

"This Government is targeting disadvantaged jobseekers, and that approach is succeeding in getting more people in the Polynesian community into work," Mr McCardle said.
