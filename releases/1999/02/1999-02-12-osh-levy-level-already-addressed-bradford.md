The Minister responsible for OSH (Occupational Safety and Health), Max Bradford, says Labour's industrial relations spokesperson should be well aware that the Government has already addressed the level of the HSE (health and safety in employment) levy.

Mr Bradford was commenting on Labour's statement today about the levy.

"Last year, in a written Parliamentary question, I advised Labour's industrial relations spokesperson that the growth in the economy under this Government has meant that the level of revenue has been higher than originally forecast, and the Government was addressing this issue. The intention has been that over time the revenue from the levy and the amount appropriate to the Labour Vote will equate.

"My comments stand today, and the matter will be dealt with in this year's Budget," Mr Bradford said.
