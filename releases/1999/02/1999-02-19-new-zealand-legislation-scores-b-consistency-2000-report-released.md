Justice Minister Tony Ryall today released the Human Rights Commission's "Consistency 2000" report, part of an ongoing process to address discriminatory conflicts in Acts and regulations.

The report shows New Zealand's laws substantially in compliance with the Human Rights Act. The report covers some 20 batches of legislation out of 300 batches.

"While the report identifies several areas where Parliament can improve its law making, it also acknowledges the progress made in complying with the Act," Tony Ryall said.

"The Government has agreed that from 1 January 2000 all its policies, practices and regulations will not unlawfully discriminate on any grounds in the Human Rights Act. Department Chief Executives will take responsibility to prepare updates of laws for compliance when such laws are amended.

"We should acknowledge the Chief Commissioner's encouragement for Parliament to move from B+ to A.

"I would also thank the Commission for the work they have done in preparing this report".
