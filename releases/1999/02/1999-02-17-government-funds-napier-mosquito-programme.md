Hon John Luxton, Minister for Food, Fibre, Biosecurity and Border Control has reiterated the Government's commitment to the mosquito programme in Napier with funding of nearly one million dollars.

Cabinet has agreed to spend an extra $917,000 to assist agencies to fund the $2.09 million programme in an attempt to eradicate Aedes camptorhynchus (southern saltmarsh mosquito) from the Napier area through controlled spraying of Bti, a larvacidal agent. The funding is until 30 April and the future of the programme will be reviewed then.

"The Government is pleased with the results to date from the mosquito spray operation. It appears it may be possible to eradicate the saltmarsh mosquito entirely and this funding shows the Government's commitment to achieving this," Mr Luxton said.

"While the core reason for the programme is to prevent disease, such as Ross River Virus disease, being introduced into New Zealand, other benefits include stopping the vicious biting from this mosquito, avoiding the need for ongoing control measures and preventing the mosquito from becoming established in other areas around the country, " said Mr Luxton.

The spray operation, which started last month, has cost $618,000 to date. This has been funded by a number of agencies, including the Ministry of Health, the Health Funding Authority, Department of Conservation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

"Special mention needs to be made of the work by Healthcare Hawkes Bay which is managing the programme and the local authorities in the region who have provided support and advice," Mr Luxton said.

"There is no doubt that the programme to contain the mosquito requires ongoing spraying as determined by the results of the regular monitoring and surveillance of both the breeding areas and the adult traps."

While no cases of Ross River Virus disease have been reported, people are urged to take preventative steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

Mosquitoes are most active around dawn, late afternoon and just after dusk. Screening open doors and windows, using insect sprays or mosquito coils indoors, covering exposed skin with clothing, and using a repellent when outdoors will reduce the possibility of being bitten by any mosquito.

"New Zealand must remain vigilant to the threat from exotic mosquitoes. There are over 200 different varieties in Australia alone. Fortunately, until now, New Zealand only has 15 species but this discovery in Hawke's Bay is a reminder of how vulnerable we are and the importance of our national surveillance programme," concluded Mr Luxton.
