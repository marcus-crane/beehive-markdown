Contact Energy Limited, whose assets were originally part of ECNZ, began operations as a separate commercial entity on 1 February 1996, as a result of Government policies designed to foster competition in the electricity industry.

Contact Energy, currently a State Owned Enterprise, is now one of New Zealand's largest energy companies. It generates more than a quarter of the nation's electricity, is one of our largest gas suppliers and has about 450,000 gas and electricity customers.

From 1 April 1999, when ECNZ has been further split into three new generating companies, Contact will be New Zealand's second largest electricity generator.

Contact already owns and operates eight power stations in New Zealand - four thermal, two hydro and two geothermal. A state-of-the-art gas-fired power station in South Auckland is due to be commissioned in the first quarter of this year and a further co-generation station in partnership with the New Zealand Co-operative Dairy Company will be commissioned later this year at Te Rapa.

Contact's power stations use New Zealand's three main energy sources: natural gas, water and geothermal steam.

owns the rights to about 43% of the production from the Maui gas field. It also owns rights to the production from the Tariki, Ahuroa and Waihapa gas fields in Taranaki. The gas is used to fire some of Contact's power stations, is sold on long-term contracts to other electricity generators and wholesalers, and directly to Contact's gas customers. Contact is New Zealand's largest gas retailer.

Contact has some 345,000 electricity and 105,000 gas customers around New Zealand, as a result of expanding its activities last year. Contact purchased eight retail power companies and a significant proportion of the customer base of New Zealand's largest gas retailer, Enerco.

Contact has investments in Australia. It has a 27.7% ownership stake in Southern Hydro which owns 10 hydro electric power stations in Victoria, and is a minority shareholder in a joint venture to build a power station in Queensland. It has operation and maintenance contracts for both investments.

Contact's total assets exceed $1.5 billion and, for the financial year ended 30 September 1998, total revenues exceeded $480 million. Contact paid dividends to its shareholder, the Government, of $47 million and $48 million in the last two financial years.
