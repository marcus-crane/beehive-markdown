Food and Fibre Minister, Hon John Luxton will visit drought parched Otago tomorrow and will meet local farmers and others affected to discuss the drought situation.

Papers released by Mr Luxton yesterday show that while things have improved in the North Island, the situation in Canterbury, Otago and parts of Southland continues to worsen.

"It is important for me to see the drought first-hand, listen directly to farmers, and see how the government can assist," Mr Luxton said.

Government has received an application for assistance from the Otago Drought Committee and will respond to that shortly.

Otago MP Gavan Herlihy and Eric Roy, MP will accompany Mr Luxton to farms in Strath Taieri and Maniototo.

Note:  
At 11.00am Mr Luxton will drive to Strath Taieri.  
At 11.50am he will talk with farmers at the property of Mr Bevan Dowling, Hyde.  
He will then travel to Patearoa in Maniototo and talk with farmers at the property of Mr Tim Crutchley - meeting scheduled to commence at 1.05pm.
