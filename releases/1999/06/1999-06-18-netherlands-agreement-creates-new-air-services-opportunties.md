'The Netherlands is New Zealand's newest air services partner', the Minister of Transport, Hon Maurice Williamson, announced today.

The recently negotiated air services agreement creates additional trade and tourism opportunities between New Zealand and the Netherlands.

The agreement allows the designated airlines of each country to offer up to a daily service on a code-share basis, including with third-country airlines. Code-sharing is where one airline sells seats under its own name on the aircraft of another airline.

"Individual airlines will have the freedom to establish their own prices and to vary those prices without needing the approval of the authorities in each country.

"The pricing freedom means that airlines will have the maximum flexibility to develop and implement innovative and competitive prices, in line with market conditions."

This new agreement is the latest in a recent series that has seen a substantial broadening of New Zealand's bilateral air services links with Europe.

In the last year agreements have also been negotiated with Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

In addition, Air Services Agreements are in place with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Luxembourg and Russia.

Around 70,000 people of Dutch origin live in New Zealand.

In the past year over 23,000 people traveled between the two countries, many of them visiting friends and relatives.

'These arrangements provide a solid base for development of direct air links between New Zealand and the Netherlands, enhancing service options for travelers', said Mr Williamson.

The Agreement will be applied provisionally pending signature and the conclusion of constitutional requirements.
