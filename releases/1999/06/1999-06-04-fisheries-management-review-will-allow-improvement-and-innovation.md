Food and Fibre Minister John Luxton today announced the 1999 annual review of fishery management measures.

"This year the annual review will focus on a select number of proposals. This allows more resources to be focused on the passing of legislation, devolution of fisheries services and pressing sustainability issues."

The high priority activities are:

- passing of legislative amendments to the Fisheries Act 1996
- devolution of registry services
- development of policy frameworks relating to exploratory fishing, associated dependent species, non-QMS management, and fisheries plans
- policy development in aquaculture, co-management and recreational rights
- concluding the Fisheries Act 1996 implementation project
- further development of standards and specifications for stakeholder contracted research.

"The next 12-18 months will be an important time for the development of fisheries reforms that build on the success of the quota management system and ensure continued innovation in fisheries management."

"It is important that all stakeholders take the opportunity to participate in the development of new legislation and policies. As part of this process, the Ministry of Fisheries will concentrate on resolving a number of pressing policy issues rather than on piecemeal changes to the existing framework," Mr Luxton said.

Management issues to be reviewed in the 1999 sustainability round are:

- those fishstocks that have urgent sustainability concerns;
- the effects of fishing methods in the Spirits Bay area;
- the need for a reduction in inter-tidal shellfish bag limits in areas of the Auckland Fishery Management Area beyond metropolitan Auckland;
- a review of conversion factors and deemed values where there is significant new information suggesting adjustment is necessary.

Stakeholders with an interest in the issues subject to this year's review have been written to and invited to take part in the review of the above management measures and of the proposals they wished to be consulted on. They have until June 10 to respond.

"I also intend to consult with iwi, other stakeholder organisations and individuals representative of interest groups who have an interest in the stock or area concerned.

"While this year's review may create some short term difficulties for some stakeholders, these will be outweighed by the significant benefits that will accrue for all stakeholders long term," Mr Luxton concluded.
