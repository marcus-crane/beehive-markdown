Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of two new members to the board of Healthcare Otago Ltd.

Maryanne Macpherson, succeeds former Board member Duncan Garvan, and Murray Valentine, fills the vacancy left by former Board member Ross Smith who retired on 31 May 1999.

Maryanne Macpherson is the current Chair of Southern Health Ltd. In addition to her Hospital and Healthcare Service experience, she has a background in farming and rural organisations.

"Ms Macpherson has been a strong advocate for good health delivery in Southland and will add this perspective to the Healthcare Otago Board. It is also intended to cross-appoint the Chair of Healthcare Otago to the Southern Board," Mr Creech said.

Murray Valentine is one of Otago's prominent company directors as well as being a partner in a Dunedin accounting firm. He was a foundation director of Television New Zealand Ltd.

"Mr Valentine will add considerable strength to the Board in the area of corporate finance."

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to the Board of Healthcare Otago were being staggered, as with all the Hospital and Healthcare Companies, to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.

Mr Creech thanked retiring board member Duncan Garvan for his contribution to Healthcare Otago.
