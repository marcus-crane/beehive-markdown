Transport Minister Maurice Williamson has warned serious traffic offenders to stay off the roads as Queens Birthday weekend approaches or face having their car impounded or licence suspended under the tough new driving laws.

"We've had a record low road toll for May and I hope this will continue into June."

Mr Williamson hoped the new licence suspension and vehicle impoundment laws would keep serious offenders off the roads as these drivers were responsible for about 10 percent of road deaths.

"Hundreds of cars have been impounded and licenses suspended already since the new regime kicked off on May 3 and reports show drivers from all walks of life have been responsible.

"The driver of a BMW in East Auckland recently bore the brunt of the new law, having his licence suspended instantly for driving more than 50km/h above the speed limit as well as having a breath alcohol level over twice the legal limit."

Mr Williamson said the immediate identification of drivers with the new photo licence was responsible for the success of the new policy and was confident this would contribute to lowering the road toll.

"I'd like to remind all motorists to take care now that winter conditions seem to be with us, particularly on bends and slowing down for wet and slippery conditions."
