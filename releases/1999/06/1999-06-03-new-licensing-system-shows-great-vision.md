The new driver licensing system is showing great vision in more ways than one, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

He was referring to the new system where drivers who fail an eye screening check when applying for or upgrading their license must get an examination from an optometrist.

"In the first month of the system we've already found that more than 1000 drivers have returned from an optometrist to complete their licence transactions with glasses."

"These people wouldn't have known they needed glasses under the old system and would have continued to drive."

Mr Williamson said this was another huge benefit of the new system and one that must ultimately save lives.

"It's hard to believe these figures and the number of people who would have been driving without adequate vision if we hadn't made the change.

"If you can't see properly, you can't drive safely. But it's great to see so many people are able to get behind a wheel, once their vision has been corrected."

Before the change, eyesight was only checked when an applicant first applied for a licence and then again when they reached the age of 71.
