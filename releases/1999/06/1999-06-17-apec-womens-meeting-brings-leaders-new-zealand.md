"The Women in APEC meeting next week will be one of the most exciting and colourful on the APEC calender, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today

"This year's theme centres on and celebrates women's contribution to economic prosperity, in the 21 countries that comprise the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation.

"APEC is all about freeing up trade to create jobs, and that is a vital concern to women in all the economies.

"Women often feel the effects of economic change very keenly, so it is vital they have opportunities to put their priorities and insights into the APEC process," Mrs Shipley said.

"We have been delighted at the calibre of women leaders from New Zealand and other countries who are keen to take part in the meeting."

The Women in APEC meeting, entitled Our Contribution to Economic Prosperity, is the second major meeting during New Zealand 's year as Chair of APEC. It will be held in Wellington from Sunday 20 to Wednesday 23 June.

"Laura Liswood, founder of the Harvard University-based Council of Women World Leaders, has been confirmed as a keynote speaker, along with our own successful children's book publishing entrepreneur, Wendy Pye.

"One of the most beneficial aspects of the meeting will be the opportunity for particularly New Zealand women to network with their peers. One part of the meeting is solely to hear other women's stories about how they were so successful.

"Statistics show that women start small businesses at a faster rate and with greater success than do men. Their small businesses employ more people and with less risk than their male counterparts.

"In short, women with small or medium sized businesses are the powerhouse of economic growth and prosperity. This contribution has been absolutely critical in helping lead the APEC region out of its recent economic crisis."

"Panel discussions such as 'Unlocking unlimited potential for women through sporting leadership' bring a uniquely New Zealand perspective to the meeting.

The meeting has attracted a range of interesting speakers from New Zealand, including: Dr Helen Anderson Chief Scientific Adviser for the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology; Jo Brosnahan, Chief Executive of Auckland Regional Council; Diana Crossan, AMP; Mai Chen - Chen & Palmer; Peri Drysdale; Suzanne Snively; Denise L'Estrange Corbet - World clothing; Anne Knowles Deputy Chief Executive New Zealand Employers Federation; Dame Georgina Kirby; June Jackson Chief Executive of the Manukau Urban Maori Authority; Pamela Jefferies, Chief Human Rights Commissioner; Gaelle Deighton - Chief Executive of Manukau Enterprise and Employment Trust; Dr Ellen Forch Manager of Environmental Monitoring Manager with the Hawkes Bay Regional Council.

Overseas speakers include: Sheryl Kennedy, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada; Diana Abruzzi, International Women's Federation of Commerce and Industry, Australia; Nadezhda Bikalova a Russian economist; Dr Shin-Yuan Lai, Director of International Affairs at the Institute of Economic Research in Chinese Taipei; Dr Lorraine Corner (Australia), Regional Programme Advisor for UNIFEM East and Southeast Asia; Dr Fanny Cheung, OBE, Chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong; Kate Clemans, director of C&M International, a Washington-based international trade consulting firm; Miranda Goeltom, Managing Director, Bank of Indonesia; Professor Kuniko Inoguchi (Japan), professor of political science; Sung-Joo Kim - President and Chief Executive of Sung-Joo International, a luxury retail store chain in Korea.

"It will be a fascinating meeting," said Mrs Shipley.

Discussion from the meeting will feed into the APEC Trade Ministers meeting at the end of June, and also to the APEC Leaders meeting in Auckland in September.
