Hon Marie Hasler, Minister Responsible for RNZ, says she has full confidence in the Board of Radio New Zealand and  
opposition calls for the board to resign are disgraceful.

"Labour Leader Helen Clark's attempts to use political bullying and to interfere with the normal function of the RNZ Board  
is quite scandalous for a would-be political leader," Ms Hasler said.

Describing Helen Clark's damaging personal comments about board member Richard Rayner as "shabby", Ms Hasler said  
the opposition leader had produced no evidence whatsoever to justify calling for any board member to resign.

"My main concern is that the board complies with the RNZ Charter, its constitution, and the RNZ Act and that the  
organisation is financially viable and sustainable.

"I believe the existing board takes its duties seriously and that board members have worked hard and conscientiously to  
make RNZ more efficient and more popular than ever before, without compromising quality.

"RNZ's sheer ratings' success proves this is the case."
