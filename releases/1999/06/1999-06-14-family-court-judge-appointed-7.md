The Attorney-General, Rt Hon Sir Douglas Graham, has announced the appointment of New Plymouth barrister and solicitor Noel Anthony Walsh as a Family Court Judge.

Judge Walsh will be sworn in at New Plymouth District Court on Friday 23 July and will sit in Invercargill from 23 August 1999.

Born in Greymouth, Judge Walsh graduated from the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1974 and was admitted to the Bar the same year. He has been a partner in the firm of Govett Quilliam since 1979.

Judge Walsh has been involved in general litigation work, initially as Assistant Crown Prosecutor, but with an emphasis on family law, since 1987. He is a former Vice President and President of the Taranaki District Law Society and a former member of the NZ Law Society Council. He was recently appointed to the NZLS Family Law Section's Domestic Violence Committee. For many years he has been involved with community groups, including Relationship Services and the New Plymouth Citizens' Advice Bureau.

Judge Walsh is aged 47, married with three children.
