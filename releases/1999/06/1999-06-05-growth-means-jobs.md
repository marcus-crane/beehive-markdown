The substantial reduction in unemployment from 7.7% to 7.2% for the March quarter confirms the rapid turnaround in the New Zealand economy, Treasurer Bill Birch said today.

"The result yet again shows the very close relationship between growth and jobs.

"Recent business confidence and consumer confidence surveys have clearly pointed to a robust recovery in economic growth and the rise in employment and fall in unemployment in the March quarter confirms this.

"The rapid improvement in unemployment also points to the benefits of a flexible labour market, which has ensured that economic growth is quickly translated into jobs. Without flexible labour markets firms would not be able to rapidly respond to their changing economic conditions and fewer jobs would be created." Mr Birch said the improving economic outlook provides a very strong foundation for this years Budget.
