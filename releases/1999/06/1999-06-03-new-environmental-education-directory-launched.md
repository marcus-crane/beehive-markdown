Associate Minister for the Environment, Hon Marie Hasler, launches the new Environmental Education Directory of New Zealand today at Wellington Zoo's Archibald Centre.

"This directory is a vital way of keeping better informed about what various individuals and organisations are doing in the environmental education field," Ms Hasler said.

"Completion of the directory is a significant step in the implementation of the 1998 National Strategy for Environmental Education. This strategy highlights the need for integration and co-ordination of all environmental education activities."

Ms Hasler said the printed directory and a special directory website will be available from 30 June. Topics include air, energy, biodiversity, wastes and coasts.

Activity packs, contacts, places to visit, courses and programmes, exhibitions, resource kits, booklets/leaflets/handbooks, video/audiotapes, computer resources, magazines/newsletters and poster packs are all featured.

The directory has been funded by the Sustainable Management Fund, administered by the Ministry for the Environment. The fund, established in 1995, aims to support projects of national and community benefit.
