The APEC Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade will mark the start of Auckland’s participation in APEC New Zealand 99, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

The Trade Ministers' Meeting will be held at the Aotea Centre, bringing Trade Ministers from the 21 APEC member economies to the city. Dr Smith will chair the meeting.

While the official meeting runs over 29 and 30 June, other APEC 99 events will surround it. These include the:

- APEC Women Leaders’ Network Meeting, 20-23 June (Wellington)
- APEC Business Symposium, 24-26 June
- APEC Student Company Achievers’ Forum, 25-29 June
- Informal APEC Senior Officials’ Meeting, 27 June
- APEC Seminar - Bridging the Gap: Explaining Trade and Investment Liberalisation, 28 June

"As with all APEC 99 events this year, the meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade will have a strong business component," said Dr Smith.

“Formal Ministerial meetings will be combined with more relaxed sessions involving private sector representatives from throughout the APEC region. The meetings with business people from each economy will not involve set-piece speeches or formal agendas. They will encourage frank discussions of APEC's work, and how we can improve our interaction with the private sector to enhance opportunities for business within the APEC region.

“As was evident at the APEC Small and Medium Enterprises Meeting in Christchurch recently, this engagement was valuable both for Ministers and the business community.

A Ministerial Retreat will also be held during the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade at Whangaparoa’s Gulf Harbour Country Club on the afternoon of 29 June. Dr Smith and the visiting Trade Ministers will travel to Whangaparoa by boat, before continuing discussions at the Gulf Harbour Country Club.

"The visiting Ministers are only here for a few days, and the retreat at the Gulf Harbour Country Club, the venue of the recent World Cup of Golf, provides an excellent opportunity to showcase a glimpse of New Zealand's unique beauty," said Dr Smith.

The Trade Ministers' Meeting is the second ministerial level meeting of APEC 99, following the April Small and Medium Enterprises Ministers’ Meeting. APEC Foreign and Trade Ministers will meet jointly at the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Auckland in September, immediately prior to the Leaders’ Meeting.
