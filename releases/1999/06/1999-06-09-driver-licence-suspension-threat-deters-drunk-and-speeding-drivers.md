The threat of having driver licenses suspended under the tough new driving laws has dramatically reduced the amount of heavily drunk and speeding drivers stopped by police, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

"We've found that 293 drivers have had their licenses suspended since May 3, but offences that now warrant suspension historically total over 11 000 each year," said Mr Williamson.

"Although it's early days, that shows a huge decline in this type of offending."

Licenses are automatically suspended by police at the roadside from drivers who either have a breath or blood alcohol level of more than twice the legal limit, drive more than 50km/h above the speed limit or refuse to provide a blood sample to police.

"The whole aim of the new driver licensing regime was to get serious traffic offenders off the roads, and in the first five weeks we're already seeing the results we wanted.

"The major advantages of roadside licence suspensions are that they are certain, swift and severe in their application. These are the three essential elements that research shows are required to maximise deterrence, and these figures verify that research."

Mr Williamson said police were going about their job as they always had and the dramatic results must be due to serious offenders being deterred by the threat of having their licence suspended.

"The tough new roadside sanctions, including the impoundment of vehicles as well as licence suspension, are proving to be a major deterrent to potential offenders and I look forward to this continuing," said Mr Williamson.

Inspector Ian James of Police National Headquarters applauded the new system and said police were delighted at the new powers they had to get these offenders off the roads.

By the end of last week 934 cars had been impounded by police under the same new laws, with only two reported cases of repeat offending.
