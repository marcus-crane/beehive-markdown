The Labour Party's announcement today that it would impose a take-overs code is consistent with Labour's intention to re-regulate the New Zealand economy, Treasurer Bill Birch said tonight.

"New Zealand unshackled itself from rigid regulation in the 1980s and 1990s, with greatly improved outcomes for growth, jobs and incomes. Now Labour wants to move away from the the market environment responsible for those improvements. "Their announcement today is a backward signpost which should not be ignored," Mr Birch said.

The Government had given careful consideration to the recommendations of the 1995 Take-Overs Panel, but after detailed discussions with business and the Stock Exchange, decided it would be more appropriate for the Stock Exchange itself to manage the rules through its own procedures.

"That system has worked extremely well for the last four years, and it should continue to be left to the investment industry to manage it. "Re-regulation is not a direction which should be supported by business or investors. It has failed in the past, and would do so again in the future."
