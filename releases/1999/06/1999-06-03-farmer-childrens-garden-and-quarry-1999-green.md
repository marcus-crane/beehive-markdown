A Waiuku farmer, a children's edible garden project in Christchurch and a Dunedin-based company responsible for cleaning up an old quarry are all big winners for the environment in the 1999 Green Ribbon Awards announced today.

"Appropriately this year's winners are playing a major role in promoting environmental education," Associate Minister for the Environment, Hon Marie Hasler said when announcing the winners at the launch of the Environmental Education Resource Directory in Wellington today.

"These national Green Ribbon Awards recognise the contributions and achievements made by groups and individuals towards a healthy and sustainable environment," Ms Hasler said.

"The three award winners this year are David Craig of Waiuku, the Kids Edible Garden Project of Christchurch and Palmer & Son Limited of Dunedin."

Mr Craig, a farmer, landowner and founding member of the Awhitu Landcare group willingly provides advice and help for other new landcare groups. On his own property he has also demonstrated practical ways for farmers to take care of the natural environment.

The Kids Edible Garden project sets out to teach children about growing plants organically, building healthy soils, turningwaste into compost as part of a school recycling scheme and controlling pests by natural means.

Palmer & Son were nominated by the Institute of Quarrying for their effort and commitment to restoring an old quarry into a garden featuring more than 20,000 trees and shrubs.

Ms Hasler also highly commended three other nominees. These are the Water Services Unit of the Christchurch City Council, the Waikato Environmental Business Network and Resene Paints Limited.

Mr Craig, a farmer and landowner, is a founding member of the Awhitu Landcare Group. He willingly provides advice and help to other new landcare groups, as well as demonstrating on his own land practical ways for farmers to care for the natural environment.

His projects have included fencing and re-establishing four large wetlands to provide habitats for birds, and fencing off and planting along streams, areas of native bush and fragile coastal land which is prone to erosion.

Mr Craig's property is a 280ha rolling to steep contoured dairy farm on the west coast of the Awhitu Peninsula. For the past eight years he has fenced, retired and planted all sand erosion on coastal strip, wetlands, streams and bush, a total of 30ha, at his own cost and in his own time. He also has established a large wetland for the breeding of wetland birds.

As recycling is his main aim Mr Craig has designed and built an effluent system for his dairy-shed and this system is used as an example by councils.

All trees used in the project are grown in a large shade house on his property. All the seeds are collected locally and up to 5000 trees grown per year in conjunction with trees for survival and Awhitu Landcare.

All development work undertaken on the property is done in consideration of the sacred hill Puketapu, a Maori historical pasite of paramount importance to the Ngati Te Ata tribe.

The Organic Garden Trust was formed in 1997 with the aim of promoting sustainable organic living in Christchurch and to improve the quality of life and the environment for Christchurch residents by education and training in organic practices.

One of their initiatives was to introduce the Kids Edible Garden Project for schools so children can learn how to grow their own vegetables, flowers, herbs and fruit. This enhanced the idea of a 'nibble garden' which was originally promoted by a parent in 1996.

The aim is for every Christchurch primary school to be a model and to promote practical environmentally sustainable principles. This involves producing zero waste through the three 'Rs'(reduce, reuse and recycle), creating edible gardens,producing compost, worm farming, and integrating environmental education into the curriculum.

A team of volunteer teachers, parents and gardeners officially launched the project in 1998. Within six months, 20 schools had built edible gardens and were busy eating their harvest, making compost and learning more about a sustainable world.

The project is a total team effort with support from volunteers of numerous Christchurch community groups, local businesses and Crown Public Health.

Schools all over New Zealand are reportedly interested in taking part in the project.

Palmer & Son Limited have been quarrying proprietors in Dunedin since 1880. During this time the company has operated quarries at North East Valley and Logan Point. The North East Valley quarry ceased operations in 1980 after operating for nearly 100 years.

The Institute of Quarrying accepts that the end result of quarrying can be an eyesore and that more could and should be done to remedy the problem. The Institute believes that the work of Palmer & Son Limited is an excellent example and standard for the industry to follow in the future.

Palmer's aim in 1989 was to landscape the quarry in order to visually diffuse the effect of the quarry face as seen from the surrounding residential areas. Over the past 10 years, more than 20,000 shrubs and trees have transformed the site into an asset that benefits the entire community. The walkways, roads and park areas are well supported by the local community and over the past two years a sound shell has been established for large outdoor concerts.

The project was awarded the New Zealand Quarry Industry's 1993 Nissan Award for Environmental Excellence and the Otago Regional Council (1997) Otago Environmental Award.

Palmer & Son Ltd is still owned by members of the founding Palmer family, with fifth generation family members involved in the running of the company today.
