Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford said today he had regretfully accepted the resignation of Glenn Dillon from the Hutt Valley Polytechnic Council.

Mrs Dillon, who is based in Dunedin, decided to tender her resignation as a board member in the wake of a petty Opposition campaign against her appointment.

"It is a matter of considerable regret that Mrs Dillon felt she had to resign after such public vilification," Mr Bradford said

"The polytechnic needs people with strong governance and financial management skills to help turn it around. The best people will resolve its problems not soft options.

"It is clear from Mrs Dillon's track record as a business person and Chair of Healthcare Otago Ltd, that she has the extensive governance experience that would have greatly helped the ailing polytechnic.

A Ministry of Education report shows the Polytechnic has been performing poorly for some time. It reported a loss of $810,000 in 1997, $1.9 million in 1998.

"The best person for the job should get the job no matter where that person lives. This will be the very clear basis for the appointment of Mrs Dillon's replacement," Mr Bradford said.

"This is just another example of Labour hounding good people for sake of political point scoring and of Labour's scruffy election campaign this year."
