"Labour Justice Spokesman, Phil Goff's ego is making promises his Party has no intention of keeping", new Justice Minister  
Tony Ryall said today.

"His latest line is promising that "higher penalties should be set in law for all serious violent offenders, not just when the  
offence is committed in a house" (statement dated 13 June 1999)", said Mr Ryall.

"This new promise goes against everything he and his colleagues have said about longer sentences in the past.

"The problem is that no-one knows what the Labour-Alliance's law and order policy is. The whole thing is a shambles,  
being made up on the spot.

"What we do know is that the cuddle-the-crims liberals in the Labour Party have spent the last six months telling everyone  
that longer sentences don't work. Yet this is what Mr Goff is now promising.

"Labour has already shown that they have no backbone when it comes to putting serious violent offenders away for longer.  
When the National Government introduced tougher sentences for rape a few years ago the Labour Party voted against it.

"Quite frankly, no-one knows what Labour-Alliance really think about home-invasion. Labour will stall, grandstand and  
maybe even eventually vote against the legislation.

"Now Phil Goff is trying to con New Zealanders into thinking Labour-Alliance stands for tougher sentences.

"As Mr Goff is well aware he is a lone voice within Labour-Alliance on the issue.

"He knows his caucus does not support him on this, and their speeches in Parliament prove it", Mr Ryall concluded.
