The Minister of Defence, the Hon Max Bradford, is to make an official visit to Washington DC from 3 - 5 June 1999.

He will meet with United States Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton, senior United States Defense and State Department officials and Congressmen.

This will be the first visit by a New Zealand Minister of Defence to Washington DC for two decades and the first meeting between a United States Secretary of Defence and a New Zealand Minister of Defence for 25 years.

Mr Bradford will use the opportunity to register once again New Zealand's strong opposition to a trade restrictive ruling against lamb imports.

President Clinton's decision on the question is expected to be announced on June 5th.

"New Zealand and the United States share a common interest in maintaining the stability of our region and in contributing to peace support and humanitarian efforts around the globe," Mr Bradford said.

"I will be exploring with Secretary Cohen ways in which we can further develop our defence relationship within the confines imposed by our anti-nuclear legislation.

"We will be looking at practical steps which both sides can take to increase the inter-operability of our forces and our ability to play a continued role in the support of peace and stability," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford is also due to visit the headquarters of Kaman Aerospace in Connecticut. Kaman Aerospace is producing the four Super Seasprite Helicopters for the Royal New Zealand Navy. The aircraft are due for delivery in 2001.

After the United States visit, Mr Bradford will attend the annual meeting of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland, where New Zealand's proposals for the reform of the ILO are expected to be adopted by the Asia-Pacific group of Ministers of Labour.
