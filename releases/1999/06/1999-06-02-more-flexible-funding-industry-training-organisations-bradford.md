Greater flexibility in the way Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) are to be funded will allow them to achieve better  
results, Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford says.

Mr Bradford today announced a new funding arrangement for ITOs for the year commencing 1 January 2000.

"ITOs will no longer have to account for their expenditure by individual cost categories, a method criticised by industry," he  
said.

"The new scheme will give ITOs the flexibility to use resources in whatever way will best achieve results for employers  
and trainees.

"They will be able to improve on the good results they have already achieved under the Government's industry training  
strategy."

Mr Bradford said that in return for this increased flexibility, ITOs would be required to implement a new performance  
measurement system being introduced by Skill New Zealand.

This system would provide robust and transparent information about how trainees were performing.

This information would be evaluated during contract negotiations between Skill New Zealand and ITOs.

"This will provide a strong incentive for ITOs to ensure that trainees successfully complete their qualifications under their  
training agreements," Mr Bradford said.

He said the Government was pleased with the results of the industry training strategy to date.

Industry Training Organisations offer people working in industry the opportunity to study industry-related national  
qualifications while working. There are 52 recognised ITOs in New Zealand.

Trainee numbers had increased threefold since the start of the strategy and now totalled 50,000.
