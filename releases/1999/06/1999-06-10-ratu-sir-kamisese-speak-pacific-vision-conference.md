The President of Fiji Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara will be a keynote speaker at the Pacific Vision International Conference in Auckland next month, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced tonight at a special dinner for South Auckland's Pacific Island community.

Mrs Shipley made the announcement after an Ava Ceremony at the Cecillia Convention Centre in Papatoetoe organised by Arthur Anae MP and attended by around 500 representatives of the Pacific Island community and other ethnic groups.

"As the elder statesman of the Pacific, Ratu Sir Kamisese has helped to shape a vision for Pacific people in the past. He will provide a visionary platform for the debate and discussion the Pacific conference will generate.

"He has always been at the forefront of Pacific aspirations to gain greater autonomy in the Pacific and greater recognition for Pacific peoples. It is a great honour to have such a respected figure taking part," said Mrs Shipley.

The conference is being organised by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs. It will be the first time that Pacific community representatives, business leaders, politicians and government have been called together in New Zealand to develop a shared vision for Pacific people in the future. Its purpose is to examine issues that will impact on Pacific people in New Zealand and to develop long term strategies to deal with those issues.

Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara coined the phrase 'The Pacific Way' more than 25 years ago which inspired these words in partnership with the Indian opposition leader in the Fijian constitution; whereby "people of different races, opinions and cultures can live and work together for the good of all, can differ without rancour, govern without malice, and accept responsibility as reasonable people intent on serving the interests of all."

The Pacific Vision International Conference will be held at the Aotea Centre in Auckland July 27-30, 1999.
