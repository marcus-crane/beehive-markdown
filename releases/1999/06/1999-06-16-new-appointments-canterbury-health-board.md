Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of two new members to the board of Canterbury Health Ltd.

Christchurch resident Dr David Kerr succeeds foundation director Professor Tom O'Donnell, and Marion Van Der Goes fills the vacancy left by former Board member Mrs Pip Wyber.

Dr Kerr, in addition to his medical practitioner expertise, has held a number of governance roles and joins the Board as an experienced director.

Marion Van Der Goes is the current Chair of Coast Healthcare Ltd.

"Ms Van Der Goes has been appointed in accordance with the policy of including directors from supportive secondary care organisations to the boards of the tertiary health service in the region," Mr Creech said.

"Her appointment to the Canterbury Health Board will cement the management and contractual relationships between the two health services."

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to Canterbury Health were being staggered to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.

Mr Creech thanked retiring board members Professor Tom O'Donnell and Pip Wyber for their contribution to Canterbury Health.
