Defence Minister Max Bradford today welcomed the appointment of Graham Fortune as the new Secretary of Defence and chief executive of the Ministry of Defence.

"Mr Fortune is a man with a great deal of experience in world affairs and a deep understanding of New Zealand's defence and security interests.

"His last posting was as New Zealand High Commissioner to Australia, our most important defence relationship.

"I have known Graham for some years. Mr Fortune will bring a steady hand and a view of the world that is built on realism," Mr Bradford said.

Mr Bradford paid tribute to the fine leadership displayed by retiring Defence Secretary Gerald Hensely.

Mr Hensely had made a distinguished contribution here and abroad through the sound defence policy, procurement and evaluation processes he established within the Ministry, Mr Bradford said.
