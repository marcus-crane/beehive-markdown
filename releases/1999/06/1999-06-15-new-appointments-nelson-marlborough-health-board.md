Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of two new members to the board of Nelson-Marlborough Health Ltd.

Blenheim resident Lynette Jones has a long-term interest in health delivery. In addition to her being the National President of the NZ Red Cross in 1992/94, she was a member of the National Advisory Committee on Core Health and Disability Services in 1992/93.

"Ms Jones as a member of several community organisations will bring a strong community focus to the Board," Mr Creech said.

The other appointment is Judy Crowe. She has a close association with local health delivery services through her education roles with the Cancer Society and the National Heart Foundation. Until 1998, she was also actively involved with the NZ Association of Natural Family Planning.

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to Nelson-Marlborough Health were being staggered, as with all the Hospital and Healthcare Companies, to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.

Current director, Mr Bruce Kerridge of Blenheim, has been re-appointed until 31 May 2000.
