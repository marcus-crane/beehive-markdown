Foreign Minister Don McKinnon welcomed the peaceful elections held in Indonesia yesterday as a good sign for the upcoming consultation with the East Timorese.

"The fact that these elections were held with few problems and very little violence is a positive sign for the upcoming consultation ballot with the East Timorese.

"For the first time in almost 50 years, Indonesia has had free, fair and peaceful elections, and it is a credit to President Habibie and all those involved in organising yesterday's ballot, that things have gone so smoothly.

"New Zealand has played its part in this election by providing funds and technical expertise to set up the new voting regime and training poll workers.

"This has been an enormous logistical undertaking for the Indonesians. They had to train two million workers just to run the ballot stations so it is pleasing that New Zealand was able to help out."

Mr McKinnon said the peaceful outcome of yesterday's elections was always going to be crucial for the resolution of issues on East Timor.

"The challenge is now for a grouping of parties to form a Government. It is to be hoped that who ever that grouping of parties is - the commitment to a resolution on East Timor remains.

"I have always said that the first hurdle to resolving the status of East Timor was a democratic and peaceful national election. Now that has been achieved, it is possible to look with renewed confidence at a similar process being followed in East Timor," Mr McKinnon said.
