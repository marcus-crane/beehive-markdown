Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru Yosano will make a two-day visit to New Zealand prior to the Meeting of APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) on 29-30 June, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith announced today.

"While the primary purpose of Mr Yosano's visit is APEC focussed, it will also be a welcome opportunity to discuss bilateral issues," Dr Smith said.

"Our relationship with Japan is of immense importance, not only because Japan is a major trading partner for goods and services, but also because of our shared regional and international economic and security interests.

Mr Yosano, making his first visit to New Zealand as International Trade Minister, will meet with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, and Dr Smith.

Mr Yosano is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and was appointed to his current position in July 1998, having previously been Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and Minister of Education.
