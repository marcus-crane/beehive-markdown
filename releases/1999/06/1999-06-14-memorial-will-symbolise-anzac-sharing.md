New Zealand and Australia's shared benefits of peace and burdens of war are commemorated in a Canberra memorial  design unveiled today by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

Kingsley Baird and the Wellington-based Studio of Pacific Architecture have won the international competition to design the  memorial from more than 100 submissions. Their design incorporates the input of several other contributors.

Mrs Shipley announced the winning design in an address to the National Council of the Returned Services Association in  Wellington.

"Our relationship with Australia binds us together as enduring partners in peace and adversity," she said.

"The selected design, and its location at the entrance to ANZAC Parade in Canberra, reflects the unique character of the  ANZAC bond."

Two 11.5 metre bronze arches will represent the handles of a Maori kete or basket, and symbolise co-operation and sharing together the benefits of peace and the burdens of war.

The memorial will also reflect the contribution and sacrifice of ANZAC service people both in its location, as a gateway to ANZAC Parade, and in design features which record the history of ANZAC operations dating back to Gallipoli.

The memorial will be built next year, with a project budget of $NZ1 million. The design was selected by an independent five-person panel convened by former Chief of Defence Forces Sir Somerford Teagle. The other members were Dame Georgina Kirby, architects Sir Miles Warren and Rewi Thompson, and Michael Radcliffe, chief executive of the Australian National Capital Authority.

"I congratulate the winning team," Mrs Shipley said. "I am sure that when the memorial is completed next year it will become a lasting symbol of New Zealand 's most important relationship."

The memorial is being built at the invitation of the Australian Government.
