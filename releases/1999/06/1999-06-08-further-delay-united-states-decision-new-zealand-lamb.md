The United States has signalled a further delay in making a final decision on possible trade restrictions against New Zealand and Australian lamb, according to Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

"This further delay is concerning," said Dr Smith.

"Although it's clear that key agencies within the US Administration have taken New Zealand's arguments seriously, information out of Washington this morning points to continued intense lobbying by protectionist politicians from the US Senate, which could damage New Zealand's existing trade access.

"New Zealand and Australia are continuing to make representations in Washington, but I'm still worried about the outcome.

"Our trade with the United States is fair, and it would be a travesty to see the introduction of penalties on our existing trade in a situation where there is no evidence of actual injury to the US sheep meat industry," Dr Smith concluded.
