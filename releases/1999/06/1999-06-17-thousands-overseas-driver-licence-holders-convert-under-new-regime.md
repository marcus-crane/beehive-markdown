Thousands of overseas driver licence holders are now the proud holders of New Zealand licences, some of whom were unaware they needed to convert until the publicity introducing the new regime, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said today.

"We've already had almost 4,500 overseas conversions since May 3, a number of whom were unaware they were driving illegally."

Mr Williamson said this was another major road safety benefit of the new regime as all these drivers must pass a theory testto ensure they have adequate knowledge of our road rules, signs, laws and safe driving practices.

"I welcome these figures and all those overseas licence holders who have converted because some of our road rules differ from other countries and confusion can lead to serious crashes."

Mr Williamson said he had heard of one example where an Australian had been driving on an Australian licence for 10 years, not knowing he was only entitled to do so for 12 months.

"I'm now pleased to report that this person and thousands of others are now driving legally on our roads with all the knowledge they need to maximise the safety of both themselves and other road users.

"The new driver licensing regime was designed to maximise road safety and already, we're seeing the results we wanted including deterring serious traffic offenders, correcting the vision of more than 2000 drivers, as well as increasing overseas conversions."
