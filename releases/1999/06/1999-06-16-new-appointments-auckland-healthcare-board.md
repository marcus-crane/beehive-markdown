Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of two new members to the board of Auckland Healthcare Ltd. This follows the recent appointment of the Boards' new Chairman, Richard Waddel.

"With the company about to embark on major capital developments, it is imperative that the Board has the right skills in hospital and healthcare services, capital development and leadership. The new board appointments have been made with this in mind," Mr Creech said.

Auckland resident Elaine Lunken has been appointed as the community representative to the Board and Dr Sven Hansen fills the vacancy left by former Board member Dr Murray Kirk of Palmerston North.

Elaine Lunken's strong community interests and commercial institutional skills will strengthen the Board's community liaison skills as well as providing a further business perspective.

Dr Sven Hansen has also been appointed to the Board. He is an Auckland based medical consultant who specialises in sports medicine, corporate health and integrated health-care. In addition to his medical qualifications and experience, Dr Hansen holds a Masters in Business Administration and has been active in the area of clinical information systems.

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to Auckland Healthcare were being staggered to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.

Current director John Walters has been re-appointed until 31 May 2002.
