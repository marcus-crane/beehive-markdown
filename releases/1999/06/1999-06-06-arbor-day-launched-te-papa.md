Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched Arbor Day at a Te Papa ceremony with the theme 'Trees for Life'. The Te Papa function involved representatives from Ngati Kuri, Project Crimson Trust and the Department of Conservation in the presentation of one of the world's rarest trees, a Bartlett's rata. In launching Arbor Day Dr Smith encouraged communities to get involved to Arbor Day activities tomorrow.

"Trees are the lungs for our global village. 80% of New Zealand was once covered in forest but clearance by burning and unsustainable logging over the last millennium has reduced it to 20%. Every minute of every hour, every hour of every day, every day of every year, every year of every century this millennium 5 trees have been bowled over without being replanted. Arbor Day is a call to arms to halt the destruction and turn the tide."

"We are gradually halting the destruction from major changes in policy in the seventies and eighties. In 1993, the Forests Act required all North Island and most South Island forests to be managed sustainably. Unsustainable logging in the West Coast Accord Forests is being brought to an end as we approach the new millennium. The last step will be in negotiating an end to unsustainable logging in the Maori owned SILNA forests. This is a key priority for the Government."

"Arbor Day is also an opportunity to draw attention to the plight of some of our rarest trees. People don't stop to think about New Zealand's trees - we know that kiwi, the kakapo and other birds are under threat but don ?t realise there are trees in New Zealand that are near extinction. Today we are presented with one of the world's rarest trees, Bartlett's rata. There are only 30 of these left in the wild, all of them in Northland - they're rarer than the kakapo."

Ngati Kuri travelled from the Far North to gift this specimen in a ceremony at Te Papa today, and it will join the other native plants in Te Papa's special collection in a dawn planting tomorrow. This rata species is unusual as it has white flowers, instead of red. Project Crimson, a partnership between Carter Holt Harvey, DOC and the community, is working to restore rata and pohutukawa forests throughout New Zealand.

"Bartlett's rata exemplifies the challenges all New Zealanders face in addressing the decline of our biodiversity. Without action, Bartlett's rata will become extinct. Thanks to Ngati Kuri and Project Crimson, Bartlett's rata has a chance of survival."

The theme for this year's Arbor Day, June 5, is 'Trees for Life - Te Ira Toi Rakau', acknowledging the vital role of trees as a life-support system for everything, including humans. To celebrate Arbor Day, native tree plantings are occurring around the country over the next week. Contact you local DOC office for information on the tree plantings in your area.
