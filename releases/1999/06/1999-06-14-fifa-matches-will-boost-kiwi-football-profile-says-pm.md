New Zealand will host a world-class sporting event when the finals of the FIFA Under-17 Championship are played here this year, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley was the guest at the announcement of the draw of matches for the championship in Auckland this evening.

"They say soccer is the beautiful game and this will be a beautiful opportunity for New Zealand.

"The country will be exposed to the vast international football-viewing television audience. That can only be good, not only for the development of the game here but for the country itself. This is a yet another world-wide stage for New Zealand."

Four New Zealand cities will host the matches: North Shore (Auckland), Napier, Christchurch and Dunedin.

"I urge any New Zealanders who can, to go along to these games and see young players from around the world striving for excellence," said Mrs Shipley.
