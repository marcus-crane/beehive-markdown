Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said he was very pleased to hear that an agreement between NATO and Serb Military  Forces had been signed this morning (NZT).

"This triggers the immediate withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, and sees the suspension of NATO bombing once it has been verified that a full withdrawal is underway, which is very good news. I just hope it sticks," he said.

"The agreement also provides a clear legal basis for the deployment of an international peace keeping force, to be called KFOR, which will provide a secure environment to enable the refugees to return in safety to their homes.

"No one should underestimate the amount of work that will need to be done to rebuild Kosovo, and get life there back to some semblance of normality.

"In this regard, New Zealand is to make an immediate contribution. A New Zealand Defence Force officer, Major John Flanagan, has been appointed to head up a new United Nations mission to map out a de-mining programme in Kosovo."

"The Government will be keeping under review the question of whether New Zealand can contribute within its resources to the international supervision of the peace settlement, but no proposals are in front of the Government at this time."

Mr McKinnon said the agreement signed today did not affect the New Zealand initiative of allowing up to 200 displaced Kosovar families to come to New Zealand.

"If they still wish to seek refuge in New Zealand they will be welcomed," he said.

Mr McKinnon said that the UN Security Council is meeting, and he expected them to reach a resolution regarding the  
agreement shortly.
