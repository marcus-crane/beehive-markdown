Reports of a European Commission decision which moves toward resolving the long standing dispute over access for New Zealand's spreadable butter are encouraging, said Trade Minister Lockwood Smith this morning.

New Zealand requested a WTO Panel ruling on the dispute after the European Commission denied access for spreadable butter under a special tariff quota arrangement negotiated in the Uruguay Round. The Commission argued that spreadable butter did not meet the relevant access criteria which requires New Zealand butter to be 'manufactured directly from milk or cream'.

New Zealand agreed to suspend its WTO action after the panel released its interim report and in April 1999, Dr Smith announced that New Zealand had re-entered negotiations with the Commission. Dr Smith also held further discussions on access for spreadable butter with the EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler and with Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan during his visit to Europe last month.

"New Zealand has not received formal notification of any decision from the European Commission on this issue. But we do understand that the Commission has given the go-ahead to our reaching an amicable solution to the spreadable butter dispute. This may see the end of the WTO dispute settlement process," said Dr Smith.

"We will need to continue working closely with the Commission to agree on the finer details of an agreement, but in principle, today's reports out of Brussels are very encouraging for New Zealand," Dr Smith concluded.
