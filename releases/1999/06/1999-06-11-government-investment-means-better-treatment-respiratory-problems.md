"Greenlane Hospital's updated respiratory unit is another positive step forward for health services in Auckland. It will provide the best of modern treatment available for people with respiratory conditions," Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

Mrs Shipley officially opened the totally refurbished eight bedroom unit today. The service provides a one stop centre for investigating and diagnosing respiratory disease in patients.

"In the four months since patients began being treated at the unit, it has proven to be a good investment. Patients can now have all their lung function testing completed in one day, where previously they would have had up to four outpatient visits.

"This is much more convenient for patients with less travel required, and means fewer people need to become inpatients. Shorter times between referrals, first assessment and definitive treatment for lung cancer is just one of the improvements for the patients involved," she said.

The day unit is an example of what the Government is aiming to achieve through its recently released Medium-Term Strategy for Health and Disability Services.

"Investing in the latest modern equipment and facilities, improving patients access to health services, and better coordination between health services are the new focus of health care. This day unit is a prime example of this goal being achieved," said Mrs Shipley.

The centre will serve people from Auckland Central through to Northland.
