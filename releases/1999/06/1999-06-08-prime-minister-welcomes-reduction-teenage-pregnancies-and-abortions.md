Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today she was pleased with a reduction in teenage pregnancies and abortions last year, as reported by Statistics New Zealand.

"The trends have been very encouraging since we introduced the Sexual Health Strategy in 1996. The average number of teenage pregnancies are down significantly as are abortions.

"In 1996, an average of 12.2 per one thousand 15-year-olds became pregnant. Provisional figures for 1998 show a drop to 10.6 per one thousand.

"Abortions in the year to December 1998 were down 1.2 per cent compared to the previous year. This compares to a 2.7 per cent increase in 1997 and an 8.4 per cent increase in 1996.

"It is very pleasing to see that the abortion rate is coming down, particularly the number of first time abortions in 1997 and 1998.

"Since the Government introduced the Sexual Health Strategy in 1996, we have seen a slowing of the number of abortions in 1997 and a drop in 1998. It appears that more people are using contraceptives, taking responsibility for their sexual health, and that sex education in families, schools and the community, is working.

"However, I am still concerned at the high number of women who are having more than one abortion. Too many women who have had one abortion are returning for subsequent abortions and that's worrying. We need to turn our minds to this issue to see how we can reverse this trend," Mrs Shipley said.

"My hope is that New Zealanders will take more responsibility for their sexual health in order to see that every child is a wanted child. I'm very encouraged with the progress being made," Mrs Shipley said.
