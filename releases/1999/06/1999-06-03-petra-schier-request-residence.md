Immigration Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, has declined a request for permanent residence in New Zealand from Mrs  
Petra Schier.

Mrs Schier, whose husband Guenther was recently removed from New Zealand for being here unlawfully and who had  
failed to declare drug convictions on his arrival, had asked Mr Delamere to be allowed to stay in New Zealand, referring in  
particular to the new Entrepreneur category of business immigration policy.

Mrs Schier is herself subject to a Removal Order as an overstayer.

"Mrs Schier supplied me with details of her backpacker hostel and craft store business in support of her application," said  
Mr Delamere.

"There is nothing in the information Mrs Schier has supplied that justified me in changing my earlier approach to this case.

"Accordingly, I have declined to use my residual powers under the Immigration Act and have told Mrs. Schier that I will not  
be granting her a Residence Permit.
