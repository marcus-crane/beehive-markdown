Labour leader Helen Clark has already decided which Alliance MPs she would include in a Labour-Alliance Cabinet.

"This must be over-confidence in the extreme," says State Owned Enterprises Minister, Tony Ryall.

"In a closed door meeting with business people in Auckland, Helen Clark said if she became Prime Minister she would offer Cabinet posts to Jim Anderton, Sandra Lee and Matt Robson.

"No mention of Phillida Bunkle, Laila Harre, Liz Gordon or Grant Gillon. Sorry folks!

"Such over-confidence by Helen Clark will no doubt strain her relationship with the un-annointed in the Alliance Caucus.

"At the special briefing, Helen Clark also confirmed Labour-Alliance would scrap the ECA and increase taxes," said Mr Ryall.
