A new air services agreement with Belgium encouraging the development of an as yet largely untapped market has been signed by Transport Minister Maurice Williamson.

Mr Williamson signed the agreement with Belgium's Ambassador Pierre Vandervoorde.

"The agreement is the latest chapter of the long-standing relationship between New Zealand and Belgium", said Mr Williamson.

The agreement provides for an unlimited capacity, no restrictions on the routes that may be offered between the two countries and unrestricted code-share rights. This is where an airline can sell seats on other airlines under its own name. This will allow airlines to determine what services they will offer based solely on commercial considerations.

It is part of a major thrust over the past year to create new opportunities in European tourist markets. Air Services Agreements have also been negotiated with Austria, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian trio of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. An agreement with Ireland was signed by Mr Williamson last month.

It is likely that in the short to medium term it will be code-sharing opportunities that will be taken advantage of rather than the operation of an airline's own aircraft.

"The number of Belgian visitors to New Zealand has been increasing and the opportunity for code-sharing between the two countries will help develop this market further", Mr Williamson said.
