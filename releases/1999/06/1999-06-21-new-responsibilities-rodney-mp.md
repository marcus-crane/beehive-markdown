Rodney MP Lockwood Smith has welcomed his appointment as Associate Minister of Immigration (International Access and Processing) in the minor Cabinet reshuffle announced by the Prime Minister this morning.

"As Minister for International Trade and Tourism, I've been concerned about the way New Zealand interfaces with the world," Lockwood Smith said.

"When people want to visit New Zealand, invest in New Zealand or buy goods from this country, it's important that their first contact with our representatives abroad provides them with useful information.

"Over the past few months I've been working with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of Tourism and Sport, Treasury, Work and Income New Zealand and Immigration to ensure that Government agencies are working toward the same objectives in their offshore operations.

"I'm pleased to have this work officially sanctioned by the Prime Minister. As a member of the new 'External Relations Ministerial Team', I'm confident that Ministers will make real progress over the coming months," Lockwood Smith concluded.

In addition to his new responsibilities as Associate Minister of Immigration and membership of the External Relations Ministerial Team, Lockwood Smith remains Minister for International Trade, Minister of Tourism, Associate Minister of Finance and Minister Responsible for Contact Energy Limited.
