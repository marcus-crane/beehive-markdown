The Minister of Health today announced that the current chairperson of Auckland Healthcare was stepping down from the position as his term was finishing, and a new appointment had been made.

Current Chair Graeme Hawkins is retiring from the position after being involved in Auckland Healthcare and its predecessor since the start of the health reforms seven years ago.

The Chairperson's position will be filled by Auckland man Richard Waddel, partner in accounting firm Ernst and Young. He is currently a Board member of Canterbury Health and Healthlink South. Mr Waddel will be withdrawing as a partner of Ernst and Young.

"I would like to express my thanks to Graeme Hawkins for his role in the health sector - particularly for helping guide Auckland Healthcare through the process required to get approval for a new hospital for central Auckland."
