ACT New Zealand's failure to support legislation stopping monopoly lines companies overcharging consumers is inexplicable, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says.

"What ACT seems to be saying is that it believes a market can develop in the monopoly industries, which is clearly nonsense, given the behaviour of some electricity lines companies over the last few months," he said.

Mr Bradford said yesterday's 112-8 vote to send the lines company control bill to a select committee showed there was a clear understanding in Parliament that competition in the monopoly electricity lines business was impossible. "The Government has always said some form of regulation would be required in that sector of the electricity industry, which accounts for 50 per cent of consumer power bills," he said.

"What the legislation does is introduce a more light-handed form of regulation - to be administered by the independent Commerce Commission - than is presently provided in the Commerce Act.

"The Government wishes to stay with this more light-handed approach rather the one that the control-freaks in the Alliance would have us accept," Mr Bradford said.

"In every region where there is competition and consumers have choice, power prices are lower than they were before the reforms were announced a year ago.

"Fifty-five per cent of New Zealand electricity consumers now have access to lower power prices.

"The Government is legislating to control monopoly lines companies to ensure that where there is no natural competition the benefits of the power reforms are passed on to consumers," Mr Bradford said.
