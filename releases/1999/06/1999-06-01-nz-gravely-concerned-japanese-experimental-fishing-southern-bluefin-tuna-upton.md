"New Zealand is contemplating international legal action over Japan's decision to conduct a second unilateral experimental fishing programme for southern bluefin tuna", Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton said today.

Japan, along with New Zealand and Australia, is a member of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna which was set up to ensure the sustainability of the species. But Japan's action is being taken without the agreement of the other Convention parties, New Zealand and Australia.

A round of consultations was set up last year after Japan proceeded unilaterally to conduct its first such experimental fishing programme, but these have not brought the parties to agreement on an acceptable scientific basis for future experimental fishing.

"I am gravely concerned that Japan is taking such a step" Mr Upton said.

"New Zealand has spared no effort to reach a resolution and to find a scientifically robust way of adding to the data at ourdisposal on the state of this fish stock which we believe to be fragile. We remain strongly committed to the Convention as the best way to manage total catch levels, and we are worried that this action by Japan could undermine the Convention."

Mr Upton called in the Japanese Acting Ambassador yesterday, making strong representations. He asked that a formal request from the New Zealand Government not to begin its unilateral fishing programme should be conveyed to Japan.

"I am extremely disappointed that the only response to this request has been a confirmation that Japan intends to proceed with a larger EFP than last year" Mr Upton said.

"Japan's unilateral action calls into question important principles of fish stock management and breaches international law. I have briefed Cabinet and the Government is now considering its response to Japan. We do not intend to let this matter lie."

The Minister added that the ban on port access for Japanese southern bluefin tuna longliners, with the exception of vessels chartered to New Zealand companies, remained in place.
