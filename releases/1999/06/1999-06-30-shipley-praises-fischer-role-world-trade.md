Prime Minister Jenny Shipley praised the work of Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer who today announced his plans to resign next month.

"Australia will lose one of its most colourful and capable Ministers and New Zealand a great friend," Mrs Shipley said.

"I regret that Mr Fischer will not be able to continue in his political roles which he performed so admirably.

"He has worked hard to advance free trade and has been a champion of the CER (Closer Economic Relations) agreement between Australia and New Zealand.

"Mr Fischer is undoubtedly a man of great integrity and character who has left a large and positive footprint on the international stage. We will miss him very much," Mrs Shipley said.
