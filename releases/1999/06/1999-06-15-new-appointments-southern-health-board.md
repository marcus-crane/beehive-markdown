Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of a new member to the board of Southern Health Ltd.

Ross Black who is the current Chair of Healthcare Otago Ltd, replaces Sue Suckling who retires on 30 June 1999.

"Mr Black is an astute financial consultant in the personal business area and will add this expertise to the board's skills ," Mr Creech said.

"Equally important, the cross appointment of both Chairs is expected to lead to a better co-ordination of health services in the Otago and Southland regions."

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to Southern Health were being staggered, as with all the Hospital and Healthcare Companies, to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.

Mr Creech thanked retiring board member Sue Suckling for her contribution to Southern Health.
