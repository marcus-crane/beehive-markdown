The Health Minister today welcomed the appointment of Sally Wilkinson as Interim Chief Executive of the Health Funding Authority.

"I am pleased an appointment has been made," Mr Creech said. "Sally Wilkinson brings valuable experience and knowledge in the health sector.

"The Health Funding Authority has a huge job to do administering more than $6 billion of taxpayers' money for health services.

"The organisation has been through a lot of change from restructuring the four different Regional Health Authorities into a single agency. This is designed to save in administrative and bureaucratic costs.

"The Health Funding Authority has completed its restructuring and is now firmly focusing all its energies on getting better and more health services for New Zealanders.

"The appointment announced today will add impetus to this focus. I look forward to working with the new Chief Executive and the rest of the HFA team to get improved health services for us all," Mr Creech said.
