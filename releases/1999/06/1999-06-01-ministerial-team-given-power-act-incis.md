Cabinet yesterday gave an Ad Hoc Ministerial Group power to act on the INCIS contract with IBM, advised and assisted by a top team of Government officials, Treasurer Bill Birch and Police Minister Clem Simich said today.

They said the Government's aim was to give the Police and the wider Justice sector cost-effective world class information technology to support front-line police catching criminals, and to do so in a timely manner. "We intend to achieve that," Mr Birch and Mr Simich said.

The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group has been monitoring the INCIS project since the first evidence of cost over-runs. It comprises Treasurer Bill Birch, Finance Minister Bill English, Justice Minister Tony Ryall, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford, Associate State Services Minister Maurice Williamson and Police Minister Clem Simich.

Cabinet reinforced the Group yesterday by directing the Chief Executives of Treasury, State Services Commission, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Commissioner of Police to oversee the next stages of the INCIS project. They will report directly to the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group. Mr Birch and Mr Simich said that, within that framework, Cabinet also instructed the Secretary to the Treasury yesterday to employ an experienced manager of commercial projects to lead a project team of senior officials from Treasury, SSC, DPMC and the Police to resolve present INCIS difficulties.

"We have a legal contract with IBM for INCIS. Preliminary indications based on limited initial use are that the first stage of the system now rolling out is being generally well-received by those using it, according to Police advice.

"In May last year, the then Treasurer and the Secretary to the Treasury visited the headquarters of IBM, a world leading computer company, and were given assurances of IBM's commitment to the project. "Progress on the next stages of the project has been complicated by difficulties and delays. The situation must be resolved. The Government aims to ensure Police get the tools they need.

"The new project manager and his project team will draw on legal, strategy, commercial and technical advice as required, accountable to the team of Chief Executives and the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group. That work will be advanced as a matter of urgent priority.

"Ministers recognise that the project team and Chief Executives deserves adequate opportunity to conduct their review and report before further substantive public statements are made on INCIS. The next stages are critical. It is important to get them right," the Ministers said.
