Singapore Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo will visit Wellington and Otago following his attendance at the Meeting of APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) on 29-30 June, International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

"New Zealand has an excellent relationship with Singapore," Dr Smith said.

"Singapore has a key role as a finance and trading hub in Southeast Asia, and is a significant investor in New Zealand. The two countries share a great deal in common, and our mutual interests range from security cooperation to trade and investment, tourism and education".

This will be Mr Yeo's first visit to New Zealand as Trade Minister. He will be hosted in Wellington by Dr Smith, and will also meet with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don McKinnon. He will be accompanied in Otago by the Treasurer, Bill English, where he will see something of New Zealand capabilities in high-tech industries and the food sector.

Mr Yeo was appointed to his current position in May this year, having previously been Minister for Information and the Arts, as well as Second Minister for Trade.
