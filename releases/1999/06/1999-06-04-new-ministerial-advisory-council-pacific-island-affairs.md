The new Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs Minister's Advisory Council has been restructured to better reflect the relative  
composition of the Pacific population in New Zealand, the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Hon Tuariki Delamere  
announced today.

The new structure will ensure that issues affecting specific groups are canvassed effectively at Council level, said Mr  
Delamere.

In the past each of the six main Pacific groups (Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga, Niue, Fiji, Tokelau) had two members and  
Tuvalu and the Solomons had one member each.

The new structure has the following distribution: Samoa (5), Cook Islands (2), Tonga (2) and one each for Fiji, Niue,  
Tokelau and Solomons.

The Council now has greater regional representation and better reflects the cultural diversity of Pacific people in New  
Zealand, said Mr Delamere.

Two current members and seven new members have been appointed:

Mr Tim Vailoeti (Tonga) Waikato University lecturer, Rotorua

Mr Mailo Pesamino (Samoa) Social worker, Wellington

New members:

Mr Enosa Auvaa (Samoa) Principal, Mt Albert School, Auckland  
Mr Eleitino Bubsy  
Memea-Maaelopa (Samoa) Social service worker, interpreter and Pacific health educator, Christchurch  
Mrs Leitulagi Sagapolutele (Samoa) Social services worker, Auckland  
Mr Edwin Puni (Samoa) Consultant, Auckland  
Ms Tairi Fenwick (Cook Is) Associate Principal, Auckland  
Mrs Taime Samuel (Cook Is) Community worker, Hastings  
Mr Siale Pasa (Tonga) Civil engineering tutor Canterburyv University, Christchurch  
Mr Sekove Mataitonga (Fiji) Community leader and National Library custodian, Wellington  
Mr Antonio Patelesio (Tokelau) Senior Human Resource advisor, Wellington

I am confident that the new Council will continue to provide me with the best advice on issues affecting Pacific people in  
New Zealand, said Mr Delamere.

Two further positions have yet to be confirmed.

The term of appointment will be for one year and with the Minister?s discretion renewable for a further two years.
