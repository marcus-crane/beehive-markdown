Latest statistics showing recorded crime reduced 2.5% in the year to December 1998 show public fears about rising crime are unfounded, Police Minister Clem Simich said today.

Nationally the crime rate (recorded offences per head of population) also reduced by 3.3%, continuing the downward trend occurring since 1992.

"This is tangible evidence that the Government's crime reduction programme is actually working," Mr Simich said. "The public should take note that our Police are doing well and thanks to their hard work, we still live in a safe country."

There are a few districts where crime is still rising, most of which will benefit from the Government's new targeted enforcement teams due to start work later this year.

"These latest figures are encouraging, but we can still do better," Mr Simich said.

"There can be little doubt from these latest figures as to the ability and adequacy of our Police service. Next year we will have 7000 Police officers - the most in the country's history. It's this Government's aim through greater resourcing and better management to make our Police better than ever."

"I want to congratulate Police managers on achieving such a good result given some of the uncertainty of the past year," the Minister said. "I hope as much as they do that the Review will bed down as soon as possible so everyone can get on with the job at hand: fighting crime, and reducing it further."

Mr Simich said he was satisfied the drop in recorded crime was not due to non-reporting of property crime, as doing so was a necessity in order to lodge an insurance claim. In addition, a victims' survey completed in 1996 showed the reporting rate for property crime was actually very high.

Mr Simich said he had little doubt other groups with political agendas will do their best to put today's news in the worst possible light.

"Given the extent to which some people are determined to undermine Police in an election year, then this can only be viewed as disappointing," he said.
