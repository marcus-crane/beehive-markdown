A US decision on safeguard action against imports of New Zealand and Australian lamb is expected to be delayed again today, according to Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

"I'm continuing to work the phones to my contacts in Washington, and Ambassador Bolger and his staff at our Embassy are working day and night to ensure that the US Government understands the importance of this case to New Zealand," said Dr Smith.

"The arguments put forward by New Zealand and Australia are being taken seriously, and we understand that the US has not yet made a final decision on the exact recommendations to place before President Clinton.

"I remain concerned about the protectionist pressures at a political level in Washington, and I'm making every effort to ensure that the final decision does the least possible harm to New Zealand farmers.

"At this stage we can't predict exactly when the US might make its final decision, but I expect it will be in the next few days" Dr Smith concluded.
