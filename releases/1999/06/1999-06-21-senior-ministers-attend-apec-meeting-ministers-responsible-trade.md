One of the most significant meetings of the APEC process will kick-off in Auckland on 29 and 30 June, Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said today.

All 21 APEC economies will be represented at the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade in Auckland, at Ministerial level in most cases, Dr Smith said.

"I am pleased that so many high-ranking Ministers have said they will attend the meeting. It reflects the importance each economy places on the trade and investment issues to be discussed.

Ministers attending are expected to include US Trade Representative Ambassador Charlene Barshevsky, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, Korean Minister for Trade Han Duck-Soo and Japanese Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Kaoru Yosano.

This is the second APEC Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade to be held in New Zealand. Christchurch hosted a Trade Ministers' Meeting in 1996 on behalf of The Philippines.

"For the first time, the Ministers Responsible for Trade Meeting will involve direct discussions between Ministers and business representatives from around the region. This interaction will provide a real opportunity for frank discussion of APEC's work, and how it can enhance opportunities for business within the region," Dr Smith concluded.
