New Zealand will provide assistance to Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) the Foreign Minister Don McKinnon and Associate Minister Simon Upton announced today.

"The reporting of human rights abuses and requests for them to be investigated have increased dramatically over the last year as Indonesia takes important steps towards democracy.

"The establishment of a credible human rights organisation which protects and promotes human rights and objectively addresses violations is extremely important in any democratic society," Mr McKinnon said.

New Zealand assistance will support the provision of seven Fellowships for two years which will strengthen Komnas HAM's human rights monitoring, legal and promotional capacity. One position will also directly assist in strengthening Komnas HAM's organisational and management capacity.

"The Fellowships are the single most valuable form of assistance that New Zealand can provide to Komnas HAM at this time. We are very pleased to offer such practical assistance which goes to the heart of Komnas HAM"s needs.

"The seven Fellows have all commenced work at the Commission and we wish them well in the challenging tasks ahead of them", the Ministers said.

New Zealand's contribution will be funded primarily from the good governance component of New Zealand Official Development Assistance (NZODA) programme to Indonesia which totals $5.1 million.
