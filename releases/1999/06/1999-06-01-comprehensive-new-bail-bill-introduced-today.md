"The Government will today introduce a comprehensive bail reform bill that will help put serious re-offenders behind bars, not leave them on the streets", new Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, has announced.

"Our plan targets those most likely to re-offend or breach bail", Mr Ryall said.

"The Government's plan will improve bail laws by forcing someone who commits a serious offence, while already on bail,to prove they deserve bail, rather than the police having to prove they don't", said Mr Ryall.

"This reverses the onus of proof as it currently stands.

"Estimates are that this plan will increase the number of people denied bail each year by 50 percent from 3000 to 4500.

"Judges will also get the information they need to make the right decisions about who should get bail and who shouldn't.

"Courts will be given new powers to have the details of bail breaches permanently recorded against a defendant, making itharder for offenders to gain bail in any future offence.

"This new information will allow the Courts to tell whether a bail applicant has offended on bail or breached conditions previously. Currently it is very hard for the Police to assemble this information.

"The new Bill also strengthens the rights of victims by making their safety the priority when Judges consider bail for those who have previously offended while on bail.

"In addition the Government will make Bail laws much easier for everyone to understand by bringing together the provisions currently scattered throughout seven Acts of Parliament", concluded Mr Ryall.
