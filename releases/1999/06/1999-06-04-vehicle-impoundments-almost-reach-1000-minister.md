Almost 1000 vehicles have been impounded by police since the new driver licence regime came into effect on May 3 with only a handful of drivers having reoffended, Transport Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

"Figures show that 934 vehicles have been impounded, but more importantly, very few people have reoffended, in contrast  to the previous system," Mr Williamson said.

"This is great news for law abiding drivers because it's keeping serious traffic offenders off the roads. This was the primary aim of the new system and already, we're seeing the results we wanted."

Under the old regime, 8000 people were convicted of 11,000 offences for driving while disqualified each year, meaning thousands were convicted of more than one offence.

"But with their cars now being impounded for 28 days, we've found in the first five weeks that only a handful have reoffended.

Inspector Ian James from Police National Headquarters said under the old system, police would have expected a far higher number of repeat offences, but the new law of impounding vehicles had slashed this figure.

"While it's early days, with only two such cases having come to my attention in five weeks, the new system is working beyond all expectations," said Inspector James.

Mr Williamson congratulated police for their efforts, and warned disqualified drivers and others who committed offences warranting impoundment to stay off the road, or lose their car.

The 28 day vehicle impoundment regime applies to those who drive:

- While disqualified
- while their licence is suspended under demerit points
- while their licence is suspended by police for 28 days
- while their licence is revoked (eg on medical grounds)
- without a licence and who have previously been forbidden to drive until they get a licence after their licence has expired and when they have previously been forbidden to drive until they renew their licence
