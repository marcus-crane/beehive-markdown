Advice from Washington suggests a decision on possible trade restrictions against New Zealand and Australian lamb is not expected until Tuesday 8 June (New Zealand time), according to Trade Minister Lockwood Smith.

"My understanding is that the inter-agency group developing the recommendation on possible trade restrictions has not yet reached agreement, and work is continuing to formulate the final recommendation to place before President Clinton," said Dr Smith.

"I'm continuing to make representations to key decision-makers in Washington, and although its hard to read precisely what this delay means, it is clear that the US Administration is taking our arguments seriously.

"I've been advised that it is unlikely that the White House will make a public announcement until Tuesday morning (New Zealand time), Dr Smith concluded.
