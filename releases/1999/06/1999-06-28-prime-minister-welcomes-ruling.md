Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today welcomed the Speaker's decision to dismiss the complaint Labour had attempted to lodge.

"The Government is getting on with the job of improving New Zealanders' prosperity.

"We are focused on the big issues that New Zealanders care about and we won't be side-tracked by petty politics in Parliament," Mrs Shipley said.
