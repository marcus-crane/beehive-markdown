Health Minister Wyatt Creech today announced the appointment of a new member to the board of Mid Central Health Ltd.

Dr Peter Jansen, an Auckland clinician, is Treasurer of the Maori Medical Practitioners Association and a member of the Mental Health Foundation amongst other health oriented organisations.

"Dr Jansen's appointment strengthens the clinical skills on the Board. His appointment is a new one and does not replace a former Board member," Mr Creech said.

Mr Creech said the terms of appointment to the Board of Mid Central Health were being staggered, to ensure director's terms did not expire all at once.
