Treasurer Bill English said today it was time Dr Cullen stepped in to calm Labour's increasingly erratic performance on tax and spending.

"We were promised Labour's tax and spending figures after Dr Cullen had seen the Treasury's pre-election update. Well that's been out a week now and  
there is still no sign of anything from Labour.

"Voters have a right to know what they would be in for under a Labour-led Government. They know they will be paying $800 million more in tax than they would with National, but the list of spending promises continues to mount up and it's time Dr Cullen stepped in to calm Labour's increasingly erratic performance on tax and spending.

"Dr Cullen's problem is that he has consistently understated the true cost of Labour's commitments by only being prepared to cost some of them. His 'A'  
list of costed commitments used to only be the credit card commitments, but that's now been extended to a few other policies such as schools, early childhood, industry training, social welfare, extra for health, a green agenda and more. He can pay for these with the extra tax and by digging into the money put aside for new policy provisions.

"But it's the 'B' list of uncosted or longer term commitments which is the real monster under the bed.

"We've counted 169 uncosted commitments and the list keeps growing. Some of these are big ticket items, such as the research & development measures, establishing Community Employment Organisations, and paid parental leave.

Commitments like a gradual change to ACC so that sickness is treated the same as accidents and removing asset testing for long-term geriatric care are sitting there too and have enormous costs attached.

"With a 'B' list like this Dr Cullen's claim to fiscal credibility is thoroughly stretched. No matter which way he cuts it there's only so much money to spend before you have to look at options like not paying back debt and raising more tax revenue.

"Dr Cullen cannot have it both ways. He cannot make the claim that the books under Labour will look as good as the books under National, while his colleagues go round the country making spending promise after spending promise.

"When the Auckland Chamber of Commerce tried to estimate the cost of Labour's spending commitments using a reputable economic forecasting company they got  
a blast of vintage Cullen vitriol.

"But if Dr Cullen isn't prepared to cost his commitments then other people will do it for him. He should save his vitriol and start being up-front with  
voters," said Mr English.
