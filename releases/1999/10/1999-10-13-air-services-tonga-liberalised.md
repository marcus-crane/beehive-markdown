"More flights between New Zealand and Tonga are in prospect following recent air services negotiations between officials of the two Governments", Transport Minister Maurice Williamson announced today.

"Airlines of New Zealand and Tonga may operate up to two additional B737 services per week to the benefit of travellers and traders.

"Current arrangements permit three B737 services per week by the airlines of each side," Mr Williamson said.

"Also agreed was the provision for new entrant airlines, as previously only one airline from New Zealand and one from Tonga were permitted to fly the route."

Tonga joins a growing list of countries with which New Zealand has negotiated new or enhanced air services arrangements in recent times.

"These new arrangements reflect the Government's policy of creating maximum opportunities for competitive air services with a wide range of countries", Mr Williamson said.
