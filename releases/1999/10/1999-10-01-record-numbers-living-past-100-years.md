More New Zealanders than ever before are living more than 100 years, Minister for Senior Citizens David Carter said today.

"This is wonderful news and especially pertinent today as New Zealanders up and down the country join people round the world to celebrate the International Day of Older Persons.

"According to figures provided by Statistics NZ, it is estimated that about 295 New Zealanders are currently 100 years old or older," Mr Carter said.

"In fact I am aware of at least two New Zealanders celebrating their 100th birthdays today.

"The news gets even better as we look into the future. It is predicted that by 2031 we will have 2700 people in this country who are over the age of 100 years. By 2051that estimate is up to 9000, the population of Opotiki or Mosgiel all over 100.

"The predictions show women will retain their improved chance of reaching 100 years in the next half century. In fact currently there are estimated to be 226 women aged 100 years and over and 69 men. By 2051 it is expected there will be 6300 women aged 100 years and over, and 2700 men.

"This International Day, which concludes this very successful International Year of Older Persons, is an excellent opportunity for all New Zealanders, young and old, to recognise the wonderful contribution older people make to life in New Zealand," Mr Carter said.
