Treasurer Bill English said today this year would be the last happy Christmas for New Zealand families if Helen Clark is able to carry out her top priority of tax increases.

"Over the weekend Ms Clark was reported as saying that a Labour-led Government would pass legislation to increase taxes a few days before Christmas because it was her top priority.

"Christmas of all times is a time when families have saved to have a little bit extra for treats and holidays. A few hundred dollars extra, saved week by week all year, makes a big difference to a family at Christmas time.

"There couldn't be a bigger contrast with National's attitude to New Zealand families. National will be passing legislation to cut the middle tax rate to 20cents and increase the threshold to $40,000. That would be a Christmas present worth having for everyone who earns over $9,500.

"National believes in sharing the benefits of growth. As well as reducing taxes, we are committed to spending a dollar more on social services for every dollar of tax cuts.

"No serious political party in the world is advocating higher taxes. Lower taxes mean reward for effort and families with more capacity to achieve their aspirations. That's what will take New Zealand forwards. Labour's higher taxes would take us backwards," said Mr English.
