The Government has promulgated new regulations which will give local bodies the authority to impose infringement fees on people breaching the provisions of the Resource Management Act," Environment Minister, Simon Upton, announced today

"The new powers will help local bodies deal with minor infringements of the Act without resorting to court action.

The regulations will come into force on 1 February 2000. The penalties range from $300 to $1000, depending on the seriousness of the offence.

Offenders will have 28 days to pay the infringement fee. They will also have the right to raise any matter relating to the circumstances with the enforcement authority or to deny liability and request that the matter be heard in the District Court.

If a local body chooses to take court action, penalties can be up to two years imprisonment or a fine of $200,000.

"These new regulations are intended to provide a method of dealing with minor offences and complement the other powers available to local authorities - such  
as abatement notices and enforcement orders.

"These new regulations will enhance local bodies' ability to operate this important legislation effectively," Mr Upton concluded.
