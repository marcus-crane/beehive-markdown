Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said that National's commitment to quality, well resourced education had never been stronger and was demonstrated by new school facilities like the administration building opened today at Tauranga Girls' College.

"I know that this new facility which will give the school an even greater sense of its own unique qualities and will continue to enhance the College's reputation as a first rate education facility for the young women leaders of tomorrow," the Prime Minister said at the opening.

"It is important that all young New Zealand females have access to the best in education facilities and teachers, so that they can take their rightful place in society as leaders and contributors.

"Young women are achieving today as never before in both traditional and non- traditional areas, and it is a strong, well funded education system with strong leadership from staff that has made this possible.

"Women are now entering the highest levels of business, political and legal life as well - the new Telecom Chief Executive is a woman, just 37 years of age, the new Chief Justice is a woman - examples abound for young women to learn from and to emulate.

"I know that Tauranga Girls College is committed to high quality outcomes for the young women who come here, and I know already of the pride and the passion you have for your school.

"This Government is committed to helping with resources and training, and then letting staff get on with the job you are obviously doing so well.

"Now, more than at any other time in the history of our country, women have a real chance to make a difference and play their full part in the community and in the nation. Schools like Tauranga Girls will ensure young women are given the best possible chance to do that," the Prime Minister said.
