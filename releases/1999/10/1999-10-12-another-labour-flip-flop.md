Labour leader Helen Clark has finally come clean with consumers and begrudgingly confirmed that the Government's electricity reforms are working, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford said today.

"It was only six months ago that she said the reforms had "turned to custard" and would never bring falling prices to consumers. Her offsider, Labour MP Pete Hodgson said Government-forced changes were "theoretical papp".

"Finally, Miss Clark has had to admit she and her colleagues were wrong. But, even then, she is revealing her party's schizophrenic approach to competition, or should I say anti-competition," Mr Bradford said.

"On the one hand she is saying competition is starting to kick in, and is praising some of the deals that are being offered.

"On the other hand she wants to cut across competition by imposing arbitrary rules for setting electricity prices, rules for which she offers absolutely no basis.

"Worse still, only last week she was talking about totally undermining competition in electricity generation by re-amalgamating ECNZ.

"Instead of flip-flopping all over the place Labour should have just supported the Government's sensible legislation to control prices in the monopoly parts of the electricity sector, and left the competitive parts of the industry to get on with the job.

"But then again, when has Labour ever put the interests of consumers ahead of political point scoring," Mr Bradford said.
