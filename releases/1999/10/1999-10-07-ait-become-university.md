The Auckland Institute of Technology is to become a university, Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford announced today.

Mr Bradford made the announcement this morning at the AIT campus.

He said he had recommended to the Governor General, that an Order in Council be signed establishing the Auckland University of Technology.

"The Governor General has accepted my recommendation and the decision will be published in the Gazette today.

The AIT made its application for university status in 1997. It was the first application of its kind under the Education Act 1989.

"The review of AIT's application has been full and thorough and has included intensive discussions with AIT, and advice from the NZQA and the Ministry of Education," Mr Bradford said.

He said over 150 submissions from the tertiary sector were received and considered.

"Earlier this year the AIT and Auckland University committed to an alliance agreement that resulted in AIT students having access to the University's facilities, library resources and staff.

"This relationship has helped ensure the AIT is able to provide the necessary functions of a university.

"More importantly it is the sort of strategic relationship that will allow the best characteristics of AIT, as a University of Technology, to be leveraged with the best characteristics of Auckland University, as a significant research oriented and teaching university," Mr Bradford said.

"The process has been a long one but after due consideration, I am satisfied that the Auckland Institute of Technology substantially meets the characteristics of a university as set out in the Education Act 1989.

"I want to especially congratulate Dr John Hinchcliffe, Chief Executive of AIT and his staff and management in the professionalism with which they have approached the difficult process of becoming a university.

"I believe the AIT provides a dynamic and innovative learning environment and is committed to the highest achievable standards of teaching and research," Mr Bradford said.
