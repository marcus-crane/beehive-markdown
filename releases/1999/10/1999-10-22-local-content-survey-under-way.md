A survey to find out people's views and ideas on how to raise the level of local content in broadcasting has just been released by Hon Marie Hasler, the Minister for Culture and Heritage.

"I am very keen to see the level of local content raised on both radio and television and this is why I am asking people involved in broadcasting to give me their views on how this can best be achieved," Ms Hasler said.

"When considering the level of local content over the past 10 years I believe there is considerable scope for improvement.

"As minister responsible for cultural broadcasting and Radio New Zealand, I want to see what can be done to better foster local content in broadcasting, beyond the level, range and quality currently being achieved.

"As we move into a new technological era I want to be assured New Zealand has an effective set of broadcasting structures and laws for the production of local content."

In a letter accompanying the survey Ms Hasler says there are many things that local content in broadcasting can do for a nation. These include representing cultural diversity, thus contributing to a sense of national identity, as well as providing some of the information and ideas people need to participate as citizens in the social and political debates of the day. Local content also showcases the achievements of our artists, performers and sports people and is a vehicle for creativity and innovation.

The survey outlines New Zealand's current broadcasting model and asks, working within these arrangements, what changes could be made to increase the level and range of local content in broadcasting.

Consideration is also given to overseas models and asks what measures used in other countries, such as quotas, could or would work in New Zealand.

"I do hope people will think laterally when they answer this survey as there could well be ways for raising the level of local content that are not currently in the public arena.

"Importantly, I want to know if any changes are made to our current system who should bear the coats and why. At the end of the day someone will have to pay for any form of intervention whether this be government, industry or the public."

Responses to the survey are due back by 15 November.
