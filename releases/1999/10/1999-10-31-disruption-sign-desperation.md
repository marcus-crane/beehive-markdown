Disruption at the National Party campaign launch in Auckland today, by supporters of the Labour-Alliance bloc, is a sign of the parties' absolute desperation, Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says.

"It appears the centre-left can't win the election on the basis of a good clean campaign.

"The desperate tactics we saw today is part of the re-emergence of the Labour party's dirty tricks campaign we saw at the beginning of the year.

"Labour shelved the tactic because it thought it would win the election, but now it is panicking and playing dirty," Mr Bradford said.
