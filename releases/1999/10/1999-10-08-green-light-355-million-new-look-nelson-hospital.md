The Minister of Health today announced Nelson Hospital would be revamped and modernised to the tune of $35.5 million.

"Nelson residents can look forward to the benefits of the multi-million dollar improvements to the city's hospital from 2001, with completion by the end of 2002.

"Old buildings will be bulldozed to make way for state-of-the-art facilities linked together to ensure the safest and best care possible is available to locals," Mr Creech said.

"The redevelopment incorporates the latest developments in hospital planning and will be very flexible to meet changing clinical demands.

"The new hospital will be built around the existing new operating theatres. The George Mansen Block and Percy Brunette block will be upgraded and connected to the new facilities.

"One of the first differences people will see is how much easier it is to access the buildings and how everything is much more coordinated.

"We have been working closely with Nelson Marlborough Health Services to get the best solution and best investment in the hospital. Today's announcement is their recommended approach for the hospital.

The redevelopment will see:

- Up to $35.5 million investment
- the theatres, emergency department, intensive care and critical care units and radiology will be located together on a single 'hot floor'
- a combined medical and surgical ward
- inpatient areas separated out from outpatient areas and clinical areas from public areas.

"Some of the buildings are getting past their use-by-date and need to be upgraded if Nelson Hospital is going to be able to keep up with modern medical care trends.

"Nelson Marlborough can now get on with the job of detailed planning and design of the new look public hospital and the final size of the investment in the hospital.

"The new buildings will lock in safe and effective health care.

"The hospital staff will have a much better environment to work in and they'll be able to provide much better care because services and facilities will be much better integrated," Mr Creech said.
