Treasurer Bill English said Labour's Labour Day package for workers was a cruel irony because it would not help create one new job.

"Labour is promising yet another review - this time of the minimum wage - along with a lowering of the age of eligibility for the adult rate to 18.

"How many more hurdles will Labour put in the way of people who need jobs? Labour has already promised employers higher accident compensation costs, a reversal of the Employment Contracts Act, and paid parental leave, along with higher taxes.

"Every one of these measures makes it less likely that any business or service organisation will create a new job.

"It will be people who need jobs who will pay the price. It is a cruel irony that Labour is announcing a package which will cost jobs on Labour Day.

"Even after nine years of thinking about it, Labour still doesn't understand how real jobs are created. It's probably not surprising with so many university academics on Labour's front bench. The only jobs they know how to create are jobs for union organisers.

"The economic policies which give more New Zealanders the chance of a job are policies which increase our international competitiveness, lower taxes, support business by lowering their costs and give business flexibility around employing staff. With these policies we can expect to see 115,000 new jobs created over the next three years," said Mr English.
