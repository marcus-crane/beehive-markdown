Minister for Enterprise and Commerce Max Bradford today praised the commitment to workers by retiring trade union leader Ken Douglas.

On Monday Mr Douglas will be standing down as President of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions.

"Ken and I have known each other for many years because of our respective and occasionally conflicting roles in the industrial relations arena," Mr Bradford said.

"I have a great deal of respect for his integrity and the passion with which he has pursued the interests of the working people he represented.

"He has the skills of a diplomat, orator and activist rolled into one.

"He is one of the few living New Zealanders to be made a member of the Order of New Zealand, after being presented with the ONZ insignia previously held by Jim Knox," Mr Bradford said.

Through his positions with international trade union organisations Mr Douglas has voiced the issues of New Zealand workers widely. The organisations include the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

"Ken has been a tremendous leader amongst labour advocates in the Asia-Pacific.

"While I have not always agreed with him on all issues I can't gainsay his commitment to improving the conditions of working people throughout the world through the channels of international trade union bodies.

"Ken has had a long and successful career making a tremendous contribution to New Zealanders and I hope that contribution won't be lost with his retirement from the CTU.

"I would like to wish Ken the best in his future endeavours," Mr Bradford said.
