Labour leader Helen Clark's credibility is under a serious strain after she made false allegations about an Auckland surgeon, said Roger Sowry, Leader of the House.

"Everyone makes mistakes, but when we do it's our job to front up quickly and say sorry."

"But for the surgeon to have to drag Miss Clark to Court to get an apology, well, it says a lot about her personality," Mr Sowry said.

"I hope it's not simply that Miss Clark would rather fight in Court than admit she made a mistake and say sorry."
