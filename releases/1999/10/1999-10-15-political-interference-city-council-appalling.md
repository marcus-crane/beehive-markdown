"The Christchurch City Council is attempting "political interference of the highest order" with its decision to stop a Youth Information Pack going out because the National Party has a paid advertisement in it," says Banks Peninsula MP David Carter.

"This is just appalling interference, and worse, a complete waste of ratepayer money," says Mr Carter.

"Twenty thousand pamphlets have already been produced, which are now sitting gathering dust at our university, polytechnic and city council service centres."

Mr Carter said it was appalling that Labour-aligned members of the City Council could pull rank and demand that the pamphlet be withdrawn, when the Labour Party had also been given the opportunity to advertise in the publication.

"The National Party was asked to advertise in the pamphlet by an agent of the Christchurch City Council, and we identified it as a chance to speak directly to the youth of Christchurch."

"The Council is displaying a patronising attitude towards the youth of Christchurch, if it thinks young people can't make their own minds up about who to vote for."

"National has identified the youth vote as an important market, and we thought the Youth Info Pack was a great idea, giving young people access to vital information."

"There needs to be a immediate investigation of who pulled rank here, and why one advertisement from the National Party is so threatening to the Christchurch City Council."
