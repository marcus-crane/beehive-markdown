"After nine long years in the planning Labour's Police Spokesman, George Hawkins, has delivered a Police policy as flimsy as the wet bus ticket Phil Goff proposes punishing criminals with," Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, said today. "After nine years Labour has no new ideas."

"Mr Hawkins has spent the last three years bagging the New Zealand Police at every opportunity," said Mr Ryall.

"But all he can come up with is allowing ‘half a dozen' former Police officers, who have left the Police under the perf scheme, to come back to the force and keep the money.

"Another of Labour's ‘key' policies is to focus the Police on reducing crime rather than having to meet specified targets of hours spent on certain Police activities. That's a good idea.

"Which is why the Police Commissioner began implementing this policy months ago.

"Frankly, New Zealanders need to ask if Labour has a clue about Policing in this country.

"And, where is Labour's commitment to the Police? New Zealanders will not forget that Labour actually cut Police numbers when it was last in government.

"Under National sworn Police numbers have increased by 900 since 1990 (in addition to the traffic merger staff). By the middle of next year they will increase by a further 100, reaching 7000 sworn Police officers - the highest number in New Zealand's history.

"George Hawkins has always been happy to grab a headline at the expense of the Police. But when he gets the opportunity to do more than blow hot air, he obediently follows the rest of Labour's politically-correct caucus," said Mr Ryall.
