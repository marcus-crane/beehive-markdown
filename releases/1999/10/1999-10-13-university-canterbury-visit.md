The Minister for Tertiary Education, Hon Max Bradford, at the invitation of the University of Canterbury Students' Association, addressed an audience of between 100 and 200 students at the University of Canterbury this morning.

Mr Bradford was accompanied by Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee and Associate Education Minister Hon David Carter.

It was a lively meeting. All three MPs made a contribution, as did a number of students.

Following that meeting, the three MPs had an unofficial meeting with the executive of the Canterbury Branch of the Association of University Staff.

When that meeting finished between 30 and 40 persons staged a noisy protest as the MPs left to go to their car.

When the three MPs were in the car, students surrounded the vehicle and lay on the ground so preventing its departure.

At least one student started to let down the car's tyres.

There was no presence from the university students' association to control this group, nor from the university administration, nor from the police.

The MPs then left the car and walked through the grounds of the university.

At one point a student stood on Mr Bradford's foot, and shouted slogans at the top of his voice right in the Minister's face.

The Minister brushed the student aside and kept walking.

Eventually the police arrived and the three MPs left the campus.
