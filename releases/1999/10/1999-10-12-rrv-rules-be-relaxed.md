Immigration Minister, Hon Tuariki Delamere, today announced a significant change to the rules governing Returning Resident Visas (RRV's).

The key change is that, from June 5, 2000, residents of New Zealand who have received final approval for their permanent residence application will receive an RRV of indefinite duration, rather than the present limitation of two years. The RRV will be valid from the date of first arrival in New Zealand.

"This means residents of New Zealand, who are not citizens, will be able to travel freely overseas and return without having to go through the process of reapplying for a re-entry visa," said Mr Delamere.

"As a trading nation, New Zealand is constantly seeking ways to make it easier for business to flourish both here and overseas. This change will make it simpler for many of our valued migrants to increase New Zealand's wealth through their trading and business activities internationally.

"This increased freedom to travel overseas and return makes New Zealand a more attractive destination for migrants to come here who wish to continue their businesses overseas, while expanding their wealth- and job-creating activities here.

"It also means they will have the flexibility to be educated overseas, if they wish, or care for family members, if it becomes necessary, without losing their right to residence in New Zealand," said Mr Delamere.

Under the policy change after June 5, 2000, residents already in New Zealand who hold RRV's of restricted duration will be eligible to apply for an indefinite RRV when their current visa expires.

"It is the Government's expectation that this change to RRV policy will increase New Zealand's attractiveness as a migrant destination and make a positive contribution to the "New Zealand Incorporated" strategy," said the Minister.
