The Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, has announced he'll be retiring from Parliament at the General Election.

Mr Elder said he has decided not to seek re-election "for family reasons".  
Mr Elder, aged 50, entered Parliament after contesting the 1984 snap election as the Labour candidate for West Auckland, holding the seat in the 1987 and 1990 elections. In 1993 he was returned to Parliament as the Member for the new seat of Henderson.  
In the 1996 General Election he was returned to Parliament as a List member of New Zealand First, and was appointed to the Coalition Government Cabinet with the portfolios of Police, Internal Affairs and Civil Defence.  
After the dissolution of the Coalition Government in August 1998, Mr Elder left New Zealand First and became a Minister outside Cabinet with the portfolios of Internal Affairs, Civil Defence and Associate Minister of Local Government. He later joined the Mauri Pacific Party.
