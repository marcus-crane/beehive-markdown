Associate Work and Income Minister Peter McCardle says ACT's backing for Community Work is welcome in principle, but goes too far.

ACT's stance is outlined in its welfare policy out today.

"I'm glad ACT sees the value of keeping people in the race for jobs, and doing something for their local community at the same time. Community Work is  
succeeding in doing that. Over 30,000 people have taken part over the past year, and 5,000 organisations are giving them work opportunities.

But Mr McCardle said he did not agree with ACT?s idea of having the participants do 40 hours work per week, instead of the current requirement up to 20 hours.  
That would be unfair as many jobseekers would then have to work for less than the equivalent minimum hourly wage.

"ACT is, however, right in supporting the growth of Community Work. We can have many more of the unemployed participating. While some of its policy detail is wrong, ACT is going in the right direction," he said.
