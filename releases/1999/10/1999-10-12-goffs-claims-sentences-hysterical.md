"Labour Justice spokesman, Phil Goff's claim that longer sentences are ‘consistent with Labour policy', are ridiculous and contradicted by recent history," Justice Minister, Tony Ryall, said today.

"Labour voted NO to longer sentences for rapists. And Labour voted NO to longer sentences for violent home-invaders.

"Mr Goff made the claim that his party stands for longer sentences in Tuesday's Dominion.

"But, just three months ago, Mr Goff voted against legislation that would see violent home-invaders put in prison for longer.

"When the new law passed he immediately pledged that his party would repeal it and introduce instead a ‘sentencing guideline' that would essentially tell judges that, if they want to, they can consider a home-invasion an ‘aggravating factor', whatever that means.

"He and his party also voted against putting rapists away for longer when the National Government increased the maximum penalties for rape.

"New Zealand women in particular should be aware of Labour's politically correct stance on rapists.

"This Government has increased penalties for violent crime, despite often vitriolic opposition from Mr Phil Goff.

"For him to now claim that his party stands for longer sentences is ludicrous. New Zealanders won't fall for it," said Mr Ryall.
