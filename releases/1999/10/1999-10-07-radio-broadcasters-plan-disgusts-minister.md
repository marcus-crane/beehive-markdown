Hon Marie Hasler, Minister for Culture and Heritage, says she is disgusted the Radio Broadcasters Association Executive Council is withdrawing support for New Zealand music because of Government's initiative to make frequency available for youth radio.

"I am disgusted by what really amounts to blackmail and spite," she said.

"The Council's statement proves just how superficial their motives have been in respect of their commitment to increasing local content on radio. Their commitment to local content is not a commitment at all.

"I am sure the whole of New Zealand will note this insincerity, the tactics they have stooped to and their attempt to bully and frighten away would-be sponsors of youth radio.

"If they withdraw their support to local music they will expose just how shallow their sense of duty and interest in youth actually is."
