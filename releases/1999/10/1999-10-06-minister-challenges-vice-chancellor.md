Canterbury University Vice-Chancellor Daryl Le Grew must explain why he is escalating student fees massively at a time when the Government is increasing its funding to the University, Associate Education Minister David Carter said today.

"He's getting more money for less students. Fee increases of up to 45% are simply not acceptable," Mr Carter said.

After speaking at Lincoln University this morning, Mr Carter said students were demanding accountability from universities on the setting of their fees.

"Canterbury University's funding from Government will be the same next year, namely $86 million."

"This reflects no expected increase in student numbers, but if there are more students than forecast, then the Government's Equivalent Full Time Student funding to the university will increase."

"The Ministry also tells me Canterbury University has spent over $80 million on capital expenditure over the last two years.

"The university is there to provide tertiary education to students, not to build monuments," Mr Carter said.

"Students and Government deserve answers," Mr Carter said.
