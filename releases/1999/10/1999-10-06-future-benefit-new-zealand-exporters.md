New Zealand exporters will see significant future benefits through the Intellectual Property Right Acts Amendment Bill passed yesterday, Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, Max Bradford said.

"This Bill will benefit our exporters by providing reciprocal protection of intellectual property rights," Mr Bradford said.

"It will also enable us to give effect to a copyright arrangement which has recently been signed with Chinese Taipei.

"These bilateral arrangements are important because they will not only benefit those New Zealand companies already exporting to Chinese Taipei, but will also give other businesses the confidence to export there.

Mr Bradford said the Bill also makes a number of technical amendments to several intellectual property rights statutes.

"This ensures New Zealand's continued compliance with its obligations under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, for example the Bill provides for the registration and protection of collective trade marks and recognises new members of the WTO," Mr Bradford said.
