"Job losses for ordinary New Zealanders will be the price of putting a Labour-Alliance government in power," Enterprise and Commerce Minister, Max Bradford said.

"The Alliance's relaunched policies of an extra week's annual leave, twelve weeks paid parental leave and an increase in the minimum wage will impose extra costs on employers of over $500 million a year.

"These costs will make employing staff more xpensive. Employers will be less willing to take on new staff and may need to reduce staff numbers to cover costs. At least 3,000 jobs will be lost," Mr Bradford said..

"The Alliance is proposing to rob Peter to pay Paul. They are favouring those already in work by promising to improve their conditions at the expense of those who will lose their jobs, or not get jobs under their policies."

"The Labour Party does not support these policies, but will be forced to adopt them in government as part of the price for the Alliance's support. The price of power will be job losses," Mr Bradford said.
