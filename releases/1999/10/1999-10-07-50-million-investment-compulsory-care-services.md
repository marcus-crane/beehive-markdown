The Government has announced $50 million new investment over the next three years for services and facilities for people with intellectual disabilities who pose a serious risk to themselves or others in the community.

"Changes are on the way to authorise the assessment and compulsory care of those with an intellectual disability, whose behaviour poses a serious danger to the health and/or safety of themselves or others, or who have been charged with an imprisonable offence.

"This new policy reflects a National Party commitment to bringing balance into the community care debate," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Caring for people in the community is all very well for those for whom it works. But there needs to be balance in the debate and for those who are a danger to themselves or others, secure institutional care must be available.

"We will invest almost $50 million more over the next three years on care for them. The ongoing annual cost is estimated to be about $18 million.

"The new funding will pay for extra services, staff and facilities. It will ensure those with intellectual disabilities who are affected by the Intellectual Disability (Compulsory Care) Bill will get the appropriate care and treatment.

"Further work will now be done on where it will be spent. It will be split between secure care facilities - whether new facilities, or extensions to existing buildings - respite care, crisis support, therapeutic intervention, behaviour support, community residential care, day programmes etc.

"It will mean adequate services are provided to offenders with intellectual disability in the correct environment, rather than them being put in prison without treatment.

"People under compulsory care will have care packages designed to meet their specific needs."
