A final paper on allowances for troops in East Timor will be considered by Cabinet next Monday, Minister of Defence Max Bradford said today.

Mr Bradford received a paper from the Chief of Defence Air Marshal Adamson, recommending the increase of field allowances for personnel.

"These recommendations will be discussed amongst Ministers on Monday.

"The Government is looking favourably at increasing allowances considering the rigours our personnel face in East Timor," Mr Bradford said.
