Labour's Wine Industry Policy is the classic Claytons Policy it's the policy you're having when you're not having a policy, Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Labour's Wine Industry Policy (part of its Rural Policy) is based on the premise that "National has refused to support the food regulations necessary to ensure New Zealand wines are true to label in respect of grape varieties and regions of origin.

"Get off the grass, Jim Sutton. This is completely and utterly wrong. National has already done precisely that, and been acknowledged for it by the wine industry. A simple phone call could have avoided Mr Sutton falling into this hopeless blunder."

Mr Creech said the Ministry of Health had already entered into a new contract with the Wine Institute of New Zealand (WINZ) over export certificates for wine. This covers truth in labelling and checks on wine as it leaves the country.

National has also made a commitment to a review of wine industry legislation in the next Parliament if re-elected.

"Wine makers know the new regime is coming in. It involves significant changes in the wine export certification process to bring about the needed integrity.

"The current export certification system - and the new one coming in - are free to wine makers, so there are few compliance costs."
