New Zealanders will be saddened by the loss of Rt Hon David Thomson, a hard working Member of Parliament, outstanding Minister of the Crown and World War II soldier decorated for bravery, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

"I have passed on my personal condolences and those of the National party to the Thomson family at this sad time.

"Mr Thomson was an outstanding New Zealander, with a distinguished career in the military. He was also a long serving Minister of the Crown who held important portfolios including Defence, Police, Justice and Tourism during his many years of service," Mrs Shipley said.

Mr Thomson served his country both as a Minister of the Crown and as a senior military officer achieving the rank of Brigadier.  
Mr Thomson's loyal service to the government and to New Zealand resulted in him being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.
