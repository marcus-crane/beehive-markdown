Bill Hastings has been appointed Chief Censor of Film and Literature, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Jack Elder, announced today. The term is for three years.

Mr Hastings was appointed Deputy Chief Censor last December and has been Acting Chief Censor since the beginning of the year following the resignation of the late Kathryn Paterson who returned to Australia to take up a similar position.

Mr Elder said Mr Hastings' appointment was made after a "thorough, independent recruitment process" and with the support of a substantial majority of MPs after consultation.

"In recommending an appointment to the Governor General I am required to have regard, not only to the person's personal attributes but also to his or her knowledge of, or experience in, the different aspects of matters likely to come before the Classification Office," Mr Elder said.

Before joining the Office of Film and Literature Classification Mr Hastings had already had extensive experience in censorship as a part-time examiner at the Video Recordings Authority and as a member of the Indecent Publications Tribunal. He had also been the Deputy President of the Film and Literature Board of Review.

Mr Hastings has practised law and taught in various university law faculties. He was Deputy Dean of Victoria University's Law Faculty from 1995 to 1997.
