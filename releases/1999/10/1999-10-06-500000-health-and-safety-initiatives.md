Fourteen projects will receive a slice of the new $500,000 Worksafe Fund to improve health and safety in the workplace, Enterprise and Commerce Max Bradford announced today.

In May this year the Government announced the formation of the pilot half-a-million dollar fund to promote industry leadership in "best practice" of health and safety management.

Mr Bradford said today he was delighted by the number of applications received.

"We have had a very positive response to the creation of the fund with 96 applications asking for a total of $3.5 million in funding.

"Unfortunately, we cannot fund all the proposed projects, but I will be closely monitoring the progress of the successful applicants and will be in a position to make a recommendation regarding the future of the fund shortly," he said.

Mr Bradford said money alone would not eliminate workplace death and injury.

"What is needed is a culture change by industry and employees. Businesses need to own the problem, and own the solution. The Government is willing to assist with solutions, and providing the WorkSafe Fund is one means to do so," he said.

The 14 projects that have received funding cover a variety of areas.

Some build on existing work such as the Work-Related Fatal Injuries Study (WRFIS) by the New Zealand Environmental and Occupational Research Centre.  
The centre has received $78,000 for completion of international comparison of work-related fatal injuries.

"This is an important follow-on from the WRFIS released in August and should allow accurate comparisons of New Zealand's occupational health and safety performance against other countries," Mr Bradford said.

The NZ Mineral Industries Association has received funding to develop, print and distribute two Mining Codes of Practice and run a communication and education programme.

FarmSafe New Zealand has received $55,000 to become established and to run a project designed to reduce farm accidents and deaths involving tractors and All Terrain Vehicles.

Graphic Risk Management has received $17,800 for the development, printing and distribution of health and safety guidelines for the screen printing industry.

"I was particularly pleased to be able to fund Tamaki Makau Rau (Auckland) Maori Business Network for a project which will scope the awareness of Maori businesses in Auckland of HSE Act requirements and develop strategies for assisting Maori businesses to comply with the Act," Mr Bradford said.
