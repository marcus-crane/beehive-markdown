The Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Rt Hon Sir Douglas Graham, has welcomed the passage through Parliament of the Ngati Turangitukua Claims Settlement Bill.

The legislation puts into effect the $5-million dollar Ngati Turangitukua settlement reached last year. It deals with the grievances which arose from Crown breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi in the 1960s during the construction of the Turangi township, built to support the Tongariro power scheme.

"While this may not be one of the larger settlements in financial terms, it is of crucial importance to the people of Ngati Turangitukua and I am very pleased to see this legislation passed by the House today," said Sir Douglas.

He paid tribute to the patient and understanding attitude of the Ngati Turangitukua negotiators, while acknowledging the helpful approach taken by the Taupo District Council and Environment Waikato.

Sir Douglas said he hoped this settlement would restore the honour of the Crown and recognise the manawhenua of Ngati Turangitukua, thus renewing the relationship between the hapu and the Crown.
