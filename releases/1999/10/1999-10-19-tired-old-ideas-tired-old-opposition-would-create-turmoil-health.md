"People will be better off with National's health policy. The health system does not want or need the structural turmoil that Labour plans," Health Minister Wyatt Creech said today.

"Apart from the structural change Labour's offering nothing different in substance to improve health services for New Zealanders

"Labour's trying to make the upheaval palatable by promising hundreds of millions of dollars more, but where the money would come from is anyone's guess.

"There's very little credibility in Labour's figures. It's time for some honesty over where they will get the $825 million from, and what it will pay for. It seems to have been plucked from thin air.

"Labour's health policy is really quite sad. After nine years all they've managed to come up with is backward and outdated structural change, over-the-top promises of extra spending and the rest is National's health policy.

"New Zealanders will be disappointed. Setting up 75 committees, boards and bureaucracies won't mean better health services.

"Labour's plans can be summed up as top heavy with bureaucracy, backward looking, lacking realism and involving pointless change.

"National agrees with the health sector that we should all be focused on certainty and stability in the system so everyone can keep on with the job of delivering better health services."
