The Government is committed to a fair student loan scheme, Minister for Tertiary Education Max Bradford said today.

"As I have said earlier, some aspects of the current scheme are being reviewed. The Government will make any announcements in due course," Mr Bradford said.

"However, suggestions made by MP Shane Ardern in the House today about removing the interest rate on loans while students are studying, are the mere musings from a member who has not been involved in the discussions."
