Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said the military takeover of the Government in Pakistan is very worrying.

"Pakistan has enjoyed popularly elected governments since 1988. The coup is a step backwards for democracy in Pakistan. It is our hope that the military will move swiftly to restore a democratic government.

"The coup appears to have been non-violent. There are no reported threats to any of the several New Zealanders living in Pakistan. Our High Commissioner resident in Tehran and our Honorary Consul in Karachi are monitoring the situation closely.

New Zealanders in Pakistan, and those travelling to Pakistan, should take care particularly to avoid any public gatherings or possible demonstrations.
