The initiative of the group of academics campaigning against the referendum to reduce the numbers of MPs in Parliament is warmly commended by Waitakere MP and Chair of the Electoral Law Select Committee, Hon Marie Hasler,

"This particular referendum proposal seems to have no basis other than a deeply cynical view of parliamentarians," Ms Hasler said.

"The almost complete lack of a reasoned case for fewer MPs amounts in itself to a contempt for our democracy and is also an abuse of the referendum system.

"This referendum assumes no goodwill exists at all between the public and their representatives.

"I look forward to a good cross-section of New Zealanders taking part in this timely debate," Ms Hasler said.
