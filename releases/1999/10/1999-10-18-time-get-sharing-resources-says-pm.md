The Prime Minister today called on Maori to get out of the courts and get on with the job of sharing the resources of the Treaty of Waitangi fisheries settlement.

Mrs Shipley was commenting on today's majority decision by the Court of Appeal.

"A lot of legal argument has gone under the bridge. I note that while the parties involved still have recourse to further legal action, I urge them to sit down and talk in a forum where they can reach agreement on basic principles, so all Maori can benefit.

"This settlement was made more six years ago to give Maori access to fisheries that are rightfully theirs under the Treaty of Waitangi. It is time to stop arguing in the courts and ensure that more young Maori find a future in the fishing industry, with benefits flowing to all," Mrs Shipley said.
