New Zealand's Associate Foreign Minister, Hon Simon Upton, announced today that Ministers and officials from 24 countries have accepted his  
invitation to the Ministerial on Ice.

Mr Upton welcomed the excellent response from the Antarctic Treaty signatories. "There has never previously been a Ministerial meeting of  
Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. For 40 years the Antarctic Treaty System has been run by officials. The Ministerial on Ice has drawn 18 Ministers  
or deputy Ministers to Antarctica itself".

"The meeting is designed to be a fact-finding and informal one. It will achieve its primary goal if it focuses significant political attention on the  
Continent and its dependent eco-systems". "Antarctica's main defence has been its isolation. It has been "out of sight, out of mind". But,  
technological changes are rapidly diminishing that isolation. The recent expansion of illegal toothfishing has shown just how vulnerable this  
pristine environment is". "The Environmental Protocol that has recently come into force should provide a measure of protection. But, there still  
remains important unfinished business. For example, clear rules deciding the liability for environmental damage have to be negotiated if the  
Environmental Protocol is to work properly.

"The Ministerial on Ice will provide an opportunity for Antarctic Ministers to learn about the issues and pressures facing this continent. The  
Antarctic Treaty System will need their political direction and encouragement if it is to cope with the twenty-first century's demands".

The Ministers will be based at Scott Base and McMurdo Station. The visit will put the spotlight on the Ross Sea region, its historical significance,  
the important scientific work being undertaken there and on New Zealand's role as a leading gateway to the continent.
