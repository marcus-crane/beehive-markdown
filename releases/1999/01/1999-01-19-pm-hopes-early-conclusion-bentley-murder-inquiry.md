It is heartbreaking that Kirsty Bentley, a young New Zealand woman with so much ahead of her, has tragically had her life cut short, Prime  
Minister and Rakaia MPJenny Shipley said today.

"It shocks and dismays us all, no matter where we live, every time this type of death happens.

"My heart goes out to Kirsty's family and friends. I hope they feel well supported by the people of our mid-Canterbury community as they show the  
depth of their concern.

"It has been a very sad start to the New Year for our community. It is times like these that remind us that one of the most important things we can  
do is look out for each other.

"It is very hard for everyone and the Police have my full support for all the hard work they are putting in to their inquiries, as they seek to bring the  
offender or offenders to account. I am sure we all hope there will be a conclusion as soon as possible, " Mrs Shipley concluded.
