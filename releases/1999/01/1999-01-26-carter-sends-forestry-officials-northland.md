Hon David Carter, Associate Minister for Food and Fibre, announced today he is sending officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to Northland to ensure people wishing to mill native timber that has fallen as a result of the recent storms can do so within the law and with minimal fuss.

"The Government wants to ensure that people can use these fallen trees, and hopefully get some small benefit out of what has otherwise been a tragedy for many in Northland," Mr Carter said.

"However, people need to be aware that there are some rules about the milling of native trees, even when they have fallen naturally and the Department of Conservation has indicated that it has no interest in the timber," he said.

"These rules require that the Ministry certify that the trees have indeed fallen as a result of natural causes and that the sawmill milling the trees is registered and can show where the trees came from."

"Without such rules, some people may try to unsustainably log their trees, then claim that they fell in the storm. The unsustainable logging of New Zealand's native forest goes against Government policy and is something I am committed to ending once and for all." Mr Carter said.

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry officials will move to Northland early next week, by which time properties will hopefully be accessible to vehicles and logging machinery.

In the meantime, anybody with an inquiry about milling fallen native timber should call the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on 025-340 755 or 03-379 4185.
