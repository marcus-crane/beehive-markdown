Defence Minister Max Bradford says 13 more Airforce personnel are travelling to flood-devastated Northland, with two Unimogs (heavy trucks), and two field refrigerators, to help preserve food.

" It is upsetting to hear criticism from Labour spokeswoman onCivil Defence Janet Mackey that the Defence Force went to Northland too late. It is the law and practice of Civil Defence to determine what resources are required and when," Mr Bradfordsaid.

" The Defence Force has acted immediately to any requests. There are now 17 Airforce personnel and five personnel from the Navy in the area, and the Army is on standby."
