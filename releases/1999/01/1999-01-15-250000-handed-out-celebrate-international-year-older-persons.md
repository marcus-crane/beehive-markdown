Senior Citizens Minister, Hon David Carter, today announced the recipients of $250,000 of Government funding for community projects that celebrate and recognise the United Nations International Year of Older Persons (IYOP).

"I'm delighted to be able to announce that community groups from Kaeo in the far north to Invercargill in the deep south have been successful in applying for Government funds for International Year of Older Persons."

"This year is a very unique opportunity for us to join with other nations in recognising older citizens, and I'm looking forward to some exciting and innovative celebrations."

Twenty four community groups were successful in applying for the $250,000 the Government allocated for community observance of IYOP.

The funding comes from a total of $500,000 the Government is spending to mark the International Year. Funds were also allocated for research and for promoting and publicising the year throughout New Zealand.

The celebrations include an exhibition of Chinese elder's skills in Manukau City, computing courses for older people in Hawkes Bay, a visual art exhibition by older people in Gisborne and a promotion of older people's achievements around New Zealand.

In Nelson a series of radio programmes by and for older people will be recorded, while a golden mile of daffodils will be planted in Invercargill by young and old to mark IYOP.

Successful applications by iwi include intergenerational programmes in Kaeo and Rotorua.

The complete list of communities that will receive funding includes Kaeo, Whangarei, North Shore, Auckland, Manukau, Hamilton, Rotorua, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Masterton, Wellington, Hutt Valley, Nelson, Christchurch, Alexandra, Dunedin and Invercargill.

Mr Carter said the funding gave communities across New Zealand the opportunity to celebrate their older people in a diversity of ways.

"Society today is pretty much youth-focused so let's grab this International Year with both hands and make older people the centre of attention," he says.

Mr Carter plans to visit organisers of some of the events in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch before the end of the month, when the funding will be confirmed for all 24 successful applicants.
