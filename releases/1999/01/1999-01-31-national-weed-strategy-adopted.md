Conservation Minister Nick Smith today launched the Department of Conservation 's weed strategy on Motutapu Island, with sobering facts and figures about the threats of these space invaders.

'New Zealand's native plants are under threat of extinction from some of the wild aliens growing in our gardens. Weeds could threaten more than half a million hectares of protected natural areas within 10-15 years. This is an area the size of Auckland City. New Zealand has only 2400 native plants, compared to a staggering 19,000 introduced plants, of which 2000 species are now established in the wild. These weeds are not just a threat to our native plants, they also threaten our animals by destroying nesting and feeding areas. Most of our native plants and animals are unique to this country because they developed under special environmental conditions.'

'Most New Zealanders recognise possums as a major threat but they probably don't realise the threats posed by plants like old man's beard, wild ginger, pampas and Pinus contorta. These plants are capable of swallowing up whole areas in an incredibly short time, leaving only drab masses of the same thing - weeds.'

'It's no accident that the weediest places are often those closest to towns. Three quarters of these invasive weeds were originally garden plants. People can help by not growing these dangerous plants in their gardens, not dumping rubbish from gardens or fish tanks, and being careful not to spread seeds or fragments.'

A lot of good work has taken place in the area of weeds at both a national and local level. What has been lacking is an overall strategic plan that ties together the work of the Department of Conservation, regional councils, landowners and Iwi. This framework will provide an overall plan in which each of the agencies can see their role.

'DoC is doing a lot to control weeds in the special places it manages for New Zealanders, but they cannot protect our country's natural heritage from the impact of weeds on their own.'
