Prime Minister Jenny Shipley yesterday sent a message of congratulations on behalf of New Zealand to His Royal Highness The Prince Edward, CVO on his engagement to Miss Sophie Rhys-Jones.

"Many New Zealanders feel an affinity with His Royal Highness from the period he spent as a master at Wanganui Collegiate School in the early 1980s.

"His Royal Highness has a great many New Zealand supporters and I am sure they would want their congratulations and best wishes conveyed to the Prince and his fiancee.

"The message extends to Prince Edward and Miss Sophie Rhys-Jones New Zealanders' best wishes and congratulations. We wish them both much joy and happiness," Mrs Shipley said.
