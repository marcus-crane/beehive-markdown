Prime Minister Jenny Shipley will advance New Zealand's trade interests and its goals for this year's APEC summit on a visit to Ottawa and Washington D.C. this week.

Mrs Shipley has arranged a tight timetable of meetings in both capitals.

"It's going to be a busy few days, but I've been delighted at the extent to which the Canadians and Americans want to use my time to discuss both bilateral trade issues and my goals as chair of APEC this year," Mrs Shipley said.

"It's vital to position APEC for the emerging signs of recovery from the Asian crisis and to see that we put systems in place that will bring real benefits to business.

Her State visit to Canada will focus on a meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the key ministers responsible for APEC.

Mrs Shipley's visit to Washington arose when Vice-President Al Gore invited her to be keynote speaker at an international forum on reinventing government. She will outline the successes and pitfalls of New Zealand's reforms over the last 15 years.

In addition, Mrs Shipley will meet guests including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Transport Secretary Rodney Slater at a dinner to be held at the residence of the New Zealand Ambassador.

She will also hold meetings with United States Cabinet members including:

Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala

"These meetings give us the opportunity to address APEC issues including: developing an adequate response to the Asian financial crisis; ensuring that APEC members' food systems, border management and electronic commerce issues are advanced together; and promoting the free trade agenda," Mrs Shipley said.

She will also discuss bilateral trade issues and seek assessments of the outlook for the United States and global economies. "I'll also be keen to discuss health issues with Donna Shalala, to talk about how the United States is trying to cope with the ever-increasing demands on health budgets," Mrs Shipley said.
