Civil Defence reform has had no impact on the Government response to the Hokianga floods, according to the Minister of Civil Defence, Jack Elder.

He said the Leader of the Opposition, Helen Clark, is wrong to suggest the Far North had been caught in the middle of changes to Civil Defence management and that the Government's response was belated and inadequate

"As was made clear yesterday the government has been involved from the outset, with the Ministry of Civil Defence providing emergency relief since Friday," Mr Elder said. "And I can state categorically that the Civil Defence reforms have had no impact on the response effort in the Hokianga district.

"Exactly the same procedures that were followed in last year's flood in Ohura were used for the Far North.

"The timing of the appointment of a Disaster Recovery Co-ordinator is also similar to what happened in Ohura. Such appointments come after the initial response to an emergency has been completed."
