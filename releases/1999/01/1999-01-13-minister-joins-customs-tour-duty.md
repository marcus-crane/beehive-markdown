The Minister responsible for the day to day operations of Customs, Hon David Carter, will join staff on Custom's new patrol vessel, Hawk IV, this Friday, when it tours the Marlborough Sounds asking locals to support the Coastwatch programme.

Staff on the Hawk IV are on a "tour of duty" encouraging more New Zealanders to provide Customs with information about suspicious and unusual boat and plane movements along New Zealand's coastline.

Hawk IV is departing from Wellington today for the Marlborough Sounds, and will be in Picton on Friday, before moving onto Nelson, New Plymouth, Houhora and finishing up at Auckland.

Mr Carter said Customs staff did an excellent job protecting the borders, but help was needed in remote locations where Customs coverage wasn't readily available.

"The Marlborough Sounds is a prime example of this. At the height of summer up to 2000 vessels can be active in the Sounds. The potential for the importation of prohibited goods and the export of protected species is a very real threat in the Marlborough Sounds."

"From Custom's experience the Sounds is particularly vulnerable to boats arriving illegally from Australia, Asia and the Pacific, and the risks these vessels present to the public, let alone New Zealand's flora and fauna, can't be under-stated."

Mr Carter said members of the public could play a significant role in assisting Customs with their surveillance and the Coastwatch programme encouraged people with concerns about suspicious boat and plane activity to call a Customs freephone number.

"The kind of information Customs is looking for is reports of craft travelling at nighttime without navigation lights, or the meeting of craft or planes at remote locations."

"Just across the Tasman late last year Customs seized 400 kilos of heroin and 200 kilos of cocaine from vessels attempting to enter Australia illegally. We can't think we're immune from this kind of activity."

Mr Carter will join Customs staff on Friday morning, taking part in the Hawk IV open day on Picton's waterfront from 10.30am to 1pm.

Marlborough people wishing to find out more about the Coastwatch programme are encouraged to attend the open day or make direct contact with the crew of the Hawk IV while they patrol the Marlborough Sounds over the next two days.

Alternatively, people can contact the 0800 Coastwatch number (0800 654 279) or their local Customs office for information on the Coastwatch programme.
