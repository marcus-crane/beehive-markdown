Food and Fibre Minister, Hon John Luxton, will visit drought parched canterbury tomorrow and meet with local Federated Farmers to discuss the drought situation.

Mr Luxton said today, "Despite what some say in the cities, farmers make an ernourmous contributioin to New Zealand, with around three quarters of our $20 billion exports coming from the primary sector.

"But despite all their hard work, weather conditions can be very frustrating and stress full for farming families.

"Farmers and rural people are very resilient and justifiably proud of what they do but when the water runs dry they need the support from the wider community.

The best solution is rain, and it is great to see that parts of the North Island have received some yesterday.

For some farmers they are going into their second year of drought. I want to again talk directly to those affected to see how the Government may be able to assist. I will be briefing my colleagues at our next Cabinet meeting, " Mr Luxton said.

Note: Mr Luxton will be meeting interested parties at the Canterbury Regional Council, Kilmore Street, Christchurch at 10.15 am to discuss the water shortage. Following that meeting he will then travel to the farm of Murray and Gina Taggart, Cust, North Canterbury to meet with farmers
