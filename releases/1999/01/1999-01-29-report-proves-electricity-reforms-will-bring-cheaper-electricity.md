Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says the Ernstand Young annual review of electric power companies report proves that the former electricity reforms were not as effective as they should have been.

Mr Bradford says the report looks at the financial period to the end of March 1998, which is prior to the latest electricity reforms announced by the Government in April last year.

"The report clearly states that the lack of an efficient structure for the industry means that to date, neither the customers nor the shareholders have seen the benefits of a reformed and restructured industry," Mr Bradford said.

But he says the report does forecast that consumers will see marked benefits in 2000 after the restructuring of the electricity sector, which starts on the 1st of April this year.

"The fact that rates of return have continued for the monopoly side of the business, (the lines businesses), simply proves the need for some form of regulatory oversight," Mr Bradford said.

"The Government announced before Christmas, a proposal of regulation over the monopoly line businesses, and the final framework of regulation will be put in place before the 1st of April."
