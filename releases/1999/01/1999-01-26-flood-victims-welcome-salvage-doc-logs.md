Conservation Minister Nick Smith buried rumours that DoC had ever suggested it might claim ownership of logs washed onto private land in the Northland floods and said flood victims were most welcome to mill any salvageable timber to assist in rebuilding their homes and communities.

"The Department wants to do its bit to help flood victims. It has offered the Far North District Council staff, vehicles and machinery to assist in the immediate clean-up. Some DoC staff have been relieved of work obligations to clean-up their own homes or assist families, but all others are being offered to assist."

"The rumour that DoC is somehow trying to claim ownership and marking logs or stumps is untrue. I find it offensive that people assert that DoC is attempting to profit from this tragedy without any evidence whatsoever to back up this claim. It is particularly hard on local DoC staff who are working to help families stricken in the devastating floods. I can only deduce that tensions arising from the flood devastation has given rise to rumour becoming fact and in such circumstances, DoC is an easy whipping boy."

"Logs swept from public lands administered by DoC are free to be used by local people to help rebuild homes or other community facilities. The Department's view is that the rights to use the logs rests with the property owner on which the logs lie. If the lost logs can be put to good use, the Department would welcome it."

"The Department of Conservation is very much part of the Northland community and shares in their loss from the floods. We are doing all we can to try and help with the clean-up and reconstruction."
