Tourism Minister, Murray McCully has launched a New Zealand Tourism Board America's Cup Campaign on Australia Day in Sydney today.

Following this morning's launch of the Board's Global Branding Campaign by the Prime Minister in London, the America's Cup Campaign aims to boost short-term visitor numbers to New Zealand and lift the New Zealand brand profile.

Guests attending the Launch included Federal Minister for Sport and Tourism, Hon Jackie Kelly, and New South Wales Olympic Minister, the Hon Michael Knight.

Mr McCully told Sydney journalists that increased promotion last year had resulted in a 14% increase in Australian visitor numbers to New Zealand.

"When the December figures are available I believe we will have topped 500,000 Australian visitors for the 1998 calendar year for the first time."

"Australia Day is a huge day for activity on the Sydney Harbour. Our promotion tells Australians that the America's Cup will see the Hauraki Gulf looking like Sydney on Australia Day - but it will last for over five months."
