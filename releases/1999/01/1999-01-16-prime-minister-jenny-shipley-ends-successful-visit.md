Prime Minister Jenny Shipley left North America today at the end of a visit which she described as "a week very well spent from New Zealand's point of view."

Mrs Shipley said the visit proved timely in both countries, especially as an opportunity to receive soundings on the global economy and to launch New Zealand's year as chair of APEC.

"My meetings have been a great springboard from which we're pushing for practical, business-friendly results from APEC and the upcoming WTO round," she said.

Mrs Shipley was speaking shortly after a meeting with United States President Bill Clinton.

"I've had a very warm reception from everyone I have met, and that reflects the good standing New Zealand enjoys in Canada and the United States.

"In my meeting with President Clinton he stressed how much he was looking forward to visiting New Zealand this year and seeing as much of the country as possible.

"And I assured him he will receive a warm welcome from all New Zealanders," she said.

Mrs Shipley and President Clinton discussed the outlook for promoting international trade and they affirmed the two countries' shared interest in international security and peacekeeping.

She said her attendance at Vice President Al Gore's international forum on re-inventing government underlined the strong interest in New Zealand's experience.

"This clearly was timely as many countries which have been affected by the Asian financial turmoil are looking at economic changes that will re-establish investor confidence in their countries.

"We sometimes take for granted how far we've come, but many countries want to pick up New Zealand's ideas and run with them."

In Canada and the United States Mrs Shipley pushed the country's case for New Zealand candidates to lead the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Trade Organisation.

"I was delighted to receive Canada's endorsement of Hon Don McKinnon for the Commonwealth position.

"And I was convinced in both countries that it was well worth while continuing to push Mike Moore's WTO candidacy," Mrs Shipley said.
