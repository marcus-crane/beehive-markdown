Defence Minister Max Bradford is flying to the Ross Sea with an aerial surveillance team searching for "pirate" vessels fishing for Toothfish.

Mr Bradford said he is taking the day-long flight as a sign of the government's commitment to stamp out illegal poaching of the Toothfish.

"The government is gravely concerned that illegal fishing could be happening in New Zealand waters. I am determined that it doesn't occur." Mr Bradford said.

Today's flight is the third of an aerial surveillance programme which started on the 14th January 1999.

The programme is designed to familiarise crews with the Ross Sea area, as well as search for illegal fishing vessels.

The results of the programme will be announced in due course.
