Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford says the rush by South Island MPs to take credit for last year's drop in oil prices seems to ignore two critical facts, first the drop in crude oil prices around the world, and secondly, the Government's introduction of competition.

"These are the principle reasons why petrol prices have fallen in both North and South Islands," Mr Bradford said.

Responding to recent reports about petrol prices in the South Island, Mr Bradford said: "The stark reality is that petrol prices have dropped throughout New Zealand since the arrival of Challenge."

For example, Statistics New Zealand figures for the weighted average retail prices of regular petrol (91 Octane) show that since the arrival of Challenge stations, there has been a 7.3 per cent drop in Auckland, 8.1 per cent drop in Wellington, 9.2 per cent drop in Rotorua, 4.2 per cent drop in Nelson, 4.5 per cent drop in Christchurch, 3.9 per cent drop in Timaru and 4 per cent drop in Dunedin.

"These figures clearly show the benefits of introducing vigorous competition," Mr Bradford said.

"Standard pricing for petroleum products disappeared many years ago, and prices now more properly reflect the price of delivering petrol across New Zealand. This inevitably reflects the low population density of the South Island compared with the North.

"While petrol prices may be higher on average in the South Island, it is important to also remember that other prices are lower in the South Island, such as electricity, land and housing.

"South Islanders benefit from cheaper electricity, for example,because they are closer to cheaper hydro electricity production than North Islanders. But like petrol, the Government's introduction of competition in the electricity industry is lowering prices in both South and North Islands.

"This is the sort of swings and roundabouts situation which is a fact of life today, and which South Island MPs need to remember when they comment on issues like petrol prices."

Meanwhile, Mr Bradford supported the Commerce Commission'scomments that it would welcome any evidence of price fixing by oil companies so that it could start an investigation.

Mr Bradford urged anybody with such information to contact the Commerce Commission.
