Health Minister Bill English today released a second report on the proposed new hospital for Wellington.

"This report has been prepared by Capital Coast Health and further explores the regional hospital options.

"We are still some way off being able to make a decision on whether or not to go ahead with a new hospital, either at the present Newtown site or somewhere else. The public will have an opportunity for input before any final decisions are made.

"However, I have agreed Capital Coast Health and other agencies should proceed with the development of detailed proposals, supported by a business case, for hospital facilities in the region. This is a major undertaking and it is difficult to put a timeframe on when a proposal might be ready for final consideration, but I would estimate it is some months away yet.

"This report does not recommend a particular site. Rather it recommends that the opportunity to build a new hospital for Wellington should not be passed up.

Key questions that need to be considered at this stage are:

whether Wellington needs or should have a new regional hospital  
if so, which site would be best.  
"The Government will be interested in seeing a proposal, supported by a business case, that has taken into account public views about the best site.

"Building a new hospital may also involve some changes to where and how hospital services are delivered and the Health Funding Authority has obligations regarding consultation over service changes.

"Just exactly what the best process is for coordinating public input is not yet clear. We are still working through those details, but the public can be reassured there will be plenty of opportunity for input before a decision is made.

"In releasing this report I would emphasise that it is not a final report and that no decisions or decisions in principle have been made yet. This report is business and management focussed and there are wider issues that will be taken into account before a firm proposal is considered," said Mr English.
