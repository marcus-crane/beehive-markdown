"I am delighted with my new responsibility as Minister for Tertiary Education, to add to my primary responsibilities for Enterprise,Commerce, Labour, Energy and Defence," said Max Bradford, MP for Rotorua.

Mr Bradford was commenting on the Cabinet reshuffle announced today by the Prime Minister in which he has assumed responsibility for all tertiary educational institutions and industry training, to add to his responsibilities as Minister of Enterprise and Commerce, and Minister of Defence.

"The Prime Minister and I have been aiming to reshape the emphasis of the economic growth drivers for New Zealand, by ensuring that any barriers to New Zealand enterprises developing into world class, rapidly growing organisations are removed," Mr Bradford said.

"In addition, there are a number of new initiatives I have under way to inject new life into Government policies affecting business. The new Cabinet responsibilities announced by the Prime Minister reflect this.

"The general economic policy environment of low inflation, lowinterest rates, conservative Budget management, flexible labour markets and competitive markets established over the past 10years or so are an essential platform for any successful economy operating in international markets. That won't change.

"However, as essential as these conditions are, they aren't enough on their own. New Zealand enterprise needs world class tertiary education that is relevant to the changing needs of the economy and New Zealand society. We need greater focus through our research bodies, and through research and development funding to build up our winning industries.

"That is the focus that can be applied through the Enterprise and Innovation Team. Maurice Williamson, Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, and Simon Upton, Minister for Crown Research Institutes, will play an important role in getting the focus and enthusiasm we need in Government.

"I see the emphasis on fiscal responsibility, which has driven much of government policy for the past few years, as being complemented by a much more aggressive concentration on facilitating the best growth prospects in New Zealand industry and agriculture.

"This is where the future growth of New Zealand will come from -- how good our education system is; how well are our labour markets working; are our immigration policies adequate; are Government policies and taxes getting in the way of the country's economic growth potential and the aspirations of New Zealanders?"

"This aggressive concentration does not mean adopting old-hat industrial policies of subsidy and central government direction which characterise the Labour/Alliance approach."

Mr Bradford indicated that he would be making a major speech in Christchurch on Tuesday, 9 February, outlining the Government's broad proposals for enterprise policy.
