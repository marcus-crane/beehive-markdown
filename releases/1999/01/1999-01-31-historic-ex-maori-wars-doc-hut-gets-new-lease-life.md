Conservation Minister Nick Smith today opened the refurbished 144 year old Camphouse on Mt Egmont/Taranaki which he said would rate not only as the oldest but the most interesting of DoC's 800 huts around the country.

"This building is bursting with history. It was originally constructed to house British troops in the New Zealand Maori Wars and is the only building left from that era. It is also the oldest corrugated iron building in New Zealand and the oldest of any in a National Park."

The Department of Conservation has spent $220,000 on protecting the derelict building from demolition and has made it suitable as a hut for trampers on Mt Egmont/Taranaki. The facelift has included restoration of the building's historic integrity as well as new ablutions and kitchen, a repaint and installation of a sprinkler system. Conservation Minister Nick Smith, after opening the new hut up ventured up Mt Egmont/Taranaki before returning and staying overnight in the Camphouse. Dr Smith said the project was part of a package of improvements he wanted to see on the mountain to improve facilities. The Department was working closely with the Taranaki Regional Council on a major upgrade of the adjacent visitors centre. "Mt Egmont/Taranaki is one of New Zealand's great icons. We need to marry its rich history and scenic beauty with improved facilities so that it is second to none as a visitor destination."
