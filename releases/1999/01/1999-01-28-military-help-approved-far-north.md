A request from the Far North District Council for military assistance in the aftermath of the Hokianga flash flood has been approved, the Minister of Civil Defence, Jack Elder, announced today.

The council has asked for military logistical help in the sorting and distribution of goods donated to flood victims.

Two or three defence personnel will begin the task as soon as possible, Mr Elder said.
