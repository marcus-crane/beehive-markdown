New Zealand and China concluded a Statement of Antarctic Cooperation today. The Statement was signed by the Associate Minister of  
Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister responsible for Antarctic Affairs, Hon Simon Upton, and Minister Assistant of Foreign Affairs of the  
People's Republic of China, Mr Wang Guangya.

"Antarctica New Zealand and the Chinese Antarctic and Arctic Administration will now have a greater opportunity to develop joint scientific  
projects in the Antarctic, particularly projects looking at the impact of human activities on the Antarctic environment", Minister Upton said.

"I am pleased to see New Zealand develop its international Antarctic science links", continued the Minister. "It is important that Antarctic Treaty  
nations commit themselves to international collaboration on the Ice. This is a central element of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic  
Treaty which has been ratified by both New Zealand and China."

Mr Wang Guangya will attend the "Ministerial-on-Ice" in Antarctica next week with Mr Upton and Ministers and representatives from 22 other  
nations.
