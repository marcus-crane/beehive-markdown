Minister of Food and Fibre, Hon John Luxton said today that the Government will continue funding for the drought relief effort to support farming families. Funds will be made available immediately and a meeting will be convened on February 11 to review support to date and any fine tuning that may be required.

"Despite rains in some regions, the drought situation is still very serious. In Canterbury earlier this week I saw the harsh effects that a second year of drought can have. Hawkes Bay, Otago, Marlborough are still all affected to differing degrees as well. The effects of the drought is tough on farming families and rural communities. I want them to know that they have support from the wider community.

"Today I have briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the drought situation across the whole country. It is a major concern. I want to acknowledge the hard work and effort put in over the last year by all those involved in providing assistance in drought areas.

"The continuing and heightening needs are for family support. Emphasis will therefore be given to supporting the work of the rural trusts that are well established in the drought affected East Coast regions from East Cape to Otago.

The Rural trusts provide independent counselling and financial negotiation services for farming families that approach them.

"Cabinet has agreed to make funds available immediately which can be applied for by affected rural communities through the Trusts or other relevant bodies. We have also agreed to continue the Rural Sector Assistance Programs through other Government agencies on a as needs requires basis. And I will be convening a meeting on February 11 to review all assistance to date and look if we need to fine tune it."

The Minister said that he expects an application from the Otago Relief Committee soon and he will consider assistance along the lines of that approved last year.

"We will also convene a meeting on February 11 with key people involved. This will provide an opportunity to review issues that have arisen in the management of adverse events and in the guidelines for Rural Sector Assistance."

The Minister will be visiting drought areas in Otago on 5 February and hope to also visit other drought affected areas.

**Background**

For many farmers this is the second season of serious drought. There is less opportunity this summer to shift stock to areas on the west coast of the North Island as the growing spring season has been poor. However, the Marlborough spring allowed a good recovery of feed reserves while in Canterbury there was also a good feed recovery in spring. Pressure on feed was reduced by lower than usual stock numbers.

But over all of the East Coast there has been a dramatic drying out of soils since the last significant rain in mid December. The recent rains reduced the fire hazard for a few days, but has not improved the deteriorating situation. Aquifers and surface water resources are at record low levels in Hawkes Bay, Canterbury and parts of Otago. This will mean restrictions on the use of water for irrigation. Even if normal rainfall patterns occur over the next few months the aquifers will not begin to recharge until next winter. This is a significant new expansion of the drought effects that we did not see last year.

The drought effects are deepening especially in parts of Central and North Otago. A drought relief committee with regional representation has been established to coordinate the relief effort similar to what has happened in other areas.
