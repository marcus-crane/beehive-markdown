Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said today that he welcomed comments by Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, suggesting that independence for East Timor might be considered, if its current proposal for autonomy is not accepted.

"News that East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao will be moved from prison to a form of house arrest is equally welcome. This is a step we urged Indonesia to take after our Ambassador met with Gusmao six months ago."

Mr McKinnon said that Indonesia's suggestion about East Timor's future needed to be clarified and he was waiting for more detailed reports about Foreign Minister Alatas's remarks. He noted that the independence proposal would need to be considered by Indonesia's Legislative Assembly which is only due to meet after the elections planned for in June. It would clearly take some time for that body to get around to serious consideration of East Timor's future.

"Nonetheless, what Minister Alatas has said is very significant. It shows that there is flexibility in Indonesia's thinking. It also comes as the next round of UN-sponsored negotiations is about to start. This is a great opportunity for the parties to reach agreement and settle the East Timor issue for once and all.

"New Zealand can live with any solution the parties agree to. Any durable solution must meet the aspiration of the East Timorese people themselves - and we have been urging the parties to the negotiations to ensure that their voice is more fully represented in these talks. The move regarding Gustmao suggests this is starting to happen."
