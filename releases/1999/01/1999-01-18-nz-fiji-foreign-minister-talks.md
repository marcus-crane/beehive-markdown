Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will hold bilateral talks with his Fiji Islands counterpart Berenado Vunibobo in Auckland tomorrow, for the first of what are to be annual consultations.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand placed a high value on the close and cooperative relationship it had with Fiji, and felt both countries would benefit from regular ministerial dialogue.

"Mr Vunibobo I will be discussing options for freeing trade and enhancing economic cooperation opportunities," Mr McKinnon said.

"Fiji is an important trading partner for New Zealand, taking $190 million in exports in 1997/98, which is an increase of 18% over the previous year. Fiji's exports to New Zealand are also on the increase."

Mr McKinnon also noted Fiji's contribution to the peace monitoring effort on Bougainville.

"The professionalism and cultural understanding of Fiji's personnel has been important to the success of the monitoring effort. Mr Vunibobo and I will review recent developments in the peace process".

The wider defence relationship will also be reviewed.

"The Mutual Assistance Programme, which provides training and exercise opportunities for the defence forces of both countries, is greatly valued by New Zealand," Mr McKinnon added.

"We will also discuss New Zealand's development assistance programme, which presently funds $5 million worth of projects annually."

Mr Vunibobo will be accompanied by the Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau. The Fiji delegation arrives in Auckland today and is scheduled to leave on Thursday.

(The meeting will be held at 10am at the Rodney District Council Office, Centreway Road, Orewa.)
