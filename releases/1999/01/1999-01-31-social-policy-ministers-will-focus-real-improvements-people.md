A new team of ministers will take charge of the key areas of health and school and pre-school education with a mandate to deliver practical policies that will foster healthy, well-educated, highly motivated communities, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

The Prime Minister announced that Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech is to become Minister of Health, while Nick Smith will take responsibility for early childhood and compulsory Education.

"I have asked the new ministers to consolidate the reforms that both sectors had been through and to demand new levels of service for New Zealanders," Mrs Shipley said.

"Both Health and Education have been through a lot of change in recent years. Our work is bringing real results in healthcare and better education for all our children.

"Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech brings a huge depth of Ministerial experience to the complex area of health. He has delivered terrific results in the education sector, and will now apply those same skills to the health needs of New Zealanders," Mrs Shipley said.

Nick Smith will take over as Minister of Education, responsible for the compulsory and pre-school sector. He will be working closely with the other ministers responsible for education, including Associate Education Minister for Early Childhood Education and Maori Education, Tau Henare.

"He comes to Education strongly motivated to see that all children are given every chance to read and write well, so they can reach their full potential.

"His experience as Corrections Minister and Associate Minister of Social Services, Work and Income has made him passionate about putting in maximum effort with children, to prevent problems before they develop.

"Education is the key to lifting people's prospects and we have a good record to build on.

"I have asked Nick Smith to concentrate on seeing that schools are performing at the highest level so that parents can be confident their children are getting the best education, wherever they live. Every child must have the best chance of success.

"My Government is determined that parents have the freedom to choose among top-line educators, with the security of knowing that standards are high across the board," Mrs Shipley said.
