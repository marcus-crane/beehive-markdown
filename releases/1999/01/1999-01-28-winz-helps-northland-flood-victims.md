In the aftermath of Northland's destructive floods, Work and Income New Zealand staff were well prepared to provide help to the victims, said the Hon Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income.

By Monday morning WINZ had two mobile offices dispatched to the worst-affected areas and four staff started an initial assessment of the people's needs.

"The team rolled up their sleeves and got straight to work finding out who needed what - both in the short and longer term."

WINZ staff have been providing emergency funds to effected people plus compiling a register of people who had suffered in the floods. Requests are also coming in from people who have lost whiteware, water tanks and sewage connections, and who are concerned they can't afford the costs.

In the longer term WINZ, after consultation with council and Civil Defense, may be able to assist with the clean-up by arranging TaskForce Green projects and Community Work programmes.

"I'm very proud of the co-ordinated response to the situation and would like to commend the WINZ teams involved," Mr Sowry said.
