The Prime Minister extended the best wishes of all New Zealanders to explorer Peter Hillary and his team when he called Mrs Shipley from  
Antarctica last night.

"We had an engaging conversation about the weather, comparing Antarctica on a warm day at -30 degrees to the current temperature in Ottawa  
Canada where I am travelling to today, a cool -20 degrees.

"He seemed in very good spirits, and talked with confidence of reaching the Pole within 10 days as long as he and his colleagues Jon Muir and  
Eric Philips didn't strike any unanticipated hazards.

"They had just ended a very successful day continuing to make progress towards the Pole, still greatly boosted by their traverse in late  
December of a new route over the Shackleton Glacier.

"He told me they were exhilarated at their achievement and that it was a huge privilege to have been able to attempt the challenge and meet it.

"Peter Hillary admitted there had been times when the challenge of completing the whole crossing had been overwhelming, but now they had the  
Pole within sight they realised the importance of reaching their goal both personally and for others supporting them.

"I have great admiration for Peter Hillary and his team, particularly for testing the boundaries, and as New Zealanders setting themselves  
challenges that few others have met.

"It is very inspiring to see New Zealanders searching for an unmet challenge and rising to meet it," Mrs Shipley said.
