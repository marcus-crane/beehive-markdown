Minister for Courts, the Hon Georgina te Heuheu, today welcomed the swearing in of ten community magistrates to service the Hamilton and Huntly areas. Sixteen community magistrates have been selected to be part of a pilot scheme in Tauranga, Whakatane, Hamilton and Huntly.

"This is a landmark development for our justice system."

"Our justice system is sometimes viewed as being distant and remote, with the administration of justice being seen to be the responsibility of lawyers and judges."

"The appointment of community magistrates presents the opportunity for justice to become the responsibility of communities."

"Traditionally, communities have set the standards for what is fair and reasonable behaviour," Mrs te Heuheu said.

"This initiative will empower our communities and, at the same time, enhance our justice system."

Mrs te Heuheu said the community magistrates, like Justices of the Peace, will have the power to impose sentences in cases involving defended and non defended minor fines only offences, most commonly traffic offences. They will also hear bail and remand applications and conduct preliminary hearings for more serious charges.

"They have a chance to spearhead changes to our justice system which would make it more responsive to the needs of our communities. We must never lose sight of the fact that our courts are very much a part of our community so the more we can involve people in our judicial process the more chance we will have of delivering better outcomes for the community."

Mrs te Heuheu said there were 210 applicants for the 16 Community Magistrates positions.

"So those who have been appointed are of a very high calibre and I have no doubt they will make their communities and families very proud," Mrs te Heuheu said.
