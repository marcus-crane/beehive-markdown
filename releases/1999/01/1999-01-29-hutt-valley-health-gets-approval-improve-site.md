Health Minister Bill English announced today that the Government had approved a $7.5 million plan from Hutt Valley Health to make improvements to the Hutt Hospital site.

"This is the final step in a long-term project to modernise the hospital site. It is part of a $2 billion investment programme in our public hospitals.

"The plan will mean a number of improvements can be made to the hospital site. These include:

bringing core medical and surgical services together into the clinical service block  
achieving efficiency savings of $0.84 million a year  
avoiding having to upgrade old buildings to bring them into line with compliance and safety requirements.  
"The changes will mean that services can be brought together onto a smaller area which makes sense from a patient and hospital management perspective. It will also mean some surplus land and buildings can be sold.

"Work is expected to start within the next few weeks," said Mr English.
