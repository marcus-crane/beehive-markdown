Corrections Minister Nick Smith today released the first six month results of inmate drug testing showing good progress in reducing prison drug use.

"Drugs have been rife in our prisons for too long. We are taking a firm approach and are determined to rid prisons of them. We've increased prison security, introduced drug dogs, put more resources into monitoring visitors and introduced drug testing. The drug testing has confirmed the seriousness of the problem but it is also showing that we are making solid progress."

Results from the first three months of testing (March, April and May 1998) were used to establish a 'baseline' for the drug use of inmates. 35% tested positive. A target was set to cut that figure to 27.5% by June 1999.

The latest figures are encouraging. They show drug use among inmates has dropped from 35% to 21%. While this is still too high, it shows we are making progress. Clearly random drug testing is having an impact on inmate behaviour. Inmates now know there is a very good chance that if they are abusing drugs inside, that they will get caught."

"Random drug testing is one of a range of measures to reduce drugs in prisons. Additional drug dogs, non-contact booths and intensified visitor searching are just as important in thwarting drug dealers from supplying inmates. Visitors are the main supplies of drugs into prisons."

"We have vehicle checkpoints intercepting drugs intended for smuggling inside by visitors, who are responsible for an estimated 80% of prison drug supply. Sniffer dogs at vehicle checkpoints is one of the best ways of stopping drugs being smuggled inside. My plan is also to tighten security through building more perimeter fencing, which should make it harder to get drugs into prison. Drug testing gives us the data to target additional resources to where the drug problem is the worst."

"Rehabilitation of drug abusers is as much part of the solution as choking the supply and penalizing the users. By June 30 this year, the Department will have 9 specialist drug units where programmes to support inmates staying drug-free are provided."

"Far too much criminal offending is drug related. Breaking the cycle of re-offending means getting on top of drugs in prisons."
