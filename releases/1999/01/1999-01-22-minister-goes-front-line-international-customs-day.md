Associate Border Control Minister Hon David Carter MP will provide an extra special welcome for some international passengers arriving at Christchurch on Tuesday 26 January 1999.

As Minister responsible for day to day Customs operations, Mr Carter will mark International Customs Day at the new Christchurch International Terminal where he will personally greet passengers arriving from Japan.

"It's a novel way of celebrating International Customs Day", said the Banks Peninsula MP, who will present a selection of kiwi gifts to some lucky passengers when they disembark from the Air New Zealand Flight NZ98 at about 11.10am on Tuesday morning.

"Unfortunately many people perceive Custom Officers as an intimidating, not welcoming presence, at international airports."

"I know from first-hand experience that our Customs officers do their best, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, to make people feel welcome when arriving in our country."

"Customs focus undeniably is on detecting criminal activity crossing our borders. Without Customs we would have more drug related crime, more illegal firearms, more pornography, entering New Zealand."

"International Customs Day is an initiative promoted by the Brussels based World Customs Organisation, to publicise the work of Customs organisations globally."

"It gives all of us an opportunity to recognise in particular the work that the New Zealand Customs Service does in protecting our boarders."

Mr Carter says he is looking forward to greeting the passengers off NZ98 at Christchurch International airport on Tuesday. Senior Customs Officers will brief the Minister on related airport operations, during his tour of the new international terminal.
