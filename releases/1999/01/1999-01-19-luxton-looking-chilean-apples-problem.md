Food, Biosecurity and Border Control Minister John Luxton is seeking more information on allegations that some Chilean orchardists are unlawfully growing New Zealand-registered apple varieties.

Mr Luxton said ENZA Fruit NZ Ltd had informed him this morning that it was proposing to take action against Chilean growers of registered New Zealand apple varieties Pacific Rose and Southern Snap.

Both the ENZA board and Hort Research New Zealand believed the Chileans were contravening intellectual property rights in the ownership and commercial exploitation of the varieties, the Minister said.

"The Government is always concerned about suggestions that New Zealand-registered plant varieties are being exploited without approval of the owners and licence holders," Mr Luxton said.

"I am sure that other horticultural and plant exporters around the world will share this concern, and I am asking the ENZA board for more information on this particular situation."
