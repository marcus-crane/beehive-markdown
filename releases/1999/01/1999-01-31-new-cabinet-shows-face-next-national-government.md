Investing in New Zealanders' skills and strengthening our economic future are the focus of Cabinet changes announced today by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

"New Zealanders can look at this line-up and see that National is continuing its strong tradition of economic management in the best interests of all of us, while giving sharp focus to developing the country's intellectual fire-power for the future.

"The line-up you see in my Cabinet today represents a generational shift. I haven't seen a time in politics when outgoing senior ministers have been able to hand over their portfolios to such an impressive range of ministers.

"In deciding the new line-up, I've drawn on the depth of talent available to achieve a balance between continuity and experience, with emphasis on the promotion of talent," Mrs Shipley said.

The key moves in today's announcements are:

Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech is to become Minister of Health; Bill English is to become Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue; Max Bradford will take up the new role of Minister for Tertiary Education; Nick Smith is to be Minister of Education; New law and order ministers are to be appointed - Tony Ryall as Minister of Justice and Clem Simich as Minister of Corrections.

"As a result of today's changes, Mr Birch will remain as Treasurer to present this year's Budget, which will harness the momentum of economic recovery. After the Budget Mr English will take over as Treasurer and Mr Birch will pick up the Finance and Revenue portfolios.

"Under Mr Birch's careful guidance New Zealand has managed to come through the Asian economic turmoil far better than anyone had expected, and his final Budget will build on the recovery to secure a very robust future," Mrs Shipley said.

"We can rest assured that Mr English will continue Mr Birch's firm management. He has proven himself to be a highly competent Minister, and his years in the Health portfolio have given him a very good understanding of New Zealand's social needs. He knows that good economic management is about more than dollars and budgets - it is about people.

"Max Bradford's new role as Minister for Tertiary Education will be strongly linked to his current responsibilities as Enterprise and Commerce Minister," Mrs Shipley said.

"I want our universities and tertiary institutions to be sharply focused on producing the skilled people New Zealand needs in the future.

"As Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, Max Bradford is promoting investment in innovation and human skills. This extension of his responsibilities will allow him to harness the resources of New Zealand's research and higher education institutions for that effort."

In other changes announced today, Tony Ryall will take over as Minister of Justice and Clem Simich will take responsibility for Corrections, alongside his role as Minister of Police.

Roger Sowry retains his role as Minister of Social Services, Work and Income, and will take on the additional role of Minister responsible for minority Government management, where his work will fit well with his role as Leader of the House. Bill Birch will pick up from Wyatt Creech responsibility for Ministerial Services and the Government Legislation programme.

Nick Smith is to take over as Minister of Education, responsible for the school and pre-school sectors, and the Education Review Office. He will work closely with the other Ministers in this area, including the Associate Education Minister (Early Childhood Education and Maori Education), Tau Henare.

Responsibility for Housing New Zealand is to pass from Murray McCully to Tony Ryall, who will be responsible for the business aspects of Housing New Zealand in line with his other SOE responsibilities. Roger Sowry will take over responsibility for the Housing Corporation, alongside his role overseeing housing policy advice.

Maurice Williamson is to resume responsibility for Local Government, where the work meshes closely with his Transport portfolio.

Outside Cabinet, Marie Hasler will become Minister Responsible for Radio New Zealand, alongside her role as Minister of Cultural Affairs.

The Prime Minister expects the changes to be officially confirmed by the Governor General tomorrow, in time for Tuesday's cabinet meeting.

"In securing a knowledge and skills-based future my new Ministry will also be securing a healthy and well-educated community, with a sharp focus on law and order," Mrs Shipley said.
