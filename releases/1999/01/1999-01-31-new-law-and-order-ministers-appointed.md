Tony Ryall is to be the new Minister of Justice and Clem Simich will become Minister of Corrections, while maintaining his Police responsibilities, to confront the hard justice issues that are worrying many New Zealanders, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today.

They will take over from Sir Douglas Graham and Nick Smith respectively, and will be responsible for initiatives that will maintain confidence in the justice system.

"We will confront the fears that have arisen in response to alarming trends such as the increase in home invasions, and deal with them.

"A justice system that people have faith in is fundamental to people's security. I wanted to lay out the succession of ministers well in advance of Sir Douglas's retirement," Mrs Shipley said.

She said Sir Douglas had been an innovative and forward-thinking Justice Minister, and he would hand over to Mr Ryall a justice system that was the envy of many countries around the world.

"It is appropriate that a young minister is taking the reins now, with a lot of fresh ideas to bring to justice issues.

"This change will also allow Sir Douglas to focus his time and effort on the Treaty negotiation process. There is now a real opportunity for Maori and the Crown to make progress and I'm keen that he has every opportunity to make that happen."

Mr Ryall returns to New Zealand tomorrow (Monday) from a visit to the United States where he has been looking at successful youth offending and crime prevention schemes in New York, including the "zero tolerance" and "broken windows" schemes.

"Clem Simich will bring the same firm hand to the Corrections service that he has shown with Police.

"People can expect the Government to provide a very firm line to arrest disturbing trends and maintain all New Zealanders' right to be safe," Mrs Shipley said.
