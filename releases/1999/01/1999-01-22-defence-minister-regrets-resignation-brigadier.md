Defence Minister Max Bradford has commented about the decision over the resignation of Brigadier Roger Mortlock as a matter of some regret.

Brigadier Mortlock has had a distinguished career and his work has exemplified the high standards of integrity which New Zealanders would expect, with the exception of one decision made under wartime circumstances thirty years ago.

Very few New Zealanders, who have not experienced the stress of wartime situations, particularly in Vietnam, will be able to appreciate the difficulties of making decisions in such an environment.

The decision to accept Brigader Mortlock's resignation was one for the Chief of General Staff ( the head of the army) Major General Murray Dodson. He has done so in the best interests of the Army and New Zealands Defence Force.

The Government accepts the decision by the Chief of General Staff, but acknowledges the honour and integrity of Brigadier Mortlock in tendering his resignation under the circumstances.

Any further statement will come from the New Zealand Army.
