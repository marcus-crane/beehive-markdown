Prime Minister Jenny Shipley says New Zealanders should be delighted at US President Bill Clinton's strong support for world trade liberalisation in his State of the Union Address.

"This is very good news for New Zealand and it confirms the firm commitments to free trade that I received from the Clinton Administration in Washington last week," Mrs Shipley said.

"Increasingly, leaders are seeing that free trade is the world's best way to improve the prosperity of people in all countries.

"New Zealand producers can take heart from the fact that the President is firmly committed to securing international trade talks that will bring real benefit to our exporters.

"It is also good news for New Zealand that the President wants a new trade round to include farm products in addition to services and manufacturing," Mrs Shipley said.

In his speech, President Clinton urged Congress to give him a mandate to negotiate trade liberalisation. A fast track mandate is seen as a vital factor for New Zealand's prospects of a free trade agreement with the United States, which Mrs Shipley discussed with President Clinton and members of his Cabinet in Washington last week.

The President's demand for negotiating authority showed his commitment to free trade was in line with New Zealand's own agenda, Mrs Shipley said.

Mrs Shipley said she planned to use New Zealand's term as chair of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group to make APEC's free trade goals a springboard for a new trade round within the much larger World Trade Organisation.
