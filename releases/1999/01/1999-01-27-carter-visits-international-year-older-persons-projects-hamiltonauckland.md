Senior Citizens Minister, Hon David Carter, met with representatives from two community groups in Hamilton and Auckland today due to receive funding this month to celebrate International Year of Older Persons (IYOP).

This morning Mr Carter visited Age Concern representatives in Hamilton to discuss the group's plans to update an intergenerational resource kit for use in schools this year to mark IYOP.

The project, "A Wrinkle in Time", will be available to schools nation-wide and Mr Carter said the resource kit would help bridge the generation gap between our youngest and oldest members, in a year dedicated to recognising the contributions of the old.

This afternoon, Mr Carter will travel to Auckland to meet with representatives from the Manukau Chinese New Settlers Service Trust.

The Trust will receive funding from the Government's IYOP budget to hold a series of exhibitions of Chinese elder's skills, including tai chi demonstrations and craft and cooking displays.

Mr Carter said the project would actively involve Auckland's Chinese community in celebrating International Year of Older Persons.

"This project is just one of many that celebrates the diversity of older New Zealanders. I'm looking forward to watching their efforts."

The Senior Citizens Minister announced earlier this month $250,000 had been allocated by Government to community groups nation-wide to mark International Year of Older Persons.

The International Year began on October 1 last year and will close on December 31 this year.
