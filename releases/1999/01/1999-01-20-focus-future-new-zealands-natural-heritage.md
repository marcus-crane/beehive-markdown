The Government and the people of New Zealand must work together to keep our country's natural heritage alive, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today at the launch of New Zealand's Draft Biodiversity Strategy at Te Papa Tongarewa.

"This 20-year strategy is about caring for and appreciating our diverse eco-systems like high country tussock lands, lowland forests, wetlands and coastline, which are home to unique native species like the kea, kiwi, weta and tuatara.

"While the strategy is a Government-led initiative, the Government cannot stop the decline of our biodiversity by itself. We need the help of all New Zealanders of whom many are already doing a very good job protecting our biodiversity. Landowners protecting remnants of bush and stream banks and coastlines are now common place, and this must continue."

Mrs Shipley said biodiversity was one of the Government's ten new strategic priorities announced last December, and this was the first time New Zealand had taken a big picture approach to deal with the decline in the country's indigenous biodiversity.

"The draft strategy recognises the importance of our unique indigenous biodiversity, as well as our economically important introduced species.

"We express our identity as New Zealanders through the kiwi and the fern. These are deeply embedded in our distinctive biodiversity. Many of our indigenous species are found nowhere else on earth and we are special because of this.

"On the economic front, we rely on the use of biological resources, and the services of healthy eco-systems - providing raw materials, clean water, soil, and pest control. Our farming, forestry and horticulture industries all rely on these services, as well as the genetic resources of introduced species like sheep, cows and pine trees.

"Maori too, place extreme importance on conserving New Zealand's living taonga. The word biodiversity may be new, but the concept of a holistic approach to protecting our environment is not," Mrs Shipley said.

Conservation Minister Nick Smith said up to 1000 species in New Zealand were under threat including the kiwi, kakapo, kokako, takahe, saddleback and stitchbird that would not survive without proper protection.

"These are not new problems but what is new is the approach. For the first time we have a long-term nationwide plan dealing directly with biodiversity. Most importantly it covers public land and deals with marine as well as land based conservation," Mr Smith said.

Environment Minister Simon Upton said the success of the draft strategy would largely depend on its ability to mobilise all New Zealanders and in

particular landowners. "Without their willing co-operation, commitment and in many cases local knowledge, we won't achieve what we hope to."

Mrs Shipley said the draft strategy and discussion over the next three months would be an opportunity for people to think about how much biodiversity we want to conserve and how best to do it.

"It is a step closer to ensuring our grandchildren inherit the same living biodiversity that we enjoy now, and I hope many people will take the opportunity to have their say.

"The release of the draft strategy signals a three-month consultation period, with meetings, workshops and hui scheduled around the country.

"I encourage as many people as possible to become actively involved, to express their opinions and to engage in debate so that the final policy can be a strategy that the vast majority of New Zealanders will want to sign up to," Mrs Shipley concluded.
