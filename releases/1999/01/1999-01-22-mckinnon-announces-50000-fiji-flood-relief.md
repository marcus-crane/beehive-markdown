New Zealand will donate $50,000 towards storm and flood relief work in Fiji, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon announced today.

Heavy rainfall earlier this week caused severe flooding in western Viti Levu, resulting in extensive damage to infrastructure and crops.

It is estimated that over 20,000 people have been affected and that about $2.2 million will be required to cover the costs of relief.

The Fiji Government has declared state of natural disaster covering the area.

Mr McKinnon said New Zealand's donation would go towards assisting the Fiji Government provide emergency shelter, food and water to families affected by the disaster.

"The floods are of particular concern given the drought suffered last year which affected agricultural production, particularly sugar," he said.

The emergency committee of Fiji's disaster management centre continues to make a full assessment of the damage.

Mr McKinnon said that New Zealand would continue to liaise with the Fiji authorities as to whether any further assistance would be required.
