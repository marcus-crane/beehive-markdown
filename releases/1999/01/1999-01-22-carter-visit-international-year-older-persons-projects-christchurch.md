Senior Citizens Minister, Hon David Carter, will visit the two successful Christchurch applicants that received funding for International Year of Older Persons (IYOP) on Monday.

More than $18,000 has been awarded to the Nurse Maude Association and Presbyterian Support Services for projects that celebrate and recognise older people in the community.

The Nurse Maude Association plans to make an educational video which will assist older people to access services that help them maintain their independence, while Presbyterian Support Services will hold a series of monthly workshops for older people, their families and carers.

Mr Carter said he was delighted two of the 24 projects to receive funding from Government for International Year of Older Persons came from Christchurch.

"These are very worthy projects as they focus on what is possibly the key issue for older people; how to maintain your independence."

"These projects will meet a very real need for information and assistance for the older community. Christchurch will greatly benefit from their development."

Mr Carter will meet with representatives of both organisations on Monday morning to discuss the projects, and how the organisers intend to publicise these services in the community.

Last week Mr Carter announced $250,000 had been allocated nation-wide to community groups to mark the International Year of Older Persons, which began on October 1 last year and runs to December 31 this year.
