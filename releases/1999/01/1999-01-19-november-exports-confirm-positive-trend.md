Today's provisional merchandise trade figures for November continue the trend of strong export growth following the Asian Crisis, Treasurer Rt Hon Bill Birch said today.

Provisional merchandise exports were up 10.2% for the November months and 5.6% for the year.

"New Zealand exporters have been successful in switching from declining Asian markets into high-value markets elsewhere over the last 12 months.

"Although exports to Asia were down 3.3% ($21m) for the month, exports to Europe rose 9% ($25m) and sales to the US and Australia were up $99m and $26m respectively.

"These figures support the view that an export-led recovery was well underway in the second half of 1998," he said.
