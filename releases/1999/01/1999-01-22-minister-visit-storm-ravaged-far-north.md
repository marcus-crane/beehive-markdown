The Minister of Civil Defence Jack Elder will be visiting the Far North District for a first-hand assessment of damage from last night's down-pour. A Civil Defence Emergency was declared in the District this morning.

Mr Elder was briefed by the Ministry of Civil Defence as the ravages of the storm unfolded. He paid tribute to the efforts and courage of local fire fighters and other volunteers in rescuing people trapped by the flash floods.

"This is another example of how we cannot get by without the selfless sacrifice of such people," Mr Elder said. "Effective emergency management depends heavily on the involvement of the voluntary sector."

Mr Elder said arrangements are being made for him to visit the area with the Director of Civil Defence, John Norton, later today or tomorrow.
