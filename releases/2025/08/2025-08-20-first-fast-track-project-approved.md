Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones have welcomed news that the first Fast-track project has received consent, less than seven months since the one-stop approvals shop opened for business.

The Port of Auckland wharf expansion project has today received its approval from an expert panel set up under the Fast-track Approvals Act. The approved works include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the Bledisloe Terminal, an extension to the Fergusson North Berth, a cruise passenger terminal, and other upgrades.

The project is expected to begin construction next month, creating jobs and boosting New Zealand’s economy

“The Fast-track Approvals Act, part of the coalition agreement between National and NZ First, was signed into law just before Christmas and opened for project applications on 7 February this year. The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that has, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” Mr Bishop says

“The Fast-track Approvals Act contains a list of 149 projects which, since 7 February, have been able to apply to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for consideration by an expert panel. The expert panels consider each application, decide whether or not each project receives approval, and attach any necessary conditions to those approvals.

“The Bledisloe North Wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” Mr Bishop says.

“The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth,” Mr Bishop says.

The application was assessed and approved with conditions by an independent expert panel. This decision comes 66 working days after the expert panel was convened to consider the substantive application.

Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said he was looking forward to more projects reaching the approval stage, with many more in the pipeline.

“I am working closely with Minister Bishop to consider what tweaks to the legislation can be made to make this process even more efficient and get these projects approved and under way.”
