Construction begins today on the new Papakura District Court which will help speed up court processes and improve critical infrastructure, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Courts Minister Nicole McKee say.

“Improving the quality of New Zealand’s infrastructure is vital to creating jobs, growing our economy and helping Kiwis with the cost of living,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Better and more efficient court processes means people can spend less time and money on legal battles and instead move on with their lives. Improving court timeliness and access to justice is a major part of plan to restore law and order, which we know is working. 

“Courts are an important part of our social fabric, where the law is enforced, civil disputes are resolved, and the rights of individuals upheld,” Mr Goldsmith says.

A modern approach is being taken when it comes to the construction of the new court.

“Half the new building is being constructed off-site. These components will be delivered as prefabricated modules and then installed onsite,” Mrs McKee says.

“This is a way of building safely and efficiently, while reducing time, cost, and material resources, as we respond to demographic changes in the fast-growing South Auckland area.

“The building will include three courtrooms, two hearing rooms and, I am pleased to note, a suite for vulnerable witnesses.  Victims are our priority, and this helps return them to the heart of the justice system,” Mrs McKee says.

The new courthouse is expected to open to the public in early 2027. It has an estimated construction budget of $34m.
