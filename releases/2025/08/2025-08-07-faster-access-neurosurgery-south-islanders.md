Fewer South Island patients are waiting for life-changing neurosurgery, with more people getting the specialist treatment they need faster, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“Neurosurgery is vital for treating serious brain and spinal conditions that can dramatically affect lives if left too long,” Mr Brown says. 

“Putting patients first means making sure every Kiwi can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it, and that is exactly what our focus is on for the South Island.” 

Between November 2023 and March 2025, the number of people waiting for neurosurgery in the South Island has fallen by 22 per cent, from 98 to 76. The number waiting longer than four months for surgery has dropped by 45 per cent, from 31 to 17. 

“This is great progress, and it is making a real difference to people’s lives. 

“Whether it is a parent needing urgent brain surgery to be there for their children, or a worker recovering from spinal treatment and returning to their community, this is about delivering for patients.” 

This improvement follows a difficult period when the neurosurgery waitlist in the South Island rose by 92 per cent between 2020 and 2023, putting extra pressure on patients and health services.  

“These results show our focus on reducing waitlists is delivering. We are investing in surgical teams, boosting capacity, and working closely with hospitals to ensure more New Zealanders get the specialist care they need sooner.  

“This progress also reflects the hard work and dedication of our frontline health professionals, whose commitment to patient care is critical to achieving these results. 

“We’re also focused on ensuring that the longest waiting patients get the care they need. That’s why it’s encouraging to see not only the total waitlist coming down, but the number of people waiting more than four months reducing at a faster rate of 45 per cent. 

“This is all part of our plan to provide timely, quality healthcare for every New Zealander. If you need specialist treatment like neurosurgery, you should be able to get it when you need it.” 

Reducing wait times for elective procedures is a key priority for this Government. Our health target is clear – by 2030, 95 per cent of patients will be treated within four months. 

“Patients are still waiting too long, and there is still more work to do, but this latest data shows we are heading in the right direction,” Mr Brown says.
