Cabinet has agreed to a series of policy proposals following public consultation for a new Emergency Management Bill, says Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell. 

As part of its response to the Government Inquiry into the Response to the North Island Severe Weather Events, the Government intends to pass a new Emergency Management Bill during this term of Parliament. The Bill will replace the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. 

“The Government released a discussion document in April this year seeking feedback on options to strengthen New Zealand’s overarching emergency management legislation,” Mr Mitchell says. 

“The 324 submissions received were from individuals and organisations ranging from councils, Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups, iwi groups, volunteer organisations, businesses, interest groups such as animal welfare, and groups representing parts of the community such as disabled people, older people, and rural communities.  

“I want to thank everyone who took the time to share their experiences and perspectives which have informed Cabinet’s decisions on which proposals to progress through the Bill.”  

The Cabinet paper provides details on the 21 proposals, but in summary the Bill will: 

- clarify who is in control during emergencies (particularly when undeclared) and clarify accountabilities at the local level
- improve how Civil Defence Emergency Management Group plans are developed and with whose input, given they drive change on the ground
- provide for representation of iwi Māori, rural communities and the wider community on Coordinating Executive Groups
- expand the tools available to improve assurance of the system, e.g. through rules or Compliance Orders
- expand the lifeline utilities/essential infrastructure providers that can be recognised under the legislation (e.g. certain digital services and solid waste).

“Alongside new legislation the Government will deliver operational improvements through the initiatives outlined in the [*Strengthening Emergency Management Roadmap for Investment and Implementation*](https://www.civildefence.govt.nz/cdem-sector/emergency-management-system-improvement-programme). This includes initiatives that will address, over time, the resourcing and training issues identified by some submitters,” says Mr Mitchell.

The Government intends to introduce and pass the new Emergency Management Bill during this term of Parliament. The public will have another opportunity to make submissions during the Select Committee process.
