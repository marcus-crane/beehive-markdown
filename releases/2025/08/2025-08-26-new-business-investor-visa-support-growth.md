The Government is modernising visa settings to attract experienced businesspeople to help grow New Zealand’s future.

“The Business Investor Visa (BIV) will provide a pathway to residence for business migrants who are ready to invest in, operate and grow established businesses here,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

“This new visa will bring overseas investment to maintain and create jobs, grow incomes, and breathe new life into existing businesses across the country.”

The new Business Investor Visa, which opens for applications in November 2025, offers two investment options:

- A $1 million investment in an existing business, with a three-year work-to-residence pathway.
- A $2 million investment in an existing business, with a 12-month fast-track to residence pathway.

“We are introducing a more targeted pathway for experienced businesspeople with capital to invest and the hands-on experience and skills needed to run a successful business. It has clearer settings that are easier for applicants to understand and for Immigration New Zealand to process, and it’s designed to deliver real economic benefits.

“The Business Investor Visa forms part of our broader refresh of business visa settings, alongside our improved Active Investor Plus visa.

The introduction of the Business Investor Visa sees the retirement of the Entrepreneur Category. It had low application volumes, high decline rates, and didn’t deliver strong economic impacts.

“Work is also underway on a visa pathway for startup-entrepreneurs with scalable, innovative business ideas, designed to complement existing settings and complete the suite. “Our Government is focused on smart, flexible and nuanced immigration solutions to help stimulate the New Zealand economy.

These changes will help bring brighter days ahead for all Kiwis,” Ms Stanford says.
