Funding of $24.62 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund will turbo-charge horticulture expansion in Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti through water storage, flood resilience and whenua Māori projects, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“This investment from the Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF) will help grow these regional economies by further enabling and unlocking high-value horticulture development that supports regional employment, productivity, and export growth while also strengthening regional resilience to economic shocks, and weather events such as storms and droughts,” Mr Jones says.

“The Coalition Government is focused on strengthening and growing our economy, and supporting our regions to succeed is a key part of making that happen.

“That’s why we’re paying close attention to areas like the East Coast, where geographic isolation can make these communities especially vulnerable during extreme weather events, with limited access to infrastructure and disrupted supply chains posing significant challenges.

“Three of these projects directly address the growing need for water access year-round to support our expanding horticulture exports and enhance productivity.

The projects are:

- **Turanga Fast Five** (Gisborne - Tairāwhiti) will receive a $11.93m loan to establish a diversified high-value horticulture development on five underutilised whenua Māori land blocks in Tairāwhiti totalling 70ha.
- **Tātau Tātau Horticulture Limited** **Partnership** (Wairoa - Hawke’s Bay) will receive a $6.83m loan to expand its existing water storage capacity and establish a scalable post-harvest facility. This builds on the $1m received from the Māori Development Fund.
- **Makauri Aquifer Recharge Limited** (Gisborne - Tairāwhiti) will receive a loan of up to $3m to build water infrastructure to replenish the Makauri aquifer in Tairāwhiti, delivering a more reliable water supply for primary production on fertile Tūranganui-a-Kiwa flats, near Waipaoa River.
- **Ngāti Pahauwera Commercial Development Limited** (Wairoa - Hawke’s Bay) will receive a $2.36m loan to develop a 42,000cu m water storage reservoir and distribution infrastructure to convert 30ha of whenua Māori into commercially competitive pipfruit orchards.
- **Quality Roading Services (QRS)** (Wairoa - Hawke’s Bay) will receive a $500,000 grant to strengthen flood protection around the operations hub and depot of QRS, a Wairoa District Council-owned engineering firm that plays a critical role in Wairoa’s disaster response and recovery.

“These investments are playing a critical role in enhancing the region’s resilience and supporting a more productive future, for the benefit of the region and the entire country,” Mr Jones says.

Mr Jones announced the funding at an event in Wairoa today, where he officially opened the final part of Wairoa’s $10.96m CBD development project Te Wairoa e Whanake.

The development consists of a new community business and tourism facility, which was supported by a $5.80m investment from the former Provincial Growth Fund.
