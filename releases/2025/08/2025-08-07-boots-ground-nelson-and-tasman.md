Eighteen job seekers have now started work clearing flood-damaged farms and orchards in Tasman, supported by the Government’s Enhanced Task Force Green programme.

Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston announced funding for an Enhanced Task Force Green, following the Nelson and Tasman region’s first flood in late June. 

“These local teams are now out on the ground, doing vitally important work,” Louise Upston says. “We made $500,000 in funding available for job seekers to help with the clean-up on farms, orchards and in community spaces, and they’re more than stepping up to the mark.

“There’s been a great response from people who wanted to support their community and get into work. Seminars were held at Motueka and Richmond Work and Income service centres, and MSD was able to fill all 18 positions available on the same day.

“These Tasman job seekers have now received the necessary training and started work on flood damaged properties. 

“They’re clearing fence lines and removing silt, debris and trees from farms and orchards so people’s lives and the regional economy can bounce back,” Louise Upston says.

MSD’s employment team will continue to work with all job seekers who were interested in working on the recovery, to help them also find other employment opportunities.
