Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Brooke van Velden announces the appointment of four new members to fill vacancies at the Employment Relations Authority \[ERA].

The ERA is an independent body that helps resolve employment relationship problems and facilitates collective bargaining when issues arise.

“Earlier this year I announced I would like to see a greater balance in the backgrounds of ERA members to ensure the experience of members better reflects the proportions of public sector and private sector employment in New Zealand,” says Ms van Velden.

“Today, I’m announcing four new appointments all from the employment law sector collectively bringing in some great legal experience to the ERA. They are:

- **Simon Greening**, for a term from 6 October 2025 to 5 October 2029
- **William Fussey,** from 15 November 2025 to 14 November 2029
- **Alyn Higgins,** from 6 October 2025 to 5 October 2029
- **Robert Davies,** from 12 January 2026 to 11 January 2030

“I am really pleased with the progress we are making to better balance a mix of public and private experience amongst members and how this has shifted from the start of the term.

“When I came into the job, only 48 percent of members had private sector experience, while 76 percent had public sector experience. That is not representative of the realities of employment in New Zealand, where around 20 percent of employment is in the public sector and around 80 percent in the private sector.

“The ERA’s new members will bring new ideas, skills, experience and balance to the ERA. With these appointments the mix of experience will become 60 per cent private and 52 per cent public,” says Ms van Velden.

“I expect the proportions to further shift over time as current ERA members’ terms expire and come up for consideration for reappointment or replacement.

“These changes to the ERA membership are complemented by a range of policy changes I am progressing through the Employment Relations Amendment Bill.

“The Employment Relations Amendment Bill currently at Select Committee includes changes to remove rewards for poor employee behaviour when considering personal grievances and clarifying the distinction between employment and contracting arrangements,” says Ms van Velden.
