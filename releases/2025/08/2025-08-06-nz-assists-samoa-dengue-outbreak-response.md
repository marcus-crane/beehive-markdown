New Zealand will assist Samoa as it grapples with a major dengue outbreak that has so far killed five children.

“Samoa and New Zealand have a special relationship and we stand with them in this time of need," Mr Peters says. 

“Our thoughts are with the people of Samoa and we will be doing all we can to help.” 

New Zealand intends to:

- send a small team to Apia to provide clinical assistance and work with Samoan authorities on further medical support requirements; and
- source and fund medical supplies, worth $300,000, to help with the outbreak.

“We stand ready to provide further support as requested by Samoa,” Mr Peters says. 

Senior New Zealand public health officials are also in contact with their Samoa counterparts. 

Travellers to Samoa should take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites and follow the [Dengue Fever prevention advice on our SafeTravel website](https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/before-you-go/general-advice/health/diseases).
