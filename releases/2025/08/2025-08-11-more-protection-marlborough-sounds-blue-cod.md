A longer seasonal closure for blue cod in the Marlborough Sounds will reduce pressure on the fishery and help support its sustainability, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says. 

“Blue cod is a favourite for many fishers and this popularity, as well as other factors, has led to sustainability concerns for the Marlborough Sounds fishery.

“I have decided to extend the seasonal closure, which will now run from 1 September to 10 January annually, to help alleviate fishing pressure while other sustainability measures are considered,” Mr Jones says.

In 2022, commercial catch limits for the fish stock (BCO 7) were reduced in response to scientific information indicating high fishing pressure was impacting the fishery. Following this, an advisory group representing interests from across the fishing sector was established to provide local expertise.

“The advisory group has been instrumental in providing advice on ways to improve the health of the blue cod population in the Marlborough Sounds. I thank the members for their mahi to protect their local fishery, as well as the public who gave their views as part of the consultation.”

“Based on that input, I’ve directed officials to further explore factors affecting Marlborough Sounds blue cod, including reduced spawning and survivability of caught fish that are returned. I will consider advice on any further proposals as part of a wider package later in the year,” Mr Jones says.

“Ahead of this summer, officials are also updating educational material for recreational fishers about how they can do their part to ensure sustainability, such as avoiding blue cod during the closed season, and safely releasing blue cod to minimise risk of mortality.
