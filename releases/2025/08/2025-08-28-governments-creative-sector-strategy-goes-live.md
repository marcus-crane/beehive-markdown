The Government has published its strategy to boost Kiwis’ engagement with the arts, grow the sector’s economic contribution and create more jobs, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Our government’s vision is for New Zealand to we be as well known for its arts and creativity, as it is for dairy exports and beautiful scenery. We know we already have a strong base and areas of global excellence.

“In November 2024, we released our first draft of Amplify, sparking a conversation with those across the sector, seeing if we can agree broadly on a pathway forward. 

“Creativity doesn’t lend itself to tidy strategies. That is why Amplify is enabling, rather than constraining. It provides a framework, but leaves plenty of room for individuals, communities, companies and institutions to find their own path. I’d like to thank all those who have provided feedback and shaped this strategy.”

Amplify sets out a series of goals for the sector:

- The economic contribution of the arts and creative sectors grows to at least $22 billion (of GDP), with a focus on cultural exports and tourism by 2030.
- A 10 per cent increase in the number of New Zealanders engaging with New Zealand arts, culture, and heritage by 2030.
- 5,000 more people working in the creative and cultural sector by 2030.

There are three strategic pillars which outline actions the Government will take to reach these targets:

- Maximising value for New Zealand from the creative and cultural sectors through the Crown investment in Arts, Culture and Heritage and wider government investment.
- Enhancing New Zealand’s creative and cultural talent pipeline and supporting sustainable career opportunities.
- Modernising and streamlining Government regulation so it enables the cultural sectors to thrive.

“This is not a set-and-forget strategy. Amplify will be a living document, updated regularly with input from creative industries to ensure it remains relevant to the sector. The conversation will continue.” Mr Goldsmith says.
