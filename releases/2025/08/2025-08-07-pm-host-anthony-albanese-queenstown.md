Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will host Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for the annual Australia New Zealand Leaders’ Meeting in Queenstown later this week. 

“I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Albanese and his fiancée Jodie Haydon to a beautiful part of New Zealand,” Mr Luxon says.

“In today’s uncertain world, one certainty is that the Australia-New Zealand relationship is the bedrock as we look out into the world.  

“Australia is our only ally and a vital economic partner. With two-way trade of $32 billion, I look forward to discussing what more we can do as we tackle economic challenges on both sides of the Tasman.”

Prime Minister Albanese will be welcomed to Queenstown by Ngāi Tahu at a pōwhiri followed by bilateral talks. Other engagements include a business roundtable with the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum and showcasing Central Otago’s beauty.  

Prime Minister Albanese arrives in Queenstown on Saturday 9 August and departs on Sunday 10 August.
