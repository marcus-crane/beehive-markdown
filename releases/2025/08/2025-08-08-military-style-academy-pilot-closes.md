The first 12-month Military-Style Academy pilot has now concluded, having provided support and opportunities that have made our communities safer and turned young lives around.

The pilot began in July 2024 at an existing Youth Justice residence, Te Au rere a te Tonga in Palmerston North. Throughout the pilot, participants were intensively supported, along with their whānau, by social workers, a mentor and other professionals. 

Minister for Children Karen Chhour has stated, “While the pilot only just closed, the feedback I have received has been overwhelmingly positive.”

“The aim of the pilot, trialling a new approach to working with the country’s most serious and persistent youth offenders to reduce (and, ultimately, end) re-offending, has been achieved and, in some cases, exceeded. 

“We have seen marked improvements in these young people’s behaviour, attitudes to offending, and activities. 

“The families of these young people have expressed great appreciation for the support they have been provided, such as accessing stable housing and parenting support services. 

“Most importantly, many of the young people involved in the pilot have taken this opportunity to turn their lives around and are showing real promise.”

Minister Chhour said, “Zero re-offending was never going to be realistic, but the goal of this programme has always been to provide meaningful supports and an opportunity for these young people to make better choices.”

“It is wonderful to see that so many have taken this chance and made great progress – several have found employment or work experience, some have returned to sports and other activities that promote positive social development, the vast majority have shown greater personal responsibility and a desire to no longer victimise others.

“This government committed to reducing the harm caused in our communities by serious and persistent youth offending. 

We are now tracking to reach a 15% reduction in the total number of children and young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour well ahead of schedule and initiatives like the Military-Style Academy pilot have played a huge role in this success.”

“Communities are becoming safer, young people who lacked hope and direction are finding it, this government is getting results.”
