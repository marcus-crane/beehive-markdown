Minister of Defence Judith Collins today opened the new headquarters of the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s No. 5 Squadron at Ohakea and its four P-8A Poseidon aircraft.

“This 20,000 sq m facility, Te Whare Toroa - The Home of the Albatross, provides essential, state-of-the-art infrastructure to support the RNZAF’s work in maritime surveillance, resource protection and disaster response,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government knows Defence personnel must have modern and fit-for-purpose equipment and infrastructure to be interoperable, combat-capable, and to deter actions that are adverse to our interests.

“The work they do safeguards New Zealand, its interests and our way of life.”

The new facility can train, sustain and support up to 320 personnel with its two hangars, maintenance and support facilities, spare parts warehouse, full flight simulator and mission support centre. For the first time, it brings together a range of training and support tools for aircrew, maintenance and mission support personnel. 

“There will be more projects like this as the Government’s Defence Capability Plan, which outlines planned commitments worth $12 billion over the next four years and doubles our Defence spending by 2032, is implemented,” Ms Collins says.

“The project has also provided significant employment and up-skilling opportunities for the local workforce, which the delivery of the Defence Capability Plan will continue to generate into regional economies in the coming years.”
