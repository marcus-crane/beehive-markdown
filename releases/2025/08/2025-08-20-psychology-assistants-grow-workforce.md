Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey has welcomed the New Zealand Psychologists Board’s move to approve the development of the Psychology Assistant role, saying it will increase access to timely mental health and addiction support.

“We know there are long-standing workforce shortages across the sector, and this initiative opens the door for a career in mental health for the hundreds of students that graduate each year with a degree in psychology but are unable to secure a place in the clinical psychology programme,” Mr Doocey says.

“This is a common-sense move that I am confident will make a real difference”.

Psychology Assistants will work under the supervision of registered psychologists, helping to increase access to support and drive down vacancies within the mental health system.

“This Government put in place New Zealand’s first Mental Health workforce plan, which clearly identified the challenges facing the psychology workforce. Since then, we have followed through on opening up more places in the clinical psychology training programme, funded more clinical internships, and now the addition of the psychology assistants, will further strengthen the psychology workforce.

“I want to acknowledge the Psychologist Board for approving the introduction of the role in a careful and considered way to make this possible. I also want to thank Canterbury University and the Auckland University of Technology for their work in developing the training and qualification for the role’s responsibilities. It will offer a new pathway that did not exist for psychology students to go on to build careers in mental health and addiction.

“We’ve been clear that tackling workforce shortages is a top priority. By widening the pipeline into psychology, we can help drive down vacancies, reduce wait times, and ultimately improve outcomes for New Zealanders in their time of need.

“Our mental health plan is working. We’re turning the corner on reducing wait times and increasing the mental health workforce. Recent data shows the frontline Health NZ mental health workforce has grown around 10% since we came into Government, and over 80% of people are being seen within three weeks for specialist services.

“I am very clear that when someone is making the brave step of reaching out to get support, workforce should never be a barrier. Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
