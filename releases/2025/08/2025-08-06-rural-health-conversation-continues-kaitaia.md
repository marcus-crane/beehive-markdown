Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health and Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey, and Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson are in Kaitaia today for the next stop on the rural health roadshow happening across the country.

“This roadshow is about listening to the rural community.  It’s a chance for me to connect directly with the public and health professionals working on the frontline in rural areas to hear what’s working, where the gaps are, and how the Rural Health Strategy is being received on the ground,” Mr Doocey says.

Since launching the roadshow in Levin, the Minister has met with rural communities in Wairoa, Wānaka, Oamaru, Gore, Hanmer Springs and Tūrangi. Now, he’s in Kaitaia ready to hear from locals and health workers.

“I’m looking forward to meeting with people in Kaitaia and hearing firsthand about their experiences with healthcare in their community. It’s important we understand both the challenges and the opportunities so we can work together to improve access and outcomes in the rural setting,” Mr Patterson says.

The roadshow builds on the Government’s broader plan to strengthen rural health care. Budget 2025 committed $164 million over four years to improve access to urgent and after-hours care, meaning 98 per cent of Kiwis will be able to access these services within one hour’s drive of their home.

“Milestones like the first total knee replacement surgery completed in Kaitaia in May this year represented a major step forward in expanding advanced surgical care closer to home,” Mr Doocey says.

“Mental health support is a key focus for this Government. A recent $3 million investment over four years will expand access to primary and specialist mental health services in rural areas. The Rural Wellbeing Fund is also being doubled to $4 million, ensuring more communities receive the support they need.

“All New Zealanders deserve timely access to quality health care and this Government is committed to improving health and mental health outcomes, including for the one in five living in our rural communities.

“The level of engagement we’ve seen at each stop has been fantastic, and I’m looking forward to hearing directly from the Kaitaia community today on how we can keep strengthening rural health care together.”
