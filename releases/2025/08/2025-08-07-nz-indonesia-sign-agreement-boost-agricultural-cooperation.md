Minister of Agriculture, Trade and Investment Todd McClay and Indonesian Minister of Agriculture Andi Amran Sulaiman, today signed a new bilateral arrangement in Jakarta to deepen agricultural cooperation, strengthen trade links, and create new commercial opportunities for farmers and agribusinesses across both countries.

“This new agreement will make it easier for our agricultural sectors to collaborate, share expertise and open doors for trade and investment,” Mr McClay says.

“It provides a framework for stronger cooperation in areas like livestock development, smart agriculture, biosecurity, agricultural research, and streamlined trade processes.”

The arrangement also commits both governments to establishing a dedicated Consultative Forum to coordinate future cooperation and set joint priorities. This forum will meet within a year of signing and will enable both countries to align efforts on technical standards, certification, and regulatory requirements, reducing red tape for exporters.

“This is about building long-term commercial partnerships. It will help more New Zealand businesses connect directly with Indonesian partners, support our farmers to get their high-quality products into market, and encourage m investment in agriculture from both sides,” Mr McClay says.

On a one-day visit to Indonesia Minister McClay has met with a number of senior counterparts, including:

- Minister of Agriculture, Andi Amran Sulaiman
- Trade Minister, Budi Santoso
- Vice Minister of Trade, Ibu Roro
- Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto
- Coordinating Minister of Food, Zulkifli Hasan
- ASEAN Secretary-General, Dr Kao Kim Hourn

These engagements support the Government’s goal to double exports by value in ten years and strengthen trade and investment ties across the region to deliver greater export returns to New Zealand’s regions.

“Trade delivers jobs, investment and opportunities for New Zealanders,” Mr McClay says.

“Agreements like this one help to grow the value of our exports, lift returns to the farmgate, and unlock future growth for the entire economy.”
