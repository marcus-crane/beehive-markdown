Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston today announced the appointment of five new members – and one reappointment – to the New Zealand Tourism Board.

“I’m pleased to welcome Chris Roberts, Jane Patterson, Jonathan Cameron, Piers Bebbington and Kevin Malloy to the Board,” Louise Upston says.

“They each bring a wealth of knowledge and experience that will strengthen the Board’s efforts to market New Zealand as a visitor destination, maximising the long-term economic benefits to this beautiful country.

“I’m also delighted to reappoint Jacqui Walshe for a further two-year term.”

The New Zealand Tourism Board oversees Tourism New Zealand. 

“The Board’s work is critical as we drive up international visitor numbers to New Zealand,” Louise Upston says.

“Tourism is New Zealand’s second largest export and a key part of our plan to grow the economy.”

Chris Roberts, Kevin Malloy and Jacqui Walshe have been appointed for two-year terms. Jane Patterson, Jonathan Cameron and Piers Bebbington have been appointed for three-year terms.

“I’d like to acknowledge outgoing members Steve Chadwick, Jan Hunt, Colleen Neville, Amanda Butler and Kauahi Ngapora for their services to the Board,” Louise Upston says.

“I thank them for their significant contributions and look forward to working with our new members as they begin their terms.”
