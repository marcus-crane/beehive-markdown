New Zealanders will be able to enjoy the beautiful Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki for generations thanks to support from a unique statutory body, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

The four Crown appointments to Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi, the governance group who will act as the human face and voice of Te Kāhui Tupua, are:

- **Professor Bruce Clarkson** is an ecologist with more than 40 years of experience in his field – including work on ecosystems in the central North Island area.
- **Stephen Daysh** has been a key strategic advisor to several Crown, council and iwi development agencies allowing him to develop strong relationships with Taranaki iwi mana whenua groups**.**
- **Hemi Sundgren** has been involved in cultural development and mātauranga Māori development activities in Taranaki and possesses 15 years’ experience in strategic leadership.
- **Rex Hendry** has a strong background in governance leadership as well as environmental and stakeholder management.

“These talented people have been appointed for three years. They along with four appointees from Te Tōpuni Ngārahu, the representative organisation of the eight Taranaki Iwi, will make up Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi” Mr Potaka says.

“These appointments will ensure New Zealanders continue to enjoy this beautiful place and that it is protected and enhanced for generations to come.

“While the Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai will retain day-to-day running of the park, Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi will uphold and promote the health, wellbeing and interests of Te Kāhui Tupua.  There will also be joint decision-making between the Crown and Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi on some concession decisions.”

The formation of Te Tōpuni Kōkōrangi is an outcome of Te Pire Whakatupua mō Te Kāhui Tupua Maunga (the Taranaki Maunga Collective Redress Act), which became law on 1 April 2025
