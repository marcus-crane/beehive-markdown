More than 100 New Zealanders have already benefited from a groundbreaking diagnostic tool that is delivering faster, more accurate brain tumour diagnoses, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

DNA methylation profiling, the international gold standard for diagnosing brain tumours, has been rolled out at Auckland City Hospital over the past year. 

“This technology is a game-changer for brain tumour diagnosis in New Zealand. It enables doctors to pinpoint the exact tumour type with greater precision and in less time, meaning patients can start the right treatment sooner,” Mr Brown says. 

“Until now, diagnosis was typically made by microscopic examination. In some complex cases, samples were sent overseas for methylation profiling, but that could take up to six weeks. 

“Having this cutting-edge capability in New Zealand means more Kiwi patients can access this advanced diagnostic technology locally. Turnaround times are faster, around four weeks, and quicker for urgent cases. 

“It also means we can prioritise urgent cases, deliver answers sooner, and give patients and their families greater certainty.” 

In some recent cases done locally, methylation profiling has significantly altered the initial diagnosis. In others, it has identified rare or unexpected tumour types that may have been missed using traditional methods. 

The Auckland-based service is one of only three in Australasia, with samples from hospitals around the country also being sent to Auckland for analysis. Along with improving access and outcomes for patients, it is also significantly cheaper than sending samples offshore. 

“Delivering faster access to cancer treatment is a key focus for the Government, which is why it is one of our five national health targets. Faster, more accurate diagnosis for brain tumours that may be cancerous is a vital part of that. 

“By providing local access to the world’s best diagnostic tools, we are improving outcomes for New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.
