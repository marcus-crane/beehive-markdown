Minister for Children Karen Chhour is calling on anyone able to provide a loving and stable environment for a child to seriously consider becoming a caregiver.

She has also reassured potential and former caregivers that the supports and training for caregivers have improved and will continue to be upgraded under this government.

Minister Chhour said, “Becoming a caregiver is one of the most selfless and rewarding things you can do, and we’re making it easier by increasing the quality of the support we provide and removing barriers that dissuaded potential caregivers – such as a focus on their ethnicity.”

Budget 2025 committed $16 million to make care environments safer and to better support and train caregivers and the wider care workforce.

“We have been guided by caregivers themselves and have undertaken a number of improvements. 

These include:

- Establishing the Caregiver Panel – ensuring caregivers have a strong voice in the services and supports provided to them
- Better on-boarding of new caregivers by providing greater information and guidance during the start of their caregiver journey
- Increasing the number of learning modules available to Oranga Tamariki caregivers provided by Caring Families Aotearoa, with 277 people already undertaking these courses since May of this year
- Improving the approval process for caregivers and ensuring caregivers are fully approved before children are placed in their care – an issue under the previous government
- Changes to the relevant caregiver policies and guidelines to ensure that safe and loving homes are prioritised over other considerations.

“There are children right here in our communities who need that care, that support, and that sense of belonging more than anything. 

“If you can provide a safe, stable, and loving home, please consider becoming a caregiver. 

“If you have been a caregiver in the past, we would encourage you to think about becoming one again,” said Mrs Chhour.
