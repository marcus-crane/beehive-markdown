Patients and families visiting Whangārei Hospital are one step closer to easier access, as a procurement process begins for additional and upgraded carparks to support the hospital’s ongoing redevelopment, Acting Health Minister Matt Doocey says.

“We know carparks are an important part of hospital infrastructure, and making it easier for patients, staff, and visitors to access health services is a priority for our Government,” Mr Doocey says.

“The carparks at Whangārei Hospital are already at capacity, and the construction of the new Child Health Centre, limited street parking nearby, and growing demand is adding further pressure.”

“As we deliver the much-needed redevelopment of Whangārei Hospital, it’s essential that people can access services easily. Parking is a key part of that.”

Health New Zealand is seeking a civil contractor to build a major new carpark extension ahead of construction of the Acute Services Building.

“This will replace those carparks lost due to construction on the wider campus as well as adding to the current capacity.

“This project will not only replace the carparks lost due to construction across the campus, it will also boost overall capacity. The tender covers an on-grade carpark extension of an existing facility, providing 552 spaces along with new infrastructure and clear wayfinding at Whangārei Hospital.”

The tender is of a scale suitable to many local contractors and suppliers.

“We are committed to delivering a modern hospital for the people of Whangārei and Northland. We know carparking is a real issue for the community, and this is another step forward in ensuring people can get the care they need when they need it. I look forward to seeing further progress on the redevelopment of Whangārei Hospital,” Mr Doocey says.
