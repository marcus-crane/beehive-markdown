A revised code of welfare for deer balances ensuring the protection of farmed deer with practicality and the economic impacts on farmers, says Associate Minister of Agriculture Andrew Hoggard.

“I’m pleased to issue the revised Code of Welfare for Deer, the first of the priority pastoral livestock codes under review to be finalised and issued.

“New Zealand has a strong reputation for animal welfare, and it’s important that we continue to rank highly for animal welfare standards. It’s also important that our animal welfare codes are practical and that the costs being imposed are proportional to the anticipated benefits. 

“The work by the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC) to review the code involved close consultation with key players in the deer industry, and a number of changes were made as a result of their input.

“I want to thank NAWAC and industry for their work. This revised code shows that when we work together, we can achieve a balance and robust outcomes for industry.

"As with all codes of animal welfare, it provides requirements and guidance that will leave farmers in no doubt about the standards of welfare they must meet.” 

The code also encourages all those involved in the farming of deer to adopt the highest standards of animal handling and care.
