Health Minister Simeon Brown, alongside Hutt South MP Chris Bishop, today officially opened the new premises of the Lower Hutt After Hours Medical Centre on Connolly Street.

“This new facility marks a significant step forward for urgent healthcare in Lower Hutt,” Mr Brown said.

“Urgent care and after-hours services help ease pressure on hospital emergency departments by providing better local options and faster access to essential treatments like diagnostics and urgent medicines.

“Lower Hutt is currently the only metropolitan area in New Zealand without a daytime urgent care service. That’s why the Government identified it as a priority location under the urgent care expansion announced in May.”

The new facility replaces the former High Street site, which did not have the capacity to support future growth. By taking over Health New Zealand’s lease of the former Te Awakairangi Birthing Unit, which closed in 2021, the medical centre has ensured the ongoing use of a valuable health asset and enabled the delivery of expanded urgent care services for the community.

“With seven consulting rooms, two triage rooms, a plaster and phlebotomy room, a carer’s room, and a much larger waiting area, this centre is purpose-built to meet the needs of a growing community. Co-location with radiology services means patients can get timely imaging and treatment for injuries like fractures, offering a practical alternative to the emergency department. Convenient access to pharmacy services also means urgent medicines can be supplied on the spot.

“This new location enables the staged rollout of a dedicated daytime urgent care service, starting from December 2025.”

Once fully operational, the new daytime service will build on the existing after-hours care, providing seven-day-a-week access to urgent care for the Hutt community.

“This means people in the Hutt will be able to access timely care day and night, closer to home, without needing to wait or travel further for non-emergency care.

“This is about making healthcare more accessible and responsive for the people of the Hutt, delivering the right care, in the right place, at the right time. It’s a clear example of the Government delivering on its promise to improve health services right across the country,” Mr Brown said.
