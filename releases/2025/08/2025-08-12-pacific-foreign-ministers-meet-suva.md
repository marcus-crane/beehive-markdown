Foreign Minister Winston Peters will attend the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiji this week to discuss key regional issues with counterparts.

“In an increasingly challenging world, it is more important than ever that the Pacific family comes together to talk about the things that matter to us,” Mr Peters says.

“New Zealand’s membership of the Pacific Islands Forum, the region’s leading political organisation, is a crucial part of our diplomacy. As a Pacific country, we remain dedicated to the Forum as the main platform for developing Pacific-owned and Pacific-led solutions to shared challenges.”

Their meeting sets the stage for Forum Leaders’ discussions in Honiara, Solomon Islands, in September.

Mr Peters leaves New Zealand on Wednesday 13 August, returning on 14 August.
