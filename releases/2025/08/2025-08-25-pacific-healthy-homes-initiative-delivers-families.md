The Pacific Healthy Homes Initiative has already helped over 300 Pacific households with warmer, drier homes, and the Government is extending it, Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti announced today.

Since July 2024, the initiative has built on the Healthy Homes and Warmer Kiwi Homes programmes, with additional eligibility for older Pacific peoples with chronic health conditions.

Nearly $4 million has been invested so far, with an additional $1 million committed through to 30 June 2026.

Dr Reti says the programme is delivering real results:

- Over 300 Pacific households supported in the past year
- More than 5,200 interventions such as insulation, heating, and minor repairs
- 200 more households expected to benefit over the next year

“The Government is focused on improving the lives of Pacific families,” Dr Reti says. 

“The Healthy Homes Initiative provides simple additions, like curtains, heat pumps, better ventilation, that keep a home warm and dry.

“By investing in healthy homes, we are reducing preventable illnesses, helping keep Pacific children and older people out of hospital and able to keep going to school, to work and be a part of their community.”

The initiative is delivered by the Ministry for Pacific Peoples in partnership with local providers in South Auckland and Porirua.

“All new funding goes directly into homes, ensuring families receive the support they need to live healthier lives,” Dr Reti says.

The University of Otago is independently evaluating the programme to guide future investment in Pacific housing solutions.
