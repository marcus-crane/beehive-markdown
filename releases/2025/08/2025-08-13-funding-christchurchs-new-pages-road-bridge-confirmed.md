Replacement of the earthquake-damaged Pages Road bridge in Christchurch will proceed, with Government funding of $38.5 million approved by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Board, Minister for the South Island and Associate Transport Minister James Meager has confirmed.

“I’m pleased that the NZTA Board have endorsed the business case for the $75.4 million Pages Road bridge renewal project and approved co-funding from the National Land Transport Fund,” Mr Meager says.

“Carrying more than 13,000 vehicles per day, the nearly 100-year-old bridge is approaching the end of its life. As the main point of access between the New Brighton and Southshore communities, and the rest of Christchurch, there has been increasing urgency to replace it.”

The bridge was last strengthened in 2015 to extend its lifespan. As a critical evacuation route, the importance of the Pages Road bridge renewal project was recognised by this Government with its inclusion in the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme. It is currently the highest priority capital improvement project for Christchurch City Council, but until now had no taxpayer funding allocated to it.

“The existing roads either side of the Pages Road bridge are also prone to flooding and erosion. This funding will also allow these roads to be raised and upgraded at the same time as the bridge replacement work,” Mr Meager says.

“With the business case and co-funding now approved, Christchurch City Council expects the project to move into construction once consenting is completed.

“I know how important this project is to the people of New Brighton, Southshore, and greater Christchurch, and I want to thank them for their continued advocacy to get this major infrastructure project across the line.

“It’s promising to see progress being made, and I look forward to seeing shovels in the ground as soon as possible.
