The latest New Zealand Conservation Authority and Conservation Board appointments will help to strengthen environmental efforts across Aotearoa New Zealand.

Minister for Conservation Tama Potaka has today announced the 2025 appointments to the country’s 15 Conservation Boards. There are 21 reappointments, 37 new appointments, and 87 continuing members.

“These appointments seek to achieve a balance on each conservation board in terms of experience, geographic spread, gender, age, recreation interests, and representativeness of community interests in the functions of the Department of Conservation at a regional level,” Mr Potaka says.

“Conservation boards play a vital role as liaisons between DOC with their regions, making their community’s voice heard on conservation issues,” says Minister Potaka. “As such, the board memberships should be representative of the communities they serve. I’m thrilled to appoint such a diverse group to these positions.

"Nau mai haere mai to those members stepping up for the first time, nau mai hoki mai to those returning for 2025, and ngā mihi to all the outgoing representatives for their important contributions to conservation mahi in their regions.”

Mr Potaka also confirmed two reappointments and four new appointments to the New Zealand Conservation Authority (NZCA), the national statutory body that provides strategic policy advice to DOC and the Minister.

“Conservation work on Aotearoa New Zealand relies on a wider variety of people coming together for a common goal. The variety of skills and qualities the appointees bring fills me with hope that together we can make a real difference for our native species and ecosystems.”

Conservation board appointments took effect from 6 August.
