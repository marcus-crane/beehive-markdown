The Government is strengthening trafficking and people smuggling laws to stop criminals using loopholes to evade real consequences for crime, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Since 2009, over 50 victims of trafficking have been identified, but only four prosecutions have been undertaken. Just two of these prosecutions have led to a conviction. This doesn't make sense, and our fear is this is just the tip of the iceberg.

“These criminals must be held accountable for their actions. Real consequences for crime is an essential part of our ongoing work to restore law and order, which we know is working.

“Those who traffic, smuggle, and exploit other human beings are preying on some of our most vulnerable, and causing egregious harm, particularly to women and children.

“We know these laws are not fit for purpose. Prosecution in trafficking cases is currently far too difficult, and offenders are receiving lighter sentences. These laws need to be more consistent with international standards, including those in UN conventions.”

The specific changes are:

- Removing the requirement to prove that coercion or deception occurred when the trafficked victim is under 18.
- Making it explicit that consent is irrelevant when the victim is under 18 or when coercion or deception was present.
- Ensuring that migrants cannot be smuggled into New Zealand using authentic, but fraudulently obtained travel documents.
- Providing greater protection for undercover Police investigating cases of child exploitation.

“This comes as part of the reform the Government is making to the Crimes Act 1961,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“This addresses issues raised by submitters on Greg Fleming MP’s Member’s Bill currently before the House. I’d like to thank him for his work.”
