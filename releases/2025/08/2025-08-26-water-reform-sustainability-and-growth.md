Local communities across the country are set to benefit from the completion of the Government’s Local Water Done Well legislation, which will enable safe, reliable, and financially sustainable water services, Local Government Minister Simon Watts and Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson say.

“Already, two million Kiwis are set to benefit from Local Water Done Well through accepted water services delivery plans, and through the changes we made to the Watercare charter last year,” Mr Watts says.

“As the remaining water service plans are submitted, local communities will be covered under models specifically designed to ensure sustainability and investment in the water infrastructure needed.

“When we came into Government, we made it clear that we would provide a solution for local communities that achieved this, and which managed finances responsibly, to respond to historic under-investment. This investment will additionally help to enable further housing growth across our regions.

“In 2023, councils and communities resoundingly rejected Labour’s expensive Three Waters policy, a proposal that we moved to repeal and replace with water reforms which will now keep water service ownership and decision-making local.

“Now, with enactment of the enduring Local Government (Water Services) Act and Local Government (Water Services) (Repeals and Amendments) Act, we have given councils the framework, delivery models, and tools they need to address the specific challenges they are facing, in a way that works for the ratepayers they serve.

“This Government knows that the unavoidable solution to years of underinvestment in water infrastructure comes at a cost to everyday Kiwis, and that is why this legislation focuses on financial sustainability.

“Local Water Done Well also provides for monitoring of progress and finances, and oversight for the public. It introduces economic regulation of water services to provide oversight and accountability, and that gives confidence to consumers.

“The legislation also strips out excessive and unnecessary regulatory costs, while ensuring that compliance requirements are at the level needed for safe, effective water services.”

“Kiwis should be getting a fair deal on water, and Local Water Done Well delivers on this,” Mr Simpson says.

“The Commerce Commission will oversee the economic regulation regime, which will initially apply to local government drinking water supply and wastewater services.

“This oversight by the Commerce Commission will ensure that ratepayers are getting the quality infrastructure they deserve, at a price that is fair and reasonable.”

“We are already receiving strong water services delivery plan submissions from councils, both as multi-council arrangements and from those going it alone, and I look forward to seeing the remaining submissions to provide the best coverage for Kiwis,” Mr Watts says.

“Multi-council arrangements provide a good option for financial sustainability, and we are already seeing instances of these as more councils submit plans. Ultimately, Local Water Done Well is about the quality of water services, and provided they meet the requirements, we are ensuring councils have flexibility to make arrangements best-suited for their communities.

“I want to congratulate and acknowledge all the councils putting in fantastic work. We are seeing great plans and we anticipate that the overwhelming majority will do what’s right for locals.

“Local Water Done Well is all about giving councils and locals the choice of what works for them, and which works for ratepayers for years to come, and I look forward to long awaited improvements.”
