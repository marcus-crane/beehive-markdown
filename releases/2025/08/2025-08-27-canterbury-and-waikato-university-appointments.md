Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti has announced four new appointments and two reappointments to the governing councils of the University of Canterbury and the University of Waikato.

“I am very pleased to appoint Dr Sina Cotter Tait and Steven Wakefield to the University of Canterbury Council, and Fiona Michel and Erin Wansbrough to the University of Waikato Council,” says Dr Reti.

“These are high calibre appointments who bring valuable skills and experience to their respective Councils, and who will support the leadership and decision making of these important institutions.

“I am also pleased to reappoint Hon Amy Adams to the University of Canterbury Council, and Graeme Milne ONZM to the University of Waikato Council. Hon Adams and Mr Milne are making valuable contributions and I am grateful they are willing to serve a further term.

“Universities have a critical role to play in generating the ideas and developing the talent we need to build up our economy, and it is important that these institutions are governed by capable and experienced councils.”
