Watercare’s $500 million investment to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure will deliver improved water services and more jobs for Aucklanders, Local Government Minister Simon Watts says.

“The Government knows that decades of underinvestment in water services have created an unavoidable cost for everyday Kiwis. That’s why the Watercare Charter was developed last year by the Government in collaboration with Auckland Council to ensure water services remain affordable for Aucklanders. The Charter will save households nearly $900 million over four years while also guaranteeing improved service quality and record infrastructure investment.”

Watercare will invest $500 million into upgrading Auckland’s ageing water infrastructure over the next 18 months as part of its renewals work programme. A third of the funds are allocated to upgrading treatment plants and the remainder dedicated to renewing pipes and other assets.

“Today’s announcement is a 44 percent increase in investments into upgrading Auckland’s ageing water infrastructure when compared to the spend in the 18-month period ending 30 June 2025. It shows how Watercare, Auckland Council, and the Government are working together to accelerate investment in Auckland’s water infrastructure,” Mr Watts says.

“This arrangement gives Watercare additional finance for investment in Auckland’s water infrastructure while keeping water charges lower than previously forecasted. It will mean Aucklanders can keep more money in their household budgets, allowing them to spend on other essential expenses such as groceries and healthcare. 

“I’m pleased to see that my conversations with Watercare, combined with the recent introduction of economic regulation, are positively impacting the level of infrastructure investment in Auckland. This is a good outcome that will support growth through increased job activity and resilient infrastructure.

“While much of the work will be delivered by Watercare’s existing contractors, the project will put $75 million worth of contracts for water and wastewater pipe replacements out to public tender before Christmas. This will allow small businesses to compete for the work, alongside Watercare’s pre-approved suppliers.

“The project reflects our shared commitment to faster delivery, stronger regional economies, and improved water services for Aucklanders. I look forward to further positive developments as we continue to monitor Watercare’s ongoing performance.”
