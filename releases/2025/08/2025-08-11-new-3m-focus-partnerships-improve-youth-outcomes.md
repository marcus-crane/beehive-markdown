A new $3 million fund to support outcomes-focused programmes will significantly enhance our ability to improve the lives of at-risk young New Zealanders, Minister for Youth James Meager says.

Mr Meager today launched the Youth Development Partnership and Innovation Fund, to coincide with International Youth Day.

The fund provides matched funding for businesses, iwi, charities, NGOs and other philanthropic organisations to deliver outcomes-based, early intervention and youth development programmes and services for those aged 12-24 years.

Funding will go towards programmes that directly support key Government targets including:

- Reducing the number of young people on the Jobseeker Support Benefit.
- Increasing student attendances rates.
- Supporting young parents with children in their first 2,000 days.

“We need to shift our mindset from contracting for outputs, to delivering outcomes,” Mr Meager says. 

“I have instructed officials to ensure that all new Ministry for Youth Development funding will only go to programmes that can demonstrate successful outcomes for young people which align with key government targets.

“By co-investing with matched funding, we can get twice the value for the taxpayer, while recognising that services are best delivered in the community, by the community. This is the fundamental premise of social investment.

“We will fund a range of community-based providers to deliver evidence-based programmes tailored to the needs of their region. This could include things like leadership training, mentoring, informal qualifications and volunteering opportunities, with an aim to build new skills and gain employment-related experience.”

Expressions of Interest for the new fund are now open, with more information available on the Government Electronic Tender Service website.
