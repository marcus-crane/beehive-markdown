Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay departs today for Thailand and Indonesia to strengthen New Zealand’s economic ties with two of Southeast Asia’s largest and fastest‑growing economies.

“Global food demand is expected to rise 47 per cent by 2050, and Southeast Asia is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by 2040, making the region central to our ambition of doubling the value of exports in 10 years,” Mr McClay says.

In the year to March 2025, New Zealand exported more than NZ$1.6 billion to Thailand and NZ$1.97 billion to Indonesia.

In Jakarta, the Minister will meet senior Ministers to strengthen cooperation on trade and food security. Discussions will focus on the shared goal of doubling two-way trade by 2029, supporting Indonesia’s participation in the OECD accession process, and further engagement on its interest in joining CPTPP.

“Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest economy worth over NZ$2 trillion. With a growing population of over 280 million it offers exporters significant opportunity as the demand for high-quality, safe food and fibre increases,” Mr McClay says.

In Thailand, the Minister will promote high-value New Zealand exports and advance the Thailand–New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership and our ASEAN economic frameworks.

“Thailand has a diverse economy valued at NZ$915 billion and consistently ranks among our top ten trading partners. Our bilateral trade is strong, however, there’s more to unlock for Kiwi exporters in this market,” Mr McClay says.

The Minister will also meet with New Zealand businesses operating in the region and Thai companies importing premium New Zealand goods.

Minister McClay will undertake his official visit to Thailand and Indonesia from 4 to 8 August.
