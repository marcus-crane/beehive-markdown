Energy Minister Simon Watts will travel to Busan, the Republic of Korea, to join leaders from across the Asia-Pacific region at the 15th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministers Meeting.

“Energy security and affordability are my bottom lines as Minister for Energy. International collaboration is crucial for achieving these goals, and I look forward to contributing to discussions on how we can build more resilient, secure, and sustainable energy systems in the region and harness energy innovation,” Mr Watts says.

“Korea’s theme for APEC 2025 – Building a Sustainable Tomorrow – is incredibly relevant for New Zealand as we deal with our own energy security and affordability challenges on our path to doubling renewable energy by 2050.

“The meeting is an important chance to connect with many of my counterparts and build momentum behind the region’s shared energy goals. In particular I intend to engage with colleagues from the United States, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and Korea while offshore.”

Key topics of discussion include electricity expansion for a secure supply, strengthening grid security and reliability, and AI-driven energy innovation.

Mr Watts is attending the conference from Tuesday through Thursday.
