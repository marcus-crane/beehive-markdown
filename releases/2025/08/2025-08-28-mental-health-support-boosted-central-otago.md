Central Otago locals are set to benefit from boosts to mental health services in Wānaka and Queenstown, including more staff and expanded services, Mental Health and Rural Health Minister Matt Doocey announced today.

“The Government is committed to faster access to mental health support, more frontline mental health workers and a better mental health crisis response,” Mr Doocey says.

“Recently I visited Wānaka as part of the nationwide Rural Health Roadshow, where I had the opportunity to meet with over 300 locals at a community meeting. While there I held a dedicated session with Health Action Wānaka, a local group advocating for improved health services in the region.

“The turnout in Wānaka was the largest of the roadshow so far. Hearing directly from residents and frontline health workers, including their concerns, reinforced why this Government is working hard to improve the health system.

“I am pleased to see progress being made to address some of the challenges there, in the form of:

•    Two additional mental health nurses have joined the Queenstown-based community mental health team, providing increased in-person support across the region.  
•    Expanded psychiatric services for children and adolescents, including a new psychiatrist registrar based in Central Otago.  
•    Telehealth psychiatric consultations, now available for residents in the Upper Clutha region, offering timely support without the need for long travel.  
•    The contract for a new child and youth mental health service in Queenstown Lakes and Central Otago has been awarded to ADL Supporting Young People.

“These changes will help deliver better child and youth services together with  adult crisis support, clinical care, and therapy closer to home – something we heard loud and clear was needed during our Wānaka visit,” Mr Doocey says.

“Our mental health plan is working. We’re turning the corner on reducing wait times and increasing the mental health workforce. Recent data shows the frontline Health NZ mental health workforce has grown around 10 percent since we came into Government, and over 80% of people are being seen within three weeks for specialist services.

“I am very clear that when someone is making the brave step of reaching out to get support, workforce should never be a barrier. Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
