Health Minister Simeon Brown today officially opened Tauranga Hospital’s new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Dependency Unit (HDU), marking a major milestone in improving critical care services for the region.

“This newly expanded and refurbished ICU and HDU complete a significant $21 million upgrade of critical care services for the Bay of Plenty. It will make a real difference for patients, their families, and the staff who care for them,” Mr Brown says.

Previously, Tauranga Hospital had 6 intensive care beds, 4 high dependency beds, and 10 coronary care unit (CCU) beds – a total of 20 beds – all located on the same floor.

“This limited capacity was putting critical care services under pressure, with demand often exceeding capacity. At times, this meant some planned surgeries requiring intensive care afterward had to be postponed.”

The upgrade increases intensive care and high dependency capacity from 10 to 16 beds on a dedicated floor, while the CCU is now located on its own floor with space designed to expand to 20 beds in the future, which could be used for coronary care or other acute care services as demand requires.

“The refurbished CCU provides a larger, separate space for heart patients and improves coordination of cardiology services, including quick access to the hospital’s two state-of-the-art cardiac catheterisation labs – the second of which opened last month.

“The ICU and HDU now occupy a fully refurbished, dedicated floor, giving more patients access to the highest level of care in the right environment.

“Expanding critical care capacity will improve patient flow from the emergency department for unplanned admissions and reduce the need to delay planned surgeries.

"This will ease pressure on the emergency department while ensuring people receive the elective care they need, both of which are essential to meeting the Government’s health targets for shorter emergency stays and reduced elective treatment wait times.”

The upgraded ICU also features three negative pressure rooms, providing additional protection for patients and staff by helping contain infectious diseases when needed.

“Improving health infrastructure is a top priority for the Government to ensure patients receive timely, quality care. The upgraded critical care services at Tauranga Hospital will strengthen healthcare for the local community and the wider Bay of Plenty region, ensuring patients have access to the critical care they need, exactly when they need it,” Mr Brown says.
