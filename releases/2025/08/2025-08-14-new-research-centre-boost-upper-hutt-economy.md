The Government is investing in a new Biodiversity Research Centre future-proofing New Zealand’s unique natural history and providing construction jobs right now, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“We know improving the quality of New Zealand’s infrastructure is vital to growing our economy and helping Kiwis with the cost of living. Around 150 staff are expected to be on site during peak times, but the contractor expects more than 2,000 people to be involved in the project in some way.

“This is just one of the $6 billion worth of infrastructure projects our government is getting underway before Christmas. 

“The new facility in Upper Hutt will house Te Papa’s natural history specimen collection containing more than 860,000 preserved specimens, including the world’s largest collection of New Zealand and Southern Ocean fishes.

“The current Tory Street facility is earthquake-prone and no longer fit for purpose. Without this investment, the collection would have faced disposal, which may have been more costly, and a devastation to science and research.

“Te Papa’s collection is a cornerstone of scientific research in biosecurity, biodiversity, and environmental science, supporting industries such as seafood, aquaculture, horticulture, agriculture, and forestry both nationally and globally.

“It includes specimens dating back over 150 years, with the oldest being a hoki fish caught in Wellington Harbour in 1869. Alongside smaller samples stored in jars, the collection features large marine species such as sharks and a colossal squid, all preserved for scientific study.”

Construction is set to begin next week, with completion expected by March 2028. The collection will be transferred shortly after, and the current facility will be decommissioned by April 2029.

The Government is investing $112.5 million over the next three years. The project is projected to cost $155.4 million overall. It previously received $42.9 million in 2022.
