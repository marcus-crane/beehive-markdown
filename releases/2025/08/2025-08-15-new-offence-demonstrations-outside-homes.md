The Government is introducing a new offence for engaging in disruptive demonstrations outside private homes, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“The public’s ability to demonstrate is a cornerstone of our free and democratic society. It is a key way for citizens to express themselves and engage in political activity. 

“However, in recent times, we have seen increased reports of demonstrations targeting private residences, especially of public persons, such as MPs, judges, and other public officials.

"Everyone in New Zealand, and their families, should be able to expect peace and privacy in their own home, no matter what their daytime job is.

“We intend to stop this intrusive behaviour, while protecting the public’s right to demonstrate in a reasonable manner.

“The ability to protest is protected under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and that will not change. All rights are subject to reasonable limitations. This new offence is such a reasonable limitation and provides a good balance of the interests involved.

“The new law will be tightly targeted. It will only apply to demonstrations directed at a person in their home. It will prohibit unreasonable disruptions for residents, and will consider factors like the time of day, duration, the actions of demonstrators, noise levels and distance to the premises.

“Just as we value the right to protest, privacy is also a key value of our society. Unreasonable intrusions into people’s privacy are simply unacceptable.”

The legislation will contain a new offence for engaging in a targeted and disruptive demonstration outside residential premises.

The Bill includes a maximum penalty of three months in jail or a fine of up to $2,000.
