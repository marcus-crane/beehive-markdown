The Government will carefully weigh up its position over the next month on recognition of a state of Palestine, Foreign Minister Winston Peters says.

“The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is rightly at the forefront of the global agenda,” Mr Peters says. 

“New Zealand, as a long-standing supporter of the two-state solution and Palestinian self-determination, is an active participant in discussions about how to broker a ceasefire and a political settlement to enable Israelis and Palestinians to live peacefully side-by-side. While we are a long way away from the Middle East, we will continue to ensure our voice is heard.” 

Mr Peters took an oral item to Cabinet today about recognition of a state of Palestine, ahead of a formal consideration of the issue in September. 

“Some of New Zealand’s close partners have opted to recognise a Palestinian state, and some have not,” Mr Peters says. 

“Ultimately, New Zealand has an independent foreign policy, and on this issue, we intend to weigh up the issue carefully and then act according to New Zealand’s principles, values and national interest.” 

“New Zealand has been clear for some time that our recognition of a Palestinian state is a matter of when, not if,” Mr Peters says. 

“New Zealand has long asked whether the pre-requisites for a viable and legitimate Palestinian state – in security, political, diplomatic and economic terms – exist. Fundamentally, we will need to weigh up whether sufficient progress is being made against these benchmarks in order to warrant New Zealand recognising a Palestinian state at this juncture.

“New Zealand has been giving this issue careful, methodical and deliberate attention. We will be taking heed of the facts on the ground deteriorating rapidly, our close partners being divided on the issue of recognition, and a range of Arab states making clear Hamas must disarm and must have no future role in Palestinian governance. 

“Cabinet will take a formal decision in September over whether New Zealand should recognise a state of Palestine at this juncture – and if so, when and how.

“This is not a straightforward, clear-cut issue,” Mr Peters says. “There are a broad range of strongly held views within our Government, Parliament and indeed New Zealand society over the question of recognition of a Palestinian state. 

“It is only right that this complicated issue be approached calmly, cautiously and judiciously. Over the next month, we look forward to canvassing this broad range of views before taking a proposal to Cabinet.”

Mr Peters will travel to New York in late September for the United Nations Leaders’ Week, where he will present the Government’s approach to this issue.
