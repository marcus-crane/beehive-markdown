Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has met his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese today in Queenstown.

“It’s an absolute pleasure to welcome my great mate Anthony to the jewel in the crown of New Zealand’s scenic beauty. I’m looking forward to spending more time with him and Jodie, enjoying the best Queenstown has to offer. 

“Prime Minister Albanese and I have just concluded an energetic set of talks where we traversed the full range of matters that are top of mind for two leaders that see the world in very similar ways. 

“We discussed the shared challenges facing the New Zealand and Australian economies and the opportunities we have to work together.

“In particular, I valued the discussion about our respective economic plans. The crossover between New Zealand’s Going for Growth agenda and Australia’s productivity agenda provides plenty of cooperation opportunities,” Mr Luxon says.

The two leaders announced a new partnership between New Zealand and Australia’s national standards bodies. More harmonisation of standards will make trade even easier, bring down costs and support economic growth on both sides of the Tasman.  

The annual leaders’ meeting kicks off a busy period of trans-Tasman economic meetings with the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum in Canberra in September and the Climate and Finance Ministers’ meeting and CER Trade Ministers’ meeting taking place later this year.
