People can now have their say on the New Zealand Disability Strategy with public consultation opening today.

“The draft strategy now out for discussion sets out a vision for the future, with a clear set of goals, and actions to help achieve them in key areas of education, employment, health, housing and justice,” Minister for Disability Issues Louise Upston says.

“The Ministry of Disabled People – Whaikaha carried out targeted engagement with disabled people and organisations to develop this draft and they’re now consulting with the wider disability community and the public. 

“There has been a lot of progress in a short time, and I urge anyone with an interest, whether they be a disabled person, a carer, a family member, or an employer, to give their feedback on the draft.

“The purpose of the strategy is to improve the lives and uphold the rights of disabled people who we know face many barriers, for example in employment, education and housing.

“Three-quarters of unemployed disabled people want to be working which means creating employment opportunities must be an important focus. 

“Disabled people, like non-disabled people, want to participate in their communities, to thrive, lead and make decisions about their own lives.

“The strategy refresh represents huge opportunities to make a positive difference,” Louise Upston says.

The current 10-year New Zealand Disability Strategy ends in 2026, and the draft refreshed strategy will be for five years from 2026-2030.

In addition to targeted engagement, Whaikaha commissioned independent facilitators to work with groups from the disability community on the refresh, and 

in a New Zealand-first, working groups drawn from the disabled community, industry and government agencies were also involved.

People can have their say via various formats, including an accessible online platform, which can be found on the Ministry’s website. They can also find dates, times and locations to register for in-person or online meetings at  [www.whaikaha.govt.nz/disability-strategy](http://www.whaikaha.govt.nz/disability-strategy) 

Consultation will remain open until 28 September 2025.
