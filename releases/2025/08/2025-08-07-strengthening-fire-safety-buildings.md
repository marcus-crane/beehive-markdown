The Government will amend the Building Code to better protect New Zealanders, following strong calls for change as part of a nationwide fire safety review, Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk has confirmed.

"The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has today released the summary of submissions from last year’s consultation on fire safety regulations in the Building Code.

“The review was launched following the devastating fire at Loafers Lodge in Wellington, which sadly claimed the lives of five people in May 2023.

“The recent tragedy here and similar incidents overseas have made it clear we need to look closely at how safe our buildings are, especially larger residential accommodation.

“More than 100 organisations, businesses, and individuals across New Zealand shared their insights during the consultation. I want to thank everyone who took the time to make a submission.

“Since the last update of the Building Code fire safety regulations in 2012, building uses, technology, materials and construction methods have evolved rapidly – adding new complexities to fire safety in our buildings and to firefighting.

“Many submitters agreed that the current framework is overly complex, with confusing building classifications and unclear language.

“These issues are causing inconsistent compliance decisions, consenting delays and challenges for owners trying to maintain buildings.

“Respondents agreed that it is essential for all building occupants to be able to evacuate safely, including people with disabilities and those in accommodation like hotels, motels and boarding houses.

“Others agreed the rules should target specific fire hazards to ensure requirements are fit-for-purpose and cost-effective.

“There was also support for ensuring fire safety provisions in the Building Code align with the realities of modern-day firefighting to protect firefighters while doing their jobs. Submitters agreed that New Zealand’s rules need to keep pace with new technologies and construction methods.

“We have a clear mandate to strengthen protections for New Zealanders by updating our fire safety requirements for buildings.

“I have instructed the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to incorporate this feedback into proposed Building Code changes for Cabinet to consider early next year.”
