Infrastructure, RMA Reform, Housing and Transport Minister Chris Bishop will travel to Sydney and Canberra this week to for a series of engagements with the infrastructure industry and Australian political leaders.

“Our Government is working hard to show the world that New Zealand is open for business. Attracting investment, particularly into our infrastructure sector, is a priority for growing our economy and creating jobs for New Zealanders, as is improving the way we deliver and maintain large infrastructure projects across the country,” Mr Bishop says.

“While in Sydney this week, I will speak at the Institute of Public Works Engineering Australasia (IPWEA) International Public Works Conference (IPWC 2025) about my priorities for New Zealand’s infrastructure and our National Infrastructure Plan,” says Mr Bishop.

“IPWEA provides an opportunity for me to engage with infrastructure industry experts from Australia and beyond.

“I will also speak about our housing reforms alongside New South Wales Premier Chris Minns at the Centre for Independent Studies, and meet with NSW State Treasurer Daniel Mookhey to discuss the actions NSW is taking to reduce approval times for consenting and their approach to infrastructure planning.

“In Canberra I am looking forward to engagements with a range of federal counterparts including Leader of the House Hon Tony Burke, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Hon Catherine King, Housing Minister Hon Clare O’Neil and Environment Minister Hon Murray Watt.”

Mr Bishop leaves for Australia tomorrow and will conclude his visit on Thursday.
