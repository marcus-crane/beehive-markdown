Foreign Minister Winston Peters has emphasised New Zealand’s commitment to Pacific regionalism during the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Fiji today. 

“New Zealand is a steadfast and long-standing advocate for Pacific regionalism, as a founding member of the Pacific Islands Forum and host of the inaugural Forum Leaders Meeting in Wellington in 1971,” Mr Peters says.     

“In these uncertain geo-strategic and challenging economic times, it is more important than ever that the region stands together and sets our own agenda – rather than being pressured or even dictated to by external influences,” Mr Peters says. 

“At the same time, the scale of the challenges we face as a region make it imperative that we are welcoming and encouraging of the interest of dialogue and development partners who wish to work with the Pacific for mutual benefit.”

Mr Peters welcomed the report of the High-Level Persons Group into Pacific regional architecture, which was presented at today’s Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. 

“The issues facing the Pacific are so urgent and important that we need our regional organisations working as effectively and efficiently as possible in advancing our collective interests. This report offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our regional architecture so that it’s fit-for-purpose for tackling today’s acute challenges.”   

During today’s meeting, Mr Peters also offered New Zealand as a host of the 2027 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting. 

“New Zealand last hosted the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting in 2011, so we feel it is important to put our hand up again,” Mr Peters says. 

“While the 2027 host will ultimately be a decision for Forum Leaders to make in the Solomon Islands next month, we wanted to make clear that New Zealand is ready to serve as host again.”

While in Suva, Mr Peters also held a range of bilateral discussions with Pacific counterparts.
