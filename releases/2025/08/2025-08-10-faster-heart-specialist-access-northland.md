The number of people in Northland waiting for their first heart specialist assessment (FSA) has dropped significantly, with the waitlist decreasing by 36 percent since November 2023, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Heart disease remains one of New Zealand’s biggest health challenges. Ensuring patients are seen promptly is vital to detecting heart conditions early and providing timely treatment,” Mr Brown says.

“It’s encouraging that more Northlanders are now accessing specialist care faster when they need it most.”

Between November 2023 and March 2025, the cardiology FSA waitlist fell from 1,091 to 691. The number of patients waiting longer than four months dropped by 68 percent, from 367 to 116.

“Whether it’s a dairy farmer receiving a timely assessment before their heart condition worsens, or a rural family no longer left anxiously waiting for a crucial appointment for their loved one, these improvements are making a real difference in people’s lives.”

This progress comes after a period between 2020 and 2023 when waitlists grew by 42 percent.

“Our patient-first commitment is reflected in the dedication of Northland’s hardworking teams, who have played a key role in reducing waitlists by:

- Running regular cardiac clinics and tests at rural hospitals, reducing travel for patients and families
- Coordinating assessments to minimise multiple visits
- Prioritising those who have waited the longest
- Expanding local services, including the catheterisation lab, and attracting skilled specialists at Whangārei Hospital

“Reducing wait times for First Specialist Assessments remains a Government priority, with a target for 95 percent of patients to be seen within four months by 2030.

“While there’s still more work to do, these results show that we’re making real progress towards faster, more accessible heart care for the people of Northland,” Mr Brown says.
