Seahawk helicopters and Airbus planes are set to replace aging New Zealand Defence Force aircraft in the first major investment decisions to be made as part of the Government’s Defence Capability Plan (DCP).

Defence Minister Judith Collins and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters today announced investment decisions of $2.7 billion, with the MH-60R Seahawk the preferred option to replace the existing maritime helicopters. The Airbus A321XLR (extra long range) aircraft will replace the aging 757 fleet.

“This decision will ensure New Zealand has a critical combat capable, interoperable and dependable fleet,” Ms Collins says.

“The MH-60R Seahawk is a great aircraft for what New Zealand needs and fulfils our objective of having a more integrated Anzac force, and the new planes will give us reliable aircraft to deploy personnel and respond to international events.”

Mr Peters says these decisions show how the Government is responding to the sharply deteriorating security environment.

“Global tensions are increasing rapidly, and we must invest in our national security to ensure our economic prosperity.

“The DCP provides the foundation for our uplift in defence spending, and two-yearly reviews of the plan will allow us to adapt to an ever-changing security environment.” 

The $2 billion plus investment in maritime helicopters and $700 million investment in the new Airbus A321XLRs are both part of the $12 billion in planned commitments outlined in the 2025 DCP announced in April. 

Ms Collins says the maritime helicopters are versatile and add combat and deterrent capability to our naval fleet.

“These five Seahawks will increase the offensive and defensive capability and surveillance range of New Zealand’s frigates and ensure we are interoperable with our ally Australia and other partner defence forces,” she says.

“We will now move at pace to procure helicopters directly through the United States’ Foreign Military Sales programme instead of going to a wider tender, with Cabinet expected to consider the final business case next year. 

“The two new Airbus A321XLR aircraft will be acquired on a six-year lease to buy arrangement, with capital costs of $620 million and four-year operating costs of $80.86 million.  

“New Zealand needs reliable aircraft to deploy our personnel, deliver military equipment and humanitarian aid, support the evacuation of civilians, and transport government trade and diplomatic delegations quickly, over long distances, and often at short notice.

“The decision to acquire the extra long range aircraft reflects the importance of having an aircraft capable of such things as returning safely from Antarctica if it is unable to land due to conditions on the ice.

“Our Defence Force personnel have proven time and time again they do an outstanding job and we must ensure they have the tools that are up to the task.”
