Thanks to the Red Tape Tipline homeowners building garden sheds, sleepouts, or garages will face less red tape and fewer delays by the end of this year, Regulation Minister David Seymour and Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk say.

Cabinet has agreed to remove the minimum required distance between single storey buildings under 10 square metres and a property boundary or other residential building (setback distance). Cabinet has also agreed to reduce the setback distance to one metre for single storey buildings between 10 and 30 square metres.

Previously, garden sheds and other single storey detached buildings like sleep outs or garages had to be as far from a boundary or residential building as they were tall. Anything closer than that required building consent.

“We’ve heard the frustration about this regulation through the Red Tape Tipline. Section sizes are shrinking, and the cost of living rising. Forcing people to put sheds in the middle of their lawn or pay for a consent to store tools doesn’t make sense.

“There is no justification for such generous setback distances on private property.

“Today’s housing market means space is tight and building costs are high. These types of property developments are practical and affordable improvements. We want people to be able to utilise them without hassle.

“We’re acting on the tips we get through the red tape tipline by removing regulation and making it easier for Kiwis to get things done. We want to hear about red tape like this that’s getting in the way – I encourage anyone with a red tape issue to report it on the [Ministry for Regulation website](https://consultation.regulation.govt.nz/regulatory-issues/tell-us-about-a-regulatory-issue/).”

The changes will make it easier and cheaper for property owners to build useful structures like:

- Garden sheds for storing tools and bikes
- Sleepouts or hobby spaces
- Small garages or workshops

“This Government is relentlessly focused on making it easier and more affordable to build,” Mr Penk says.

“We don’t believe Kiwis should be bogged down in bureaucracy when making practical use of their own backyard.

“By the end of the year, homeowners will be able to put up a small shed or garage closer to their boundary or another building without needing a consent.

“That’s a real win for anyone short on space, giving them more freedom to add a bike shed, protect their tools, cover a vehicle, or even create a small sleepout for guests – all without extra paperwork.

“Frustration with the building consent system is one of the top issues flagged to the Red Tape Tipline. It’s great to see action that cuts through delays and makes life easier for everyday Kiwis”.

These changes are expected to be in force by late 2025.
