Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced Chris Seed will be New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the United States of America.

“New Zealand’s strategic partnership with the United States is one of our most important and long-standing relationships,” Mr Peters says.

“It is therefore essential that New Zealand’s Ambassador to the United States has the necessary experience, judgement and influence to effectively represent our country in Washington DC and navigate the range of important and pressing issues that are vital to New Zealanders.

“Mr Seed is one of New Zealand’s most senior and accomplished diplomats and is accordingly the right person for this vital role,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Seed served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2019-2024 and has previously led New Zealand High Commissions in Canberra and Port Moresby. He will take up the role in January 2026.

Mr Seed succeeds Rosemary Banks, who will shortly complete her second term as Ambassador in Washington DC.

“Ms Banks has had a most distinguished diplomatic career, having led New Zealand missions in Paris, New York and Washington,” Mr Peters says. 

“Twice Ms Banks has been asked by her Government to serve in Washington DC and we are enormously grateful to her that twice she answered that call to serve with distinction as New Zealand Ambassador to the United States.

“Ms Banks’ long diplomatic experience and her elevated standing amongst her US counterparts, during such a challenging time in global affairs, has seen her contribute greatly to one of New Zealand’s most critical bilateral relationships,” Mr Peters says.
