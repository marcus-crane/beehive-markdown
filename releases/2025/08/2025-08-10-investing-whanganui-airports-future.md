A major investment in Whanganui Airport will improve safety, enhance regional connectivity and aid economic growth for the region, Associate Transport Minister James Meager says.

The Government will use $3.35 million in taxpayer funding to complete construction of the new sealed parallel taxiway. The investment will address long-standing safety concerns by reducing the need for aircraft to backtrack on the active runway before take-off and after landing.

“Whanganui Airport is one of New Zealand’s busiest regional airports in terms of flight movements. This new taxiway will reduce the risk of collisions and make flying in and out of the site safer for both pilots and passengers. It will also reduce aircraft congestion and improve resilience by providing an all-weather replacement for the grass taxiways,” Mr Meager says.

“Being able to make this decision now will also potentially save local ratepayers hundreds of thousands of dollars by keeping the current construction contractors on-site to finish the second stage of the taxiway safety improvements.”

The investment represents the taxpayer’s 50% share of the $6.7 million contracted costs to build the full taxiway. The remaining funding has come from the Whanganui District Council.

“This investment is a result of the advocacy of local Whanganui MP Carl Bates, who first brought this issue to my attention several months ago. Mr Bates has worked constructively with the Government, Council and local operators to find a solution which encourages continued growth,” Mr Meager says.

“His dedication to serving his local community has been critical in getting this investment over the line. Whanganui Airport is a vital regional hub for medical flying, and hosts New Zealand’s largest international flight training school the New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy (NZICPA).

“The NZICPA has resumed flight training operations and has demonstrated its commitment to providing a high quality, safe training facility that we need to meet the growing demand for commercial pilots.

“Aviation is critical to New Zealand's domestic economy, which relies on air travel for connectivity, tourism and economic growth. It’s important we take active steps to improve connectivity, address workforce shortages, and make it easier for aviators to operate in New Zealand.

“This is a significant step forward for regional connectivity. By providing funding for this development, we’re investing in the future of the Whanganui region and community, boosting economic opportunities and improving access for residents and visitors.”
