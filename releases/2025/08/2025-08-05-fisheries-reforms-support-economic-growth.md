The Government is progressing a package of major fisheries reforms that will remove obstacles to the fishing industry achieving its enormous potential for sustainable growth, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says

“These changes are the most significant reforms to the Fisheries Act for decades and they reflect my commitment to the success of our fishing industry which generates around $1.5 billion in exports each year.”

A key feature of the reforms is more efficient and effective decision-making when setting sustainable catch limits. The changes mean specific fisheries will be able to have rules that automatically respond to changes in abundance for up to five years.

“These rules will be subject to the usual scientific evaluation and consultation processes but will allow for greater catch when there are more fish in the water and more responsive intervention when fisheries need to recover,” Mr Jones says.

“This replaces the much slower process currently in place where each change must be assessed and be considered separately.”

Fishers’ privacy will also be better protected through a change that will exclude footage from the Official Information Act.

“We are making changes to the onboard camera programme to protect the privacy and confidentiality of regular New Zealanders going about their legal business.

“The information from on-board cameras will continue to contribute to fisheries management but camera footage will not be subject to the Official Information Act 1982. Fishers won’t need to worry about private or commercially sensitive footage being publicly released and either deliberately or unintentionally misconstrued,” Mr Jones says.

Finally, the reforms set out practical and workable rules around when fish must be landed and when they can be returned to the sea for vessels monitored by onboard cameras or observers.

“As long as the catch is monitored and accounted for under the Fisheries Act, fishers will be able to decide whether to land or discard relevant catch. 

“Together these changes support the Government’s objective to remove unnecessary obstacles to growth. I want a thriving and sustainable fishing industry that continues to contribute to New Zealand’s export-led recovery.”

An amendment Bill will be introduced later this year, and people will have a further opportunity to provide feedback on the Bill during the select committee process.
