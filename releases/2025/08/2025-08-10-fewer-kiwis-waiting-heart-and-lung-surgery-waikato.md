Fewer Waikato patients are waiting for critical heart and lung surgery, with the number of people on the cardiothoracic treatment waitlist dropping by 70 per cent since November 2023, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Heart and lung conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated, so it is fantastic news that more people in Waikato are getting the treatment they need faster,” Mr Brown says.

“Putting patients first means making sure every Kiwi can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it and that is exactly what is happening here in Waikato.”

Between November 2023 and March 2025, the number of people waiting for cardiothoracic treatment in Waikato has fallen from 90 to 27, a 70 per cent reduction. The number waiting longer than four months for surgery has dropped from 13 to 4.

“This is great progress, and it is making a real difference to people’s lives. Whether it is a grandparent needing a heart bypass to keep up with the grandkids, a young mum recovering from lung surgery and getting back to her family, or a Waikato farmer returning to work after life-saving treatment, this is about delivering for patients.”

Mr Brown says these improvements are a result of the strong focus on delivery by frontline health workers in the Waikato region responding to the Government’s health targets. 

"The region’s strong commitment to preventing surgery cancellations and expanding surgical capacity has delivered significant reductions in waiting lists. These outcomes reflect the hard work and dedication of local teams, whose focus on patient care has been essential to this success.

“Reducing wait times for elective procedures is a key priority for this Government. Our health target is clear – by 2030, 95 per cent of patients will be treated within four months.

“We are investing in our health workforce, validating our waiting lists, boosting capacity, and working closely with hospitals to make sure services meet patient needs, because that is what Kiwis deserve.

"This is part of our plan to deliver timely, quality healthcare for every New Zealander. We want everyone to access specialist care, such as heart or lung surgery, sooner – no matter where they live."
