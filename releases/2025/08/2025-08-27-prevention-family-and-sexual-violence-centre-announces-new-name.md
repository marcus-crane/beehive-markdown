The Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence Karen Chhour has today confirmed the new name for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence multi-agency organisation.

“I am pleased to announce that it will now be called ‘The Centre for Family Violence and Sexual Violence Prevention’.

“This name reflects the role this team plays in aligning government strategy, policy and investment to improve the family violence and sexual violence system through the implementation of the National Strategy and its Action Plan,” said Min Chhour.

The Centre supports government agencies to take a collective, community-led and people-centred approach to delivering solutions that prevent and respond to violence, strengthen and heal.

It has significant work underway in partnership with communities and plays a central role in enabling evidence-based responses to family violence and sexual violence.
