Feedback is being sought on proposals to cut the rock lobster catch on Northland’s east coast to allow the fishery to recover.

“Rock lobster, which plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, is prized by commercial, recreational and customary fishers,” Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“The proposals that have been developed are significant. They would reduce catch on Northland’s east coast to, in the longer term, increase the abundance and size of rock lobster in that fishery.

“It’s about allowing the fishery on the east coast to recover so there are more and bigger lobsters in Northland’s east coast fishery,” Mr Jones says.

The proposals include:

- Options for seasonal or year-round area closures to the spiny rock lobster fishery on the east coast of Northland (CRA 1),
- an additional option to close a small section of the CRA 2 coastline (bordering CRA 1) to the take of spiny rock lobster to avoid displacement of fishing effort, and
- options to reduce the recreational daily limits for spiny rock lobster and packhorse rock lobster.

“Officials engaged with the public late last year ahead of developing these proposals, and it’s clear from feedback that we all want a healthy and thriving Northland rock lobster fishery,” Mr Jones says.

“Taking steps to increase the abundance and size of rock lobster in this fishery is good for fishers but also for the marine environment. Rock lobster helps keep kina in check so they don’t destroy important kelp forest habitat and cause bare areas of rocky reef known as kina or urchin barrens.

“I’ve made dealing with kina barrens a priority.

Consultation on the Northland proposals starts today, and people have until 5pm on 22 September 2025 to make a submission.
