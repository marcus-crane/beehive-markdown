Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka today recognises the significant achievements of the Māori recipients in the King’s Birthday 2025 Honours List, for their dedicated mahi and outstanding contributions across various important areas.

“The impressive mahi of Māori recipients this year are too numerous to mention. They have been honoured for achievements across many fields, coming from Iwi right across New Zealand – it is my privilege to recognise all of them today and to highlight just some examples,” Mr Potaka says.

“The King’s Birthday Honours recognise the commitment and the passion that the recipients have shown, along with what has come from their dedication to their work and their causes.

“Among those recognised are, Mrs Deborah (Debbie) Davis, who has done extensive work to bring so much good, including through He Iwi Kotahi Tātou Trust, the grassroots organisation transforming the community of Moerewa in Northland, along with her husband, Mr Ngahau Davis (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Manu, Kohatutaka)

“Mrs Davis (Ngāti Pāhauwera, Ngāti Kahungunu) has worked, through the Trust since 1987, to address challenges including housing, food security within the community, and youth engagement. Her and her husband’s work helped to provide insulation and heating solutions to more than 12,000 Northland homes since 2008. 

“They have developed food rescue programmes and have introduced cultural and sports programmes that blend physical activity with the preservation of Māori traditions. They have expanded whānau support services to offer counselling, school programmes, and drug and alcohol programmes. Over the past 15 years, they have been involved in the establishment of a rehabilitative-focused sentencing in Kaikohe, Matariki Court.

“Hon Dover Samuels is recognised for services as a Member of Parliament and his achievements and what he progressed in that time, including as Minister of Māori Affairs.

“Mr Samuels (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kura, Ngāti Rēhia) was a Labour MP and MP for Te Tai Tokerau, working across various portfolios, including not least Māori Affairs, where his care and ability made considerable gains that continue to benefit Māori today. He also helped establish Rawene Health Hub for a rural Māori community and led the Rainbow Warrior project to sink the wreckage of the vessel and erect a memorial on Matauri Hill. He is kaumatua of several organisations. 

“Mrs Elizabeth (Liz) Graham, who has dedicated more than 40 years to her community and to Māori education.

“Mrs Graham (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāi Toroiwahi), has contributed to her community in many ways – that includes through the education of our tamariki and to the education sector through many roles across her career, work she continues today as a teacher at Te Aute College. She helped guide her community through the Treaty Settlement process, and her knowledge of traditions, values, and customs, has helped the marae in hosting funerals, weddings, gatherings, and other events for over 20 years.

“The Honourable Sir Mark Cooper KC, High Court Judge, Court of Appeal Judge and President of the Court of Appeal, who was Chairperson of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes. 

Sir Mark (Ngāti Mahanga, Waikato-Tainui) chaired 33 public hearings to deliver four reports, all of these under intense time pressure and public scrutiny. The detailed findings and recommendations of those reports helped avoid delay to the Canterbury rebuild and helped provide a resolution to the community.

Amongst some of his other work has been his leadership in resource management and local government law, and his work that helped integrate various councils into one North Shore-based Council.

I want to thank all of today’s recipients, those mentioned here and all others who I trust will be celebrated by their people and their communities, and all the people who have worked with them along the way.
