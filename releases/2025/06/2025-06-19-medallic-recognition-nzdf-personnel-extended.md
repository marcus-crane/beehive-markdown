The Government has expanded the criteria for medallic recognition for Defence personnel who have served in operations supporting the UN’s sanctions against North Korea, Defence Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“This medal – the New Zealand General Service Medal (NZGSM) 2002 (Korea) – has already been awarded to 180 personnel and the move to widen eligibility means a further 350 personnel will be recognised,” Ms Collins says.

“Personnel who have served as part of Operation Whio – which monitors the United Nations Security Council’s sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea - since 2018 are now eligible for this medal.

“Over the past seven years, there have been 19 rotations of Operation Whio – including seven deployments of P-3K2 Orion and P-8A Poseidon aircraft, aircrew and support personnel, and the deployment of HMNZS Aotearoa in 2024.

The aircraft and ship conducted and supported maritime patrols to detect and deter evasions of United Nations Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against North Korea. The other rotations were of small numbers of staff officers in headquarters roles.

“This is another example of how we are contributing to upholding the international rules-based order. 

“Previously this specific medal, the NZGSM 2002 (Korea), was only awarded to United Nations Command activities relating to preserving the Korean Armistice Agreement,” Ms Collins says.

“The men and women of our Defence Force rightly deserve this acknowledgement of their service.

“Our people do what we ask of them, when we ask it, often in trying conditions, and medallic recognition such as this is one way we recognise this.”
