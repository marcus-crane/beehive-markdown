The Government is ensuring more students with the highest learning support needs have access to warm, safe, dry and fit-for-purpose learning environments.

“We know many parents of children with high needs want the option of a specialist education setting. Right now, those choices are limited because our specialist schools are stretched beyond capacity. This investment is about giving families more choice and confidence their children can learn in the environment that best supports them,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

$30 million through Budget 2025 will expand specialist school property across New Zealand. Investment will fund the construction of 18 new satellite classrooms at host schools nationwide and 5 additional classrooms at two base specialist schools, relieving pressure on the network.

This funding will deliver:

- Two classrooms for Blomfield Special School at Selwyn Park School in Dargaville,
- Two classrooms for Hamilton North School at Ngaruawahia School in Waikato,
- Two classrooms for Kimi Ora School at Taita College in Lower Hutt,
- Two classrooms for Tauranga Special School at Te Puke Primary School in the Bay of Plenty,
- Two classrooms for Rosehill School at Papakura Normal School in Auckland,
- Two classrooms for Fairhaven School at Onekawa School in Napier,
- Four classrooms for Central Auckland Specialist School at an Auckland school,
- Two classrooms for Oaklynn Special School at Kelston Intermediate in Auckland,
- Two classrooms at Ferndale School in Christchurch,
- Three classrooms at Sara Cohen School in Dunedin.

“Specialist schools play a vital role in our education system. This investment recognises the incredible work these schools do and builds on the largest boost to learning support in a generation.

“The classrooms are set to enter construction over the next 12 months. The majority will be delivered using offsite manufacturing or repeatable designs which enable the funding to go further, so more schools get the extra classrooms they need. The sooner we build, the sooner schools can provide tailored support, so more children have the chance to thrive,” Ms Stanford said.
