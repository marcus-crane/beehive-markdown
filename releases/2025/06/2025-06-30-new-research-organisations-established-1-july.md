Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti says today marks a major milestone for New Zealand’s science and innovation sector with the launch of three new science organisations designed to unlock innovation, drive economic growth, and improve the lives of hardworking Kiwis. 

“Science, innovation and technology are the engine rooms of a productive economy and our Government is committed to powering up our scientists and innovators to deliver for New Zealanders,” says Dr Reti. 

“From today, six Crown Research Institutes will merge to form two new entities: the Bioeconomy Science Institute and the Earth Science Institute. Meanwhile, ESR will refocus its mission to become the Public Health and Forensic Science Institute.

“These changes are about sharpening our focus and lifting performance. By bringing together complementary research skills and infrastructure, we’re enabling greater collaboration, better alignment with Government priorities, and stronger commercial outcomes.

“These new organisations will be set up to deliver real-world value, creating jobs, boosting exports, and helping New Zealand compete globally.”

The new institutes will remain Crown companies, but with a renewed mandate to deliver economic benefits for New Zealand. 

“This reform is a practical step to ensure our science sector is agile, responsive, and focused on outcomes that matter – jobs, growth and innovation. We’re backing our scientists to turn ideas into impact, and to help New Zealand lead in areas like biotechnology, climate resilience, and public health,” says Dr Reti.

Dr Reti also acknowledged the contributions of outgoing Chairs and Board members of the seven Crown Research Institutes, whose leadership has laid the groundwork for this new chapter. He extended thanks to the dedicated staff across the institutes, whose work continues to make a meaningful difference to New Zealand’s economy and communities.

“This Government is committed to building a science system that delivers results. These reforms are about unlocking the full potential of our research sector to fuel economic growth, drive innovation, and secure a more prosperous future for all New Zealanders,” Dr Reti says.
