Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti and Space Minister Judith Collins have today announced that in partnership with the US, the Government is investing $5.6 million to support five new joint NZ-NASA research projects in the field of Earth observation.

Researchers from New Zealand and NASA will work in partnership to tackle challenges such as disaster resilience and environmental management over the next three years.

“These projects will combine some of New Zealand’s best research talent with NASA’s world-leading scientific expertise and technology, driving innovation in space science and environmental monitoring,” Dr Reti says.

“Advancing Earth observation science helps us better understand our natural environment and enables us to manage our natural resources more effectively. For example, we can use satellite data and AI algorithms to accurately measure water movements, which helps manage freshwater and mitigate floods.

“These projects will create a more resilient economy and drive productivity in some of our most valuable export industries, such as forestry and agriculture. They will also grow our science and innovation sector by positioning us in global growth markets such as remote sensing,” Dr Reti says.

“The US is an indispensable space cooperation partner for New Zealand and our engagement with NASA is a key part of our bilateral relationship. These projects will further entrench our ongoing and positive relationship with NASA,” Ms Collins says.

“NASA will contribute Earth observation satellite data, access to advanced tools and technology, as well as approximately $1.9 million in direct staff time and expertise."

The projects are the second stage of the NZ–NASA research partnership through the Catalyst Fund, following an earlier round of feasibility studies. The selected projects span a range of high-impact areas:

- **Te Mātai Pū o te Kea – High Altitude Coastal Remote Sensing** – advances remote-sensing technology using Kea’s Atmos high-altitude uncrewed aircraft.
- **Satellite Multi-Scale Hydrologic Framework for Te Hiku ō Te Ika Wairere Ngahere** – develops tools to measure terrestrial water flux via satellite data.
- **Monitoring Vegetation–Geothermal Interactions from Space and Airborne Platforms** – Integrates multiple Earth observation data streams to measure chemical and physical changes via vegetation.
- **Near Real-Time Fuel Moisture System for Wildfire and Drought** – builds a predictive fire model using remote sensing.
- **Integrating Machine Learning and Remote Sensing for Dynamic Forest Mapping** – develops predictive forest mapping using satellite imagery.
