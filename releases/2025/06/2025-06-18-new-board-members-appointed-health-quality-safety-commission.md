Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced three new board appointments to the Health Quality & Safety Commission.

“Dr Watson is a specialist youth health physician, a clinical leader with expertise in medical administration and paediatrics and currently contracted as Regional Strategic Clinical Advisor to Health New Zealand.

He is also a member of the Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal.”

“Ms Campbell is a registered nurse with over 35 years’ experience, specialising in system quality and patient safety within the health care sector.

“Ms Perry is an experienced public servant with a strong background in health, regulatory services, and leadership. She has held senior roles, including Deputy Director-General at the Ministry of Health and other roles in regulatory services, health system improvement and innovation, and integrated service design, and has played a key role in implementing significant health initiatives”.

“I would like to thank outgoing members Dr Andrew Connolly for his services to the Board since 2018, and Dr Jennifer Parr for her services to the Board since 2019.”

“These members provided expertise and advice during their time on the Board. I thank them for their significant contribution and look forward to working with the new members as they begin their terms,” Mr Brown says.
