The Government is recognising Matariki at the official ceremony near Ohakune today, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka say.

“We are honoured to be guests of Ngāti Rangi for this traditional hautapu ceremony,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“This is the fourth national Matariki broadcast but the first time it has been hosted by a marae, and the first year Puanga is the star of national celebrations. 

"Matariki and Puanga are both stars that sit in the night sky together to signal the start of the Māori new year for different iwi. 

“We are very fortunate to have this opportunity to witness and share in the Puanga traditions of Ngāti Rangi.

“The theme for this year’s celebration is Matariki mā Puanga*,* which means celebrating together. I hope that no matter where people are, they get the chance to remember, celebrate and look to the future. Mānawatia a Matariki!”

“For many Iwi, Puanga shines brightest above our communities as we grow the tradition of celebrating together,” Mr Potaka says.

“These Puanga observations signal the year is coming to a close, and inform forecasts for the future. It’s a time to reflect on the past, remembering and giving thanks to those who have passed on before us.

“It’s also a time to reflect on what was achieved over the past year. Along with the rising of Matariki, we welcome the dawn of a new year and plan ahead with ancestral wisdom.”
