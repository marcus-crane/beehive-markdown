Associate Transport Minister James Meager has confirmed an additional $76.7 million for New Zealand Search and Rescue over three years, to ensure 12 organisations can continue their lifesaving operations.

Additionally, the Government has announced an investment of $624,000 over the same period, to help maintain and improve recreational aviation safety across the country.

“New Zealand has one of the largest and most challenging search and rescue regions in the world, so it’s vital to ensure they have necessary funding to deliver their critical services,” Mr Meager says.

"Ensuring Kiwis are safe as they go about their activities, either for work or leisure, is one of the Government’s top transport priorities.

“Last year, 152 lives were saved, 921 people were assisted and 794 people were rescued through the work of the search and rescue sector. This is thanks to the dedication of than 11,000 people involved in the industry – 80 per cent of whom are volunteers.”

$542,000 will go towards the New Zealand Aviation Federation to deliver updated Instrument Flight Procedures at unattended aerodromes, which pilots use to safely take off and land at airports across the country.

An $82,000 funding boost will also enhance safety at those sites, paying for further training and education to remind pilots of the necessary safety procedures.

“The investment also underlines the Government’s commitment to helping grow our economy by supporting a safe and secure recreational aviation system,” Mr Meager says.

“Many Kiwis and visitors love to get out and explore our beautiful country. Today’s announcements will help keep everyone safe when they’re outdoors – whether that’s on the land, water or in the air.”
