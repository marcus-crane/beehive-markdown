A reservoir to be built near Carterton will be a game-changer for the town and wider Wairarapa region, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

The 20ha reservoir, which will hold up to 1 million m3, will provide water for industry at Waingawa Industrial Park and irrigation for land.

“Water resilience has been identified as a regional priority for Wairarapa. A lack of water security is holding back development limiting current land-use options.

“The reservoir is game-changing for this region and will be key infrastructure for Wairarapa’s resilience to extreme weather, including drought,” Mr Jones says.

Carterton District Council has been granted an initial loan of up to $3 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund for preparatory work. A further $17m loan will be available from the fund for construction once a final model is confirmed. The total project cost is budgeted at $25m, with the council contributing $5m of co-funding.

“This investment in water infrastructure aligns with the Coalition Government’s Going for Growth strategy and its objective to double exports by 2034,” Mr Jones says.

The reservoir is expected to bring jobs and more economic activity to existing and new industries at Waingawa Industrial Park. 

The project will also increase agriculture production on nearby land, with a 50 per cent increase in crop yield predicted. It will allow pastoral land to be converted to higher-value horticultural land.

“The Government’s investment in water is addressing barriers to development in regions like Wairarapa where a consistent water source is needed to unlock economic, environmental and recreational resources for its communities,” Mr Jones says.
