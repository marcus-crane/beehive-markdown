Parliament has today passed legislation to formally establish Invest New Zealand, clearing the way for the new investment attraction agency to begin operations on 1 July 2025.

“This marks a major step in the Government’s plan to grow the economy by attracting more international capital, businesses and talent into New Zealand,” Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay says.

“Invest New Zealand will have a clear commercial focus—working directly with global investors to unlock opportunities that create jobs, boost innovation, and lift our long-term productivity.”

Budget 2025 committed $85 million over four years to support the agency’s establishment as an autonomous Crown entity.

Invest New Zealand will:

- Drive investment into advanced and high-growth industries;
- Connect offshore investors with local businesses and research opportunities;
- Support global companies to grow their R&D footprint in New Zealand;
- Help build the skills base needed to support a more innovative economy.

A private sector advisory group, chaired by Rob Morrison, has played a key role in designing the agency’s framework and will continue to provide strategic advice as the agency scales up.

“Invest New Zealand will act as a bridge between global capital and New Zealand’s economic potential,” Mr McClay says.

“It’s about making it easier to do business here—cutting red tape, speeding up decision-making, and targeting investment that delivers long-term benefits for the country.”

The agency will be up and running 1 July.
