Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has congratulated the 2025 recipients of King’s Birthday Honours.

“Every person on this list has made New Zealand a better place.

“Locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally they are the proof that individual actions build a strong and thriving country.

“I am inordinately proud that twice every year, we can easily find dozens of outstanding citizens to honour this way, and I would like to thank all of the New Zealanders on this list for their service and achievements.

“To our new Dames and Knights, carry your Honour with the pride with which it was given,” Mr Luxon says.

Appointed as Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit are Ranjna Patel, Emeritus Distinguished Professor Alison Stewart, and Catriona Williams.

“Dame Ranjna Patel has made a lasting impact across New Zealand in her service to ethnic communities, health and family violence prevention. She founded Mana for Mums for young Māori and Pacific women in South Auckland, co-founded a multi-cultural community centre, and co-founded Tāmaki Health, which has grown to become New Zealand’s largest privately owned primary healthcare group. In doing so, Dame Ranjna has helped hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders,” says Mr Luxon.

“Dame Alison Stewart is an internationally renowned plant scientist with a 40-year career focused on sustainable plant protection, soil biology and plant biotechnology. She reinforces New Zealand’s stellar reputation in science and is an example of how our science community will continue to lead the world,” Mr Luxon says.

“Dame Catriona Williams’ legacy in spinal cord injury goes back more than 20 years. This remarkable woman has been the founder and driving force behind the CatWalk Spinal Cord Injury Trust since its establishment in 2005. She has inspired countless people by her example of courage and determination in the face of adversity. Dame Catriona dedicates her time to engage with people who have experienced a spinal cord injury and are new to life in a wheelchair,” says Mr Luxon.

This year’s Knights Companion are The Honourable Mark Cooper, Brendan Lindsay, and Ewan Smith.

“Sir Mark Cooper’s service to the judiciary is distinguished and longstanding. He became President of the Court of Appeal after being a Court of Appeal Judge from 2014 and a High Court Judge from 2004. Sir Mark was Chairperson of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes and his detailed findings and recommendations avoided delay to the Canterbury rebuild and provided a sense of resolution to the community at a time it was critical,” Mr Luxon says.

“Businessman and philanthropist Sir Brendan Lindsay built a global brand producing sustainable and recyclable storage products stamped ‘Made in New Zealand’. Sistema was sold to an American firm in 2016, with the buyer committing in writing to keep production in New Zealand for 20 years. That business acumen has created a philanthropic legacy that has helped countless charities including Pet Refuge, Starship National Air Ambulance Service, New Zealand Riding for the Disabled and Assistance Dogs New Zealand Trust,” Mr Luxon says.

“Sir Ewan Smith is legendary in the Cook Islands. The founder of Air Rarotonga, he has grown the business to become the largest private sector employer in the Cook Islands. However, it is his passion and loyalty to his people that distinguishes him further. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he ensured no Air Rarotonga employee was made redundant, and the airline maintained essential cargo and medevac services throughout the Cooks. Everyone including himself was placed on a minimum wage and he provided mentorship, counselling and budget advice to staff. Sir Ewan exemplifies what it is to be a good employer and an outstanding citizen.

“I would like to congratulate all 188 recipients of this year’s King’s Birthday Honours. We are proud of you, and we celebrate the example you set for others,” Mr Luxon says.
