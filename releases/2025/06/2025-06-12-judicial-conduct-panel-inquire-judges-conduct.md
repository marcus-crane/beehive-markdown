A Judicial Conduct Panel will inquire into and report on the alleged conduct of acting District Court Judge Ema Aitken, Acting Attorney-General Paul Goldsmith says.

“Judge Aitken’s alleged conduct at the Northern Club on 22 November 2024 was the subject of a preliminary examination by the Judicial Conduct Commissioner.

“The Commissioner recommended a Panel be set up to inquire into what happened. I have accepted that recommendation.

“Following an inquiry, the Panel will provide me with a report, including its opinion as to whether consideration of Judge Aitken’s removal is justified.

“Members of the Panel will be appointed following consultation with the Chief Justice.

“I won’t be making any further comment until then.”
