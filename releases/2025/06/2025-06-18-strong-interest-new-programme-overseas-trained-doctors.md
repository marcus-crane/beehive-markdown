A total of 180 overseas-trained doctors have expressed interest in a new Government-funded training programme aimed at boosting New Zealand’s primary care workforce, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“New Zealand needs more doctors – particularly in primary and rural healthcare care settings – and this Government is taking action to make that happen,” Mr Brown says.

“That’s why we’ve launched a new two-year training programme to support up to 100 additional overseas-trained doctors across the country.”

Announced in March, the programme supports qualified international doctors to become registered in New Zealand, with a particular focus on those wanting to enter general practice roles – creating a clear pathway for doctors already in the country and ready to contribute to our health system.

“It makes no sense that overseas-trained doctors already living here, ready and willing to work in primary care, are held back simply due to a lack of supported clinical training opportunities. We are changing that.”

Applications for the programme closed on 31 May, with 184 expressions of interest received – well exceeding the number of places available. The first group of 10 overseas-trained doctors will begin in Waikato this July, with Health New Zealand currently working to match the remaining placement locations with district and primary care providers.

“This strong response shows the scale of untapped potential in New Zealand. These doctors are eager to work where they are most needed – and this Government is opening the door for them to do so.

“I’ve also requested advice from Health New Zealand on how to provide clear, structured pathways for doctors who have passed the NZREX to begin practising under limited scopes while they wait for a placement in general practice training.

“This is part of our broader plan to strengthen primary and rural healthcare and ensure New Zealanders get timely access to the care they need, no matter where they live,” Mr Brown says.
