Health Minister Simeon Brown today officially opened the new Athlae Lyon Day Stay Unit at Starship Children’s Hospital, marking a major milestone in the ongoing redevelopment of New Zealand’s largest children’s hospital.

“Starship plays a critical role in caring for our most vulnerable children, not just from Auckland but from right across New Zealand. It provides lifesaving care and specialist services that families depend on during some of the most challenging times they will face,” Mr Brown says.

“This new, purpose-built medical day stay unit is a significant step toward delivering the modern, fit-for-purpose health services that children and their families deserve.

“It offers a dedicated, child-friendly space for procedures that don’t require an overnight stay – such as infusions, allergy testing, medical reviews for chronic conditions, and sleep studies. The bright, welcoming environment is designed to support a positive experience for both patients and their families.”

The new unit replaces a much smaller area that accommodated just three procedure chairs, nearly tripling capacity to six chairs along with two flexible rooms that can be used for sleep studies or as isolation spaces when infection control is required.

“Shifting appropriate procedures to this new day stay unit will help hospital teams work more efficiently, allowing more children to receive timely care with fewer delays caused by inpatient bed shortages – leading to shorter wait times and improved access to essential treatments for children and their families.

“At the same time, freeing up inpatient beds will ensure those requiring acute or planned overnight care have access to the space they need - enabling the hospital to use its capacity more effectively, improving care for all patients.

“I know that hospital visits can be stressful for children and their families. This new unit is designed with their wellbeing in mind, helping to ease that stress through a more supportive environment, and providing smarter, more efficient care – ensuring every child receives the right treatment, at the right time,” Mr Brown says.
