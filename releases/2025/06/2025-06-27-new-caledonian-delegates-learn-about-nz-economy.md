A New Caledonian delegation will tour New Zealand next week to learn about aspects of our economic development, Foreign Minister Winston Peters says.

 “As New Caledonia seeks to recover economically from a challenging period in its history, New Zealand is pleased to be sharing our own lessons and experiences. 

 “When visiting New Caledonia twice in the past year, we heard from businesses, including Kanak entrepreneurs, significant interest in New Zealand’s economic development – including the Māori economy.

 “We are therefore delighted to welcome this high-level delegation, which will be introduced to all aspects of our economic development – including the Māori economy and how Māori operate in key sectors like youth training, economic development, and technology.

 “This study tour is an important element of New Zealand’s commitment to New Caledonia’s development through ongoing and constructive exchanges.”

 The programme includes a meeting with Māori policymakers and engagement with a range of iwi on areas such as youth, tourism, services and private sector partnerships.

 The study tour follows Mr Peters’ visits over the last six months to Paris, Nice and Nouméa, where he has met France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, and Overseas Territories Minister Manuel Valls, as well as the new President of the Government of New Caledonia, Alcide Ponga. 

The 20-person study tour includes visits to Wellington, Hamilton, Tauranga, and Auckland.

“We have a shared interest in promoting economic development, good governance and regional security,” Mr Peters says. 

 The delegation arrives in New Zealand on Sunday 29 June, will meet Mr Peters on Friday 4 July, before returning to Nouméa the following day.

The study tour is being organised in conjunction with the French Embassy in Wellington and the Government of New Caledonia.
