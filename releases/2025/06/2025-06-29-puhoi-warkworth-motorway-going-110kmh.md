A new 110km/h speed limit on the Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway will come into effect first thing tomorrow morning, Transport Minister Chris Bishop announced today.

“Transport is a critical enabler for economic growth and productivity, and with over 20,000 vehicles travelling this motorway every day, the new higher speed will help ensure people and freight can get to where they need to go, quickly and safely,” Mr Bishop says.

“Late last year, the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) publicly consulted on increasing the speed limit from north of the Pūhoi interchange viaduct to south of the Warkworth roundabout to 110km/h. More than 7,900 submissions were received across Northland and Auckland. Responses were overwhelmingly positive, with 94% in support of the increasing the speed limit and 91% strongly in favour.

“The Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway has been designed and constructed with safety features that greatly reduce the risk of death and serious injury in a crash such as two lanes in each direction providing safe passing opportunities, flexible median barrier separation between opposing lanes, and a mostly straight, wide alignment. Since opening in 2023, no one has died in a crash.

“Kiwis have had their say and NZTA has completed all required technical assessments, with the motorway being assessed as safe to increase the speed limit to 110km/h. Now, we’re getting on and delivering it.

“Police will apply the same enforcement to 110km/h roads as any other part of the road network. Drivers can expect to see police patrols on New Zealand roads anywhere, at any time. Drivers should continue to drive to the conditions, free from impairment and distraction, and make sure everyone’s wearing their seatbelt.

“The Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway has vastly improved the safety, connectivity, and resilience of the network between Auckland and Northland, and has opened access to popular destinations between the two regions. As a critical route for road users, freight, and tourists, I look forward to the new 110km/h speed limit coming into effect from tomorrow.”

The new 110km/h speed limit on the Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway comes into effect on Tuesday 1 July 2025 and will apply from 2.5km north of the Johnstones Hill Tunnels, to south of Warkworth roundabout.

**Notes to editor:**

- The public consultation for increasing the speed limit to 110km/h on the Pūhoi to Warkworth motorway took place from 3 September to 1 October 2024.
- 7,911 submissions were received from across Northland and Auckland, including 158 submissions from businesses or organisations.
- The speed limit on SH1 through the Johnstones Hill Tunnels will remain 80km/h. While the SH1 Johnstones Hill Tunnels are built to high safety standards, the enclosed environment within a tunnel creates a different safety risk to that of the surrounding motorway. There are no current plans to review or change the speed limit for this section.
- There is a transition zone where the speed limit will be kept at 100km/h for a short length (2.5km) north of the Johnstones Hill Tunnel over two viaducts. This section is an area of weaving movements, where traffic is diverging and merging, exiting and egressing on short, narrow on and off ramps, with narrow lines of sight over the viaducts, and does not meet safety criteria for an increased speed.
