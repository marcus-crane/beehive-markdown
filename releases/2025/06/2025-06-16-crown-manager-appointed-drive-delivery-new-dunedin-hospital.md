Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced the appointment of a Crown manager to oversee the delivery of the New Dunedin Hospital Inpatient Building, reinforcing the Government’s commitment to ensuring the project is delivered successfully.

“In late January, I confirmed the Government’s commitment to building the New Dunedin Hospital on the former Cadbury site – providing certainty to the people of Dunedin and the wider Otago and Southland regions,” Mr Brown says.

“As part of that commitment, we are putting strong leadership in place to drive the next stage of this project. I’m pleased to announce the appointment of Evan Davies as Crown manager for the inpatient building project.”

Mr Davies will lead the delivery of the inpatient facility, including confirming the procurement approach and finalising the construction contract. He will work closely with Health New Zealand to ensure alignment with the broader New Dunedin Hospital programme. It will also enable Health New Zealand to focus on the many other infrastructure work programmes currently underway.

“Mr Davies brings over 30 years of senior leadership experience and a proven track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in the health sector.

“His appointment reflects the importance of this project to the Government. I’m confident he will bring the capability, oversight, and momentum needed to see it through.

“This Government has committed a record $1.88 billion to the New Dunedin Hospital, making it the largest health infrastructure investment in New Zealand’s history.

“That level of investment reflects our commitment to providing a modern, fit-for-purpose hospital that meets the needs of future generations.

“This step will help ensure the project remains on track, and that we deliver a world-class facility providing timely, high-quality care in Dunedin,” Mr Brown says.
