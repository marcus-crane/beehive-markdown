Today’s opening of a new 596-bed facility at Waikeria Prison will ensure Corrections can safely manage the rising prison population and provide effective services to help reduce reoffending, Corrections Minister Mark Mitchell says.

“Our Government has restored proper consequences for crime.  Because of that, there has been an increase in the prison population and fewer victims of crime.

“As the prison population continues to increase, this new facility will help ensure Corrections has the right level of capacity and resources to keep its staff, people in prison, and the public safe.

“The facility is modern and fit-for-purpose. It adds 500 high-security beds to New Zealand’s prison system as well as 96 dedicated mental health and addiction beds.

“There is also a new education and rehabilitation hub with ten classrooms to support offenders with opportunities that put them on a better path away from crime.”

The new facility, consisting of 28 buildings, has been built across 21 hectares of land at Waikeria Prison, which is located 14 kilometres south of Te Awamutu in Waikato. Surrounded by a secure 1.7 km long perimeter fence, the new facility sits adjacent to the prison’s existing low security facility.

Key features include:

- High-security accommodation for 500 men
- A dedicated mental health and addiction service within a new 96-bed facility
- An education and rehabilitation hub
- Large kitchen and laundry, a new waste and recycling centre, and more industry training spaces for prisoners
- Single point of entry with secure perimeter
- Advanced biometric security
- Two main visitation areas
- A modern medical centre

“Corrections have already recruited 300 additional frontline staff for when it is ready to take prisoners in the coming months, following final assurance checks,” Mr Mitchell says.

“Preparations are also underway for a further expansion of Waikeria Prison, which is due to be completed in 2029 and will add a further 810 beds to New Zealand’s prison system.

“Ongoing investment in our prisons will keep us ahead of the increasing prison population and enable Corrections to focus on safety and effective rehabilitation to reduce reoffending.”
