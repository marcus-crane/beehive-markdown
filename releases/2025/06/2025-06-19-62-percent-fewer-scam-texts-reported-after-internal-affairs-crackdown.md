Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says the Department of Internal Affairs \[the Department] has made significant progress in tackling scams in New Zealand, with a 62 per cent drop in reports of SMS scams in 2024 from 2023, following the Department’s investigations into scammers.

The Department’s 2024 Digital Messaging Transparency Report, published this week, details some of the actions the Department has taken to catch people perpetrating scams, including by conducting search warrants and seizing equipment.

“Scams cause serious financial and emotional harm, often preying on vulnerable people in our communities. I’m pleased the Department’s work is making a real impact in reducing scams and holding perpetrators accountable,” says Ms van Velden.

In 2024 the Department received over 103,000 reports of SMS scams, conducted six search warrants, and seized almost $400,000 worth of scam equipment as well as $162,000 in cash. One of the search warrants resulted in the arrest of a 19-year-old Auckland man and the seizure of a cell site simulator. A cell site simulator is a false cell tower which tricks nearby mobile devices into connecting to the fraudulent network so that scam text messages can be sent to the connected phones.

Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson, who is the lead anti-scams Minister, welcomes the report’s findings and highlights the Government’s increasing focus on keeping New Zealanders safer from scammers.

“Online financial scams cause significant harm to New Zealanders – reported losses have been nearly $200 million a year, but some estimate this to be as high as $2 billion. Often scams affect the more vulnerable people in our community and our loved ones. We are taking action to change this. I intend to make announcements in due course on further work we intend to do to reduce scams across New Zealand,” says Mr Simpson.

“The prevalence of scams also hurts the wider economy, as people become less comfortable with transacting online. Building back people’s trust by reducing scams is part of rebuilding the economy and reducing the cost of living,” says Ms van Velden.
