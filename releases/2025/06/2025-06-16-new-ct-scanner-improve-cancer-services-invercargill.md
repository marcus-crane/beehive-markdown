A new, state-of-the-art CT scanner is now operational at Southland Hospital, delivering a significant step forward for diagnostic services in the region, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This new CT scanner is a game-changer for Invercargill and surrounding areas. It will provide faster, more accurate diagnosis for a wide range of conditions, including cancer and heart disease – meaning patients can start treatment sooner and with greater confidence.

“The enhanced imaging technology offers clearer, more detailed information to support doctors in making timely, well-informed decisions. That means better care for patients, fewer delays, and improved health outcomes.”

The new scanner replaces equipment installed in 2012 and features advanced detector-based spectral technology, providing enhanced lesion detection and more detailed tumour assessments – particularly valuable in oncology care.

“This technology allows clinicians to detect abnormalities earlier and with greater precision, which is critical in cancer care. The sooner a diagnosis can be made, the sooner treatment can begin.

“Southland Hospital currently scans over 500 patients each month. This upgrade will increase the capacity for patients to receive advanced diagnostic services, reducing the anxiety that comes with waiting for answers and helping to ensure timely access to the right care.”

In a first for the region, the scanner will also provide cardiac imaging, enabling local assessment for signs of heart disease – a service not previously available at Southland Hospital.

“The addition of cardiac CT scanning means patients can get the care they need closer to home, without having to travel to other hospitals for these tests. The hospital’s diagnostic team will be undertaking specialised training so this new service can be up and running as soon as possible.

“Access to modern diagnostic tools like this CT scanner is essential to improving outcomes for patients. By detecting disease earlier and with greater precision, we can help ensure people receive the right treatment at the right time,” Mr Brown says.
