The Government will make more beds and timely services available to people needing mental health and addiction support in the Midland Region, Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey says.

Budget 2025 has reprioritised almost $51 million over four years to help those with acute mental health and addiction needs to access appropriate specialist forensic services in a timely manner. The investment will also support additional step-down beds.

“Providing better mental health and addiction services to people in prison, in forensic beds or on remand can help with rehabilitation and reintegration into the community,” Mr Doocey says.

“We know that people in the Corrections system have higher mental health and addiction needs than the general population. Currently, there are not enough beds to adequately care for those who need them.

“This investment will improve forensic and prison mental health services throughout the Midland Region and enable greater participation in rehabilitation programmes. It will help in particular at the country’s biggest prison, Waikeria, and has the potential to relieve pressure across the wider forensic mental health system.”

The funding will support 10 new acute inpatient beds and 8 new step-down beds delivered by Non-Government Organisations in the Midland Region. These new beds will be supported by new community wraparound support teams and funding to attract and retain specialist staff.

“Ensuring timely access to care has been one of my top priorities. The shortage of forensic beds has caused delays in access to effective care, creating issues throughout the forensic rehabilitation system,” Mr Doocey says.

“This funding will improve the flow of patients from forensic beds to stepdown beds and should have a positive knock-on effect for other services around the country.”
