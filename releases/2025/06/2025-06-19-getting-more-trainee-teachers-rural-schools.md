The Government’s ensuring some of New Zealand’s most isolated schools get the pipeline of teachers they need to teach the basics brilliantly.

“For most new teachers, school placements play a significant role in deciding where they choose to teach once they qualify as a teacher. We know rural and isolated schools struggle to fill these rolls. This Government is helping address that so more children benefit from excellent teachers in the classroom,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

$494,000 will fund “Go Rural: Isolated Placements Fund” - an initiative that contributes to the costs student teachers incur. Up to 123 student teachers in their final year of study will be eligible for a payment of $4,000 to take up a professional experience placement in a rural or isolated school.

“We know students’ factor in additional accommodation, childcare and travel costs for when they choose where they undertake their placement. This investment will make it easier for them to take up placements in some of our most unique communities.

Applications for the fund will be available in early 2026.

“This is just one of several initiatives we have put in place to ensure more Kiwi kids benefit from quality teaching and leadership in the classroom. Through Budget 2025 we are expanding the School Onsite Training Programme (SOTP) by 530 places, supporting up to 800 teachers to access an Aspiring Principal Programme and funding approximately 115,000 teacher registrations and practicing certificates.

“We are committed to supporting our incredible teachers. By growing the skills and knowledge in our workforce, our tamariki have the very best chance to thrive at school and beyond,” Ms Stanford says.
