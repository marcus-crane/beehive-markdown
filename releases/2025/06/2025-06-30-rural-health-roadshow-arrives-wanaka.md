Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health and Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey and Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson will be coming to Wānaka today as part of the rural health roadshow happening across the country.

“The rural health roadshow is an opportunity for me to hear direct feedback from the public and those who are working in rural health. The roadshow is also a great opportunity to hear how well the Rural Health Strategy is being implemented,” Mr Doocey says.

“The roadshow kicked off in Levin followed by Wairoa. It is excellent to now be in Wānaka for what is shaping up to be the biggest turnout event yet. I look forward to talking with the local community and our hardworking rural health staff today."

“I’m looking forward to meeting with people in Wānaka and hearing firsthand about their experiences with healthcare in their community.  It’s important we understand both the challenges and the opportunities so we can work together to improve access and outcomes in the rural setting,” Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson says.

“The roadshow builds on initiatives already in train to improve rural health care services,” Mr Doocey says.

“Budget 2025 delivered for Kiwis living in rural and remote communities. The Government is investing $164 million over four years to strengthen urgent and after hours care nationwide, meaning 98 per cent of Kiwis will be able to access these services within one hour’s drive of their home.

“We are also improving access to primary care including access to 24/7 digital care, training more new doctors and investing to increase the number of nurses in primary care.

“To improve access to mental health support I was pleased that the Government recently announced $3 million over four years, that will help improve rural communities’ access to mental health support. The Government is also doubling its investment in the Rural Wellbeing Fund to $4 million over the next four years.”

“It is important that the Government continues the conversation with rural communities on how rural health care services can be improved, which is exactly the aim today in Wānaka.

“Whilst I was at Fieldays last month I heard loud and clear that access to healthcare is one of the biggest concerns for people living in rural and remote communities. This Government is committed to improving and increasing their access to support.”
