Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard has appointed a new management agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the National American Foulbrood Pest Management Plan (AFB NPMP).

The New Zealand Bee Health and Biosecurity Trust (NZBB) will take over management of the NPMP from 1 July 2025.

“The NZBB will bring a lot of experience. It is a new registered Charitable Trust of the current AFB Management agency board. With the resignation of Apiculture NZ, which has managed the NPMP since 2016, a new management agency designated under the Biosecurity Act was needed if the Plan was to continue.

“The former AFB Management Agency board took steps to organise themselves in such a way that they were eligible for appointment under the Act. This appointment ensures a smooth transition, without the need to stand up a completely new organisation.”

Mr Hoggard says there will be no change for beekeepers.

“There will be a different name on the levies – otherwise there are no changes. All the obligations and rules in the AFB NPMP remain the same.

“I have confidence that the NZBB will manage the plan in a way that represents the interests of all beekeepers. I expect that the expansion of their role beyond just AFB management will be an opportunity for beekeepers to come together for the long-term success of the industry.

“I support NZBB establishing Advisory Groups to provide an opportunity for beekeepers and the wider industry to provide input into decision making.

“American foulbrood is a devastating bee disease, and while elimination of AFB may seem an impossible task, it is a disease that New Zealand beekeepers have worked hard to not only control, but to achieve some real reduction in cases.

“I am confident the new management agency, along with beekeepers’ continued vigilance and compliance with the NPMP, that the industry will continue to see a reduction in this disease, for the benefit of all.”
