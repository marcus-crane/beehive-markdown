Victims of sexual violence will soon have the power to determine name suppression orders, with legislation passing third reading in Parliament today, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“These changes will help ensure victims of sexual violence and their needs are returned to the heart of the justice system. We’ve been clear from day one that victims are our priority as we work to restore law and order.

“This Bill will ensure the courts cannot issue a permanent name suppression order for an adult convicted of a sexual offence, unless the victim agrees to it.

“Currently victims’ views only have to be taken into account by the courts. Long battles over name suppression retraumatises victims, as does the inability to discuss what happened to them and to warn others. 

“I recognise that some victims will not want to make this decision, some will not be able to, and others may not be available. In these cases, the court will decide about name suppression for the convicted offender.

“We’re also ensuring victims of all sexual crimes, including intimate visual recording offences, are automatically given name suppression. There is a legislative gap, which means some victims of sexual offences receive automatic name suppression and others do not.

“Finally, this Bill amends the law so that children under the age of 12 will not be able to be questioned about whether they consented to sex. This makes it crystal clear that children cannot consent to abuse.

“These changes will help restore real consequences for crime, and ensure there are 20,000 fewer victims of violent crime by 2029.”
