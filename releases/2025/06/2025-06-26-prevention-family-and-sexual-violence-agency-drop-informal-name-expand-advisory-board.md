Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence Karen Chhour is today announcing the agency will no longer use the informal name of Te Puna Aonui and will adopt its legal name: the Executive Board for the Elimination of Family Violence and Sexual Violence.

“This decision reflects the reality that all people are potentially victims of Family Violence and Sexual Violence, as well as the wishes of disgruntled former advisory board members who have asked for the gifted Te Reo name to be returned,” says Mrs Chhour.

“They have raised their concerns with me around my decision to not extend their tenure as the Ministerial Advisory Board, as well as concerns around my decision to include other communities in a new, multi-cultural advisory board which will replace the current Māori-only one.

“I need an advisory board that can advise on all issues victim-survivors face, and one that reflects the diversity of our nation, not just the seventeen per cent of New Zealanders who identify as Māori.

“Yes, I am Māori, and proud of this. I am also a mother, a wife, and a survivor of both family and sexual violence. The idea that one part of my being is somehow more important than any other is something I don’t accept, and I don’t believe that the majority of New Zealanders would accept this either.

“It is also Government policy that Government departments, with the exception of those focused on Māori, will have their main names in English.

“By continuing with a Te Reo name I believe we risk potentially making non-Māori victim-survivors feel like their lived experiences do not matter. I can assure them that they do and will continue to.

“This is the right thing to do, it reflects our national values of equality.

“The important work of the agency will be strengthened by the incorporating Pasifika, Asian communities, and other groups who were deliberately excluded by the scope of the previous Ministerial Advisory Board for this portfolio.

“While Te Puna Aonui is an informal name, not a legal one, it will take time to update the agency’s branding and letterhead.

“This is a positive step forward for the Executive Board for the Elimination of Family Violence and Sexual Violence and for our national response to these hugely important issues.”
