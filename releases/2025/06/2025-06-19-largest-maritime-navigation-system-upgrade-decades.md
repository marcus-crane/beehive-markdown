The Government is making New Zealand more attractive to international shipping lines with the first major investment in navigation services in more than 30 years.

Land Information Minister Chris Penk says the $28.6 million Budget 2025 funding secures the future of shipping, tourism and the maritime economy – highlighting the Government's commitment to back economic growth.

"The investment enables safer and faster access to New Zealand's ports, keeping trade flowing smoothly and reliably and provides confidence in shipping. This is key as more than 99 percent of our imports and exports move by sea.

"Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and Maritime New Zealand are working together to create high-tech digital navigation tools based on the global S-100 standard. These tools will make navigation more precise, helping ships save fuel and cut costs while operating in our waters.

“The initiative will transform how mariners access and use data such as electronic charts, water levels, ocean surface currents and navigational warnings.”

Associate Transport Minister James Meager says the investment benefits both economic growth and maritime safety.

“Modern digital maritime data and services will enable freight-efficient, environmentally responsible shipping routes that boost trade and investment across the Pacific.

“The investment in high-tech infrastructure ensures our maritime and tourism sectors are ready to thrive, while enhancing safety and efficiency.

“Importantly, it positions New Zealand at the forefront of the shift to digital navigation technology, and signals to the world that we’re serious about supporting innovation, sustainabilitty and welfare at sea.

“Beyond New Zealand’s coastline, this initiative supports safer, more efficient shipping across our wider maritime region – including Antarctica and South-West Pacific nations such as the Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Niue, and Tokelau.

“As we celebrate Matariki and reflect on New Zealand’s rich cultural history of navigating by the stars, now is the perfect time to look ahead toward building a resilient maritime economy for future generations.”
