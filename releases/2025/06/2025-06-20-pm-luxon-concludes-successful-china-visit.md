Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has wrapped up his successful China visit by meeting with his Chinese counterpart Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

“My first official visit to China allowed me to reconnect with Premier Li on the full scope of our bilateral relationship,” Mr Luxon says.

Following their meeting, Mr Luxon and Premier Li issued a Joint Statement of Outcomes and witnessed the signing of 11 new government-to-government arrangements covering cooperation on climate change, cultural linkages, tourism and a range of practical initiatives to facilitate trade flows. 

“These arrangements will help New Zealand exporters by opening up new trade and making existing trade faster, predictable and cheaper,” Mr Luxon says.  

Mr Luxon reiterated the importance of leader-level dialogue to support the comprehensive bilateral relationship, including openly and consistently discussing areas of difference, such as human rights.  

“I raised with Premier Li a number of issues that are important to New Zealand.  In particular, the need for engagement in the Pacific to take place in a manner which advances Pacific priorities,” Mr Luxon says.  

“In an increasingly turbulent global environment, we also discussed a range of security, climate, and trade challenges.

“The ongoing security and prosperity of the Indo Pacific region is vital to New Zealand interests, and I raised concerns with rising tensions in the Indo Pacific, including in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.” 

Mr Luxon also had constructive discussions with President Xi Jinping and National People’s Congress Chairman Zhao Leji in Beijing and Party Secretary Chen Jining in Shanghai.

“Chairman Zhao and I discussed the long history of Parliamentary exchanges between New Zealand and China, and the contribution this makes to the bilateral relationship,” Mr Luxon says.  

During his three-day visit, Mr Luxon worked with a high calibre business delegation to promote New Zealand’s premium food and beverage, and health and wellbeing products. 

“The visit has reinforced for me that New Zealand remains well-placed to meet the evolving needs of Chinese consumers, particularly in premium and niche categories that support higher-quality lifestyles,” Mr Luxon says.

In Beijing, Mr Luxon also promoted New Zealand as a world class tourism and education destination and celebrated new and long-standing air connections that underpin these. 

“Inbound tourists and students bring people together, build understanding, and support jobs across New Zealand,” Mr Luxon says. 

“We’re committed to welcoming more Chinese visitors and students to New Zealand and strengthening the ties between our two countries.”

Beijing marked the final stage of the Prime Minister’s visit to China. He now departs for Europe for a five-day programme.
