The Government is introducing specific coward punch offences to ensure perpetrators receive tougher sentences, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“A ‘coward punch’ gets its name for obvious reasons. These attacks affect everyday Kiwis and are often committed by cowardly attackers, who strike when the victim is distracted.

“We know how dangerous they are. People can be killed or suffer lifelong brain injuries, yet perpetrators often receive lenient and insufficient sentences.

“This fulfils a commitment in the National/New Zealand First coalition agreement, to introduce legislation to create an offence for anyone who injures or kills someone with a coward punch.

“Specific offences will ensure the consequence reflects the gravity of the crime.

“It builds on our plan to restore law and order, which we know is working, and will help reduce the number of victims of violent crime.”

The charges and penalties are:

- An assault offence for one punch attacks which cause grievous bodily harm with associated maximum penalties of:
  
  - Eight years imprisonment when the offender intended to cause injury or acted with reckless disregard for safety,
  - Fifteen years imprisonment when the offender intended to cause grievous bodily harm.
- A culpable homicide offence for a one punch attack which results in death with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Both new offences will be added to the Three Strikes Regime.
