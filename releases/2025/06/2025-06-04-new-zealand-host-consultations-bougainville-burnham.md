New Zealand will host post-referendum talks between the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Bougainville Government next week, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced.

The ‘Burnham Consultations’ will be held at Burnham Military Camp at the request of Sir Jerry Mateparae, as independent moderator. The discussions will be led by Sir Jerry and his United Nations team.

“New Zealand looks forward to welcoming parties to the Bougainville Peace Agreement back to Burnham — 28 years after we last hosted peace talks there,” Mr Peters says.

“Our involvement is to provide the venue and environment necessary for substantive discussions on Bougainville’s political future.

“Reaching a mutually agreed outcome is important for Papua New Guinea, Bougainville, and the wider region, as is upholding the integrity of the Bougainville Peace Agreement, to which New Zealand is a witnessing signatory.”

Representatives will travel from Port Moresby to Christchurch on Friday to attend the talks.
