The Government is attracting new migrants to bring their capital, experience and skills to New Zealand with a flood of formal interest in the new 'golden’ visa.

Since only April – less than three months – Immigration New Zealand (INZ) has received 189 applications for the Active Investor Plus visa, significantly more than the 116 applications received over more than two-and-a-half years under previous settings, Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis says.

“New applications under the scheme represent a potential $845 million of new investment in New Zealand business.”

"Attracting investment to New Zealand is crucial to the country's economic growth. It means Kiwi businesses can expand, hire and grow – and that means more opportunities for New Zealanders.

“Investor migrants are clearly attracted to New Zealand’s growing reputation as a safe, pro-business, high-potential economy. In a world where countries compete for dollars and talent, it’s great to see New Zealand’s growth prospects being recognised.”

“New investors don’t just bring their dollars to our shores, they also bring skills, knowledge and experience that will drive future economic development. It’s a win-win.”

Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says the interest shows investors hear the call loud and clear: New Zealand is open for business.

“We welcome your capital, your knowledge, and your contribution to New Zealand’s economic growth,” Ms Stanford says.

“We’re seeing strong momentum from global investors, particularly across Asia and North America. This reflects our growing reputation as a stable, forward-looking destination for investment and innovation.

“These are smart, flexible and nuanced immigration solutions to help stimulate economic growth.”

On April 1 the Government changed the Active Investor Plus visa to a simple two-pronged system: the Growth category and the Balanced category.

Other changes included expanding the scope of acceptable investments and removing potential barriers to investment, such as the English language requirement.

As at 23 June, 100 applications had been approved in principle, and of those, seven had transferred and invested their funds in New Zealand and had been granted a resident visa. Five of those were invested in the Growth category and two under the Balanced category, totalling a total minimum investment of $45 million.
