Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey today announced that the Government has released the refreshed Strategy to Prevent and Minimise Gambling Harm.

“The updated strategy includes a targeted investment of over $81 million to improve access to support, strengthen prevention and early intervention and reduce the impact of gambling-related harm across New Zealand,” Mr Doocey says.

“We know that simply announcing strategies isn’t enough to make a material difference. We want New Zealanders to see real change and make progress, that is why as part of this strategy we’ve built in an independent review in 2025/26 to track what’s working, and what’s not.

“The strategy focuses on delivering timely, effective support for individuals, families and communities affected by gambling harm. Key areas of investment include increasing access to treatment and support, improving prevention and early intervention initiatives, and improving the effectiveness of support for those experiencing gambling harm.

“We know one of the biggest barriers to people accessing support is workforce, that is why the plan includes ways we will grow the gambling harm workforce. We will be creating up to 18 additional clinical internship places.

“It is expected these interns will be supported to develop gambling harm expertise by working closely with a supervisor in a clinical setting. This approach is necessary to bridge the gap between education and work and will give interns the practical experience needed to help people affected by gambling harm.

“Not only will this ensure more people can access help, but this will also support people who could otherwise struggle to meet the requirements to become registered clinicians.

“One in five New Zealanders will be affected by gambling harm in their lifetime—either directly or through someone they know. This can have devastating effects not only on individuals, but also on their families and wider communities.”

Services will be funded through the new Problem Gambling Levy Regulations, paid by non-casino gaming machine operators, casinos, TAB NZ, and Lotto NZ. Work is also underway on how online casino operators will contribute under upcoming regulations.

The strategy was developed through a two-stage consultation process and strongly reflects the voices of people with lived experience.

“I want to thank those who shared their experiences with us. You’ve helped ensure this strategy is reflective of real-life experiences and have helped to ground the strategy with a strong understanding of what support works best for you and our communities,” Mr Doocey says.
