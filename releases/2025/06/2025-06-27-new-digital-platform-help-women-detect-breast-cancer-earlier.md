Around 135,000 women across New Zealand who are eligible but not currently enrolled for breast cancer screening will benefit from the successful national rollout of a new digital platform, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The launch of Te Puna across the country is a major step forward for delivering faster and smarter screening services,” Mr Brown says.

“Te Puna replaces an outdated legacy system with a modern, streamlined platform that makes it easier for women to enrol, book, and manage their breast screening appointments – helping more women get screened earlier.”

The new system, which began rolling out in February, is now live nationwide. It introduces a more proactive approach to screening, with women now automatically identified when they become eligible and invited to book a mammogram – shifting from an opt-in to an opt-out model.

“This change will significantly boost participation and help close the gap for the 135,000 eligible women who aren’t currently getting screened.

“Early detection through regular mammograms is critical. Women diagnosed through screening are about 34 per cent less likely to die from breast cancer. This new system will make it easier for more women to get the checks they need, when they need them.”

Te Puna significantly enhances data tracking, accuracy, and reporting – helping providers identify and reach women who have never screened or don’t screen regularly. It also improves convenience for patients, allowing women to book or change appointments using a secure personalised link or QR code sent via text, email, or letter.

“This Government is focused on lifting screening rates to save more lives and improve treatment outcomes. Te Puna will play a vital role in achieving that.

“We’re also delivering on our commitment to extend breast screening to women aged 70 to 74, with rollout of the expansion beginning later this year.

“Every woman deserves the chance for early detection and timely treatment. Te Puna is about putting the right tools in place to deliver better care, faster – and ultimately, to save lives,” Mr Brown says.
