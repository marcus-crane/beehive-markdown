Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has met with the Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, to mark 60 years of diplomatic representation between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

“The Netherlands is one of New Zealand’s oldest and closest friends. Our people share strong bonds, enriched by the 150,000 New Zealanders who have Dutch heritage,” Mr Luxon says.

“In our discussions, Prime Minister Schoof and I reaffirmed our commitment to global peace and security, pledged to increase bilateral trade and investment, and promote further innovation between our researchers.”

The Netherlands is one of New Zealand’s top export destinations within the EU.

“The Netherlands is crucial to New Zealand’s economic growth. Our exports have grown by 24 percent since last year,” Mr Luxon says.

“It is New Zealand’s greatest source of foreign direct investment from the EU, and it is also a base for many Kiwi businesses in Europe.”

Mr Luxon will now attend the NATO Summit in the Hague. 

A joint statement from Mr Luxon and Mr Schoof is attached.
