Health Minister Simeon Brown and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey have today marked the beginning of construction on the new Sir Mark Dunajtschik Mental Health Centre in Lower Hutt. 

Joined by Hutt South MP Chris Bishop, the Ministers took part in a sod-turning ceremony to celebrate the start of a project that will transform mental health services across the Wellington region. 

“Today, I’m proud to announce the Government is investing $38 million in the construction of this world-class facility – alongside an extraordinary $50 million donation from Sir Mark Dunajtschik, who also generously donated $50 million towards the new Wellington Children’s Hospital in 2017,” Mr Brown says.

“This marks an important milestone for Lower Hutt and the wider region. The new centre will provide 34 adult acute inpatient beds – ten more than the existing facility – and will be purpose-built to support modern models of care, helping to deliver better outcomes for patients and their families. 

“It will also enhance the region’s mental health infrastructure, offering safer, more therapeutic spaces for those in urgent need.” 

Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey said the purpose-built centre would help ensure New Zealanders in distress receive timely, appropriate care. 

"People experiencing severe distress deserve care in the right environment, at the right time – it’s not only better for them, but it also helps take pressure off our busy emergency departments. 

“That’s why mental health care must be underpinned by high-quality infrastructure that enables clinicians and support staff to deliver the safe, effective, compassionate care Kiwis deserve. 

“Sir Mark’s generosity is a powerful act of leadership. It reflects deep compassion, civic spirit, and an enduring commitment to the wellbeing of our communities. 

“His $50 million contribution will leave a legacy of hope and care that will benefit generations to come. 

“This project is about more than bricks and mortar. It’s about improving lives and delivering the mental health outcomes New Zealanders deserve.”
