Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey has welcomed prescribing changes that will enable GPs and nurse practitioners to diagnose and treat adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

“I applaud Pharmac and Medsafe’s decision to widen prescribing rules for ADHD medicines from next February, this decision will give New Zealanders faster access to assessments and treatment,” Mr Doocey says.

“This is a common-sense change that will make a meaningful difference in many lives of New Zealanders. I have heard stories of many people with ADHD who have been unable to get a diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner because of long wait items and costs associated with seeing a specialist.”

Currently, GPs and nurse practitioners can only prescribe ADHD medicines to patients with a written recommendation from a paediatrician or psychiatrist, or after someone has already been diagnosed and had their first prescription.

“This is a great step forward for timely access to support and for system efficiency. A number of our GPs and nurse practitioners are already working closely with psychiatrists to treat ADHD, so they already have the skills to manage this work,” Mr Doocey says.

“It is still crucial that we balance risks. The Ministry of Health is working with sector representatives to develop a clinical principles framework for the assessment and treatment of ADHD. This will ensure there is quality and consistency for supporting patients with ADHD in New Zealand.

“I want to acknowledge the many advocates with lived experience and others who have spent years advocating for this change. This decision is based on the recommendations received from both healthcare practitioners and patients.

“We have heard your feedback loud and clear, and we know the positive impact this decision will have on many people’s ability to access what is often life-changing medicines.”

This change is only one in a suite of measures to increase access to ADHD medicines. Last year, Pharmac also removed the requirement for funded access to stimulant medicines to be renewed every two years and is funding a new ADHD medicine, lisdexamfetamine.

**Note to editors:**

- Health agencies will be working closely with health sector groups over the next few months to support these changes. Not all GPs and nurse practitioners will be equipped to carry out this work immediately after the regulatory changes come into effect.
- For younger people under 18, this change will allow nurse practitioners working within a multidisciplinary setting as part of paediatric or child and adolescent mental health services to diagnose and start treatment for ADHD.
