---

The Government has outlined its ongoing response to the Royal Commission into Historical Abuse in State Care and in the Care of Faith-based Institutions.

“We are committed to continuing to respond to the Royal Commission of Inquiry with respect and dignity. To maintain transparency with our response, the Government’s released its Response Plan which lays out what work has already been completed and what work is still underway,” Lead Coordination Minister Erica Stanford says.

The Royal Commission made 95 recommendations in its 2021 redress report, and 138 in its final report in 2024*.* Of these 233 recommendations overall, 207 are addressed to the Crown, of these, 85 have been either accepted, partially accepted or we have accepted the intent.

Since the release of the Royal Commission’s Final report in July 2024:

- The Government acknowledged that torture occurred at Lake Alice Psychiatric Hospital Child and Adolescent Unit (Lake Alice) and introduced two pathways for redress which are now underway;
- An end-of-life payment of $20,000 was made available for Lake Alice survivors along with work to address inequities in the reimbursement of legal fees;
- Public Apologies were made by the Prime Minister and Government agency Chief Executives on 12 November 2024;
- A $32 million investment as part of the apology to increase capacity in current redress and claims systems from approximately 1350 to 1550 claims per year
- Progression of the Responding to Abuse in Care Legislation Amendment Bill which supports the Crown response to a range of recommendations
- a $2 million dual purpose survivor-focused fund for local authorities, non-governmental organisations and community groups;
- Commitment to a national day of reflection on the one-year anniversary of the public apology, 12 November 2025;
- Budget 2025 investment of $533 million over four years, for redress improvements including increasing average payments and increasing the number of claims paid each year;
- Budget 2025 investment of $188 million over four years to improve the safety of children, young people and vulnerable people.

“We know the Crown’s response will be ongoing given the number and complexity of recommendations. The Royal Commission estimated it could take up to 15 years.

“While we can never fully make redress for or right the harm survivors experienced, the Government remains committed to engaging with the Royal Commission’s report and recommendations in good faith and with careful consideration,” Ms Stanford says.
