Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced new sanctions on crucial enablers of Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.

This latest round of sanctions targets actors involved in Russia's military-industrial complex, supporters from North Korea, Iran, and Belarus, as well as vessels that are part of Russia's ‘shadow fleet’.

“New Zealand must continue to hold Russia and its enablers accountable. Military support from actors in North Korea, Iran, and Belarus has helped Russia sustain its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,” Mr Peters said.

These new sanctions target a further 17 individuals and entities who have been assisting Russia’s war efforts.

In addition, 27 ‘shadow fleet’ vessels have also been designated. Russia’s ‘shadow fleet’ enablers are involved in illegal activities to avoid sanctions, including through the transport of Russian oil at above the G7 Plus oil price cap, which New Zealand adopted last year.

“The designation of Russia’s ‘shadow fleet’ reflects a joint effort with likeminded international partners to prevent sanctions evasion and to maintain the pressure on Russia in support of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine,” Mr Peters says.

Since the Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals, entities, and shipping vessels, along with a range of trade measures.
