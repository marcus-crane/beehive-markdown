Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey today officially opened Te Puna Wai Kātea, a new mental health facility set to improve mental health and addiction outcomes for people in the Taranaki region.

“This new facility is designed to support people with mental health and addiction needs by helping them transition successfully back into the community,” Mr Doocey says.

“The focus is on ensuring people receive not just clinical care, but also the wraparound rehabilitation support they need to live well in the community and achieve long-term improvements in their mental health and addiction outcomes.”

Located on the Taranaki Base Hospital campus, Te Puna Wai Kātea is part of Health New Zealand’s Mental Health Infrastructure Programme and was delivered at a cost of around six million.

The facility includes four short- to medium-term stay rooms, an activities room, family space, kitchen, dining, and living areas. It will open to patients from 1 July.

“The team here will work closely with clinical services, whānau, and government agencies like MSD, Kāinga Ora, and Pathways to develop the most suitable tailored transition plans for each individual,” Mr Doocey says.

“This Government is committed to delivering better mental health outcomes for New Zealanders through targeted investments, modern facilities and a clear focus on recovery and community reintegration.”
