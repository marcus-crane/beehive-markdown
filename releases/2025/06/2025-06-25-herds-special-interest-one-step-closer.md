Legislation to clarify how Herds of Special Interest (HOSI) operate in National Parks has passed its first reading in Parliament today, Hunting and Fishing Minister James Meager says.

“The Game Animal Council (Herds of Special Interest) Amendment Bill will ensure the legislation for HOSI is clear and unambiguous. It will support the designation of a wapiti deer HOSI in Fiordland National Park and will allow hunter-led conservation groups to manage deer numbers in our national parks, creating opportunities for local hunters and tourism and driving more economic growth in the region,” Mr Meager says.

“HOSI are another tool to effectively and sustainably manage deer, tahr, and other valued introduced species on our conservation estate. By utilising hunter-led conservation groups we can manage deer numbers down to healthy, sustainable levels, whilst better protecting our biodiversity and controlling dangerous predators which kill our native birds.

“The National Parks Act’s requirement to ‘exterminate’ introduced animals as far as possible is at odds with the purpose of designating a HOSI, which is to manage game animals for hunting purposes while preserving conservation outcomes.

“The Game Animal Council Act always intended for HOSI to be allowed in national parks. By introducing this bill, we aim to provide clarity and certainty for all involved. The legislation will retain the requirements for HOSI to be consistent with New Zealand’s wider conservation framework, including the preservation of indigenous habitats and natural features.

“The bill has been referred to the Environment Select Committee for consideration, and the public will have the opportunity to submit. I look forward to hearing from everyone who is keen to better manage the impact of valued introduced species on our conservation estate.”
