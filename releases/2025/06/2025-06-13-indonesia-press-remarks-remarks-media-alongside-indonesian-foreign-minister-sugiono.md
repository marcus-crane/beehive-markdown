Good Morning. It is a pleasure to be in Jakarta again today.

Indonesia is an absolute priority for the New Zealand government, which is why we have now visited here four times since re-taking office as New Zealand Foreign Minister in late 2023.

Indonesia is one of New Zealand’s oldest friends in Southeast Asia and our relationship is warm, deep, and broad-based. There is much that we admire about your country. We are ambitious for us to do much more together. 

Thank you to Minister Sugiono and his officials for hosting us today. We are always honoured by the extremely warm welcome here in Jakarta, and were proud to be here for President Prabowo’s inauguration last year. 

New Zealand is a partner to Indonesia for the long-term and we have strong ambitions to strengthen our relationship as we head towards 70 years of diplomatic relations in 2028.

We are pleased, Minister Sugiono, that during this visit we have been able to make tangible, concrete progress on issues of importance to our peoples. 

On the economic front, we welcome the conclusion of a Cooperation Arrangement on Halal Products. This will facilitate the convenience, security and safety of halal food traded between our countries. 

New Zealand leads the world in agriculture and dairy productivity, and our high quality, safe and halal food products are a key export to Indonesia. 

We were pleased to discuss how New Zealand dairy exports can support President Prabowo’s flagship healthy nutrition programme – and to reiterate New Zealand’s commitment to working closely with Indonesia on agricultural cooperation, as Indonesia’s own dairy sector grows. 

On education, our governments are signing today an amended Cooperation Arrangement to enhance student and research exchange between New Zealand and Indonesia.

New Zealand is also delighted to announce today a significant increase ­– from 45 to 70 – in the annual number of scholarships offered to Indonesians to do tertiary study in New Zealand. 

We look forward to welcoming an even greater number of Indonesian students to New Zealand to experience our world class education system and learn more about our respective cultures and countries. 

On energy, we are proud of our long-standing partnership in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector. Over the next 5 years, New Zealand will invest a further $15 million to support the development of renewable energy in Indonesia. 

We were pleased to reaffirm with Minister Sugiono our goal to increase two-way trade to NZ$6 billion by 2029 – noting that two-way trade with Indonesia increased by more than 43% in the past 5 years. 

Our trade is mutually beneficial. To achieve our ambitious trade target, we need to keep working together to unlock new trade opportunities. 

Indonesia is also a key partner for New Zealand in navigating increasing geostrategic complexities in the region. We discussed our collaboration on defence and regional security issues, including tackling transnational organised crime, the flow of drugs, and human trafficking.  New Zealand also announced a new contribution to the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, which reflects New Zealand’s long-standing partnership with this world class facility. 

We are also pleased to announce the visit by HMNZS Te Kaha this month to Jakarta.

New Zealand will also participate in Exercise Super Garuda Shield, a major United States-Indonesia exercise aimed at reinforcing security ties across the Indo-Pacific.

So, this has been a very productive visit. New Zealand and Indonesia are making concrete progress together, in a wide range of areas. This is befitting the high ambition that our two countries have for the relationship. 

Minister Sugiono, your hospitality has been a reflection of the warmth and respect that underpin our bilateral relationship. We eagerly await the opportunity to host you in   
New Zealand at your earliest convenience.

Thank you very much.
