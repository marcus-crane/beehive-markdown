Pacific Peoples and Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti departs this week for visits to Spain and the United Kingdom.

In Spain, Dr Reti will represent New Zealand at the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development. 

“The Conference is an opportunity to reaffirm New Zealand’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals at a time where the Goals, and the international development cooperation system, are facing major challenges,” Dr Reti says. 

“An important role as Minister for Pacific Peoples will be working with Pacific partners and other Small Island Developing States to prioritise their interests at the Conference.

“While in Seville I will meet with counterparts from across the world to discuss how shifts in donor funding, and the deteriorating geostrategic environment, are affecting our efforts to realise the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.”

Dr Reti will then travel to London, United Kingdom to deepen science, innovation and technology ties.

“Harnessing science, innovation and technology is a core pillar of the Government’s Going for Growth agenda, and the UK is a key partner for New Zealand,” Dr Reti says.

UK and New Zealand researchers have strong collaborative relationships across a broad range of important areas such as medical and health science, physics, biological science, and engineering. 

“While in London I will meet with counterparts to explore new areas of cooperation and ideas to reform and modernise New Zealand systems,” Dr Reti says. 

Dr Reti will also take the opportunity to discuss approaches to census delivery with the UK. 

New Zealand and the UK are both looking towards administrative data to support future census delivery and provide more relevant, useful, and timely information to support decision making. 

Dr Reti departs New Zealand on Friday 27 June and returns on Sunday 6 July 2025.
