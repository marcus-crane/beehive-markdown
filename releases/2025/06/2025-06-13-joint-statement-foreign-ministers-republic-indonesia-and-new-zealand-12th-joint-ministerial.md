The Ministers celebrated the cooperation between Indonesia and New Zealand under the Comprehensive Partnership agreed by Leaders in 2018, and the achievements under the 2025-2029 Plan of Action.

The Ministers committed to intensify cooperation across the seven pillars of the Comprehensive Partnership to strengthen bilateral ties and achieve the ambitious goals set out in the 2025-2029 Plan of Action.

Both Ministers reconfirmed the importance of a rules-based, free and open trade environment, with the World Trade Organisation at its core, as critical for the regional and global economy. The Ministers welcomed the implementation of the upgraded ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), which entered into force in April 2025, and ongoing cooperation under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The Ministers acknowledged the process of Indonesia’s accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) as an important step to foster economic integration, accelerate economic reform, and support mutual prosperity.
