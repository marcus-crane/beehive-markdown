New Zealand’s horticulturalists are breaking new ground with exports tipped to surpass $8 billion for the first time, Associate Agriculture Minister Nicola Grigg says.

“New Zealand’s horticulture sector is poised for impressive growth, with export revenue forecast to hit a record $8.5 billion by 30 June 2025,” Ms Grigg says.

“That’s phenomenal growth of 19 per cent – the fastest of any agricultural sector - reflecting the dedication and resilience of our growers and exporters. 

“Looking ahead, the sector’s continued hard work is expected to drive that even higher, with export revenue forecast to climb to $9.8 billion by 2029. 

“These numbers reflect the vital role horticulture plays in New Zealand’s economy and global trade.

“Kiwifruit and apple exports are the key drivers behind these figures. Bumper kiwifruit crops are driving a forecast 36 per cent increase in export revenue to $3.9 billion - a remarkable achievement,” Ms Grigg says.

“Increased export volumes and average export prices are behind a forecast 18 per cent jump in apple and pear exports to $1.1 billion this year, surpassing $1 billion for the first time, and avocados are expected to rebound by an impressive 192 per cent to reach $108 million.

“These strong results are thanks to the dedication and hard work of our fruit and vege growers - and the Government is fully committed to backing their ongoing success.

“The Government is working hard to ensure the right settings are in place to support to grow their businesses.

“For example, we’ve recently opened public consultation on the biggest package of changes to national direction under the Resource Management Act in New Zealand’s history.

“This includes removing unnecessary consents for practices like crop rotation, enabling commercial domestic vegetable growing, and supporting long-term water security by enabling water storage.

“Our common-sense proposals streamline or remove many of the burdensome regulations holding our growers back.

“The Government will keep working hard to support Kiwi growers to boost on-farm productivity and profitability, drive higher farmgate returns, and strengthen our rural communities.”
