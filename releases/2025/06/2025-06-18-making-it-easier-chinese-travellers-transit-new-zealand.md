The Government is boosting tourism and trade by making it simpler, faster and cheaper for Chinese nationals to transit via New Zealand.

From November, Chinese passport holders will no longer need to obtain a Transit Visa before transiting through New Zealand airports. Instead, they will be able to get a New Zealand electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA).

“International connections are a crucial part of our plan to drive economic growth. We rely on robust and affordable air connectivity to bring people to our beautiful country, and to get our high-quality products out to the world. Alongside the announcement of a new route from China to South America via Auckland, we expect this will significantly boost the number of passengers that choose to transit through New Zealand.

“Instead of spending $235 and waiting four days, individuals can pay as little as $17 and can be processed in 24 hours,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

An NZeTA is also valid for up to 2 years, meaning that someone can travel multiple times without needing to apply again.

“Our Government has taken action to enable another route to be opened from China via New Zealand. This will allow Auckland Airport to be a hub for further airline connections. Removing the cost and time barriers of a transit visa makes this route a more attractive option for both tourists and airlines,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“Every additional passenger transiting New Zealand on their way to South America or back to China will help to lower the cost of a plane ticket, which makes it cheaper for other waves of tourists to come and see what our country has to offer.

“More capacity from airlines will make it easier to visit New Zealand and adds cargo capacity, driving economic growth and supporting the Government’s goal to double the value of tourism exports by 2034.”

“This Government is focused on delivering smart, flexible responsive nuanced immigration solutions such as this to support New Zealand’s growing economy,” Ms Stanford says.
