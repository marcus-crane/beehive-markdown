Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters have announced a new $16 million package of support for Ukraine ahead of this week’s NATO Summit in the Hague.   

“New Zealand stands in solidarity with Ukraine. Its war of self-defence is well into its fourth year and our condemnation of Russia’s illegal full-scale invasion remains undiminished,” Mr Luxon says.

New Zealand will make $4 million contributions to two multi-national funds providing lethal and non-lethal military assistance for Ukraine: the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) fund; and the United Kingdom and Latvia-led Drone Coalition for Ukraine.

“The defence of Ukraine has significant implications not only for the security of the Euro-Atlantic, but also for the Indo-Pacific,” Mr Peters says.  

“We must continue to work with others in the international community to uphold a rules-based order that serves all our interests.”

New Zealand will also provide $7 million in further humanitarian assistance for conflict affected communities in Ukraine, and $1 million for Ukrainians displaced in neighbouring countries.  

“The scale of need remains vast, as Russia continues its bombardment of densely populated civilian areas of Ukraine,” Mr Luxon says.

This support package follows the recently announced sanctions targeting Russia’s “shadow fleet” and other enablers of Russia’s war in Ukraine. 

“It is vital the international community maintains pressure on Russia to end its war and engage meaningfully with efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” Mr Peters says.
