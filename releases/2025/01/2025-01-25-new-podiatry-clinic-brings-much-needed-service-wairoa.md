A new monthly podiatry clinic has been launched today in Wairoa and will bring a much-needed service closer to home for the Wairoa community, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Health New Zealand has been successful in securing a podiatrist until the end of June this year to meet the needs of the Wairoa community. The podiatrist has a special interest in diabetes and will travel to Wairoa with a nurse, for monthly clinics which will be held at Queen St Practice,” Mr Brown says.

“Primary and community healthcare, like this podiatry clinic, play a key role in preventing illness, treating disease early and reducing the impact of long-term conditions. Keeping people well improves their quality of life and reduces the pressure on our hospitals.

“I am aware the community is also working closely with government agencies on addressing access to other healthcare services such as the provision of aged care services for their elderly.”

This six-month initiative funded by Health NZ will be reviewed in June. Further engagement with the community will continue throughout the year, including on the Wairoa Ageing Well Project.

“For the estimated 400 – 600 people in the area with diabetes, as well as those with other issues, having this service on their doorstep will be a great addition to improving the range of timely, quality healthcare that can be delivered locally.” Mr Brown says.

“Investments like this are important to ensure all New Zealanders can access timely, quality healthcare and is made possible by the Government’s record investment of $16.8 billion in health in Budget 2024.”
