The Government is seeking public feedback on options to strengthen New Zealand’s overarching emergency management legislation, Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell announced today.

“The Government is committed to strengthening New Zealand’s emergency management system and ensuring that it can meet the growing risk we face from severe weather events and other emergencies,” Mr Mitchell says.

“As part of our response to the Government Inquiry into the Response to the North Island Severe Weather Events, we intend to pass a new Emergency Management Bill during this term of Parliament. The Bill will replace the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002.

“The new Bill is an opportunity to make sure our legislative settings enable the improvements identified through the Government Inquiry and other reviews.

“In particular, the legislative reforms aim to ensure there is a whole-of-society approach to emergency management. 

The proposed objectives for the new bill are to:

- strengthen community and iwi Māori participation in emergency management
- provide for clear responsibilities and accountabilities at the national, regional, and local levels
- enable a higher minimum standard of emergency management
- minimise disruption to essential services
- ensure agencies have the right powers available when an emergency happens.

“Everyone has a role to play in emergency management – before, during and after emergencies – and different parts of our society have different strengths, knowledge, resources and ways of organising. 

“I encourage individuals, community groups, the rural sector, hapu and iwi, businesses, ethnic communities and other organisations to read the discussion document and share their perspectives on the issues and the options for improving the legislation. 

“Given the significant and often long-lasting impacts of emergencies, it’s important that we make sure the legislative settings are fit-for-purpose.”

The discussion document and information on how to make a submission is available on NEMA’s website [www.civildefence.govt.nz/emergency-management-bill](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/emergency-management-bill). 

Submissions close on 13 May 2025.
