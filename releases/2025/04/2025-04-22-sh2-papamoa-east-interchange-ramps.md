The early opening of the eastbound off-ramp on the Pāpāmoa East Interchange is great news for the local community says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

“Construction of the new interchange over the Tauranga Eastern Link Toll Road will improve travel for the Pāpāmoa East community and enable further development of the area. Getting a ramp open early means road users can benefit from improved connection to the region,” Mr Bishop says.

“The Pāpāmoa area is expected to grow significantly, increasing to around 40,000 people by 2043. Once completed, the Pāpāmoa East Interchange will alleviate pressure on existing routes and shorten travel time towards Tauranga, the Mount and destinations in the east, as well as enabling further development in Pāpāmoa east, notably the Golden Sands and Wairākei neighbourhoods and The Sands town centre.

“Tauranga City Council (TCC) has requested an early opening of the eastbound off-ramp before completion of the full project, and the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) has now agreed in principle to this proposal. The interchange eastbound off-ramp is expected to be ready in the second half of 2025, with the overall project completion expected in mid-2026.

“Consideration is also underway for a new toll point to be installed on the toll road west of the Pāpāmoa East Interchange. Tolling infrastructure takes approximately 12 months to install, and the implications of an early opening are currently being worked through. This includes NZTA carrying out public consultation on the amendment to the road tolling scheme for the Tauranga Eastern Link Toll Road in mid-2025.

“Tauranga City Council is leading delivery of the interchange with HEB Construction, and 51 percent funding of the project from NZTA. When construction is complete, the interchange will be passed to NZTA to maintain and operate as part of the toll road.

“I want to thank TCC, NZTA, and local MP Tom Rutherford, for their support and advocacy in making this opportunity to open the eastbound off-ramp early a reality. Common sense decisions like thiswill help ensure everyone can get where they’re going safely and efficiently and provide early wins for this critical project.
