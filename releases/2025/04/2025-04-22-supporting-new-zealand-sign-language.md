The release of a draft New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) strategy for consultation will help drive better support for the Deaf community, Disability Issues Minister Louise Upston says.

The draft NZSL Strategy went out for consultation today, with Minister Upston describing it as an important step forward.

“NZSL is an official language of New Zealand and the first language for many Deaf New Zealanders.

“Unfortunately, Deaf people are not always able to access public services or community events using NZSL.

“The strategy will drive the work of the NZSL Board for the next five years as they strive to ensure members of the Deaf community have the assistance they need.

“This draft strategy represents a fresh look at what needs to be done to ensure all New Zealanders can use, support and value NZSL.

“The Government is committed to better public services and delivering services and supports that meet the needs of the Deaf community.

“From census information, we know the number of NZSL users has increased since 2013, with about 25,000 using NZSL in Census 2023. The same census indicated that around 5,700 people in New Zealand could not hear at all

“I acknowledge the work of the Board to ensure that NZSL goes further and is futureproofed as a strong, vibrant language recognised and embraced by Kiwis,” Louise Upston says.

Consultation on the draft NZSL strategy is open until 2 June 2025. Minister Upston will report the strategy back to Cabinet for approval later this year.
