*Toi te kupu, toi te mana, toi tū te reo.*

Talented appointees to prominent reo Māori entities will help grow accessibility to the language and culture in homes and communities, Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka says.

“Beloved shows from the past like Hōmai Te Pakipaki, popular celebrations like Te Wiki o te Reo Māori and inspiring national events like Te Matatini o Te Kāhui Maunga attract large diverse audiences to reo Māori me ngā tikanga. Stories about Māori told in a uniquely Māori will continue to support language learners and fluent speakers alike as we move to an increasingly digital mediascape.

“The appointments I’m announcing today include leaders in governance, business, broadcasting, and language revitalisation.” The entities and appointments are:
