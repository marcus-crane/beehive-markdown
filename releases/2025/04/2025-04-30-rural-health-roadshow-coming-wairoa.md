Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health and Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey is pleased to be in Wairoa today as part of the Rural Health Roadshow across the country.

“I was pleased to begin the roadshow in Levin recently where I had the opportunity to hear from the local community and people working in rural health about their access to health care, what’s working well and what’s not. I look forward to continuing momentum by hearing from those living in Wairoa today,” Mr Doocey says.

“All New Zealanders deserve timely access to quality health care and this Government is committed to improving health and mental health outcomes, particularly for the one in five living in our rural communities.

“The Rural Health Strategy was published in 2023 and sets the direction for improving the health of people who live in rural communities. I now want to hear today from the public and those working in rural health in Wairoa on how well the strategy is being implemented.

“As Minister for Mental Health, I also committed to sustainably fund the Mana Ake school-based mental wellbeing programme to ensure its roll out to all of Hawke’s Bay and Tairawhiti’s primary and intermediate schools, including those in Wairoa.

“Early intervention and prevention are one of my priorities. I’ve committed to it in my mental health targets as we know it’s one of the best ways to increase access and encourage better mental wellbeing for young New Zealanders, both rural and urban.

“I have been heartened to hear positive feedback so far on the roadshow from many people who appreciate the opportunity for the voices of our rural communities to be heard.”
