Parents are being encouraged to provide feedback on how relationships and sexuality education (RSE) is taught in schools.

“As young people grow up, they deserve the chance to be equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to interact respectfully with others. Relationships and sexuality education can play an important role in this. Parents deserve certainty and clarity on what their children are learning, when and how in RSE at school so they can make informed decisions about their education,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says. 

The Ministry of Education has released the draft relationships and sexuality framework for consultation. It was developed by Ministry of Education subject matter experts and quality assured by both internal and external experts. It outlines the proposed teaching to be covered in RSE each year, from Years 0 to 13.

“It aims to ensure the content is age-appropriate, evidence-informed, and detailed about what is taught and when.”

Research conducted by the Education Review Office (ERO) last year highlighted significant inconsistencies in the delivery of RSE across the country. It found more than three quarters of recent school leavers say they didn’t learn enough about consent.

“Young people have been very clear that consent education is important to their development and have advocated for its inclusion in the national curriculum. We have ensured that age-appropriate consent education is present in all year levels of the draft framework,” Ms Stanford says.

The consultation period is open until May 9 2025. The feedback will help shape the wider health and physical education learning area will be released for consultation in Term 4, 2025.

“The new curriculum will give certainty to schools about what is to be taught, choice to parents over the level of their child’s participation, and consistency across the country, so all young people get the information they need to keep them safe and healthy.”

Minister for Women, Nicola Grigg says she wants all women and girls to be safe from all forms of violence, including sexual violence.

“Statistics show that in New Zealand, women are nearly three times more likely to experience sexual violence compared to men.

“It is important that both boys and girls are taught how to engage in healthy relationships and that parents are aware of what their children are being taught. While consent education is not the only solution, it can contribute towards the necessary shift in behaviour to prevent forms of sexual violence and better equip young adults to be safe.”
