Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will travel to the United Kingdom and Türkiye next week, visiting London, Gallipoli, and Istanbul.

“New Zealand has enduring bonds with both the UK and Türkiye, forged through our shared history. I’m looking forward to reinforcing these bonds,” Mr Luxon says.

While in London, Mr Luxon will meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to talk trade, security, and the geopolitical backdrop in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

“New Zealand is a champion for free trade, and I look forward to talking to Sir Keir Starmer about what our countries can do together to support the rules-based trading system.”

His visit will also reaffirm New Zealand’s strong defence and security partnership with the UK.

“The UK is one of New Zealand’s closest and most trusted partners, and for many Kiwis, it is where they base themselves on their OE.

“The UK is also important to New Zealand’s prosperity. Our exports there grew by more than 20 per cent in 2024 and are still growing.”

Following the UK, Mr Luxon will make his first official visit to Türkiye.

"This will be the first visit by a New Zealand Prime Minister to Türkiye since 2015. It also coincides with the 110th anniversary of the ANZAC landings.

“I am travelling to Gallipoli to honour the commitment and sacrifice of all New Zealand war veterans.”

He leaves New Zealand on 19 April.
