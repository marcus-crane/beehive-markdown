A new toolkit to support women and their employers address online harm has been launched by Minister for Women, Nicola Grigg, at the Local Government New Zealand conference today.

“The prevalence of online harm has become a serious issue, disproportionately impacting women who are in the public eye. The growing phenomenon of online abuse has the very real potential to deter women from stepping into leadership roles and engaging in public and political life,” Ms Grigg says.

“The Ministry for Women’s new online harm prevention toolkit has been developed in collaboration with the online safety organisation Netsafe. It includes interactive educational modules, practical resources, and real-world case studies from women in leadership and public-facing roles. It offers insights and strategies for overcoming digital harm.

“Research shows the alarming impact abuse and harassment on social media is having on women, particularly those in the public eye, including self-censoring, avoiding digital platforms, and generally having less contact with the public.

“This toolkit aims to ensure women have the tools to engage safely and confidently online, while helping to foster a more supportive digital environment for everyone. I encourage all workplaces to check out the new toolkit so that collectively we can call out online harm when we see it, and support those experiencing it.”

The online harm prevention toolkit is available on both the Ministry for Women and Netsafe websites.
