The Prime Minister will represent New Zealand at the funeral for Pope Francis on Saturday, after attending Anzac Day services in Gallipoli the day prior.

"I will join those at St Peter's Basilica mourning the loss of Pope Francis, while celebrating his service to the more than one billion Catholics across the world, including almost 450,000 in New Zealand," says Mr Luxon.
