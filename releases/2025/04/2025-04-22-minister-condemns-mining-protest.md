Protesters camping at a West Coast mining site should be condemned for their selfish and dangerous actions that put themselves and others at risk, Resources Minister Shane Jones says.

“I cannot fathom the mentality of these blow-ins from other parts of the country to think that they have a right to speak for the hundreds of people who derive their living from mining.

“They turn up, reportedly with an eight-month-old child in tow, to protest what is a legitimate industry going about its lawful business. In the process they are putting themselves in danger and sapping the resources of Police and other agencies.

“I’m not sure if they have realised New Zealand is probably the only country transitioning from renewables to coal as Kiwis face down an economic downturn and rising power prices at the onset of winter.

“This lack of awareness and consideration for others is mind-boggling. New Zealand is relying on a stockpile of 1.2 million tonnes of coal to keep the lights on this winter. Where do these activists think it comes from if not from mines?”

“Mining brings in millions of dollars in royalties, and in wages and spending on infrastructure, plant and supplies. It is an industry with a proud history on the West Coast. It is incredibly insulting to the people of the West Cost who rely on this industry for a few protesters from outside the region to fossil-fuel their way, presumably, to the West Coast to vilify those people.

“And to the stragglers who plan on protesting outside the office of Bathurst Resources in Wellington today, shame on you. Don’t think for a minute you are striking at the heart of the company. All you are doing is intimidating the people who work in the building and preventing them from going to work to put food on the tables of their families.

“Businesses have a legal right, under a law passed by the New Zealand Parliament, to apply for fast-track approval. I’m confident in its robustness to ensure guard rails are in place for projects to ensure they comply with our environmental and conservation laws. These protesters should too,” Mr Jones says.
