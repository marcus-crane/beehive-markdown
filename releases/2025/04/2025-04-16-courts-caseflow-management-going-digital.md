Kiwis will soon be able to file and track their court cases online as the Government signs off the business case to finally go digital, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Courts Minister Nicole McKee say.

“The new online portal will provide a source of trusted information, and users will receive consistent, timely responses about their cases. This means more certainty, and less anxiety, for everyone involved,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Current court and tribunal processes are largely paper-based and underpinned by outdated software. These manual processes don’t meet the public’s expectation of a modern, streamlined service. 

“This new modern caseflow management system will improve the reliability and efficiency of courts, benefitting everyone involved in the courts.”

“The caseflow management system is set to make a significant difference to everyone who participates in New Zealand’s courts and tribunals,” Mrs McKee says. 

“The Family court will benefit first from the new system, which will start to be rolled out from July 2026.

“Planning for a second phase of development for the Civil and Criminal jurisdictions of both the High Court and District Court, is scheduled to begin later this year and expected to go live in the second half of 2027.

“A third and final phase of development will focus on the appeals processes, including the Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court. It will also include rollout for Environment Court, Coroners Court, and the Disputes Tribunal. The third phase is expected to begin in 2027 and go live in late 2028.”
