The Government is making more financial support available for eligible farmers in many parts of the North Island and upper South Island to help with essential living costs, Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston and Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson say.

“Rural Assistance Payments are being made available from Monday 28 April 2025 in 27 districts affected by dry conditions. We want to help eligible farmers whose income has been severely affected by drought-stricken conditions,” Louise Upston says.

“We know farmers in these regions have been significantly impacted by low rainfall over recent months, and we want people to be able to access support when they need it

“These Rural Assistance Payments are being made available until 28 October 2025, when farmer incomes are expected to lift.”

Mark Patterson is encouraging farmers doing it tough to get in touch with their local [Rural Support Trust](https://www.rural-support.org.nz/regions) to find out what help is available and to apply for a Rural Assistance Payment if they need it.

“Droughts often have a sting in the tail with the cold tough winter months still to come. We know how hard it can be to recover from a drought, and we are here to support farmers through it,” Mark Patterson says.

Farmers in the Northland, Waikato, Taranaki, Horizons (Manawatū-Whanganui, including Tararua), and the Top of the South Island (Marlborough, Tasman, and Nelson City) regional council areas can apply for Rural Assistance Payments.
