Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey is pleased to announce today that the Women’s Refuge is the latest recipient of the Government’s Mental Health and Addiction Innovation Fund. 

“Women’s Refuge do incredibly important work in our communities. They provide a safe space for women and children experiencing family violence, some of whom may be experiencing mental health and addiction challenges. I am delighted that the organisation will receive funding from the Government to help deliver mental health and addiction support to those in need,” Mr Doocey says.

“I am pleased the funding announced today will support 250 advocates based within the 41 Women’s Refuges across New Zealand with mental health and addiction training, advisory support from clinical specialists and strengthen referral pathways so clients can access local mental health and addiction services more efficiently.  

“The feedback I often hear about mental health services is that it is too hard to navigate and know where to go in a time of need. This funding will enable Women’s Refuge to upskill their staff on mental health and addiction as well as improve connections with local services and referral pathways and join up the system to make it more accessible to those in need.

“Over the past five years, Women’s Refuge has supported an average of 15,000 clients per year. This funding will strengthen the workforce and improve referral pathways for those women and children who are accessing Women’s Refuge services.

“Initiatives like this is exactly what the Innovation Fund was designed for, and this support will only grow as we move into the second round of funding.”

The Women’s Refuge will receive $540,000 from the Government across two years, which will be matched by the Women’s Refuge to make a total of $1,080,000 over a two-year period.

In round one of the Innovation Fund the Government have so far supported MATES in Construction, The Mental Health Foundation, YouthLine, Wellington City Mission, Rotorua Youth One Stop Shop and the Sir John Kirwan Foundation.

“I am committed to doing everything possible to bring down mental health and addiction wait times in New Zealand. Partnering with organisations such as Women’s Refuge through the Innovation Fund to deliver innovative projects and initiatives supports the Government’s priority focus of increasing access to mental health and addiction support for Kiwis,” Mr Doocey says.

A future procurement opportunity for round two of the Fund was released on the Government Electronic Tender site (GETS) last week and a Request for Proposal is scheduled to be released in May 2025.
