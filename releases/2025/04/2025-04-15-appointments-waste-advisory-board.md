Environment Minister Penny Simmonds has today announced two new appointments and two reappointments to the Waste Advisory Board.

The Waste Advisory Board provides independent advice to the Minister for the Environment on matters relating to the Waste Minimisation Act 2008 and waste minimisation.

“I am very pleased to welcome Dr Terri-Ann Berry and Michelle Kazor to the Waste Advisory Board,” Ms Simmonds says.

“Dr Berry is an Associate Professor at the School of Future Environments at Auckland University of Technology and the founder and Co-Director of the Environmental Innovation Centre, a private research institute focused on improving sustainability outcomes, especially in the construction industry.

“Ms Kazor has more than 20 years’ experience in waste, resource efficiency, and climate policy, and has worked across government, corporate, and non-profit sectors in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.”

In addition to the new appointments, Ms Simmonds also reappointed Board Chair Darren Patterson, and Board member Don Chittock.

“Mr Patterson has more than 25 years’ experience in industry, local and central government, and community projects, as well as significant board experience. He has provided sound leadership to the Board during the last six years as Chair and his reappointment will ensure continuity of knowledge and experience.

“Likewise, Mr Chittock brings a wide range of industry experience and has led some of the more technical pieces of the Board’s work. His reappointment means he will continue to provide the group with experience in the more technical aspects of the industry.”

Ms Simmonds thanked outgoing Board members Denise Roche, Jacqui Forbes and Sue Coutts.

“These members provided expertise and advice during their time on the Board. I thank them for their contribution and look forward to working with the new members as they begin their terms,” Ms Simmonds says.
