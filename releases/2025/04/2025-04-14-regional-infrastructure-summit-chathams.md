Regional Development Minister Shane Jones will take one of the largest delegations in recent years to the Chatham Islands tomorrow for his next regional summit.

“It is important, given the relative isolation of the islands, to take the summit to the people who live there. The Chathams has an infrastructure deficit and I am going there in person to share with the locals the criteria of the Regional Infrastructure Fund and how they can apply for project funding,” Mr Jones says.

“I expect a big turnout from the locals for this summit. Previously, the Crown funded projects through the Provincial Growth Fund. I’m keen to see how they have contributed to the local economy. Boosting resilience is critical.

“ I am taking a large delegation including government ministers and MPs, experts in a range of fields, business leaders and officials. Energy, fishing, tourism and alternative land use are all areas which could benefit from the connections made at the summit tomorrow and I hope to hear some ambitious plans from the islanders.”

Mr Jones will also be accompanied by the Rātana Band, a rare visit, and an acknowledgement of the historical ties between the Rātana Church and the Chathams.

The Coalition Government’s drive for regional economic growth through the $1.2 billion [Regional Infrastructure Fund](https://www.growregions.govt.nz/new-funding/regional-infrastructure-fund) is on track with more than $580 million in funding so far committed to key infrastructure projects.

“To date, the Regional Infrastructure Fund has received more than 260 applications. Approved investments align with the Government’s focus areas of enabling growth and water storage, supporting energy generation and Māori economic development, and increasing resilience,” Mr Jones says.

Mr Jones has so far held 11 summits around the country, with more than 1300 stakeholders attending. 

Summits will be held for Wairarapa and Kāpiti on 9 May, and Otago on 16 May.

The Regional Infrastructure Fund is a capital fund with the primary purpose of accelerating infrastructure projects, particularly with a focus on water storage, energy, Māori economic development, growth, and resilience.

Committed funding includes approved funding and funding ring-fenced for specific purposes but is yet to be approved for release.
