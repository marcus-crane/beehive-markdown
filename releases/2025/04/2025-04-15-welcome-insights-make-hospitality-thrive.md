Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has welcomed a report from the Restaurant Association and Hospitality New Zealand on steps to support the hospitality sector to thrive.

“It’s fantastic to see the insights and ideas discussed at last year’s Hospitality Summit now presented as actionable solutions in this report,” Louise Upston says.

“I’m pleased to see that the Government’s focus on tourism growth aligns with the hospitality sector’s priorities, particularly our vision to drive economic growth for hospitality businesses and jobs for Kiwis, by increasing international visitor numbers. 

“The hospitality sector’s renowned hustle and hard work shines through in its response to this report, with industry leading the way on most recommendations. 

“The Hospitality Summit has been a key initiative allowing greater alignment across the hospitality and tourism sectors. The input of hospitality leaders has been instrumental in delivering our Tourism Boost. The shared knowledge of leaders has been invaluable in helping chart future directions.

“Where recommendations call for government support or action, much is already being addressed through the work programmes of various government agencies.

“Work currently underway includes the additional $3 million to secure more business events as part of the Tourism Boost package, and $50,000 for the Restaurant Association of New Zealand, working in partnership with Hospitality NZ, to develop hospitality and restaurant spending insights.

“Changes to the Accredited Employer Work Visa address concerns raised about wage thresholds and job checks while a review of the vocational education and training system will consider the need for better support for skilled talent in the hospitality industry.  

“The comprehensive recommendations in this report are exactly the type of feedback that I want to encourage from the sector, working in partnership with Government.  

“I look forward to working together as we continue to prioritise growth for the tourism and hospitality sectors,” says Louise Upston.
