*He aha te kai a te rangatira? He kōrero, he kōrero, he kōrero.*

The government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the aspirations of Raukawa and communities across the South Waikato, Minister for Māori-Crown Relations Tama Potaka says.

“My deep thanks to all those who travelled from Raukawa whenua to share their important kōrero at a ministerial forum held at Parliament on Thursday.

“A stronger relationship helps us build on opportunities to address challenges together that exist across the rohe, not just for uri of Raukawa but for the entire South Waikato community,” Mr Potaka says.

The kōrero focussed on three key areas: resetting and strengthening the Treaty partnership; rebuilding marae resilience, and cross-agency partnership.

“Marae continue to play an important role as community hubs during times of tough challenges such as significant weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic. The people of Raukawa hold an inspiring commitment to ensuring their marae are available to serve the needs of the entire community in the south Waikato region during tough times.

“I also mihi to Raukawa on the work they have done through the Kahu Taurima and Te Kei o Te Waka programmes to support the health and wellbeing of tamariki and whānau in their region. It’s a testament to the strength of the regions to get in there and get the mahi done with a locally-led whānau-centred kaupapa.

“I am looking forward to working with my Ministerial colleagues and officials to expand on the topics discussed at the forum, and to identify how we can collaboratively contribute meaningfully to the aspirations of Raukawa. Sustaining strong partnerships with Iwi and Hapū is essential to the prosperity of all New Zealanders.”

Kua whakaūhia anōtia e tēnei kāwanatanga tōna ngākau nui ki te tautoko i ngā moemoeā o Raukawa me ōna hapori huri noa i te Tonga o Waikato, te kī a Te Minita Hononga Māori Karauna Tama Pōtaka.

“Aku mihi nui ki ngā tāngata katoa i haere mai i te whenua o Raukawa ki te tuari i ō rātou kōrero nui whakaharahara ki te hui ā-minita i tū ki te Whare Pāremata i te Rāpare.

“Mā te pakari ake a te hononga e āwhina mātou ki te whai i ngā arawātea ki te whakatikatika ngātahi i ngā wero e hua mai ana puta noa i te rohe, kaua anake mā ngā uri o Raukawa engari mō te katoa o te hapori o te Tonga o Waikato” te kī a Minita Potaka.

I arotahi ngā kōrero ki ngā wāhi e toru, te whakarite anō me te whakapakaritanga o te pātuinga Tiriti, te whakapakaritanga o te manahautanga o te marae me te pātuinga whakawhiti hinonga.

“”He wāhi nui tonu tā ngā marae hei pokapū hapori i ngā wā o ngā wero nui pērā i ngā wā o te huarere taritari me te mate urutā te KOWHEORI-19. Kei te pupuri ngā tāngata o Raukawa te kaingākau whakaawe e mātua whakarite ana e wātea ana ō rātou marae ki te manaaki i te katoa o te hapori i te Tonga o Waikato i ngā wā o te raru.

“Kei te mihi hoki au ki a Raukawa mō ngā mahi kua oti i a rātou mā ngā hōtaka te Kahu Taurima me Te Kei o Te Waka hei tautoko i te hauora me te oranga o ngā tamariki me ngā whānau i tō rātou rohe. He tohu tēnei o te kaha o ngā rohe ki te whai wāhi atu kia tutuki ai ngā mahi me tētahi kaupapa ā-whānau e whakahaerehia ana ā-rohe.

“Harikoa katoa te ngākau kia mahi tahi mātou ko ōku hoa Minita me ngā āpiha ki te whakawhānui ake i ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kaupapa i kōrerotia i te hui, me te kimi huarahi e taea ai e mātou te mahi ngātahi i runga i te ngākau nui ki te whakatutuki i ngā moemoeā o Raukawa. “He mea nui te whakapūmautanga o ngā mahitahi pakari ki ngā Iwi me ngā Hapū ki te tōnuitanga o te katoa o Ngāi Aotearoa.”
