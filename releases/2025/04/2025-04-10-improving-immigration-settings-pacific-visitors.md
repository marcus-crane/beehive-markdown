New Zealand is making it easier for people from across the Pacific to visit here, the Foreign Affairs and Immigration Ministers have announced.

“We deeply value our Pacific relationships. Being able to visit New Zealand to connect with family and friends is an important part of this,” Foreign Minister Winston Peters says, who is currently in Tonga during a multi-country visit to the Pacific. 

“We expect all visitors to New Zealand to follow the rules. At the same time, we want to make it easier and cheaper for people from across the Pacific to visit New Zealand.”  

From early July, people from all Pacific Islands Forum countries who apply for a visitor visa may be eligible for a multi-entry visa – and will be able to visit New Zealand as many times as they want for 24 months, an increase from the current 12. Maximum stay rules for visitors remain unchanged.

From November, Pacific Islands Forum country passport holders travelling from Australia with a valid Australian visitor, work, student or family visa will be able to come to New Zealand with just an NZeTA rather than a separate New Zealand visa and be able to stay for up to three months.

“By removing the need for a separate visitor visa for those people travelling from Australia, we are simplifying the process for Pacific visitors by significantly reducing the cost and time. This new visa waiver will be trialled for 12 months to allow an assessment of its impact. For those who do still need a New Zealand visa, we are making it easier for them to make multiple trips,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

“These flexible and nuanced solutions ensure we have a stable and predictable immigration system,” Ms Stanford says.  

“These changes are a tangible step to increase the connection between New Zealand and the Pacific. We look forward to discussing our connections further when Pacific Islands Forum leaders meet in Solomon Islands in September,” Mr Peters says.
