The Government is making changes to work-based learning so that industries have more influence over how they train apprentices and trainees, Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds says.

“Whether you’re a carpenter building the warm, dry homes of tomorrow, or a mechanic working to keep us safe on the roads, it’s important you have the right skills to do your job effectively,” Ms Simmonds says.

“However, industry representatives have made it clear that the current work-based learning model is not delivering because it has become overly centralised through Te Pūkenga. As a result, the training of apprentices and other workers is often disconnected from the realities of the jobs they are working towards.

“We are fixing this by giving industries more control over how they train people.

“Beginning next year, the Government will introduce a new, independent, and industry-led model for work-based learning.

“This means vocational education and training providers will be able to manage all aspects of an apprenticeship or traineeship at an industry level, rather than taking direction from a centralised behemoth.

“This is great for learners because it makes their learning more relevant to their employment, and it is beneficial to businesses who will gain access to more capable workers to boost their productivity and deliver economic growth.

“Public and industry consultation clearly showed that this model was the preferred option, and this Government is proud to deliver the changes that we called for,” Ms Simmonds says.

From 1 January 2026:

- New Industry Skills Boards (ISBs) will be set up to set training standards, endorse programmes and moderate assessments.
- Apprentices and trainees currently with Te Pūkenga will move to the ISBs for up to two years.
- New students will enrol directly with new work-based learning private providers, polytechnics, or Wānanga.
- ISBs will be able to enrol new learners until other providers are set up to deliver work-based learning.

“So, if you’re a learner or an employer — keep going. Your qualifications are essential, and your training is valuable. There will be no disruption, your training stays on track,” Ms Simmonds says.

“We’re building a better system — for learners, for industry, and for the future of New Zealand.”
