Nominations are now open for the inaugural Growing Native Forests Champions Awards, celebrating the people and groups leading native growing efforts Forestry Minister Todd McClay announced today.

“These awards will recognise the farmers, landowners, iwi, and community groups restoring and planting native forests, and helping bolster New Zealand’s biodiversity and land resilience,” Mr McClay says.

“Native trees are vital to healthy ecosystems — they shelter wildlife, protect water quality, stabilise soils, and store carbon.”

Award categories include:

- Trees on Farms – for farmers growing native forests on their land.
- Lifestyle Block Owner – for owners of properties under 20 hectares.
- Forestry Company – for businesses or individuals in the forestry sector.
- Mana Whenua – for individuals, whānau, hapū, and iwi-led projects.
- Catchment/Community Group – for local and catchment-based initiatives.

Nominations open 15 April and close 9 May 2025. Winners will be announced at Fieldays in June.
