The Government has agreed on a new scheme allowing trusted builders to sign off their own work and will set a mandatory target to tackle building inspection wait times, Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk has announced.

“Making it easier and more affordable to build opens the door to homeownership for more Kiwis, gives families choice about where they live, and supports growth and job creation in the construction sector,” Mr Penk says.

“We can’t achieve this vision while the building consent system remains slow and overloaded. Even simple, single-storey homes must go through around 12 inspections before they’re finished, with costly delays when demand is high.

“At a time when many Kiwis are locked out of the housing market, that’s simply not good enough.

“The Government is committed to making the building system more efficient and Cabinet has now agreed to an opt-in self-certification scheme, which will allow approved building firms, plumbers, and drainlayers to sign off their own work.

“Reputable building companies delivering large numbers of near-identical houses each year will be able to proceed without the need for Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to approve a building consent and carry out inspections.

“Giving qualified plumbers and drainlayers the ability to self-certify their work puts them on equal footing with electricians and gasfitters, who’ve had that flexibility for years. It’s a common-sense change backed by Master Plumbers and delivers on a National Party campaign promise.

“Kiwis should have confidence that their homes are built to a high standard. That’s why only proven professionals who meet strict criteria will be eligible for the scheme - and only for simple residential dwellings.

"Initially these changes are expected to see around 3,000 homes built each year without delays from approvals or inspections. BCAs will be freed up to focus on high-risk, complex builds instead of being bogged down by simple homes.

"In addition, the Government will require BCAs complete 80 percent of building inspections within three working days.

“Master Builders have welcomed this announcement as a meaningful step toward reducing inspection delays. We regularly hear from builders frustrated by the disruption to project timelines and the uncertainty it creates for homeowners.

“Wait times sometimes stretch up to a week - having a knock-on effect which can add about $400 for every day a project is held up.

"Updated guidance will be issued to BCAs, outlining practical strategies to boost efficiency, reduce bottlenecks, and help authorities better prioritise their workloads."

“BCAs success in meeting the target will be shown in quarterly performance data - giving the public greater transparency and encouraging improved performance.

"By backing skilled professionals and focusing council resources, we can cut building costs without sacrificing quality - delivering more affordable homes for Kiwi families."

Inspection targets will come into force later this year and legislation to enable the self-certification scheme will be introduced by the end of 2025.

**Notes to editors:**

- The self-certification scheme will be a voluntary, opt-in measure enabled by changes to the Building Act 2004 and the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Act 2006.
- There will be two self-certification pathways available under the scheme:
  
  - An opt-in self-certification scheme for house builders carrying out work on an entire simple residential dwelling (including design and construction).
  - An opt-in self-certification scheme for plumbers and drainlayers carrying out work on a simple residential dwelling.
- The definition of an eligible simple residential dwelling will be set down in regulation, following industry consultation.
- BCAs will still be required to provide a nominal consent for entire simple homes where trusted building professionals are self-certifying their work.
