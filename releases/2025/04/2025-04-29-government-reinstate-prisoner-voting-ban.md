The Government has agreed to reinstate a total ban on prisoner voting, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Cabinet’s decision will reverse the changes made by the previous government in 2020, which allowed prisoners serving sentences of less than three years to vote.

“Restoring prisoner voting was typical of the previous government’s soft-on-crime approach; we don’t agree with it.

“Citizenship brings rights and responsibilities. People who breach those responsibilities to the extent that they are sentenced to jail temporarily lose some of their rights, including the right to vote.

“The proposed change will establish a consistent approach to prisoner voting, regardless of the length of sentence.

“The Government is committed to restoring law and order, and part of the response is to place a greater emphasis on personal responsibility and accountability. 

“A total prison voting ban for all sentenced prisoners underlines the importance that New Zealanders afford to the rule of law, and the civic responsibility that goes hand-in-hand with the right to participate in our democracy through voting.

“The voting ban will be progressed as part of an electoral amendment bill announced in April and set for introduction later this year. 

“When prisoners have served their time, they will enjoy the full restoration of electoral rights. The Department of Corrections and the Electoral Commission currently coordinate to support prisoners with re-enrolment upon their release, and this work will continue.”

The ban will not be retrospective, meaning prisoners already serving sentences of less than three years at the time the ban comes into force before the 2026 General Election will retain the ability to vote. 

The voting ban will not apply to people detained on remand or serving sentences of home detention.
