New Zealand and the United States will continue to pursue shared strategic objectives in the Pacific, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says.

“Our Pacific links with the United States are more important than ever, and this visit to Hawaii has been an excellent opportunity to underline our shared Polynesian heritage and common strategic interests,” Mr Peters says. 

“New Zealand’s partnership with the United States remains one of our most long-standing and important, particularly when seen in the light of our joint interests in the Pacific and the evolving security environment.”

Mr Peters, leading a cross-party New Zealand political delegation to the Pacific, has had engagements in Honolulu with Governor of Hawaii Joshua Green, the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Paparo, the Interim President of the East-West Center Dr James Scott, as well as Hawaii-based representatives for Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. 

“This visit has enabled an important exchange of views on the economic, political and security changes occurring in the Indo-Pacific, and the role that New Zealand can play in working with regional partners to meet common challenges,” Mr Peters says.

“We have long advocated for the importance of an active and engaged United States in the Indo-Pacific, and this time in Honolulu allowed us to continue to make that case.” 

The delegation also commemorated the attack on Pearl Harbour by laying a wreath at the USS Arizona Memorial alongside the Commander of US Pacific Fleet Admiral Stephen Koehler. 

“It is important to remember those who gave their lives to create a free and open Indo-Pacific, especially in times such as these where the values which we fought for are being challenged.”

Hawaii was the second destination on the New Zealand delegation’s ongoing Pacific visit, following Tonga. The delegation now travels to Fiji, then Vanuatu.
