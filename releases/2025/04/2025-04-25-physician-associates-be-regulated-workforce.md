Physician associates will become a regulated profession that will contribute to New Zealand’s talented workforce of health professionals delivering timely, quality healthcare to New Zealanders, Health Minister Simeon Brown has announced.

“Physician associates are overseas-trained health professionals who can evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients under the supervision of a doctor.

“They work in a range of health settings in New Zealand, such as general practice and hospitals, assisting with both clinical and administrative tasks to ensure patient needs are met.

“About 50 physician associates are currently employed across the country, with the workforce expected to grow over coming years.

“Regulating physician associates under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 demonstrates the Government’s commitment to patient safety and providing high quality care.

“By regulating physician associates, they will be required to meet clear standards that are appropriate for the New Zealand health system, including training, supervision, and ongoing professional development.”

The Government has recently made a series of announcements to enable more health professionals to prescribe the medicines patients need. These have included amending the Medicines Act to provide nurse practitioners greater prescribing rights, and changing regulations to allow podiatrists to prescribe medicines relating to their role.

“Ensuring that all New Zealanders have access to timely, quality healthcare is a priority for the Government.

“I look forward to seeing how health services use this growing resource to meet our priorities,” Mr Brown says.
