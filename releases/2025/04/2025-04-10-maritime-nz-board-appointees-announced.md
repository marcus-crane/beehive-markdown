Associate Transport Minister James Meager has announced two new appointments and three reappointments to the board of Maritime New Zealand.

“I am pleased to welcome Kevin Short and Vivienne Bull as new members, who will join Dame Jo Brosnahan, Danny Tuato’o and Parke Pittar, who have been reappointed to the Board,” Mr Meager says. “Dame Jo will continue as Chair and Mr Short will be Deputy Chair.”

“Mr Short has extensive leadership, security, and response experience, from a long and distinguished career in the Defence Force.

“Ms Bull brings valuable expertise to the Board from serving over 10 years as an executive at Napier Port, where her responsibilities included health and safety, industrial relations and community engagement. She also has wider public sector experience.

“Maritime NZ has an important role in ensuring the safety and security of our maritime sector, along with our search and rescue responsibilities. I am very grateful that Dame Jo, Danny, and Parke have agreed to continue in their roles.

“I am confident that these new appointments will ensure that we continue to have an excellent range of skills and experience to continue the strong governance and leadership of Maritime NZ.

“I’d like to acknowledge the work of the previous members, Roy Weaver and Ross Wilson, for their commitment since February 2019 and August 2023 respectively. Both served during key periods of transition and change, and their leadership and experience has been highly valued. Mr Weaver has also served as Deputy Chair since November 2022.”

The board has six members, appointed by the Associate Minister of Transport, and Lesley Haines is the other member of the Board.
