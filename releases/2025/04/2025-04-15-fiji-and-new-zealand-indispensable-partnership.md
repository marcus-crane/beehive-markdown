Fiji and New Zealand will work together ever more closely to navigate the challenging strategic environment, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Peters says. 

“New Zealand and Fiji share an indispensable partnership in the Pacific,” Mr Peters says, following his meeting in Nadi last night with Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. “In these uncertain times, the Fiji-New Zealand relationship must deliver for our peoples and the region.”  

“As small, export-dependent countries facing economic headwinds, we focused on our regional and international connections and delivering the best possible outcomes for the Fijian and New Zealand people,” Mr Peters says. “We also discussed our ambition to grow two-way trade to $2 billion by 2030, and New Zealand’s recent decision to make it easier and cheaper for Fijians to visit our country.”

Minister Peters, who arrived in Fiji from Hawaii yesterday, says last night’s discussion also focused on the role of the United States in the Pacific. 

“During our visit to Honolulu, we were reminded of the United States’ significant investment in regional and global security. We continued this focus with Prime Minister Rabuka and we welcome our close cooperation with Fiji on a myriad of security issues, including defence cooperation, drug trafficking and people smuggling.

“We also exchanged ideas for how to cooperate to tackle shared challenges, how New Zealand can best support Fiji and the region’s economic development, and the importance we both attach to support for the Pacific from partners with similar values. We looked forward to the Pacific Islands Forum in Solomon Islands in September, which will provide regional leadership on priority Pacific issues.”

Mr Peters is leading a cross-party delegation around the Pacific. The short visit to Fiji followed programmes in Tonga and Hawaii. The cross-party delegation arrives in Vanuatu later today, before returning to New Zealand tomorrow.
