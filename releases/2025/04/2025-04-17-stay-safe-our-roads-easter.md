Transport Minister Chris Bishop is encouraging all road users to make safe choices and be patient with other drivers while on the roads this Easter.

“Road safety is a responsibility we all share, and with more people travelling around the country over the long weekend, we need everyone to make safe choices when they’re driving to avoid deaths and serious injuries,” Mr Bishop says.

“Please check road and weather conditions before you travel, especially in areas affected by Cyclone Tam. Take care and drive according to the conditions – remember that wet roads are slippery, reduce speed, increase following distances, avoid sudden braking, and use headlights if visibility is poor.

“You can expect to see Police on the roads anywhere, anytime this weekend, undertaking increased breath testing, as well as monitoring speed and other driving behaviour. There is a zero-tolerance approach to people putting themselves and others at risk, so think twice before you get behind the wheel.

“Drive sober, wear your seatbelt, ensure you’re well rested, and stick to the speed limit. Simple decisions like putting on your seatbelt and avoiding distractions, such as cell phones, while driving make a big difference in keeping yourself and other people safe on the roads.

“We want everyone to enjoy this Easter spending time with their friends and family. Making safe choices on the roads will ensure everyone can travel and return home safely.”
