- The Government is proposing the first major changes to New Zealand’s driver licence system since 2011
- The changes include removing the requirement for a practical driving test when getting a full driver licence
- Public consultation on the changes will begin tomorrow.

The Government proposes to remove the requirement for a second practical test when gaining a driver licence and reduce the number of eyesight tests required, among other sensible changes to the Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS), Transport Minister Chris Bishop says. 

“Getting a driver licence is very important for many Kiwis. Having a licence means people can access jobs, education, healthcare, and participate in society. 

“Around one million adults in New Zealand don’t have a full driver licence, and nearly half of these people have no licence at all.

“Right now the process for getting a driver licence is time consuming and inefficient. It involves a theory test to get a learner licence, and then two practical tests – one when going for a restricted licence, and another when going for a full licence. 

“It’s also expensive, with the full process from learner to full licence costing a minimum of $362.50 in fees.

"The Government is proposing changes to the driver licensing system to make the process for getting a full driver licence more accessible, efficient and affordable.

“The main change is to remove the requirement for a person on their restricted licence to do a practical driving test when going for their full licence. The full licence test currently costs $98.90 to book.

“Internationally, we are an outlier in requiring a practical driving test when going from a restricted licence to full. Other countries such as Australia require those on restricted licences to have longer learner periods, reduced demerit thresholds, or mandatory practice hours.

“We’re proposing new safety measures, including:

- requiring drivers on their restricted licence to keep a clean driving record to progress to their full licence, for 18 months for under-25s – or 12 months if they complete an advanced driving course – with a zero tolerance for any driving offence
- halving the demerit threshold for learner and restricted drivers, meaning they can have their licence suspended if they reach 50 demerit points, as opposed to the current threshold of 100 demerit points
- introducing a zero-alcohol limit for learner and restricted drivers of any age, as well the current zero limit for everyone under 20 years

“NZTA will also look at introducing a hazard perception test at the end of the learner stage.

“These measures are designed to encourage safe driving from these drivers while they gain experience behind the wheel. 

“We’re also proposing to reduce the frequency of eyesight tests for drivers. 

“At present, drivers are required to undergo an eyesight test before their learner, restricted and full driving tests. This means some people end up having their vision tested three times between age 16 and 18, while a person aged over 25 going through the process to get their driver licence can have their vision tested three times in just nine months. 

“Evidence suggests there is little safety benefit from this repeated eyesight testing. Instead, we propose that people would still need to have their vision tested when they apply for their first licence, and when they first renew their licence after they turn 45. At other times people would need to declare that their vision has not deteriorated.

“We are not proposing changes to eyesight testing for heavy vehicle licences or endorsements, or for people over 75 years.

“Any changes to the driver licensing system would be implemented in July 2026. Until the new system is in place, people will need to follow the current requirements for their licence.

“We believe our proposals strike the right balance between making it easier to progress through the system and maintaining road safety.”

Consultation on the proposed changes to the Graduated Driver Licensing System opens on 14 April and will close on 9 June 2025.
