Transport and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop will travel to Sydney today to further promote New Zealand’s infrastructure investment opportunities following the NZ Infrastructure Investment Summit last month.

“The Government has signalled that New Zealand is open for business and going for economic growth. In Sydney I will present a New Zealand Government Infrastructure Investment update to the International Project Finance Association, highlighting the range of upcoming investment opportunities across New Zealand’s infrastructure pipeline,” Mr Bishop says.

“I will attend the 2025 National Infrastructure Awards dinner, hosted by Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, and host an NZTE Investors Roundtable lunch with a range of major potential investors in New Zealand.

“While there I will also visit a range of transport projects, including the WestConnex toll road, and the Paramatta Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) programme. All of these projects offer lessons for New Zealand as we embark on our ambitious transport investment programme.”

Mr Bishop leaves for Sydney today and will conclude his visit on Friday 2 May.
