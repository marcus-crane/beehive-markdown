Veterans Minister and Associate Defence Minister Chris Penk will visit Niue this week to honour the contribution of Niuean service personnel to New Zealand and the Pacific on Anzac Day.

“New Zealand shares a deep and enduring partnership with Niue in defence and security, forged through joint service and sacrifice in times of war,” Mr Penk says.

“It is a privilege to be invited to attend the official Anzac Day commemorations in Alofi, to join in remembering the brave service personnel no longer with us and to acknowledge Niue’s continued efforts in supporting peace and stability for our people.

“During the First World War, around 150 Niuean men volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), serving in the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion. For a nation of 4,000 people, this was a remarkable commitment — and a testament to their courage and sense of duty.

“At least 15 Niuean soldiers died in service. Their sacrifice is etched into our shared history and will always be remembered by New Zealand.

“In the Second World War, Niuean men served as coast watchers, helping to safeguard the Pacific during some of its most precarious moments. Their quiet vigilance was critical to regional security.

“The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) is continuing to identify Niuean coast watchers, so that we may properly recognise their service, including efforts to match names to photographs taken on Raoul Island. The first two commemorative plaques are already underway.

“During my visit, I will also meet with Niue’s Prime Minister Hon. Dalton Tagelagi, whom I was pleased to have met recently in Wellington, and his Cabinet. I am also looking forward to attending a village dawn service to experience the community spirit that is integral to the Niuean way of life.

“Our relationship with Niue is anchored in this legacy of service and continues today through the ongoing dedication of Niueans in the New Zealand Defence Force."

Mr Penk departs on Thursday 24 April and will return to New Zealand on Saturday 26 April. He will be accompanied by the NZDF Joint Forces Commander, Major General Rob Krushka.
