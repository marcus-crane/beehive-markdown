Regulations that will soon allow podiatrists to prescribe certain medicines have been approved, giving patients with painful foot and leg conditions better access to healthcare, Health Minister Simeon Brown has announced.

“Enabling podiatrists to be able to prescribe medicines is all part of our Government’s commitment to ensuring Kiwis have access to timely, quality healthcare in their communities,” Mr Brown says.

“Podiatrists play a critical role in managing a range of conditions affecting feet and lower limbs, including symptoms of chronic health conditions like diabetes, which impact many New Zealanders.

“New regulations will give podiatrists the authority to prescribe medicines relating to their role, enabling patients to have more direct access to the medicines for these conditions.

“This means podiatrists will join other health professions that have designated prescriber rights, including specially trained nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists. Medicines will include some oral painkillers and oral antibiotics, and some topical antifungals, topical steroids, and local anaesthetics.

“Podiatrists usually work in community and rural settings. They are particularly important for helping manage diabetes or health conditions of older people, as people with diabetes and older people are vulnerable to nerve and circulation problems, both of which can lead to foot and leg sores and infections.

“These changes will allow podiatrists to prescribe medicines directly, so patients can access the treatments they need without requiring extra GP appointments for the same condition.

“The Government has also recently announced changes to prescriber regulations to give nurse practitioners and other professions increased prescribing rights within their scope of practice.

“By expanding access to medicines and enabling health professionals to get on with their jobs, we can make it easier and quicker for people to get the care they need in their communities, closer to home,” Mr Brown says.
