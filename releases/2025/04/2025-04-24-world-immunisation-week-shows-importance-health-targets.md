World Immunisation Week, celebrated in the last week of April, is an opportunity for parents and caregivers to ensure their children are up to date with their immunisations, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“High immunisation coverage is critical to protect not only the health of individuals, but the community from the spread of preventable diseases.

“This week is an opportunity to emphasise our focus on childhood immunisation and achieving our target of 95 per cent of children aged 24 months being fully immunised.

“We know that immunisation for both children and their parents and families is one of the best tools we have to protect Kiwi kids from serious illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) and measles.

“Last month, a Taranaki healthcare provider hit 100 per cent for all enrolled children under eight months of age. This is an incredible achievement, and one that we want to see replicated around the country.”

The recent spread of measles internationally has highlighted the importance of ensuring Kiwis are vaccinated against the disease.

“A measles outbreak in New Zealand would mean kids off school, in hospital and, as we’ve seen overseas, could cost some children their lives,” Mr Brown says.

“Raising the country’s childhood immunisation rates is a priority for this Government. High rates of immunisation are a safe and effective way to better protect New Zealanders from disease, including measles, and saves lives.”

Results released in the second quarter 2024/25 earlier this show more children are now fully immunised, with 77 per cent of two-year-olds being immunised in the second quarter of this year, up from 75.7 per cent in the previous quarter.
