Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters will travel to New Caledonia later this week.

“This visit comes at an important moment in New Caledonia’s history and reinforces New Zealand’s commitment to being a constructive partner in the region for both New Caledonia and France,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Peters will meet the French Minister for Overseas Territories, Manuel Valls, and the President of the Government of New Caledonia, Alcide Ponga.

“We are looking forward to meeting the new leadership of the Government of New Caledonia and continuing New Zealand’s warm and long-standing relationship with France.

“New Zealand wants to listen, learn and support New Caledonia’s pathway forward as a neighbour and fellow member of the Pacific Islands Forum.”

Mr Peters will also visit the Pacific Community (SPC), a leading science and technical agency in the Pacific, and meet with Director-General Dr Stuart Minchin.

This will be Mr Peters’ third visit to New Caledonia, following previous visits in 2018 and 2024. 

Mr Peters departs New Zealand on Thursday 1 May and returns on Friday 2 May.
