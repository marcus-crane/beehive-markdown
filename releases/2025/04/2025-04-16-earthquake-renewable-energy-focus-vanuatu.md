New Zealand is boosting support to Vanuatu to recover from last year’s earthquake and develop its renewable energy sector, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says.

“Being in Port Vila has underlined the scale of the challenge that Vanuatu faces in recovering from the December earthquake, and we are pleased to provide a further NZ$10 million of support.” 

“New Zealand will work with the Vanuatu Government over coming weeks to identify priority areas to focus our efforts,” Mr Peters says. 

“This support will draw on our experience of preparing for, and responding to, major earthquakes through the provision of geotechnical, engineering, and local government response advice, as well as reconstruction.

“We are also pleased to announce that New Zealand will lead on a renewable energy project on Efate and Tanna — focused on solar photo-voltaic and battery energy storage systems. Working with France, the project will help reduce fuel import costs, and provide for cleaner, more efficient energy use.” 

While in Port Vila, the New Zealand cross-party delegation met Prime Minister Jotham Napat, the new Vanuatu Government, as well as members of Vanuatu’s Opposition.

“We had productive discussions, highlighting the muti-faceted nature of our engagement, as neighbours and as development and regional partners,” Mr Peters says. 

“Our visit also reinforced our shared interest in a safe, secure, and peaceful Pacific.”.

The delegation attended the completion ceremony of the South Paray Wharf, an important economic project delivered with Vanuatu and the Asian Development Bank.

Vanuatu is the New Zealand delegation’s fourth and final destination on this Pacific trip, following Tonga, Hawaii and Fiji.
