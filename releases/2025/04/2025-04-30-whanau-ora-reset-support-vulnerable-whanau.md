The Government is backing four new community-based Whānau Ora commissioning agencies to ensure whānau with significant needs continue to benefit from the best possible support services.

Whānau Ora Minister Tama Potaka today announced the following agencies will take-over the commissioning of services from July 2025:

- National Hauora Coalition, Te Tiratū and Ngaa Pou Hauora o Taamaki Makaurau Consortium operating as Rangitāmiro, which will commission Whānau Ora services in the North Island, down to Taupō.
- Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira, which will commission Whānau Ora services in the North Island, south of Taupō and east to Bay of Plenty and the East Coast.
- Te Tauraki Limited, a subsidiary of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, which will commission Whānau Ora services in the South Island.
- The Cause Collective, operating as The Tātou Collective, which will commission Whānau Ora services for Pasifika families across Aotearoa.

“These agencies will ensure Whānau Ora care and support continues for thousands of whānau across the country whether it’s help accessing better healthcare, improving home budgeting to help ease the cost of living, or getting on top of household maintenance.

“Since Whānau Ora was launched in 2010, the model has grown to provide a strong foundation to now further improve services. National backed the development of Whānau Ora in last year’s Budget with a $182 million investment.

“Te Puni Kōkiri has carefully selected these agencies to deliver on the Government’s focus on providing better public services. The agencies will:

- Introduce greater participation from local communities in decision-making.
- Expand the reach of Whānau Ora to engage with more whānau most in need across Aotearoa New Zealand.
- Gather data to strengthen evidence of positive outcomes for whānau and targeted support for whānau in greatest need.
- Invest in the workforce to develop the capability and retention of Navigator kaimahi working with whānau.

“I also welcome the recent Court of Appeal decision - *Te Pou Matakana Limited v Secretary for Māori Development and others 2025* - which cleared the way for this progress,” Mr Potaka says.

“The case unsuccessfully challenged aspects of the procurement process – it wasted time and created uncertainty for whānau and service providers. The delay means that the move to new commissioning agencies will be more complex than necessary but, with the Court’s decision now made, we can move forward with certainty.

“I’d like to acknowledge and thank the outgoing commissioning agencies: Te Pou Matakana, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu, and Pasifika Futures for their mahi over the past decade to implement the important kaupapa of Whānau Ora,” Mr Potaka says.
