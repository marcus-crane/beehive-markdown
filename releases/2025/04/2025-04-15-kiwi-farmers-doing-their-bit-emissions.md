New figures released today confirm that New Zealand farmers are on track to meet the target of a 10 percent reduction in biogenic methane emissions by 2030 Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says. 

“New Zealand farmers are among the most carbon-efficient food producers in the world and these latest results further demonstrate that Labour’s failed He Waka Eke Noa was not needed, and that we were right to take agriculture out of the Emissions Trading Scheme,” Mr McClay says. 

New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (1990-2023) shows there was a further 2 per cent drop in agricultural emissions in 2023, supporting the government’s projections showing methane to be on track to reduce emissions by 10.1% by 2030. 

“This is a step in the right direction; however, New Zealand cannot afford to reduce emissions through the planting of food producing land or further reduction of stock numbers,” Mr McClay says.

“That is why we are introducing legislation this year to restrict full farm to forest conversions and instead support agricultural methane reduction through a $400m commitment to science and innovation. 

“The primary sector is responsible for 360,000 jobs and contributes $58 billion each year to the New Zealand economy through exports. 

“This latest emissions reduction was achieved without Labour’s proposed taxes or a price on methane and I would like to thank our farmers for their hard work and commitment to innovations. 

“The Government is committed to meeting New Zealand’s climate obligations without closing down farms or sending jobs and production overseas,” Mr McClay says.
