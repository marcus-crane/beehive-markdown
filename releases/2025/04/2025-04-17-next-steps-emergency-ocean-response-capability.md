The Government is considering next steps on developing an emergency ocean response capability and has contracted ocean-going tugboat ‘MMA Vision’ to provide assurance in the meantime, Minister of Transport Chris Bishop says.

Last year Cabinet directed the Ministry of Transport and Maritime New Zealand to develop a business case that considers options to improve New Zealand's maritime emergency ocean response capability, with a focus on the Cook Strait.

“The Detailed Business Case recommends a “two-strike” solution. This would comprise a locally based (in the Cook Strait area) “first-strike” capability dedicated to quickly reaching and stabilising a stricken vessel in the Cook Strait, and a regionally based (for example, Port Taranaki) “second-strike” capability that could tow any stricken vessel in New Zealand back to port.

“Solutions would be procured by Maritime NZ as a service by entering into retainer contracts with commercial providers. The Crown would not directly purchase or own a vessel.

“There have been 23 maritime incidents over the last five years where ready access to an emergency ocean response capability may have supported the response. However, it is worth noting that all these incidents were resolved with existing capabilities and vessels of opportunity, with most occurring outside the Cook Strait area. 

“There have been several notable incidents in the Cook Strait area, including the *Kaitaki* loss of power (January 2023), *Shiling* loss of power (April 2023), *Aratere* grounding (June 2024), and *Connemara* loss of power (September 2024). The *Connemara* incident is the only clear example that a Cook Strait based first-strike capability would have improved the response.

“The latest analysis also indicates the cost of a two-strike solution is significantly higher than initially thought.

“The Government has decided to continue to explore procuring an emergency ocean response capability, on a predominantly user-pays basis. We are interested in testing the willingness of users (public and industry) to pay a levy to fund a permanent response capability. I have instructed officials to provide me with advice on the most effective approach and expect to hear back in the middle of the year.

“To provide assurance while a long-term solution is worked through, the Government has contracted the services of ocean-going tugboat ‘MMA Vision’ through to June 2026. The tug is expected to arrive in Wellington tomorrow and will be based between the Cook Strait area and Taranaki.”
