Chris Swasbrook has been appointed as Chair of the Te Papa Board says Chris Bishop, Acting Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage.

“Chris Swasbrook is a prominent New Zealand investor with more than 25 years’ experience working in finance. He has an extensive resume in executive and governance roles in many large-scale New Zealand businesses and organisations,” Mr Bishop says.

“Born in Auckland, he has been a long-time supporter of local business and arts communities. Chris is Chair of the Auckland Future Fund and an Inaugural Member and current Chair of the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki Advisory Committee – roles which have shown his commitment to thriving arts infrastructure in New Zealand.

“Chris will bring valuable commercial, financial and investment governance experience to Te Papa. His strategic insights and international perspective will undoubtedly prove valuable to our national museum.

“I would like to thank Jackie Lloyd who has stepped up as acting Chair following the departure of Hon Dame Fran Wilde. Both Jackie and Dame Fran have made immense contributions to the leadership of Te Papa which have enhanced the museum’s standing on the world stage.”
