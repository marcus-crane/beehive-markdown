Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has completed a successful three-day visit to the United Kingdom, where he met with His Majesty King Charles III and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

“The UK is one of New Zealand’s most trusted partners, and I had a hugely productive day with Prime Minister Starmer,” Mr Luxon says.

The two leaders released a Joint Statement in which they pledged to do more to ensure the partnership remains robust in a rapidly changing world.

“Prime Minister Starmer and I underlined our commitment to the international rules-based system. We also talked about boosting bilateral trade and investment, especially while the global economy is under such extreme pressure."

“Export growth will be critical to improving our economic prospects in the coming years so our businesses can create more jobs and lift incomes for Kiwis.

“Our free trade agreement provides New Zealand business with certainty of access to the high-value UK market where we have enjoyed export growth of more than 20 per cent in the last year.”

Mr Luxon also hosted an investment roundtable with British business leaders to promote New Zealand as open for business.

“Building on the success of our international investment summit earlier in the year, I continued to make the case for New Zealand as a place to invest, so we can get infrastructure built and grow our businesses to put more money in Kiwis’ pockets.

“During my visit to London I also witnessed a number of commercial deals between UK and New Zealand companies, worth more than $120 million.”

The Prime Ministers agreed to refresh the Joint Statement on Defence Cooperation to ensure the partnership can respond to today’s global challenges.

Mr Luxon also announced New Zealand will extend the deployment of NZDF personnel to the UK and Europe to train Ukrainian soldiers until December 2026.

Mr Luxon visited some of those soldiers, met with representatives of the UK Government, the Leader of the Opposition and New Zealand and UK businesses.

He now travels to Türkiye where he will attend Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli before going on to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis.
