The Government is delivering on its commitment to make freshwater farm plans more practical and affordable, Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Associate Environment Minister Andrew Hoggard announced today.

“We’re cutting the cost and complexity out of the system,” Mr Hoggard says.

“Cabinet has agreed to progress improvements, meeting a key commitment in our Q1 Action Plan.

Ministers have agreed to reduce the number of farms required to have a plan and to take a risk-based approach to certification. Plans will still manage environmental impacts, but without unnecessary red tape, and they won’t be required for small blocks.

“Farm plans are useful tools, but they must be practical and matched to actual environmental risk.”

Officials are working with industry, sector groups, and councils to finalise improvements through updated regulations.

Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says the Government paused the rollout last year to make room for these changes.

“We’re recognising existing industry programmes that achieve equivalent environmental outcomes, farmers shouldn’t have to complete multiple plans.

“The new system will also act as an alternative to local council rules and consents where appropriate, allowing landowners to meet requirements in a way that suits their farm systems.”

The improvements are being progressed through the Government’s RMA reform process and are expected to be in place by the end of the year.

“These changes reflect our shift from a precautionary to a more permissive, risk-based approach, ensuring landowners can use their property more freely, while protecting the environment and their rights.”

“We’re moving quickly to reduce costs and unlock productivity across the primary sector.”
