More than 2,000 additional Jobseekers found work in the first three months of 2025 than in the same period last year, statistics Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston describes as “cautiously encouraging.”

Quarterly benefit numbers released by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) today show more than 23,000 clients receiving a main benefit found employment in the March 2025 quarter – an increase of 2,421 people, or 11.6 percent on the same period last year.\**

Other key indicators released this morning show:

- Consecutive decreases in the number of people on benefit for three months in a row, from January 2025 through to March 2025.
- The number of people receiving Jobseeker Support reducing by almost 3,500 people from December 2024 to March 2025.

“While encouraged by these figures, I’m also taking a cautious approach as our Government continues to drive for economic and job growth in a challenging global and domestic environment,” Louise Upston says. 

“We must consider Jobseeker improvement alongside figures showing that the number of people on a main benefit is higher than it was in the March 2024 quarter, following increases throughout 2024. 

“I am however particularly encouraged by the work of MSD staff over recent months.  One of the drivers behind the increased number of people moving into work is MSD’s ’s heightened focus on employment. 

“MSD frontline staff are doing a great job engaging proactively with Jobseekers, informing them not only of the obligations and sanctions we’ve introduced under the traffic light system, but also the supports available to help New Zealanders find work.

“This one-on-one intensive prep for the job market can only help more people back into work.

“We know the faster we can help beneficiaries – especially young people – find sustainable employment, the better the outcomes for them, their families, our communities, and our economy.

“Our Government has introduced more early intervention for young beneficiaries through a new phone-based employment case management service, we’ve got 2,100 more places for young people to get community job coaching, more regular work seminars, and a traffic light system to help them stay on track with their obligations.

“The new Relocate for Work Support payment will also make it easier for people to move to take up sustainable employment. 

“All of these initiatives are helping on the frontline, and that matters because  ‘work’ is about more than money. It also gives people a sense of purpose, independence, connectedness – leading to a better future and helping families break out of the cycle of inter-generational welfare dependence.

“We know there will be more to do, but these figures indicate what a difference strong interventions can make,” Louise Upston says.
