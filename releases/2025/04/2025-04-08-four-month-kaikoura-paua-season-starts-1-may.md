The Kaikōura pāua fishery will open to recreational pāua-gathering for a four-month season from 1 May, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“I’m very pleased to be able to open this treasured fishery for a longer season this year, which is possible due to the continuing recovery of the pāua stock.

“This recovery is thanks to careful management, and the ongoing commitment by Kaikōura locals to their fishery.”

The season will run until 31 August and, subject to ongoing discussion with the Kaikōura Marine Guardians, iwi, and the community, these dates will also apply for future seasons, giving people certainty about when the fishery will be open. 

“The Kaikōura pāua population was heavily impacted by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, which caused significant damage to pāua habitat along the coastline,” Mr Jones says.

“We have made major strides in the recovery of the pāua stock, and I’m committed to ensuring this continues, which is why I decided to [increase the minimum legal size](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/snapper-catch-limits-orange-roughy-down) for recreationally caught pāua. 

“The new size limit means people can take pāua only if they are 130mm or bigger. This will help improve the population by providing more time for pāua to spawn. This also aligns with a higher size limit implemented by commercial fishers.”

The daily bag limit is three pāua per species from Marfells Beach to Conway River with a minimum size of 130mm for blackfoot pāua and 80mm for yellowfoot pāua. When gathering over multiple days, there is a maximum accumulation of two daily limits.

Some areas remain closed including the Hikurangi marine reserve, Waiopuka (Wakatu Quay) rāhui, three mātaitai, and a taiāpure. The Oaro-Haumuri Taiāpure will be open for the season but has lower daily limits and a bigger minimum size.

Fishery Officers will be checking catch to make sure all fishers are following the rules. More information can be found on [MPI’s website](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/fishing-aquaculture/recreational-fishing/fishing-rules/kaikoura-fishing-rules/).
