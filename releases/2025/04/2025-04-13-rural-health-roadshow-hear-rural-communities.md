Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health and Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey announced today he will be coming to 12 rural locations across the country on a Rural Health Roadshow, starting this week in Levin.

“All New Zealanders deserve timely access to quality health care and this Government is committed to improving health and mental health outcomes, particularly for the one in five living in our rural communities,” Mr Doocey says.

“The Rural Health Strategy was published in 2023 and sets the direction for improving the health of people who live in rural communities. The rural health road show is an opportunity for me to hear from the public and those working in rural health about how well the strategy is being implemented.

“We know access to health care within rural communities, or being supported to access care when required, are key issues for rural communities. That’s why I want to hear from our rural communities who are accessing health care services directly about what’s working well and what’s not, I also want to hear from those who are working in rural health.”

Some initiatives are already in train. Late last year, the Government provided accreditation to Te Tai o Poutini West Coast to deliver Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine Training and awarded scholarships to 27 health care students to boost the future rural health workforce.

The Government is also improving access to primary care including access to 24/7 digital care, training more new doctors and investing to increase the number of nurses in primary care. Primary care providers will receive up to $20,000 per nurse employed in rural areas.

“We are prioritising rural communities as part of Health New Zealand’s roll out of Integrated Primary Mental Health and Addiction Services. It’s about bringing mental health and addiction support in over 400 general practices across the country,” Mr Doocey says.

“Early feedback I have received so far from rural health agencies is that they are keen to be involved in the roadshow, and they appreciate the opportunity for the voices of rural communities to be heard.
