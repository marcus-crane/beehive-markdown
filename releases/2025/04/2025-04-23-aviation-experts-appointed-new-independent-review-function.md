Three experts have been appointed as independent reviewers, making it easier and more affordable for New Zealanders to operate in the aviation sector, Acting Transport Minister James Meager says. 

Mr Meager today announced the appointment of Kevin Short, Rob MacGregor and Ashok Poduval as the three reviewers for the new independent review function for aviation decisions.

“All three appointees are highly skilled professionals, with decades of aviation and leadership experience between them across both the public sector and the private sector,” Mr Meager says.

“Kevin Short offers extensive leadership and experience in assessing and testing highly technical information. He is the former Chief of Defence Force and was previously a senior officer within the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

“Rob MacGregor brings 50 years of aviation experience within New Zealand and internationally, including former roles as Chief Executive of Texel Air and as an airworthiness inspector for the CAA New Zealand and Qatar.

**“**Ashok Poduval is a highly experienced aviation professional who has served as Chief Executive of the Massey University School of Aviation since 2005 and was most recently the President of the Aviation Industry Association.

The independent review function was established by the Civil Aviation Act which came into force on 5 April 2025. Independent reviewers have recommendatory powers, with the Director of Civil Aviation having final decision rights.

The reviewers have been appointed for three-year terms, expiring on 31 March 2028. 

“The new function offers opportunities that will make it easier and more affordable for aviation sector participants in New Zealand to access fair outcomes and challenge decisions that have a significant impact on their livelihoods, such as cancelling or suspending a pilot’s licence,” Mr Meager says.

“The independent review function provides an alternative option for people wanting to appeal an aviation decision through the courts and is intended to enhance transparency and accountability within the aviation regulatory framework.

“Being able to have decisions reviewed independently will now mean those people won’t incur these costs and delays, and they’ll have the opportunity for a quick, cost-effective determination.”

“I look forward to seeing how this new independent review function will support people in their careers and in their involvement in aviation in our country.”
