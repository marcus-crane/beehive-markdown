A major drive boosting New Zealand as an international travel destination will kick off with a $13.5 million turbocharge for global marketing activity, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has announced. 

“We’re a Government relentlessly focused on growing the economy so Kiwis can get ahead. All the stats show tourism will play a leading role as that growth continues,” Louise Upston says.

“Today I’m delighted to announce a $13.5 million investment for Tourism New Zealand to encourage more international visitors across multiple markets.

“Encouraging more visitors means more people staying in our hotels, eating in our cafés, spending in our shops and visiting our attractions, creating jobs and driving economic growth.

“The initial investment will include a focus on encouraging visitors from China, Australia, the United States, India, Germany and South Korea. In these countries and beyond there are millions of people actively considering coming here and experiencing all New Zealand has to offer. 

“We know international marketing works, with around 14 per cent of international holiday visitors already being directly influenced by Tourism NZ’s marketing activity. 

“We want to grow that influence. Our international visitor spending and visitor numbers have been rebuilding strongly, and we must make the most of that momentum. 

“The $13.5 million announced today is estimated to result in more than 23,000 additional international visitors and spending an extra $100 million across the country. 

“That will be a major boost, not just for tourism and hospitality providers, but in regions and communities throughout the country.

“We have encouraging signs coming through from our ‘Everyone Must Go!’ campaign focused on Australia, but we won’t stop there.

“2025 is our chance to reinforce the value of tourism and show what our humming, vibrant country has on show. New Zealand tourism is open for business. 

“We already know our country has so much going for it. Now we need the global marketing to push that story even wider,” Louise Upston says.

Specific campaigns will be announced as they continue to be developed during 2025.
