Councils from regions severely impacted by the 2023 North Island Severe Weather Events continue to make steady progress repairing transport routes and building future flood resilience for their communities, Emergency Management and Recovery Minister, Mark Mitchell says.

“As at the end of February 2025, Auckland, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay councils have stabilised 1,125 slips, repaired 25 local bridges and completed 51 km of stop banks.

“The Crown cost-share agreements with these councils provided more than $1.6 billion for the council-led Category 3 residential property buyouts, flood risk mitigation and local transport projects.

“The Government recently approved plans for the final three projects, bringing the total number of approved projects to 54,” says Mr Mitchell.

“I would like to acknowledge the considerable work councils in Hawke’s Bay, Tairāwhiti and Auckland have done to prepare Delivery Plans for these projects.

“Some of these projects have required significant programmes of work involving multiple workstreams, and I am conscious that councils have also been delivering other aspects of their region’s recovery.

“Many of the flood mitigation projects are technically complex, and councils have taken time to plan and consult with impacted communities to balance the level of protection with minimising the impact on properties before deciding on the final design.

“Completing the flood mitigation projects, which are part funded by the councils, will reduce the risk of future flooding, allowing many impacted properties to move from Category 2C. This will mean many people can continue living on their property with greater confidence.

“Progressing the flood risk mitigation projects and repairing roads and bridges will make a considerable difference for impacted communities and will support growth in these regions.”

Combined, the total cost of the flood risk mitigation and local transport projects is $1,050 million of which the Crown is funding $907 million.
