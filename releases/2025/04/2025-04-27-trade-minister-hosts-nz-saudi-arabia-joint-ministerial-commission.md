Minister for Trade and Investment Hon Todd McClay will today welcome Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, His Excellency Eng Abdulrahman A. AlFadley, to New Zealand. 

Minister AlFadley is leading a delegation of more than 35 senior Saudi officials and business people to Auckland for the 9th New Zealand–Saudi Arabia Joint Ministerial Commission—a key platform for advancing trade and economic ties between the two countries.

“The hosting of this Joint Commission in New Zealand reflects the strong momentum in our relationship with Saudi Arabia and the broader Gulf region, particularly following the successful conclusion of negotiations for the New Zealand-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement late last year,” Mr McClay says.

“In a time of global uncertainty, the Government is focused on opening doors for Kiwi exporters and providing greater certainty for New Zealand businesses.

lf’s largest economy and one of our top export markets, with exports reaching $1.14 billion last year, Saudi Arabia presents significant opportunities for Kiwi businesses through the NZ-GCC FTA.”

Alongside the Commission, the Ministers will participate in business outreach focused on agriculture, technology, and digital innovation.

“This visit provides a valuable opportunity to profile world-class Kiwi exporters and highlight investment opportunities in New Zealand’s fast-growing tech sectors,” Mr McClay says.

The Joint Ministerial Commission and business programme will run from 28–30 April in Auckland.
