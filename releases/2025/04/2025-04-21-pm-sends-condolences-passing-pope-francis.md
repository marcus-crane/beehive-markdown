Prime Minister Christopher Luxon today expressed the Government’s condolences to the Holy See and to Roman Catholics in New Zealand and around the world on the passing of Pope Francis. 

“It is a time of great sorrow for all those who have admired Pope Francis’ compassion and humility,” Mr Luxon says. 

“Pope Francis was the first Pope from the Southern Hemisphere. He will be remembered for his unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice, and to interfaith dialogue. 

“My thoughts are with Roman Catholics and all those who mourn his death.” 

Note: 

- Formal messages from the Prime Minister  and Minister of Foreign Affairs will be sent to the Holy See and to the Catholic Church in New Zealand.
- The Prime Minister has asked that, as is protocol, flags flying on public buildings should be lowered to half-mast tomorrow, Wednesday and the day of the Pope's funeral.
- A decision on New Zealand representation at Pope Francis’ funeral will be made once details of these arrangements have become clear.
