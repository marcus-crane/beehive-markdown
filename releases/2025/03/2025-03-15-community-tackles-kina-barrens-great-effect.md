More than 8000 kina have already been removed from Matheson Bay/Te Kohuroa north of Auckland under a special permit issued to deal with the problem of kina barrens, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative’s work removing the kina is a powerful example of a community protecting its local marine habitat.

“It was the first group to be approved for the [new permit introduced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-tools-announced-tackle-kina-barrens) in October last year to deal with the problem of kina barrens, and they have used it to great effect.”

Four community-led events so far have resulted in more than 8000 kina harvested and culled. More events are planned.

“The mahi is already paying off. [Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative](https://www.tekohuroarewilding.org/) has observed that kina are not coming back in large numbers to areas that have been cleared, and kelp is beginning to grow in previously barren spots,” Mr Jones says.

“The restoration of kelp forests is crucial in restoring coastal environments that support biodiversity.”

The group is working with Ngāti Manuhiri, the University of Auckland Reef team, and the Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust to design and facilitate its programme to restore the marine ecosystem at Matheson Bay/Te Kohuroa. 

“This is exactly what I wanted to see when I introduced the special permit. These activities demonstrate the power local communities can have when given the right tools. It’s also a great opportunity for new generations to take part in community projects, become interested in their local environment, and develop new skills,” Mr Jones says.

“I congratulate Te Kohuroa Rewilding Initiative and all the volunteers who have come together to have such a positive impact on the marine environment they care about.”
