The Pastoral Sector Group (PSG) has held its first meeting, discussing farm emissions.

The group consists of Agriculture, Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay, Climate Change Minister Simon Watts, and Chairs and CEOs from: Beef + Lamb New Zealand, Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand, Dairy NZ, Deer Industry New Zealand, Federated Farmers, and the Meat Industry Association.

**Pasture Sector**

Sector representatives contributed perspectives on the current state of the industry and a desire to work constructively toward a positive outcome for the rural sector.

They underlined the significant eﬀort made by farmers to date. 

They stressed the need for any consideration of emissions reduction to be based upon science and to be solutions driven. 

They stressed the need to revise the domestic methane target based on the principle of no additional warming. 

They stressed the need for any solutions to be aﬀordable for farmers; and for the need to avoid imposing costs upon industry and government. 

They voiced concerns about the eﬀects afforestation was having on the pastoral sector and welcomed the Government’s recent announcement to restrict farm to forest conversions. 

They raised concerns about the negative impact that a price on agricultural emissions would have on production. 

They stressed the need for certainty and time for the primary sector.

**Government**

Ministers reiterated that this group was to allow the sector to provide their views to government directly and to engage in a respectful dialogue.

Ministers thanked the primary sector for their significant contribution to New Zealand, and in particular, the importance of a strong primary sector to the New Zealand economy.

They stressed that the PSG was an opportunity to talk openly and that it was not a decision-making body.

The members of the group agreed that New Zealand farmers are among the world’s most carbon-eﬃcient food producers and were willing to do their part for New Zealand’s overall commitment to reduce emissions.

**Ministers confirmed the following:**

01. That the Government has removed agriculture from the Emissions Trading Scheme.
02. That the Government has disbanded He Waka Eka Noa.

06. That the Government is committed to meeting New Zealand’s climate obligations without closing down farms or sending jobs and production overseas.
07. That all decisions in respect to farm emissions will be informed by accepted science.
08. That the Government is mindful of the impact of costs related to emissions reduction on farmers; and the implications that cost could have for production.
09. That a revised 2050 biogenic methane target will be set this year.
10. That the Government is committed to the use of science and innovation to reduce emissions, not reducing on farm production.
11. That it is for New Zealand to decide how to reduce emissions.
12. That New Zealand has climate change obligations under some trade agreements and that the Government will be guided by domestic considerations and interests including those of New Zealand producers and the economy.
13. The Government currently has a plan that shows New Zealand can meet its obligations while growing the economy and without closing down farms or sending production or jobs overseas.
14. That the Government will continue to build confidence in the primary sector.

The PSG will meet again next month.
