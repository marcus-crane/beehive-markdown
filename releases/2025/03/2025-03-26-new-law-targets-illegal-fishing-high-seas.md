New Zealand’s fight against illegal fishing in the high seas has been boosted by new legislation which passed its third reading in Parliament today.

The Fisheries (International Fishing and Other Matters) Amendment Bill sets out stronger powers for the investigation of and action against suspected illegal fishing outside New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone. 

“Illegal fishing in the high seas hurts all countries by undercutting legitimate operators, distorting markets and impacting sustainability,” Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“These changes take a commonsense approach to the problem by strengthening our ability to fight illegal fishing outside our domestic waters and beefing up regulation for our own commercial fishers in international waters.”

Key changes include:

- Improving the regulation and permitting of New Zealand vessels fishing outside our waters.
- Strengthening New Zealand’s ability to combat IUU fishing by both New Zealand and foreign vessels.
- Clarifying and expanding the international fishing permitting regime for industry and decision-makers.
- Strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of action taken against fisheries violations.

“The Pacific Ocean provides food and economic opportunities for the countries in and around it. These changes will help ensure fisheries continue to thrive while protecting the livelihoods of fishing communities throughout New Zealand and the Pacific,” Mr Jones says.
