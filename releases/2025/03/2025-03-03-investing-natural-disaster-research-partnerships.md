The Government continues to invest in research which will deliver tangible benefits to New Zealanders, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti announced today. 

Three New Zealand research teams have been granted funding to partner with Japanese research organisations on projects that aim to make New Zealand more prepared and resilient when natural disasters strike.

“This Government is focused on putting funding where it will make the biggest difference. Natural disasters pose a significant risk in New Zealand – a good reminder of that is the recent elevation of alert levels at Whakaari White Island,” says Dr Reti. 

“Collaboration with like-minded nations and sharing research infrastructure enables our researchers to lead and participate in world-class science, innovation and technology that benefits New Zealand. 

“Building relationships with international partners is critical to developing a vibrant science and innovation sector, which is a core part of our plan to deliver economic growth.

“New Zealand and Japan share similar risks when it comes to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic activity. By working together in these projects, we can better understand risks and potential mitigate options for future events. 

“Working together with Japan also enables our researchers to access invaluable resources and experience such as their Marine Seismic Vessel *Research Vessel Kaimei*, proprietary modelling software, and access to structural laboratories. I look forward to seeing the outcomes of this research and the benefits it brings.” 

The University of Canterbury will work with Tohoku University on a structural retrofitting system to enhance the resilience of buildings in seismic events while reducing the cost of traditional retrofitting with a new modular infill system. 

GNS Science will work Japan’s National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) on tolerable levels of ashfall following volcanic events. 

GNS Science will also work with the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) for a seismic study of the Hikurangi subduction zone – New Zealand’s largest threat for tsunamis. 

The research teams will each receive $300,000 from the Government’s Catalyst Fund. Japanese research teams will receive equivalent funding from our Japanese partner – the Japan Science and Technology Agency.
