Minister for Pacific Peoples Dr Shane Reti says the Pacific language week series continues to celebrate our diverse Pacific languages, with exciting updates for 2025 and 2026, including the first-ever addition of Bislama, the national language of Vanuatu.

“Last year, the Pacific language week series saw an incredible response, with thousands of New Zealanders participating in events and activities,” says Dr Reti.

“From cultural performances and storytelling sessions to engaging social media campaigns viewed over 3 million times, the celebrations highlighted the powerful role language plays in connecting and inspiring communities.

“I have heard firsthand how important the language week series is to Pacific communities and how it affirms the relationships we have with Pacific island nations.

“Each community embraces their Pacific language week in unique ways. As they say in Bislama, wan toktok hem i neva enaf – one language is never enough. We’re excited to celebrate Bislama for the first time in 2025, bringing the total number of language weeks to 12 this year.

“I am also pleased to confirm the dates for 2025 and 2026 ahead of time, to reinforce our commitment to preserving these cultural treasures for future generations,” Dr Reti says.

The Ministry for Pacific Peoples invites all New Zealanders to embrace the Pacific language week series. Learning materials, online challenges, and tutorials will be available throughout the year, alongside events fostering cultural connection and understanding.
