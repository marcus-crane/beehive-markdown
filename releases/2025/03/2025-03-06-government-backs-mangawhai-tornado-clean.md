The Government has confirmed a $435,000 contribution from the Ministry for the Environment to support emergency waste clean-up after a recent tornado, say Environment Minister, Penny Simmonds and Emergency Management and Recovery Minister, Mark Mitchell.

“The Government recognises the significant challenge councils face in managing emergency waste from severe weather events and is committed to providing the necessary support,” says Ms Simmonds.

“This funding will assist the Kaipara District Council in managing the clean-up of emergency waste in Mangawhai and provide some relief to the community as they recover.” 

On Sunday 26 January 2025, a tornado struck the coastal township of Mangawhai in Northland resulting in serious injuries to several people, extensive damage to properties, power outages, and roads blocked by storm debris.

Following the event, Ministry for the Environment officials met with officials from both Kaipara District Council and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to identify, quantify and assess the costs associated with the tornado event.

“Recovery is an ongoing process, and we recognise the Kaipara District Council is working hard to strengthen resilience and support recovery in their community,” says Mr Mitchell. 

Ms Simmonds says Kaipara District Council acted quickly after the event to manage emergency waste responsibly.

“This funding will substantially cover the council’s costs from the tornado’s immediate aftermath, as well as helping with the ongoing clean up. The council will provide a final report within three months of project completion to outline how the funding was used.”
