Vocational Education Minister, Penny Simmonds, and Universities Minister, Dr Shane Reti, have announced two new appointments to the board of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

Mr Robin Hapi CNZM, and Mrs Sharon McGuire have been appointed as members of the TEC board until 31 October 2027.

“We would like to welcome both Robin and Sharon to the TEC Board, Ms Simmonds says.

“Robin is an experienced director and leader with a proven record across multiple boards under various governments. His commercial expertise, te ao Māori perspective and extensive knowledge of the education system, including wānanga, his tenure on the TEC Board (2007–2013), and university leadership experience, will greatly benefit the TEC.

“Sharon has a strong commercial background and knowledge of the polytechnic and broader tertiary sector as well as governance experience with several entities including the Nelson Tasman Chamber of Commerce.”

TEC leads the Government's relationship with the tertiary education sector and provides career services from education to employment.

“Each year, TEC invests over $3.3 billion in tertiary education and delivers quality career services that equip New Zealanders with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed,” Dr Reti says.

“The Chair vacancy is intended to be addressed this year. While recruitment for a permanent Chair is underway, we are working closely with the TEC Board on interim arrangements,” says Ms Simmonds.

“We would like to thank outgoing board member Vivien Sutherland Bridgwater MNZM for her contribution. We look forward to working with the new members as their term begins.”
