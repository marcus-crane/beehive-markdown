A new independent review function will enable individuals and organisations to seek an expert independent review of specified civil aviation regulatory decisions made by, or on behalf of, the Director of Civil Aviation, Acting Transport Minister James Meager has announced today.

“Today we are making it easier and more affordable for New Zealanders to challenge decisions that have a significant impact on their livelihoods, such as cancelling or suspending a pilot’s licence,” Mr Meager says.

“Until now, people have had to go to the courts to appeal a decision, a costly and time-consuming process. Being able to have decisions reviewed independently will now mean those people won’t incur these costs and delays, and they’ll have the opportunity for a quick, cost-effective determination so they can get on with delivering growth for New Zealand.”

The new review function will focus on the most impactful decisions that primarily relate to aviation documents. This includes granting or suspending pilot licences, air operator’s certificates, airworthiness certificates or maintenance engineer’s licences. It will also include decisions on individual exemptions from civil aviation regulations or rules.

The function will not review medical certification decisions, as these are already covered by the existing medical convener process.

Application fees for reviews, which will partially recover the costs for the new independent review function, are set at $1,000 (excl. GST) for individuals and $1,500 (excl. GST) in any other case (such as for organisations).

“In comparison, I’ve heard that it can cost in excess of $300,000 to take an appeal through the District Court and it can take 3 to 4 years before there is a hearing.

“I will soon be announcing the appointment of the independent reviewers who will be carrying out these reviews.”

The independent review function will become operational on 5 April 2025 when the Civil Aviation Act 2023 comes into force.
