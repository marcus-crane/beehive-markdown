The Government has agreed to progressively lower the age of eligibility for bowel cancer screening tests to align with Australia.

“Today, I am pleased to announce that we are taking the first step by lowering the age to 58, with redirected funding of $36 million over four years.

“This means free bowel screening will become available to all New Zealanders from the ages of 58 to 74,” Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Lowering the age of eligibility from 60 to 58 will see 122,000 Kiwis eligible for free tests in the first year and save hundreds of lives over the coming decades.

“This is the first significant step we are taking to align our screening rate for bowel cancer with Australia as funding and access to additional colonoscopy resource becomes available.

“The changes announced today are projected to prevent an additional 771 bowel cancers and an additional 566 bowel cancer deaths over the next 25 years.

“Advice from the Ministry of Health clearly states that lowering the age to 58 for all New Zealanders will save even more lives than the previous government’s approach to lower the age to 50 for Māori and Pacific Peoples only.

“Under our approach, we will be able to prevent 218 additional cancers and 176 additional deaths over 25 years in comparison to the settings proposed by the previous government.

“This also aligns with the Government’s policy of ensuring that healthcare is delivered on the basis of need.

“The evidence is clear: by delivering this first step for all New Zealanders, more lives will be saved.

“The Government has also approved additional funding for targeted initiatives that aim to increase screening rates among population groups with low rates. Improving early detection of bowel cancers can be lifesaving, and this significant investment will be a game-changer for under-screened populations.

“New Zealand has one of the highest rates of bowel cancer globally. Every year, more than 3,300 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in New Zealand. Tragically, more than 1,200 Kiwis die from the disease.

“We are committed to improving cancer detection and treatment for Kiwis. Last year we announced a $604 million uplift over four years to enable thousands more Kiwis to access life-saving cancer drugs.”

“We will continue to deliver better outcomes for people with cancer as a result of the changes announced today.

“By expanding eligibility for free bowel cancer screening tests, we will enable Kiwis to detect cancer earlier, undertake treatment, and ultimately save lives,” Mr Brown says.
