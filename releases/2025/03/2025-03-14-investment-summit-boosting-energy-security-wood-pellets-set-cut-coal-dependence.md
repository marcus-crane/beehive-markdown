Energy and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts is welcoming a Memorandum of Understanding by Genesis Energy and Carbona to produce torrefied wood pellets with the potential to replace coal with biomass at Huntly Power Station.

“This Memorandum of Understanding is an encouraging step towards affordable, secure and sustainable energy that supports economic growth,” Mr Watts says.

“Renewable, storable fuels like torrefied wood pellets are a promising alternative to coal that could keep the lights on in dry years while contributing towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

"The Government created the woody bioenergy taskforce as part of our Emissions Reduction Plan to encourage private investment into this market, including the potential for export.

"This MOU follows a similar agreement between Foresta and Genesis Energy in February, which shows growing momentum in the sector.

“This is a win-win for energy and the environment.

“Affordable, secure energy is a crucial part of the Government’s plan to grow the economy.

"I look forward to seeing Genesis and Carbona turn this agreement into action and developing this important new energy supply chain.
