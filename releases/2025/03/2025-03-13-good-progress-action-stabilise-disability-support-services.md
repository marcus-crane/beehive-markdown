Minister for Disability Issues Louise Upston is pleased with progress to stabilise the disability support system so it can deliver better outcomes for disabled people.

In August 2024, the Independent Review into disability support services made recommendations to stabilise services and provide a base for further work to strengthen them.

“Six months on, good progress is being made towards ensuring disabled people receive fair, consistent, and transparent services and supports,” Louise Upston says.

“In addition to running the nationwide community consultation process currently underway, DSS has also made progress in:

- Transferring Disability Support Services (DSS) and its supporting functions from the Ministry of Disabled People – Whaikaha to a branded business unit of MSD, while also ensuring continuity of services and care for disabled people.
- Completing a rapid review of residential contracts and developing a pricing model for residential care. This new model will provide simpler, credible pricing based on the current costs of care and enable DSS to sustainably forecast costs and needs into the future.
- Providing greater consistency across NASCs and Enabling Good Lives sites and ensuring they are prioritising those in highest need.
- Taking action to forecast expenditure and implement more fiscal discipline.
- Developing a monitoring function to support continuous quality improvements.

“Good progress has been made, but there is still work to do so the system is fair, equitable, transparent, and sustainable.

“The Taskforce will soon begin further work to strengthen disability support services, with more community engagement to come later this year,” Louise Upston says.
