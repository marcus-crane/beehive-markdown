Environment Minister Penny Simmonds today launched the Government’s strategy to reduce waste and improve how it’s managed in New Zealand.  

The strategy sets out the Government’s approach to reducing the environmental and economic harm caused by waste, Ms Simmonds says. 

“The Government is committed to working with the sector, business, iwi/Māori, local government and communities to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill, increase reuse and recycling, and ensure we have the right tools in place to better manage our country’s waste,” Ms Simmonds says.

Ms Simmonds says the Government has also confirmed its waste work programme to help achieve the strategy’s goals.

“One of our main priorities is to make sure New Zealand has waste legislation that gives us more options and flexibility to reduce and manage waste effectively and efficiently.

“As well as modernising our legislation, we’ll also make sure we’re investing the waste disposal levy to have the greatest impact. 

“Reducing waste emissions is another big goal, as well as making sure New Zealand has well-managed resource recovery and disposal facilities, and limiting the environmental harm caused by contaminated sites, including historic contamination.

“Following the launch of New Zealand’s first regulated product stewardship scheme, Tyrewise, we’ll continue work to bring in new industry-led schemes, enabling supply chains to take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products. Farm plastics and agrichemicals are our next focus, with support from key stakeholders in the agricultural sector.”

Ms Simmonds says changes to existing waste policies will support the strategy while minimising impacts on the cost of living.

“We’re reducing costs to ratepayers by leaving it up to councils to decide what kerbside waste collections they bring in and when. We’ll continue to support councils to introduce kerbside collections through the Waste Minimisation Fund.

“We’ve also removed the 2025 deadline for phasing out all PVC and polystyrene food and drink packaging, and will work with industry to make sure any further regulations are workable and provide enough time to switch to alternative packaging.”

Ms Simmonds says everyone has a role to play in reducing waste and waste emissions.
