The development of a dry dock and surrounding marine maintenance facilities at Marsden Point in Northland represents a substantial opportunity for investors looking for quality infrastructure investments, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“New Zealand is open for business, and we are looking for investors who want to support the delivery of this significant infrastructure asset. This is a unique opportunity to deliver what will be a landmark project - New Zealand’s only dry dock large enough to service our bigger Royal New Zealand Navy ships, commercial vessels such as the Cook Strait ferries, as well as international flagged ships,” Mr Jones says.

“This project will be a significant investment to upgrade and modernise infrastructure to support New Zealand’s maritime industry, create local jobs and enhance the country’s self-sufficiency in vessel maintenance and repair.

“This Coalition Government is focused on strengthening and growing our economy. Supporting strategic infrastructure projects such as the Northland dry dock is a key component of how we will do it,” Mr Jones says.

A Registration of Interest (ROI) has been issued by Kānoa on the [Government Electronic Tender Service (GETS).](https://www.gets.govt.nz/ExternalIndex.htm)

The ROI is seeking a partner with the capacity, capability, experience and project team that can deliver the project.

Responses are being sought from New Zealand and international organisations that are seeking large investment opportunities or can undertake some or all of the key components required to build the dry dock. They will need to have a proven track record in providing similar work or services on comparable projects domestically or internationally.

The process is expected to be in two stages, commencing with the ROI, followed by a second stage Request for Proposal (RFP) for shortlisted respondents.

The ROI process closes on 2 April 2025.
