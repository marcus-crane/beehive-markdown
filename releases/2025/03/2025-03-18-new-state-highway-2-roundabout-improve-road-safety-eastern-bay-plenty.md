The intersection of State Highway 2 (SH2) and Wainui Road in the Eastern Bay of Plenty will be made safer and more efficient for vehicles and freight with the construction of a new and long-awaited roundabout, says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

“The current intersection of SH2 and Wainui Road is on a sweeping bend with limited visibility. There were nine crashes at this intersection between 2014 and 2023, three of them were injury crashes, one of which was serious. Construction of a roundabout here will make a real difference to the safe and efficient travel of local road users,” Mr Bishop says.

“Delivering safe roading infrastructure that supports economic growth and productivity is a priority. SH2 between Ōpōtiki and Whakatāne is a main route for locals, tourists, and freight between Tauranga and Gisborne. Around 5,000 per day vehicles use SH2 between Ōpōtiki and Wainui Road, with 15 percent heavy vehicles.

“The 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme prioritises investment in road safety and efficiency by encouraging safer driving behaviour, vehicles and infrastructure. Funding is available for improvements at the highest-risk locations, which includes the intersection between SH2 and Wainui Road.

“The roundabout at SH2 and Wainui Road is expected to cost around $10 million from business case through to completion and will complement a raft of improvements already completed in the area, such as road widening, side barrier installation, and line marking.

“Construction is due to start in April and will take approximately 12 months to complete. Final costs for the roundabout will be confirmed once the contract is awarded this month.

“I want to thank the local community in advance for their patience as this important work to make SH2 safer is carried out, and I look forward to it being completed as soon as possible.”
