Katherine Rich and Captain Iain MacLeod bring pragmatic, practical experience to the Ferry Holdings Board, Minister for Rail Winston Peters says.

Mrs Rich and Captain MacLeod have been appointed to the Board, joining chair Chris Mackenzie, deputy chair Heather Simpson, and director Greg Lowe.

“The new board is already hard at work, with shipyard engagements continuing, alternative proposals being assessed, and collaborative engagement underway with KiwiRail, Port Marlborough and CentrePort on the infrastructure considerations,” Mr Peters says.

“Mrs Rich and Captain MacLeod bring pragmatic skills and insight to the board table, with Mrs Rich’s knowledge of what customers need from the New Zealand supply chain as an industry body chief executive and Captain MacLeod’s experience as a mariner and ship master.

“This issue has always been bigger than replacing ferries and building infrastructure – it’s about a North-South connection for New Zealanders and their businesses, and the safe and reliable driving and berthing of ships.

“As a board, this team is focussed on the most efficient path to connect the Strait,” Mr Peters says.
