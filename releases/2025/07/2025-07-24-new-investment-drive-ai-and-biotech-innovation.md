The Government is investing $24 million in smart, practical science that will help New Zealanders live healthier lives and support the development of sustainable food industries.

Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti today announced two major research programmes in partnership with Singapore, focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) tools for healthy ageing and biotechnology for future food production.

“Science and innovation are critical to building a high-growth, high-value economy. That’s why we’re investing in research with a clear line of sight to commercial outcomes and real public benefit,” Dr Reti says.

“This Government is focused on backing the technologies that will deliver real-world results for New Zealanders – not just in the lab, but in our hospitals, homes, and businesses.

“Whether it’s supporting older Kiwis to live well for longer or developing smarter food production systems, these projects are about practical applications of advanced science to solve problems and grow our economy.”

Funded through the Catalyst Fund, designed to facilitate international collaboration, the investment will support seven joint research projects over the next three years, deepening New Zealand’s research ties with Singapore and building capability in AI and biotechnology.

The AI programme, delivered alongside AI Singapore, directly supports the Government’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy – a plan to use AI to safely and effectively boost productivity and deliver better public services.

“Our AI Strategy is about encouraging the uptake of AI to improve productivity and realise its potential to deliver faster, smarter, and more personalised services, including in healthcare,” says Dr Reti.

“These projects will help develop tools that support clinicians and improve care for our ageing population. Our collaboration with Singapore, a country well advanced in their use and development of AI, will help grow Kiwi capability to explore future practical uses of AI.”

The biotechnology programme will focus on turning scientific research into scalable food solutions, including alternative proteins and new food ingredients, in partnership with Singapore’s A\*STAR.

“These partnerships are about future-proofing our economy and our communities — tackling global challenges with New Zealand science at the forefront,” Dr Reti says.

**Notes to the Editor:**

The Leveraging AI for Health Ageing programme will partner with AI Singapore (AISG) and will fund three projects which apply AI to improve health outcomes for older adults, particularly in cognitive health and personalised care:

- *AI-Assisted interRAI Assessment* – University of Otago will enhance aged care assessments by integrating AI to improve efficiency and personalisation.
- *AI-Driven Risk Score for Dementia* – University of Auckland will build an AI tool to help clinicians identify individuals at high risk of progressing to dementia.
- *AI-Augmented Cognitive Health Monitoring* – Victoria University of Wellington will develop a remote monitoring platform using speech analysis, cognitive games, and caregiver input.

The Biotech in Future Food Research Programme will partner with Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and fund four groundbreaking projects:

- *Algae-Based Future Foods* – Cawthron Institute will develop processing methods for two algae species suited to commercial development in both countries.
- *Hybrid Meat Production* – University of Canterbury will design a novel, scalable approach to producing affordable hybrid meat.
- *Bio-Fermented Functional Foods* – University of Auckland will create next-generation food ingredients from bacterial cellulose and mushroom mycelium.
- *Black Soldier Fly Bioproducts* – Scion will explore the use of insect larvae to develop bioactive compounds and protein sources for human and animal nutrition.
