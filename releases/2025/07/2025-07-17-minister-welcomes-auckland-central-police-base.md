The opening of the new Auckland central police station will mean higher police visibility, and accessibility to the public, our retail sector and business community, in the heart of our largest city,” says Police Minister, Mark Mitchell.

“The community have been asking for a central police station for some time, and I am very pleased that Police have been able to deliver on this.

“The public feel safer when Police are visible and when they know Police are close at hand and accessible.”

“Public safety is at the core of this Government’s law and order agenda and is what drives our police officers,” Mr Mitchell says.

“The base will be home to Auckland’s 51 inner city beat officers, who provide 24/7 policing coverage, and who continue to make a real difference in our largest city.

“Not only is their presence reassuring for public safety, the data also shows a reduction in crime types where the beat team operates.

“In the last year, victimisations are down 17 per cent, robbery has dropped 25 per cent, and theft is down by 21 per cent.

“These results are encouraging, and reflect the hard work of our police officers, alongside stakeholders including Auckland Council, the retail community including Heart of the City, business associations, and community volunteers.

“The presence of a central police base will continue to build on this work, by enabling Police to respond faster to crime in the CBD.

“There is no doubt this police base will have an important role to play in the community now and into the future.”
