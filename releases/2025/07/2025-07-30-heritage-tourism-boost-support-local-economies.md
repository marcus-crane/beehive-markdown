A $4.5 million investment to develop tourism at places with unique cultural heritage will help create jobs and boost incomes in rural economies, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

“This investment over the next three years from the International Visitor Levy will expand Tohu Whenua experiences to more regions with Manawatū-Whanganui and Murihiku Southland next,” Mr Potaka says.

“Tohu Whenua is a tourism and regional economic development programme that helps create jobs, boost incomes, and connect visitors to places with unique cultural heritage.

“Sites which received Tohu Whenua status previously have seen increases of up to 150 per cent in visitation in their first year in the programme.

“Expansion of the programme across more regions will support high-quality authentic visitor experiences with enhanced storytelling, information and facilities.

“Recently added sites include Kate Sheppard House, and Kaikōura Peninsula in Canterbury. They joined others including the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, Te Ana Ngāi Tahu Māori Rock Art Centre in Timaru, and Historic Hayes in Otago.

“DOC is responsible for over 15,000 heritage places across New Zealand, from pā to whaling stations, light houses, WWII defences and mining relics. Tourism to these places is estimated to be worth around $1.3 billion per year.

“I encourage everyone to look out for Tohu Whenua sites around Aotearoa New Zealand. These offer rich stories, variety and cultural exchange, encouraging visitors to stay longer in a region and delve deeper. In turn, they support local economies by spending more on attractions, accommodation, hospitality and retail.”
