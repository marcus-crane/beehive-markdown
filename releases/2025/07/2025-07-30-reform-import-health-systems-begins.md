The Government is taking decisive steps to modernise New Zealand’s import health system, with a new programme aimed at significantly reducing the time it takes to develop Import Health Standards (IHSs) while maintaining the country’s world-class biosecurity protections.

Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says the current regulatory framework is over 30 years old and is struggling to adapt to today’s fast-moving global trade environment.

“The way we develop import health standards hasn’t kept pace with the demands of modern trade and innovation. We need a system that is faster, smarter, and more responsive, without compromising our biosecurity.”

A regulatory efficiency programme is now underway to transform the IHS development process.

“The programme will make IHSs easier to use and understand for industry, but also much faster to develop.”

Mr Hoggard says one of the most promising innovations is the use of generative artificial intelligence to support pest risk analysis, standards drafting, and consultation materials.

“We’ve already seen successful proof-of-concept trials that show AI can significantly reduce the time it takes to complete key parts of the IHS process. This is about using smart tools to do the heavy lifting, so our experts can focus on the decisions that matter most.”

A key pilot project is the reform of the Plant Nursery Stock import system, and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has started work reforming the plant import system in collaboration with importers and growers.

“Our plant-based industries need safe and efficient access to new plant material to stay competitive, improve productivity, adapt to climate change, and meet evolving consumer preferences. We’re working closely with industry to co-design a system that works for users, supports access to new plant genetics, and protects our environment.

These protections underpin the work of our farmers and growers, and the $59.9 billion primary sector.

Once fully delivered, this reform programme will mean faster approvals for imported goods that New Zealand businesses need and the removal of unnecessary restrictions to growth and productivity, while still maintaining strong biosecurity protections.”

We’re committed to building a system that supports growth, innovation, and resilience for the years ahead,” Mr Hoggard says.
