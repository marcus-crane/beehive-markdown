Associate Health Minister David Seymour has today announced more clear expectations for Pharmac to innovate and optimise to further build on expectations set last year; to deliver the medicines and medical technology that Kiwis need.

“Increasing medicines access is one of my greatest priorities. For many New Zealanders, funding for pharmaceuticals is life or death, or the difference between a life of pain and suffering or living freely,” Mr Seymour says.

Since my last letter of expectations Pharmac has:

- Improved overall consultation
- Added additional consultation to the annual tender process
- Changed funding criteria based on public feedback, such as the decision to fund two types of oestradiol patches
- Appointed Natalie McMurtry as the incoming Chief Executive to cement positive change, and continue to move towards a more transparent, inclusive, and people-focused organisation
- Conducted, and published a report on, the Consumer Engagement Workshop to help reset the Patient-Pharmac relationship
- Appointed a Consumer Working Group to help reset the Patient-Pharmac relationship
- Funded access to 66 additional medicines using the Government’s $604 million budget boost over four years which will benefit over 200,000 New Zealanders

“This is a good start. My letter of expectations for this year makes it very clear that there is still more work to be done. I expect this positive culture shift to continue,” Mr Seymour says.

“Pharmac must modernise, or it will fall behind. It needs to adopt faster, smarter processes and explore the use of AI to lift performance.”

My expectations for this year are that Pharmac should:

- Explore how it can optimise medicines assessment and procurement processes to make them more efficient
- Explore ways to utilise AI to make their processes more efficient
- Consider the fiscal impacts to the government of funding medicines and medical devices, including costs of societal impacts of funding or not funding a medicine or medical device
- Be more proactive in engaging with stakeholders
- Look for new and additional funding opportunities for medicines and medical devices
- Publish measurable performance metrics and timely decisions to increase transparency
- Continue to involve patients early in the process and engage with them meaningfully

“We’re committed to ensuring that the regulatory system for pharmaceuticals is not unreasonably holding back access. It will lead to more Kiwis being able to access the medicines they need to live a fulfilling life,” Mr Seymour says.

“I am looking forward to continuing to work with Pharmac as we continue to ensure Kiwis get timely access to medicines and medical devices.”
