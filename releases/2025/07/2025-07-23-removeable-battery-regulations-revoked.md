The Government is revoking 2023 regulations requiring all vaping devices to have removeable batteries to resolve a current court challenge brought by Mason Corporation Limited.

“Cabinet was advised that taking this step was the best way to resolve the case,” Associate Health Minister Casey Costello says. 

“This decision means the proceedings, which relate to regulations brought in by the Labour government, can be withdrawn.”

The changes will be gazetted today and take effect from 1 September. From that date vaping devices will not be required to have a removeable battery.

“It is not expected that the revocation will negatively impact our falling smoking or vaping rates,” Ms Costello says. 

“This Government legislated to ban disposable vapes, which have been the most popular products among young people, and these are now off the market.”
