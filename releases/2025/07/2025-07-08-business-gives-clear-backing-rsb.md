Regulation Minister David Seymour is welcoming BusinessNZ’s strong support for the Regulatory Standards Bill as a means to deal with red tape and regulation.

“After all the misinformed opposition we’ve heard, the people who get up in the morning to make an honest buck and deliver goods and services to New Zealanders want red tape and regulation dealt to and believe this Bill will help them do that. 

“Submitting on the Bill at select committee today, BusinessNZ said it was an important step towards improving the quality of regulation and reducing the compliance burden on businesses by putting more scrutiny on politicians when law is made.

“The academics who have been so loud about this Bill are so far removed from reality partly because many of Parliament’s damaging laws don’t frustrate their ability to make a living. If they were held back by red tape and regulation on a daily basis, like many businesses are, they would support this Bill.

“Too often, politicians find regulating politically rewarding, and we need to make it less rewarding by putting more sunlight on their activities.

“The Bill doesn’t stop politicians or their officials making bad laws, but it makes it transparent that they’re doing it. It makes it easier for voters to identify those responsible for making bad rules. Over time, it will improve the quality of rules we all have to live under by changing how politicians behave.

“In a high-cost economy, regulation isn’t neutral – it’s a tax on growth. This Government is committed to clearing the path of needless regulations by improving how laws are made.”
