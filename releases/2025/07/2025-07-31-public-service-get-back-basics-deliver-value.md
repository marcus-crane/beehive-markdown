Legislation to overhaul the public service so it focuses on getting back to basics and delivering value for money to taxpayers has passed its first reading, Public Service Minister Judith Collins says.

“The Public Service Amendment Bill aims to lift the performance of the public service,” Ms Collins says.

“It clarifies the purpose of the public service – and the responsibilities of chief executives – while preserving its constitutional role as a politically neutral and professional institution.”

The bill will:

- Reinforce merit-based appointments, to attract the widest pool of talent and ensure the best candidates are chosen
- Clarify the responsibilities of public service chief executives, with greater accountability for performance
- Remove the option to automatically reappoint chief executives at the end of their fixed term, to ensure a competitive selection process
- Refocus the public service on supporting the government of the day, while maintaining the core values of political neutrality and free and frank advice
- Remove pay equity, diversity and inclusion provisions, most of which are substantively covered in the Public Service Act or in other laws

“The reforms will ensure the public service is professional, politically neutral and equipped to serve the government of the day – all of which adds up to better outcomes for taxpayers,” Ms Collins says.

“Taxpayers expect a public service that is capable, impartial, and focused on getting results. These changes will do that.”
