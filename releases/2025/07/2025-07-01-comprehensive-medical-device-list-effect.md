Associate Health Minister David Seymour has today announced that Pharmac have created their comprehensive list of medical devices which are used in public hospitals, to improve the way they manage medical devices.

“Almost everyone diagnosed or treated at a public hospital relies on medical devices for their care. These can range from bandages and cotton swabs to pacemakers, hip replacements, hospital beds, and robotic surgery machines,” Mr Seymour says.

“Pharmac has made a list of all medical devices currently used in public hospitals to improve the way medical devices are managed in New Zealand. Establishing the comprehensive list will not only support better planning and investment decisions, but it will also help identify funding priorities and guide future purchasing.

“Over 26,000 medical devices were added to the comprehensive list, bringing the total number of devices on the list to 220,000. Pharmac will continue to refine the list as we engage with more suppliers and prepare for the next phase of the medical device management work.

“We’re working toward a future where all public hospitals work from a single, trusted national list. One list used by all public hospitals brings greater transparency to what devices are used and funded. This will support consistent access, reduce duplication, and improve equity across the country.

“Previously the Hospital Medical Devices list only included medical devices covered by Pharmac’s contracts with suppliers. We recently added the remaining medical devices used by hospitals to this list, to create the comprehensive list of medical devices.

Pharmac consulted on what to include in the comprehensive list from 11 February until 31 March 2025.

“Pharmac staff carefully reviewed all feedback received during the consultation process. They contacted suppliers to validate data, confirm which medical devices have been added to the list, and explain why others have not,” Mr Seymour says.

“When the Government manages its accounts like families and businesses have to, money goes a lot further.”
