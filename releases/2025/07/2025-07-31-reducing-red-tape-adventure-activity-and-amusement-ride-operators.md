Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Brooke van Velden is consulting on health and safety regulations in the recreation and entertainment sectors to reduce unnecessary compliance pressure, while maintaining safety outcomes.

“We’re making it easier for recreation providers by making sure only those running genuinely high-risk adventure activities need to meet the stricter safety requirements,” says Ms van Velden.

“The first proposed change is to amend the definition of ‘adventure activities’ in the Adventure Activities Regulations. The current definition is so broad that it may require low-risk activities to meet compliance standards designed for higher-risk operations.

“There’s a big difference in the level of risk associated with things like white water rafting and bungy jumping versus a bike ride on one of the New Zealand cycle trails,” says Ms van Velden.

“I’m proposing this change to ensure only businesses providing higher-risk adventure activities need to meet the stricter higher risk safety requirements. We will be consulting with the sector so that we get the boundary right between high risk and lower risk activities.”

The second change is to update the Amusement Device Regulations so that only transportable high-risk amusement devices require a permit from local councils.

“I have heard from local councils who say the regulations are outdated and in need of review.

“Councils currently permit a wide range of amusement devices regardless of risk. There’s a difference in risk between large Ferris wheels that are frequently dismantled and reinstalled, and small merry-go-rounds or fixed amusement rides that are never moved.

“This change will streamline the process, such as the use of low-risk amusement devices at the school fair. It will make it easier for communities to put on local events like Guy Fawkes or Easter shows because the operators from the communities don’t have to get local permits from the Councils,” says Ms van Velden.

“I have also heard from a number of groups that recreational organisations are reluctant to organise volunteer work in the outdoors, like checking traps and pest control or trail maintenance, because of concerns about triggering health and safety liabilities.”

Social and community groups are having to develop extensive policies and documentation for their volunteer workers, rather than focusing on actions to keep them safe.

Local authorities are concerned about extensive health and safety obligations for people who spontaneously volunteer and self-organise during emergencies, over which they may not have much control.

“I will be seeking Cabinet approval to include a provision on clarifying the obligations for volunteer organisations in the Health and Safety Reform Bill that I expect to be introduced later this year.

“I have asked my officials to consult a wide range of affected groups like the Federated Mountain Clubs, Aotearoa Climbing Access Trust, Department of Conservation, Volunteering NZ, and Local Government NZ.

“It is important we get the balance right between encouraging voluntary activities that all New Zealanders benefit from, while keeping people safe.

“By targeting regulation better, we’re helping recreation and entertainment businesses spend less time on paperwork and more time delivering safe, enjoyable experiences,” says Ms van Velden.

“These changes will save time and costs for businesses and workers as we cut-red-tape to make it easier to do business. When our Kiwi businesses thrive, there are more jobs and lower prices for all New Zealanders.”
