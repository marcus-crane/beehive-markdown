Legislation regulating ground-based space infrastructure to deter foreign interference and protect New Zealand’s national interests has passed all stages under urgency in Parliament, Space Minister Judith Collins says.

“The Outer Space High Altitude Activities Amendment Bill is a significant milestone and enhances New Zealand’s national security with immediate effect,” Ms Collins says.

“It supports New Zealand’s interest in the safe, secure and responsible use of space and stop any attempts by foreign entities that do not share our values or interests.

“Ground-based space infrastructure in New Zealand plays a vital role in supporting global satellite operations and space activities, but without regulation, it can also pose risks to national security, and other national interests.

“The global space sector continues to push the boundaries of satellite technology, space communications and orbital operations. As this sector evolves, so too must our regulatory settings.

“From 29 July, when the legislation takes effect, ground-based space infrastructure such as satellite tracking stations and telemetry systems will be subject to appropriate oversight and safeguards.

“While all in-scope operators will be treated as having a transitional authorisation from the end of July, as the Minister for Space I will be able to vary, suspend or revoke these authorisations on national security grounds.”

MBIE will be the administrator, backed with enforcement powers and able to take action to stop malicious activity. 

Regulations will be developed later this year setting out further requirements for ground-based space infrastructure authorisation, under which operators will need to implement security and due diligence systems.

A transition period for operators to implement the necessary systems for successful registration will apply until the regulations come into force in the first half of next year. 

“This system helps maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a trusted and capable space-faring nation, one that takes its responsibilities seriously and is prepared to manage the risks and opportunities of space activity,” Ms Collins said.

Information about the ground-based space infrastructure regulatory regime is available on the [MBIE website](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/space/our-regulatory-regime/ground-based-space-infrastructure).

**Notes to Editors**

From 29 July 2025:

- Anyone operating ground-based space infrastructure (GBSI) for certain activities, such as communicating with satellites or tracking space objects, will be considered to hold a transitional authorisation.
- When seeking authorisation, applicants will need to confirm with MBIE as the regulator that they have appropriate protective security arrangements in place, and due diligence systems to assess any partners they provide GBSI services to, such as customers or research collaborators.
- The Minister for Space can decline applications if they are not satisfied the authorisation is in the interests of national security.
- The Minister for Space will have the power to vary, suspend or revoke authorisations, where national security concerns arise.
- Following the entry into force of regulations next year the Minister for Space’s power to vary, suspend or revoke authorisations will expand to include national interest considerations beyond national security.
- Enforcement officers will be able to inspect facilities, assess security arrangements and, where necessary in the national interest, the Minister will be able to issue disposal orders requiring a person to divest their interest in GBSI.
