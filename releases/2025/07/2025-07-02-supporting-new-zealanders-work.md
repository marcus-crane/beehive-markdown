Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston says a strong turnout for the first in a series of regional employment events reinforces a cross-sector commitment to get Kiwis into jobs, boost employment and grow the economy.

Kicking off the MSD-led series in Levin, Minister Upston and officials met with representatives of around 30 employers and other stakeholders, reinforcing job opportunities across the Horowhenua and Kāpiti Coast regions.

“It was great to attend this event, acknowledge the commitment of MSD and recognise the partnership with local employers,” Louise Upston says.

“That's because this Government is focused on a Going for Growth strategy which includes a key emphasis on developing the talent of our people.

"These events reinforce that. They're about people, about maximising the potential of Kiwis, about raising their earning potential while also ensuring businesses can access the people they need to help them compete globally and grow.

"The Government has an ambitious target to reduce the number of people on the Jobseeker Benefit by 50,000 by 2030. MSD and employers are key to this.

“We know we can’t do it alone, and need support from the community, employers and training organisations to achieve this goal.

“To continue discussions about how we can work together to achieve the Jobseeker reduction target, MSD will host a number of events to bring together employers, providers and community organisations.

“The focus for the Levin/Horowhenua Supporting New Zealanders Into Work event was ensuring employers and partners are motivated to invest in the good of their communities by training or employing MSD clients, and that they know how MSDs products and services can support them.

“It provided a great opportunity for local employers and organisations to discuss how we can all work together to understand workforce needs and address workforce challenges.

“This week, I’m attending two more MSD-hosted events in the Hutt Valley and in Gisborne, with additional dates to be confirmed around the country.

“Again, I want to acknowledge the work of MSD staff in getting people into jobs, with work exits up 11 per cent on the same time a year ago. As we saw in Levin last night, MSD are doing a great job engaging proactively with both Jobseekers and with employers.

“We know the faster we can help beneficiaries – especially young people – find sustainable employment, the better the outcomes for them, their families, our communities, and our economy.

“That’s why we’ve introduced more early intervention through a new phone-based employment case management service which includes 6,000 18-24-year-old clients in this service, we’ve got 2,100 more places for young people to get community job coaching, more regular work seminars, and a traffic light system to help them stay on track with their obligations.

“The new Relocate for Work Support payment will also make it easier for people to move to take up sustainable employment.

“All of these initiatives are helping on the frontline, and that matters because ‘work’ is about more than money. It also gives people a sense of purpose, independence, connectedness – leading to a better future and helping families break out of the cycle of inter-generational welfare dependence.”
