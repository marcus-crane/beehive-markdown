A new medical school will be established at the University of Waikato as part of the Government’s plan to build a stronger health workforce, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti say.

“Cabinet has approved the business case for the new school, which will have a strong focus on primary care and rural health,” Mr Brown says.

“With $82.85 million in Government funding and over $150 million from the University, supported by philanthropic investment, this is a substantial commitment to education and regional development in the Waikato.

“Today’s decision will enable the University of Waikato to begin construction on new teaching facilities later this year and start planning for clinical placements, while giving more students the opportunity to study medicine in New Zealand.”

The school will offer a graduate-entry programme, providing a flexible new pathway into medicine that helps attract a broader range of students and build a stronger, more diverse workforce.

“It’s an innovative model that supports our focus on strengthening primary care, making it easier for people to see their doctor – helping Kiwis stay well and out of hospital.

“It also builds on the University’s recent additions of nursing, pharmacy, and midwifery programmes, demonstrating a strong and growing commitment to developing New Zealand’s health workforce.”

A full cost-benefit analysis was presented to Cabinet before any proposal was finalised, as part of the National – ACT coalition agreement.

Mr Brown says the school builds on the Government’s record investment in the health system and workforce.

“Today’s announcement adds 120 doctor training places each year, starting in 2028 – a significant boost to our long-term pipeline of homegrown medical workforce.

"This is on top of the 100 additional medical training places that are being added over the term of this Government across the University of Auckland and University of Otago.”

Dr Reti says the decision represents a significant step forward for both the University of Waikato and the wider region.

“This is a major milestone for the University and a real boost for tertiary education in the Waikato.

“It strengthens the University’s position as a leader in education, training, and research, and creates new academic and economic opportunities for Hamilton, the Waikato, and rural communities.

“By expanding access to medical training, we’re creating new opportunities for students from across the region and beyond, while also helping to future-proof the local workforce.

“This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking initiative this Government wants to see from our universities – investing in regional growth, building local capability, and delivering on the needs of rural communities.”
