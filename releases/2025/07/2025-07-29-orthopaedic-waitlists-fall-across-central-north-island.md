Fewer people in the Midland region are waiting for orthopaedic surgery, with the total waitlist down 15 per cent since November 2023, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Orthopaedic conditions like hip and knee issues can severely impact a person’s quality of life. It’s great to see more patients getting the care they need, faster,” Mr Brown says.

Between November 2023 and March 2025, the number of people waiting fell from 3,125 to 2,668. The number waiting longer than four months dropped by 11 per cent, from 1,666 to 1,480.

“Across the region, faster treatment is helping people regain their independence and enjoy life again. That means grandparents staying active, tradies getting back to work, and young people returning to sport.”

This progress comes after the waitlist ballooned by 123 per cent between 2020 and 2023. Since November 2023, waitlists have decreased in:

- Waikato – down 25%
- Taranaki – down 7%
- Gisborne – down 32%
- Lakes – down 6%
- Bay of Plenty – down 9%

“We’re investing in the workforce, expanding surgical capacity by making better use of both public and private facilities, and supporting hospitals to deliver faster, more effective care.

“Reducing wait times for elective procedures is a top priority for this Government. Our health target is clear: by 2030, 95 per cent of patients will receive treatment within four months.

“Patients are still waiting too long, and there is still more work to do – but this latest data shows we’re making real progress for orthopaedic patients in Midland,” Mr Brown says.
