Police Minister Mark Mitchell today announced the retirement of statutory Deputy Commissioner of Police, Tania Kura.

Ms Kura has served in the statutory Deputy Police Commissioner role since her appointment on 18 April 2023.

Deputy Commissioner Kura notified the Governor-General yesterday of her intention to retire from the role and the New Zealand Police in November this year.  

Ms Kura has served in the police for 37 years, graduating from the Royal New Zealand Police College in 1988. She started her career as a constable in Christchurch before working her way through the ranks to be Area Commander Hawkes Bay in 2012 and District Commander Eastern from 2017. She moved to Wellington in 2020 to be based at Police National Headquarters, taking up the role of Deputy Commissioner Leadership and Capability.

“I wish to acknowledge Deputy Commissioner Kura for her service, and I wish her and her family the best for the future,” Mr Mitchell says. 

Statutory Deputy Commissioners of Police are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The Public Service Commission has started a recruitment process for both Deputy Commissioner positions
