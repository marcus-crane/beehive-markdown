The Government is making it easier for police to punish shoplifters and is introducing stronger penalties for low-level theft, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee say.

“Public confidence in our justice system is undermined if people can steal with apparent impunity. It’s disheartening, and our government will not sit by while shoplifters rob businesses of their livelihoods,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Currently, the administrative burden can deter retailers from making official complaints, and lower-level offending often goes unreported or unpunished. Our government is restoring real consequences for crime, and shoplifting is no exception.”

The proposed changes include:

- **Introducing an infringement regime for shoplifting in retail premises**. For stolen goods valued up to $500, infringement fees will be up to $500. For goods valued over $500, fees will be up to $1,000.
- **Strengthening the penalties for theft.**The maximum penalties will be one year imprisonment (if the value is approximately $2,000 or less), or seven years imprisonment (if value is approximately more than $2,000).
- **Creating a new aggravated theft offence** for when the value of the goods is under $2,000 and the theft is carried out in a manner that is offensive, threatening, insulting, or disorderly.

“Harsher penalties could mean up to twice as long behind bars for aggravated theft, and criminals will be forced to think twice before destroying more lives,” Mrs McKee says.

“Our government is focused on restoring law and order, reducing violent crime, and putting victims first in our justice system.

“I want to thank the Ministerial Advisory Group, and its Chair Sunny Kaushal, for their work shaping this proposal.”

These changes fulfill a commitment in the National/New Zealand First coalition agreement to ensure real consequences for lower-level crimes such as shoplifting.
