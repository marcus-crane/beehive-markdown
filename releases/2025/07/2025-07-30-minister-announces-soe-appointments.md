Seven reappointments and seven new appointments to eight companies in the State Owned Enterprises portfolio have been made, ensuring these companies are equipped with the skills and expertise necessary to deliver on their commitments to New Zealanders, State Owned Enterprises Minister Simeon Brown says.

“I have made clear that the Government expects a return on investment from our state-owned enterprises, and that like all commercial entities, they need to make commercial decisions that are in the best interest of the company. This requires SOEs to run profitable businesses that set ambitious targets and performance measures and emphasise distributions to shareholders.

“The Government is committed to ensuring our state-owned enterprises have strong leadership in place to navigate both the challenges and opportunities they face. These individuals bring a strong mix of governance expertise, commercial acumen, and stakeholder engagement to their roles, which will help ensure the entities they oversee meet the Government’s expectations,” Mr Brown says

ECNZ and Kordia will benefit from experienced leadership continuity through the reappointments of Victor Wu and Sophie Haslem as the Chairs of ECNZ and Kordia respectively. Victor Wu has successfully guided ECNZ towards its planned wind-up, while Sophie Haslem will continue to oversee Kordia’s strategic transformation, driving improved operational efficiency and enhancing its future resilience.

In addition, Terry Paddy (Airways), Jan Hilder (AsureQuality), Jane Meares (ECNZ), Nicola Riordan and Linda Robertson (Kordia) have all been reappointed to their respective boards with new term start dates of 1 September for Nicola Riordan and 1 November for the remainder.

Seven new directors will bring specific skills to help Hawke’s Bay Airport, Landcorp, MetService, and NZ Post achieve Ministers’ expectations, with terms commencing on 1 August:

 

- **Hawke’s Bay Airport:** Megan Allan will bring expertise in financial strategy, operational efficiencies, and stakeholder engagement to enhance the airport’s role as an economic hub for the region.

 

- **Landcorp (Pāmu):** The appointments of Angela Dixon, Stu Husband, and Brent Lawgun will focus on driving Landcorp’s performance turnaround. Collectively, they bring experience in agricultural governance, capital management, and iwi engagement, tailored to meet the Government’s expectations for a sharper focus on core farming operations.

 

- **MetService:** Janie Elrick and Julian Smith bring complementary skills, with backgrounds in finance, risk management, and customer-centred transformational change. They will add value to the Board as the business amalgamates with NIWA over the medium term.

 

- **NZ Post:**  Michelle Henderson, with her commercial acumen and expertise in governance and digital transformation, will support the organisation’s transformation in the postal and logistics sector.

The Government acknowledges and thanks outgoing appointees for their valuable contributions and service.
