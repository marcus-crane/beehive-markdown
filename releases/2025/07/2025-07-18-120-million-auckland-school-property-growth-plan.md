The Government’s investing more than $120 million into building more classrooms in Auckland, so thousands more students can learn in safe, warm and dry environments.

“Auckland is booming, and we are stepping up by investing heavily in extra classrooms to support the city’s rapid growth. Through Budget 25 funding, 137 new classrooms will be rolled out, creating space for an additional 3,014 student places in the network, supporting schools with growing rolls,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“We’re delivering these through a combination of cost-effective repeatable designs and offsite manufactured buildings, so our funding can go further and more students benefit.

“All of these projects are expected to enter construction in the next 12 months. We are getting on with the job of future-proofing Auckland’s school network to keep pace with population growth.”

“I am also thrilled to announce we have confirmed a site purchase in Pōkeno to build a new primary school. We will also establish a new Junior College in Chapel Downs, on the site of Chapel Downs Primary School.”

The school is due to open in Term 1, 2027, with an initial roll of up to 270 which is expected to grow to 1000 students over time.

“Significant progress has also been made through Budget 24 property investment into two new schools. Te Kura Rau Iti in Flat Bush is in the final stages of construction and is set to open for Term 1, 2026. A new primary school in Massey Redhills is in construction and set to open in Term 1, 2027.

“These new classrooms and schools are a fantastic boost for students, teachers, and the wider community. We will continue to drive efficiencies in school property delivery so more schools, communities and children benefit sooner,” Ms Stanford says.

“Auckland is a magnet for talent, with thousands of people moving to our largest city each year to build a better life for themselves and their families. Ensuring that our city has the services and infrastructure for growth is a priority for our Government,” Minister for Auckland Simeon Brown says.

“The Government’s investment in new classrooms for our young learners will help Auckland accommodate growth, while also supporting construction sector jobs across the region.”
