Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Foreign Minister Winston Peters met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele in Wellington today, reaffirming New Zealand’s close ties to Solomon Islands.

“Prime Minister Manele’s visit this week reinforces the deep ties between our two nations stretching back over 150 years. We discussed the work we are doing together to grow Solomon Islands economy, and PM Manele’s plans for the Pacific Islands Forum, which he will host next month,” Mr Luxon says.

“I was particularly pleased to confirm that New Zealand will continue its support over the next 10 years to build on the positive progress Solomon Islands is making in the education and fisheries sectors.

“Our long-standing partnership demonstrates New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to Solomon Islands and its people.”

Mr Peters welcomed New Zealand’s continued commitment to supporting Solomon Islands’ development.

“As we work with our Pacific partners to build a peaceful and prosperous Pacific, New Zealand’s assistance plays a big part in supporting the development of countries like Solomon Islands.

“Our continued commitments to Solomon Islands’ education and fisheries sectors will build upon the hard-earned progress made to date for the mutual benefit of both our countries,” Mr Peters says.

Prime Minister Manele and his delegation also attended a number of business and community engagements in Auckland and Wellington.

Prime Minister Manele departs New Zealand tomorrow.
