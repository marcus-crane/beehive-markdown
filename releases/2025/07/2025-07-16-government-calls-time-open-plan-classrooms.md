The Government has put an end to building open-plan classrooms, ensuring all new classrooms are designed in a flexible way to ensure better student outcomes. 

“Overwhelming feedback I’ve received from schools across New Zealand is open-plan classrooms aren’t meeting the needs of students. While open-plan designs were originally intended to foster collaboration, they have often created challenges for schools, particularly around noise and managing student behaviour,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“This Government is focused on raising achievement and closing the equity gap and an important part of our reform package is ensuring learning spaces are designed to improve student outcomes.

“In many cases, open-plan classrooms reduce flexibility, rather than enhance it. We have listened to the sector and new classrooms will no longer be open plan.” 

The Government has not designed and built open plan classes since being in office other than classrooms that have been specifically requested.

All new classrooms will be built using standard designs that prioritise flexibility over open-plan layouts. For example, the use of glass sliding doors mean spaces can be open when classes collaborate but can also close for focused learning. This approach ensures schools have fit-for-purpose environments that support a range of teaching and learning styles.

“We are ensuring school property delivery is efficient and sustainable. We’ve lowered the average cost of a classroom by 28 per cent so we could deliver 30 per cent more classrooms last year compared to 2023. We’re continuing to drive down costs so more Kiwi kids can access them, faster. In 2025, new classrooms cost on average $620,000 compared to $1.2 million at the end of 2023.”

Wellington is the latest region to benefit from this, with a $25 million targeted investment into areas experiencing population growth.

The schools receiving new classrooms are:

- Newlands Intermediate – 10 classrooms
- Aotea College – 16 classrooms

“Aotea College is a prime example where existing open-plan classrooms did not support learning outcomes. The lack of functionality of the open design meant spaces could not be shared or multipurpose due to disruption and noise. This investment will deliver new, standard teaching spaces that better meet the needs of both students and staff.

“Delivering these classrooms through repeatable designs and offsite-manufactured buildings also ensures we are achieving maximum value for money. Planning is already underway for these projects, with construction expected to begin within the next 12 months,” Ms Stanford says.
