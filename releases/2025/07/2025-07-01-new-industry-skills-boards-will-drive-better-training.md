Eight new Industry Skills Boards (ISBs) will give industry a strong voice in work-based learning, ensuring the system delivers the right skills, in the right places, for a growing economy, Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds says.

“The Government promised to disestablish Te Pūkenga and return decision-making to local providers and industry. The Industry Skills Boards are a key part of delivering on that promise,” Ms Simmonds says.

“This is all part of our plan to make sure that the training people receive is aligned to what industry needs, and skills are matched to ensure they are fit-for-purpose, paving the way for economic growth. We want to ensure our workforce across key growth sectors are ready to hit the ground running.

“The ISBs will be led by industry experts who know their trades and sectors best. They will set training standards, oversee quality, and make sure apprenticeships and traineeships match what employers and students need.”

The eight Industry Skills Boards will begin operating from 1 January 2026 once the legislation is passed later this year. They will also temporarily manage work-based training currently overseen by Te Pūkenga. Backed by industry consultation, they will cover:

- Automotive, transport, and logistics
- Construction and specialist trades
- Food and fibre (including aquaculture)
- Infrastructure
- Manufacturing and engineering
- Services
- Health and community
- Electrotechnology and information technology

Industry Skills Boards will have three main funding sources. They will receive some core public funding, they can choose to charge fees to fund their quality assurance functions, and industries can also choose to support ISBs through a levy.

Around 250,000 learners enter the vocational education system each year — half learning on campus or online, and half through work-based training.

“Whether you’re learning on the job or in a classroom, these changes will make your training more relevant and valuable,” Ms Simmonds says.

“We want every apprentice and trainee to be confident their qualifications will be recognised by employers. Employers can trust the system to deliver skilled workers ready to step into roles.

"This is a win for apprentices, trainees, employers, and the economy. We're building a modern, connected work-based learning system that supports quality jobs and drives the economic growth powering New Zealand’s future."
