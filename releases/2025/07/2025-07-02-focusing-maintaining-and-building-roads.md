The Government’s focus on improving roads across the country is well on its way, with the successful completion of one of the largest state highway road renewal programmes in New Zealand history, Transport Minister Chris Bishop confirmed today.

“We are focused on ensuring government agencies are better at looking after the infrastructure assets we already have, to ensure New Zealanders get the most from their public infrastructure,” Mr Bishop says.

“That’s why we’ve invested in road maintenance and renewals through the $2 billion State Highway Pothole Prevention fund, which ensures vital work is carried out to keep our roads safe and suitable for the people that use them. 

“Over the summer months from September to April, almost 2200 lane kilometres of road either received a new layer of seal or asphalt or the entire road was completely replaced. 

“With over 300 lane kilometres of road being rebuilt, the NZ Transport Agency and its maintenance contractors almost tripled their delivery of brand-new high-quality roads when compared to the previous summer.

“A particular highlight this past season was the State Highway 1 Tīrau to Waiouru accelerated maintenance programme, which delivered over 100 lane kilometres of road rebuilding and resealing throughout the centre of the Waikato region. Regions such as Northland, Taranaki, Manawatū and Southland each saw more than 20 lane kilometres of new roading also.

“I extend my thanks to the communities, drivers and truckies who’ve been so patient through this busy summer maintenance season, and to the contractors who’ve worked hard to get the work done to a high standard.

“Our focus on building new roads will continue over the next two years. We acknowledge that this work can be disruptive for road users; but the use of new construction techniques, increased use of risk-based traffic management guidance, and clear communication with the public will ensure that New Zealanders experience better journeys both during construction and after the works take place. 

“Having safe, high-quality roads to drive on is critical for people getting to work, school and home safely as well as making sure our freight gets to where it needs to go in a timely manner.”
