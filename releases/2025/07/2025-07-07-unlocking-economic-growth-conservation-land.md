A targeted effort to reduce the backlog of applications for use of conservation land is accelerating economic growth without compromising conservation values, says Conservation Minister Tama Potaka.

“Over the years, decision makers at the Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai became wrapped and trapped in a sticky ball of red tape unnecessarily slowing the success of tourism operators, researchers, major infrastructure project developers, among many others.

“The department is doing a great job delivering on my expectation to crack on with the mahi. The total number of applications awaiting decisions has dropped from around 1300 last September to now under 550. The processing of these applications in April and May this year were nearly three times faster than the same time last year - up by 180 per cent.

“We’re achieving these results through a data-driven approach and smarter, more efficient systems and processes, including new technology such as AI tools helping to scan statutory documents. 

“A standout example is the new one-off drone permits process: previously taking weeks, these applications are now processed within five working days.

“Around a third of the applications DOC has processed since February are related to tourism, the country’s second-largest export earner, where more than 380 tourism related applications in the last three months were processed, including guiding activities in Fiordland and Heli hunt and fish concessions for helicopter landings in the North Island.

“This month, DOC has approved Kokiri Lime’s application to quarry 1ha of rock needed for critical roading and flood protection infrastructure projects in South Westland having first received the application more than five years ago.

“Processing applications quicker means businesses get certainty faster. DOC is enabling a wide range of activities that connect people with nature and support local economies, while more quickly declining proposals where the effects on nature or heritage cannot be avoided, remedied, or mitigated.

“The conservation estate covers a third of our country. It’s not just a sanctuary, it’s a shared space where tourism, science, infrastructure, and community projects intersect with nature. We’re now managing that balance faster and smarter.

“We are ensuring activity on conservation land is lawful and sustainable while protecting the natural environment that is the lifeblood of our economy.” 

**Notes to editors**

- From guided walks and scientific research to filming and infrastructure, a wide range of activities on public conservation land rely on DOC’s permissions system to proceed responsibly and sustainably.
- Each year, millions of international visitors ([3.3 million in 2024 alone](https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/visitor-arrivals-up-in-2024/#:~:text=Overseas%20visitor%20arrivals%20to%20New,visitor%20arrivals%20to%20New%20Zealand.%E2%80%9D&text=There%20were%201.4%20million%20visitor,visitor%20arrivals%2C%E2%80%9D%20Drake%20said.)) are drawn to Aotearoa New Zealand by its spectacular natural landscapes. Around a third of all permissions applications DOC processes annually are tourism-related, underscoring the importance of timely decisions for the visitor economy and regional communities.
- Since the end of February, DOC has made 386 decisions on tourism-related applications. In June 2025, 71 tourism decisions were processed, triple the number from June 2024, when 23 were completed, reflecting a sharp improvement.
- Of the tourism-related decisions in June, 35% were for guiding activities. The number of tourism applications on-hand has dropped from 374 in June 2024 to just 137 in June 2025.
- Tourism is a crucial part of the Government’s focus on economic growth, with domestic and international tourism expenditure at $44.4 billion and supporting more than 300,000 jobs.
- Conservation-related tourism is worth around $3.4 billion a year.
