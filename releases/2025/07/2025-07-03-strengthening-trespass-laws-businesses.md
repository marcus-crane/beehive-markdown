The Government is strengthening trespass laws to make them more effective and practical for businesses, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee say.

“We know our trespass laws are no longer fit for purpose. They’re difficult to enforce and often criminals take no notice. They return with impunity and just continue to rob businesses of their livelihoods,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Our plan to restore law and order is working, but there’s still more work to be done. Trespass laws are an area we know will make a world of difference to the community.

“Businesses need extra tools to better protect their properties, keep offenders away, and stop them from coming back.”

The proposed changes to the Trespass Act are:

- Increasing the maximum trespass period from two years to three years.
- Allow businesses, such as franchises, to trespass individuals from multiple locations.
- Increase the maximum fine for anyone refusing to leave when asked, or returning when trespassed from $1,000 to $2,000.
- Increase the maximum fine for anyone refusing to give their name and address when requested, or giving false information, from $500 to $1,000.

“For too long, offenders have treated trespass notices like a joke. These changes send a clear message: enough is enough. If you threaten retail workers or steal from businesses, don’t expect to walk back in like nothing happened,” Mrs McKee says.

“Every New Zealander deserves to feel safe at work, especially our frontline retailers. These reforms aren’t just about fines and paperwork; they are about making retail spaces safer and giving businesses the respect they deserve.”

“I want to thank Sunny Kaushal and the Retail MAG for engaging with retailers across the country and for their recommendations on how to modernise the Trespass Act, so it better upholds retailers’ business and property rights, while keeping customers and staff safe,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Our goal before the Bill is introduced is to explore how best to support retailers when distributing notices to those who refuse to engage.”
