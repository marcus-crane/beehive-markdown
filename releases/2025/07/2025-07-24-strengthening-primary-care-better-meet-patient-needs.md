The Government is taking further action to ensure Kiwis can see a doctor, focusing on improved funding for rural practices, faster access to primary care, and a stronger pipeline of locally trained GPs, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

- Updating GP funding to better reflect patient needs
- Setting a new health target for faster GP access
- Backing GP training and retention

“We want all New Zealanders to be able to see a GP when they need one, regardless of where they live,” Mr Brown says.

“In rural areas especially, GP clinics with only one doctor or closed books makes it harder for patients to get timely appointments. We’re committed to changing that.

“The health system should reflect the needs of patients, wherever they live in New Zealand. That’s why we’re making changes to the way GP clinics are funded to ensure money goes where it’s needed most.”

The government’s funding method for GP clinics, known as capitation, will be updated for the first time in more than 20 years. This is proposed to take effect from 1 July 2026.

“The current model is outdated and doesn’t reflect the needs of patients. The revised formula will go beyond just age and sex, to also include multimorbidity, rurality, and socioeconomic deprivation.

“These changes will better distribute funding to where it’s needed most, so that GP clinics with a higher needs population of enrolled patients will receive more funding to care for them.”

The Government is also introducing a new national health target to drive timely access to primary care.

“People shouldn’t have to wait weeks to see a doctor. Delays can lead to poorer health outcomes, more pressure on hospitals, and growing frustration for patients. We’re focused on delivering timely, quality care that puts patients first.”

“This new target will be developed in partnership with the primary care sector and is proposed to ensure that more than 80 per cent of people can see a primary care provider within one week, taking effect from 1 July 2026. It will take effect from 1 July 2026 and aligns with the target of ensuring 80 percent of people receive faster access to primary mental health and addiction services within one week.”

The Government is also making targeted investments in general practice training to strengthen the GP workforce and support long-term retention.

“The General Practice Education Programme (GPEP), delivered by the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners, is the only accredited training and education pathway in New Zealand for doctors wanting to specialise as GPs. Vocational training through GPEP takes a minimum of three years to complete, but currently only the first year of training is funded.

“We are increasing funding for this programme to ensure it is valued and supported in the same way as other medical specialist training programmes.”

As part of this investment, the Government is funding:

- Training fees in 2025 for doctors in their second, third, and post-third year of GPEP to encourage completion of their training
- Exam and preparation costs for around 200 GPEP trainees who have completed, or nearly completed, training but not yet taken the fellowship exam
- Full ongoing training and education costs for approximately 400 GPEP year 2 and 3 trainees each year

“Our goal is to make general practice a more attractive and sustainable career path, especially in rural and high-needs communities, so we can bring more doctors into the areas that need them most.

“By fully covering training and exam costs, we’ll enable hundreds of doctors to complete the pathway to becoming GPs, giving them the support they need to finish their training and enter the health workforce – building a stronger pipeline of experienced GPs who can train and mentor the next generation.

“This Government knows that primary care is the cornerstone of the health system, which is why we’re committed to making it more accessible and responsive to the unique needs of communities.

“Improving access, particularly in rural and underserved areas, will help ease pressure on hospitals and ensure New Zealanders get timely, quality care when and where they need it,” Mr Brown says.
