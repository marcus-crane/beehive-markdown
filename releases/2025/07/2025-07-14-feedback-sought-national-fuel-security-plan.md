The Coalition Government is seeking feedback on a draft Fuel Security Plan that provides a long-term strategy to ensure New Zealanders have reliable access to fuel in times of domestic and global disruption, Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones says.

“As a small and remote island nation that imports nearly all of its liquid fuels, New Zealand is vulnerable to supply chain shocks beyond its borders,” Mr Jones says.

“The Government is seeking to improve our fuel resilience and protect our economic wellbeing so our people and businesses can continue to move, work, and grow. New Zealanders are invited to have their say on the plan.”

The plan builds on findings of the 2025 Fuel Security Study by focusing on four key areas:

- Strengthening resilience against global supply disruptions
- Enhancing domestic fuel infrastructure and emergency preparedness
- Supporting the development of domestic low-carbon fuel alternatives
- Managing fuel security during the transition to new energy technologies

“Our recent decision to [boost minimum fuel reserves](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/increased-diesel-reserves-improve-resilience) and [improve storage locations](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/more-jet-fuel-be-stored-near-auckland-airport) is prudent given the current global geopolitical environment.

“Fuel security is not just an energy issue — it’s an issue of economic and national resilience. The consequences of inaction are too great. The Fuel Security Plan was a key plank in the New Zealand First-National Coalition Agreement to safeguard our transport and logistics systems and emergency services from any international or domestic disruption,” Mr Jones says.

Public submissions are open from 15 July 2025 to 25 August 2025. Feedback can be provided via the MBIE website: [https://www.mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say/draft-fuel-security-plan](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say/draft-fuel-security-plan)
