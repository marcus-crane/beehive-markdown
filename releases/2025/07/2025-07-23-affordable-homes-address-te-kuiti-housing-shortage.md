*Mā te hononga ka whai kaha.*

Te Kūiti whānau will enjoy greater access to modern affordable rental housing thanks to an Iwi-led partnership backed by the Government, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

The Government has approved in principle $17million into a partnership with Ngāti Maniapoto that will build 40 affordable rental homes with infrastructure in Te Kūiti, giving effect to the Crown’s Treaty of Waitangi settlement commitment with the iwi. The Iwi will also contribute a significant portion to the development including $11million - representing 50 percent of the housing supply costs - and the land.

“This is an area of high housing need. With over a third of Te Kūiti residents renting, the limited availability of rental properties makes it difficult for whānau to secure stable housing,” Mr Potaka says.

“We’re taking action to help address this shortage, which will also help local businesses because employers can struggle to attract and retain staff due to the lack of affordable housing. This mahi can mean a world of difference for whānau in small rural communities that need stable employment and incomes.

“The development, named Te Kirikiri, will feature affordable rentals of a mixed typology to meet the diverse needs of kaumātua and young whānau, consisting of 20 two-bedroom accessible homes for kaumātua, 13 three-bedroom homes and 7 four-bedroom homes.

“Work is scheduled to begin next month and will take about two years to complete. 

“Te Kirikiri will incorporate tikanga Māori and kaupapa-led design principles, and include the use of wetlands, native grasses, trees, and shrubs to create safe, communal spaces for whānau to enjoy.

“These affordable rentals will support Ngāti Maniapoto’s ambition to place 200 whānau in safe, secure, high-quality and affordable homes by 2030.”

The Government investment is part of a $200 million commitment announced earlier this year that will accelerate Māori housing projects across the country and enable the delivery of 400 affordable rentals in high-need areas by the end of June 2027.
