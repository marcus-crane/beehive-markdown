The Acting Prime Minister has extended warm congratulations to Hugh Jackson on being crowned the 2025 FMG Young Farmer of the Year.

“Last night I was lucky enough to attend the Young Farmer of the Year grand final in Invercargill. It was a brilliant event, celebrating the future of farming and showcasing their expertise, leadership, and passion for agriculture,” says Mr Seymour. 

“Hugh Jackson from the Waikato Bay of Plenty demonstrated exceptional skill, leadership, and knowledge in one of the most historic competitions in the country. They have a bright future ahead of them, and I wish them all the best for their future in farming.

“Even for a townie from Epsom it’s impossible to not appreciate the contribution farmers make to New Zealand. We are lucky to live in a country that produces food the world loves, and with export revenue on track to surpass $60 billion for the first time, agriculture is very much central to New Zealand’s future prosperity.

“Last night’s awards ceremony was testament not only to the achievements of those competing, but to the strength and future of New Zealand’s rural sector. The industry is in safe hands judging by the talent on display. 

“I’d also like to thank the organisers for inviting me to this event. It is inspiring to see the next generation of farmers being recognized for their talent and passion.”
