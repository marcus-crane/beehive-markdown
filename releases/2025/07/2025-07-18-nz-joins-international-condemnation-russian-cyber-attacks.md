New Zealand has echoed international condemnation of malicious cyber activity by the Russian Government, Foreign Minister Winston Peters says. 

“Russia’s hostile behaviour in cyberspace continues to threaten global cyber security and undermine agreed international rules and norms,” he says. 

Mr Peters’ comments follow UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy’s [statement today](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-russian-spies-at-the-heart-of-putins-malicious-regime) that outlined a campaign of malicious cyber activity by Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

The GRU has undertaken sustained cyber attacks in support of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and enables Russia’s destabilising activity worldwide.

“New Zealand stands with the UK in calling out this behaviour,” Mr Peters says.

The United Kingdom has exposed the role of the GRU’s cyber operations in real world events, including the 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury and the bombing of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Today it has imposed sanctions on the units and individuals responsible.

“New Zealand supports international efforts to impose costs on those responsible for Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine,” Mr Peters says.

“New Zealand will continue to use the Russia Sanctions Act to hold the enablers of Russia’s military to account and press the Russian Government to end its unlawful and unjust war.

“New Zealand has already sanctioned some of the groups and individuals the United Kingdom has acted against today and officials are providing advice on whether further sanctions are appropriate.”

To date, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,800 entities and individuals under the Russia Sanctions Act 2022, including the Head of the GRU and its cyberwarfare units 74455 and 26165, also known as Sandworm and Fancy Bear respectively.
