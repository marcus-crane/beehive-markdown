The Government is focused on the delivery of Dunedin’s new inpatient building, with the establishment of a local engagement group to support the next phase of the New Dunedin Hospital project, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Work is back underway on the inpatient building at the former Cadbury site, marking a critical phase for this major health investment. I’m pleased to announce, alongside Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich, the formation of the Southern Engagement Group, which will help ensure the local community is kept well informed as this vital project progresses,” Mr Brown says.

The group will be established to strengthen communication with the local community as the New Dunedin Hospital project moves into the construction phase. It will bring together Health New Zealand leaders and a range of local stakeholders, including representatives from local government, infrastructure partners, and tertiary institutions, to provide regular updates and support ongoing engagement throughout the project.

Meeting quarterly, the group may consider a broad range of matters relevant to the successful delivery of the hospital. It will not provide advice on the building’s design scope, clinical models of care, or procurement decisions.

“This will ensure the project is well embedded into the fabric of the city and the region, playing a vital role in ensuring the public receives clear and consistent updates as the project progresses.

“The New Dunedin Hospital will be the largest health investment ever made in the South Island. We’re getting on with the job – and the Mayor and I want to make sure the people of Dunedin and the wider region are kept informed every step of the way.”

Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich welcomes the group’s establishment.

“The people of the South are rightly passionate about our new hospital. I’m pleased the Government has listened to the community’s call for it to be built on the right site, with all 11 floors promised. There is understandable interest in the finer details of the construction and fit-out,” Mr Radich says.

“I’m delighted that the Minister has taken up my recommendation of reinstating a community oversight group to keep people engaged and informed. The Southern Engagement Group will ensure community leaders from across the catchment area for our hospital are aware of build progress and understand why key decisions are being made.

“I look forward to working collegially with the Minister, the project team, and the Southern Engagement Group to ensure the delivery of a fit-for-purpose, modern tertiary hospital that will serve our region’s needs for many decades to come.”
