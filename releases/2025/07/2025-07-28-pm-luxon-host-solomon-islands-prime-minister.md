Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele will visit New Zealand this week, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced.

“Solomon Islands is an important partner for New Zealand, with which we share a historic connection,” Mr Luxon says. 

“I am looking forward to furthering our bilateral relationship when I meet Prime Minister Manele. It will also be good to hear about Solomon Islands’ plans for hosting the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in September.”

More than 1,000 Solomon Islanders make New Zealand home, with 1,100 participating in the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme in the last year. 

New Zealand has a long-standing development cooperation partnership with Solomon Islands, which includes support for education, economic development, climate resilience, and peacebuilding.

While in New Zealand, Prime Minister Manele will attend various business and community events. He will also meet Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones. Prime Minister Manele last visited New Zealand in his former capacity as Solomon Islands Foreign Minister in 2022.
