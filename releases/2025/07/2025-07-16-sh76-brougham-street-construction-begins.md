Work is set to start on major upgrades to State Highway 76 (SH76) Brougham Street in Christchurch that will support economic growth and make it safer and easier for people to move through the city, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Earlier this year the Government confirmed Crown funding for this Road of Regional Significance, and being in Christchurch to turn the first sod today is an exciting step forward,” Mr Bishop says.

“Congestion and safety on SH76 Brougham Street have been issues of concern for Christchurch for some time now. Projects like this one are being prioritised by this Government because they’ll significantly improve how people, vehicles and freight get from A to B, and because of the flow-on productivity benefits to the wider roading network and our economy.

“SH76 Brougham Street is one of Christchurch’s busiest streets. It carries more than 45,000 vehicles per day, and it also serves as the main freight route to the South Island’s largest port at Lyttelton.

“There are also several schools and a retirement home close by, so the first stage of the project will focus on a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over Brougham Street at Collins Street and Simeon Street. This bridge will provide a safe crossing for kids getting to and from school, and for people with impaired mobility.

“Fulton Hogan will deliver the first stage of the project, with the bridge expected to be completed in about two years.

“The second stage of the upgrades will include improved traffic signals, T2 lanes (for vehicles with two or more occupants), new signalised crossings, and a shared path along the south side of Brougham Street.

“The Brougham Street upgrades are great example of the Government’s drive to deliver transport projects that will make a real difference for New Zealanders.”

- Cabinet has confirmed funding for the SH76 Brougham Street upgrades to be a drawn down from the tagged contingency set aside in Budget 2024 to enable NZTA to bring forward priority projects that would otherwise be phased to begin from 2027 onwards.
