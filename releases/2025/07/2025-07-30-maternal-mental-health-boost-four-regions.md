More women and families in need of specialist mental health support during and after pregnancy will soon have better access to care, with new investment being directed to Waikato, Hawke’s Bay, Mid Central, and the Wellington region.

Pregnancy and early parenthood can be a challenging time. This funding will mean more women can access the right care when they need it. These services can be life-changing not only for mothers but also for their babies and wider families,” Mr Doocey says.

“While becoming a parent is often a time of great joy, it can also bring real challenges for some. This funding will enable those who need extra support, whether they are facing mental health challenges during pregnancy or postpartum, to access the care they need.

“It will also provide support for those experiencing distress following birth trauma or stillbirth.

“The additional $4.9 million announced today targets four regions identified as having lower levels of investment in maternal mental health. This new funding will help ensure more equitable access across the country.

“The investment will create more clinical and non-clinical roles within community-based specialist infant and maternal mental health services. It will also fund intensive home-based care packages for those with higher needs. Evidence shows these measures make a significant difference for pregnant women, mothers, their babies, and families.

“We’re turning the corner on reducing wait times and increasing the workforce. Recent data shows Health New Zealand’s frontline mental health workforce has grown around 10% since we came into Government and over 80% of people are being seen within three weeks for specialist services.

“When someone reaches out for help whether it’s you, your child, a friend or family member this Government is committed to ensuring support is available. Today’s announcement will continue with the progress being made in ensuring that support is there.”
