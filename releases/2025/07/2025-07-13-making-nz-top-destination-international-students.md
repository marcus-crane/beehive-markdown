The Government’s going for growth in international education, releasing its plan to double the sector’s economic contribution to $7.2 billion by 2034. 

“International education is one of our largest exports, injecting $3.6 billion into our economy in 2024. It also provides opportunities for research, strengthening trade and people-to-people connections, which are important to drive investment, productivity and innovation in New Zealand.

“On average in 2024, an international student spent $45,000 across the year. That means more visits to our cafes and restaurants, more people visiting our iconic attractions and ultimately more jobs being created.

“With international student enrolments steadily increasing since 2023, we want to supercharge that growth track and make New Zealand the destination of choice for international students,” says Education Minister Erica Stanford.

To support this, from November the Government will:

- Increase in-study work rights from 20 to 25 hours per week for eligible student visa holders.
- Extend eligibility for in-study work rights to all tertiary students in approved exchange or Study Abroad programmes, including programmes one-semester long.

In addition, the following will be investigated:

- Introduce a short-duration work visa of up to six months to provide some international graduates who do not qualify for post-study work rights, allowing time to seek employment in their field of study under the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) pathway.
- Updates to make it easier for students to apply for multi-year visas.

*The International Education Going for Growth Plan* sets out short, medium and long-term actions for agencies to boost New Zealand’s presence in overseas markets, attract talented students, build sector capacity and capability, and support the university sector through system improvements.

Its objectives are:

- raise awareness of New Zealand as a study destination from 40% in 2024, to 42% in 2027 and 44% by 2034.
- grow student enrolments from 83,400 in 2024 to 105,000 in 2027 and 119,000 by 2034.
- increase the proportion of prospective students rating NZ among their top 3 choices of study destination from 18% in 2024 to 20% in 2027 and 22% in 2034.

“In the short term, Education New Zealand will focus its promotional efforts on markets with the highest potential for growth. Across all markets, promotional activities will aim to elevate awareness of New Zealand as a premier study destination that is a safe and welcoming place to live and learn.

“To achieve our ambitious target, we’re taking a considered and strategic approach. It’s important to strike the right balance between increasing student numbers, maintaining the quality of education, and managing broader impacts on New Zealanders. Our plan will deliver that,” says Ms Stanford.
