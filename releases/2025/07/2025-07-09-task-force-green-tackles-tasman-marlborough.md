The Government has activated an Enhanced Task Force Green (ETFG) in response to flooding in the Tasman and Marlborough districts. 

“Enhanced Task Force Green funding builds on the Government’s commitment to support those impacted by this event,” Minister for Social Development and Employment Louise Upston says. 

“The recent flooding has been a significant and adverse event damaging farms, homes, roads and bridges. 

“The ETFG programme puts job seekers to work where they will be of most help to the farmers and growers cleaning up their properties. This may include clearing debris, clearing fence lines and repairing buildings and waterways. 

“It also provides support to enable public assets such as community halls and gardens, playgrounds and public spaces to be returned to the same condition they were prior to the event.

“Across the affected areas, damage assessments are being carried out. The Ministry of Social Development will work with agencies to make sure Enhanced Task Force Green assistance is provided as soon as possible to farmers and growers in need of this support.

“We know these are resilient communities which are pulling together to help each other. ETFG is designed to support those efforts and to lend a hand.”

Farmers and growers can self-register for clean-up help by contacting the Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254. 

Local job seekers available to help with the clean-up effort can register their interest by emailing [totsemploymentteam@msd.govt.nz](mailto:totsemploymentteam@msd.govt.nz) or contacting Work and Income on 0800  559 009.
