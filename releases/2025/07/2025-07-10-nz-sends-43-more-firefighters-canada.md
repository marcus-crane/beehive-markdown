Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden says Fire and Emergency New Zealand is deploying an additional 43-person taskforce to Manitoba, Canada on Sunday 13 July to bolster support of Canada’s response to severe wildfires.

“This deployment is in addition to the seven firefighters who left New Zealand on Wednesday. As wildfires continue to burn across Canada it is important that New Zealand supports the firefighting efforts by Canadian crews,” says Ms van Velden.

The taskforce consists of an agency representative, two taskforce leaders and eight five-person arduous firefighting crews. Like the specialist team, it is intended that they will be deployed for approximately five weeks.

“I would like to commend all of those being deployed for answering the call of our Canadian colleagues in their time of need, giving up time with their families to do this important work.”

“As well as benefitting the Canadian crews, the deployment is also valuable experience for personnel at Fire and Emergency New Zealand.”

Across Canada there are 518 active wildfires. 105 of these are in the Manitoba province, with fourteen new fires starting in the last 24 hours.
