The Government is today announcing the reestablishment of the Health New Zealand Board, with new appointments to drive its priority of ensuring timely, quality healthcare for all New Zealanders, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

The re-established Health New Zealand Board will take over from the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners appointed last year to stabilise the organisation and set a clear direction.

“Under Professor Lester Levy’s leadership as Commissioner, Health New Zealand has delivered a strong financial plan, and a clear Health Delivery Plan is now in place. He is refocusing the organisation on patients and driving progress on the Government’s health targets, which are seeing waitlists reduced,” Mr Brown says.

Professor Levy has been appointed Chair of Health New Zealand for a 12-month term to ensure continuity of leadership. His appointment will maintain momentum on the Government’s health targets and keep the focus firmly on patients. Mr Brown also announced his intention to begin a nomination process later this year for a permanent Chair to take effect from 1 July 2026.

“I have also appointed an experienced team of Board members who will support Health New Zealand to deliver for patients, including the appointment of Dr Andrew Connolly as Deputy Chair. Dr Connolly is an experienced surgeon and clinical director who has also held numerous appointments across Governments, including Chair of the Medical Council, Crown Monitor, and Commissioner on District Health Boards.

“I am also appointing Hamiora Bowkett as a Crown Observer to keep a close watch on performance and support the Board with independent oversight. This role will focus on supporting the Board’s re-establishment and ensuring Health New Zealand delivers on the Government’s health targets. Mr Bowkett will advise me directly, with a particular focus on Health New Zealand’s financial position and the delivery of health targets.”

“We’re also tackling one of the biggest barriers to better care - our ageing health infrastructure - by establishing a dedicated Infrastructure Committee to make sure our Government’s significant investment in health infrastructure delivers modern facilities, on time and on budget.

“This is about accountability. Patients care about seeing a doctor sooner, getting their hip surgery faster, being treated in a hospital that works. That’s what these governance changes are designed to achieve.”

The key appointments include:

- Professor Lester Levy, currently Commissioner of Health New Zealand and Chair of the Health Research Council, has been appointed Chair of the Health New Zealand Board for a 12-month term.
- Dr Andrew Connolly, a senior surgeon and clinical leader, is appointed Deputy Chair.
- Board members include Roger Jarrold, Dr Frances Hughes, Parekawhia McLean, Peter McCardle, and Terry Moore.
- Hamiora Bowkett is appointed as Crown Observer to support and monitor Health New Zealand.
- A new Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Dr Margaret Wilsher, will oversee the delivery of critical health projects, supported by experienced members: Mark Binns, James Christmas, Sarah Sinclair, Evan Davies, and Roger Jarrold.

“I want to acknowledge the work of Professor Levy as Commissioner, and thank Deputy Commissioners Roger Jarrold, Ken Whelan, and Kylie Clegg for the rapid progress they have made in refocusing Health New Zealand on patients.

"There is still much work to do, and I look forward to working with the Health New Zealand Board to deliver for patients, achieve the Government’s health targets, and continue driving progress on the key priorities I announced in March.

“These changes ensure we have the right people in the right roles to get it done.”

Appointed members will assume their roles on 23 July 2025, when the Commission ends.
