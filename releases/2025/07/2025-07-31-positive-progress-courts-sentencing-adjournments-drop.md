Minister for Courts Nicole McKee is welcoming new data showing a significant drop in sentencing adjournments in the District Court, reflecting ongoing improvements in court efficiency.

 

“Over the past two years, sentencing adjournments in the criminal jurisdiction have fallen from 36 to 29 per cent, resulting in nearly 2,900 fewer delayed sentencing hearings.  This means more cases are proceeding as planned, freeing up court time and helping more people access timely justice,” Mrs McKee says.

 

Mrs McKee credits the success to the collaborative efforts of the District Court Timeliness Programme, the Sentencing Ready team supported by priority rostering, and the Prosecutions Uplift Programme.

 

Reducing delays benefits victims, defendants, witnesses, and their families by allowing swift justice and enabling people to move forward with their lives.

 

To build on this progress, new Case Review Hearing Guidelines introduced nationwide from 1 August by the Chief District Court Judge will help ensure trials proceed on schedule by confirming all parties are fully prepared.

 

“These guidelines provide a clear process for reviewing evidence and resolving issues before trial, improving scheduling accuracy and court efficiency. They have been piloted successfully in Auckland and Waitākere District Courts and are an important step in reducing court backlogs,” Mrs McKee says.

 

“With national backlogs decreasing, we are seeing real results from these collective efforts to keep our courts moving.”
