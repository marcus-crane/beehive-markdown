With adverse weather forecast for the Top of the South, the Bay of Plenty and parts of Northland, Agriculture Minister Todd McClay is urging farmers, foresters, and growers to prepare for potential challenges.

Two orange rain warnings have been issued for these regions, signalling the possibility of surface flooding and slips, particularly with upwards of 100mm of rain expected in the Bay of Plenty and the third rainfall event in the Top of the South in just six weeks.

“The compounding effect of these weather events on rural communities is significant, and we are committed to providing the necessary support.

“MPI staff are ready and available to assist, with additional staff deployed in the Top of the South and regional staff closely monitoring the Bay of Plenty. We have 15 MPI staff on the ground in the Nelson/Tasman area and people available across the Bay,” Mr McClay says.

Farmers are advised to move stock to higher ground ahead of the storm.

“We understand the pressure and uncertainty rural communities are facing right now, and we remain focused on ensuring they have the resources to manage this event and any challenges ahead.”

For more updates, farmers, foresters, and growers are encouraged to continue monitoring weather warnings.
