Jobseeker beneficiaries will be the focus of the Government’s employment programmes over the next three years, says Minister Louise Upston.

Minister Upston has welcomed an updated Ministry of Social Development employment investment strategy which runs through to June 2028, describing it as overdue.

“Prioritising beneficiaries into jobs should always be the employment focus for MSD but unfortunately that hasn’t always been the case,” Louise Upston says.

“This updated strategy makes it crystal clear MSD needs to be consistently focused on the job seekers already on benefits and getting them sorted first because that’s where they can make the most impact.

“I’ve also instructed MSD that it needs to work in more targeted ways, particularly when it comes to young people. 

“That’s important because recent forecasts show that people under the age of 25 on Jobseeker Support are estimated to spend an average of 18 or more years on a benefit over their lifetimes - 49 per cent longer than in 2017. 

“This is a human tragedy. We need to focus on the potential of one of New Zealand’s most powerful assets - our young people - and get them straight into first jobs.

“Frontline MSD staff do work hard in this area, and I know case managers working directly with clients is where MSD can make a real difference. This strategy reinforces that approach.

“Employment case management is important and should also be straightforward and practical. It can include something as simple as helping someone get an up-to-date CV, through to passing a driver licence. 

“The Government continues to support MSD’s frontline staff - this year, Budget 2025 invested in retaining 490 frontline staff to help deliver vital employment services.

“Preventing young people getting stuck on a benefit will also be vitally important as we go on.  Already in this term, we’ve introduced a new phone-based employment case management service which includes 6,000 18-24-year-old clients, we’ve got 2,100 more places for young people to get community job coaching, more regular work seminars, and a traffic light system to help them stay on track with their obligations.

“And just in the past weeks, MSD has kicked off a series of regional employment events, bringing together employers, providers and community organisations focused on a common goal – getting people into work.

“I’m also attending those events and hearing first-hand what’s needed to support employers, and job seekers.  Our Government is determined to get Kiwis into jobs, grow New Zealand businesses, and grow the economy.”
