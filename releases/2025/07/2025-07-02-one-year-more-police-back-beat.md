One year on, more Police on the beat across New Zealand’s major cities is being celebrated by Police Minister Mark Mitchell.

“Today I am excited to be part of welcoming the new Beat Team in Rotorua and getting some time to be out on the beat with them,” Mark Mitchell says.

“Our beat officers have an important role in ensuring our retailers and members of the public feel and are safe.  

“We know it makes a huge difference to our communities to see Police out on the streets. Not only does it make people feel safer, we know it discourages crime.”

Police report that the beat teams in Wellington, Christchurch, and Auckland have done 14,108 hours of foot patrols on the beat since starting in July last year to the end of April this year. This is an increase of 189% from the same period in 2023-2024. 

“We have already seen the positive impact our Police beat teams are having across our major CBDs.  Police data shows in the last 12 months robberies have reduced in Auckland by 25 per cent, in Wellington by 22 per cent, and Christchurch by 67 per cent. 

“These results are encouraging, and shows inroads are being made at the violent end of retail crime, but we know there is more to do, particularly to address low level theft.   

“As announced this week, stronger penalties for theft will ensure real consequences for shoplifters and help protect the livelihood of our retailers. 

“Getting on top of retail crime is a priority, and we will continue to back Police with the powers and tools they need to deter and hold offenders to account.  

“I look forward to seeing more community beat teams rolled out into towns and regional centres over the course of the year.”
