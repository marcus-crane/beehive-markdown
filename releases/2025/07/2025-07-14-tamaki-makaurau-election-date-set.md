The Tāmaki Makaurau by-election will be held on Saturday 6 September, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has announced.

The by-election follows the death of MP Takutai Tarsh Kemp.

“Given the vacancy in the seat has now been gazetted, I have set a date of 6 September for the by-election,” says Mr Luxon.

The by-election Writ Day will be Wednesday 30 July. The deadline for candidate nominations to be received will be midday Tuesday 5 August, and the last day for the return of the Writ will be Sunday 28 September.
