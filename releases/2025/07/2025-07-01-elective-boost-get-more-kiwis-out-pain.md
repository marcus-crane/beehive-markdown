Thousands more New Zealanders will get the procedures they need faster, with the Government today announcing 21,000 more elective procedures over the next year through its Elective Boost programme, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“With over 215,000 procedures set to go ahead over the next year – over 21,000 more than previously planned – wait times will reduce, helping more Kiwis access life-changing operations like hip and knee replacements and cataract surgeries sooner.

“Our Government is focused on real delivery. For patients stuck on surgical waitlists, that means getting their procedures faster, no matter where they live or who provides it.

“We’re making the health system work smarter, using both public hospitals and private providers in a coordinated national effort. New Zealanders don’t care who does the operation – they just want it done and done quickly.”

Many of the procedures will be delivered in Health New Zealand’s dedicated elective facilities, including Manukau Health Park, Tōtara Haumaru on the North Shore, and Burwood Hospital in Christchurch. Others will be completed by private hospitals under new national agreements.

The next phase of the Elective Boost follows strong early results: 

- More than 12,764 procedures delivered to 1 June, outpacing the 10,579 target set for 30 June.
- The majority of procedures delivered have been for people waiting longer than four months for treatment.
- Statements of work issued to 60 private providers to deliver surgery at consistent national rates.

“We’re taking a joined-up approach to procedure delivery. That means removing hold-ups, providing certainty, and unlocking capacity across the system,” Mr Brown says.

“This is how we start to fix the waitlist crisis that grew under the previous government. Too many Kiwis have been waiting in pain for procedures that could transform their lives – a tradie needing a shoulder operation to get back to work, a nana needing cataract surgery to see her grandkids clearly, or a child waiting months for tonsils to be removed. We’re turning that around.”

Mr Brown says the long-term goal is to treat 95 per cent of patients within four months by 2030 as part of the Government’s health targets.

“Our Government is investing $30 billion a year in health, and we’re backing that investment with a relentless focus on delivery. We are ramping up capacity in public hospitals, partnering with private providers in a more strategic way, and most importantly, we are getting Kiwis the care they need,” Mr Brown says.

“We’ve already delivered thousands of extra procedures through the Elective Boost, and now we’re building on that with thousands more to put patients first.”
