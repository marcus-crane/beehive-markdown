The Government is increasing its financial contribution to support rural communities in the Nelson Tasman Region, with additional funding to help farmers, foresters, growers and rural contractors recover from recent severe weather events.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay speaking during a visit to the Tasman District today announced an additional $600,000 in Government and industry support, bringing the total Government financial contribution for the affected primary sector to $500,000.

“These regions have experienced significant damage to forests, farms and rural infrastructure. This funding will help meet immediate recovery needs and help rural businesses get back on their feet,” Mr McClay says.

The support package includes:

- A $300,000 Government contribution to the Mayoral Relief Fund tagged to the rural sector.
- $100,000 contribution by the Government and Federated Farmers to the Farmers Adverse Events Trust to support with the immediate recovery needs for the most impacted pastoral farmers in the Nelson Tasman region.
- $100,000 contribution by the Government and Horticulture New Zealand, to help the horticulture sector across the Top of the South.
- $100,000 announced by Government in June to support and coordinate recovery efforts, including $20,000 for the Top of the South Rural Support Trust.

“We continue to work with New Zealand Winegrowers to ensure appropriate support for affected vineyards, including the potential use of Enhanced Taskforce Green,” Mr McClay said.

“Many farmers and growers are facing their second clean-up in a fortnight from floods and storm damage. Rural communities are resilient, but the relentless wet weather conditions have taken a toll. This support is designed to provide meaningful and direct assistance quickly,” Mr McClay says.

MPI staff are on the ground working with the Rural Support Trust and industry groups assessing damage and coordinating assistance.

“Farmers, foresters and growers will face many, many months of work to repair damage to their land and get their businesses back on track. We will continue to assess what further assistance might be required.”

“Farmers and growers who need help or assistance should in the first instance contact their local Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254,” Mr McClay said.
