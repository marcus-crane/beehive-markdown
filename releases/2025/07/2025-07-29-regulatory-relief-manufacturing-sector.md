Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Brooke van Velden is consulting with manufacturers, including wood processors, bakers, and millers to help businesses focus on managing genuine risks rather than navigating red tape.

“We’re simplifying machine guarding rules and reviewing exposure standards to reduce complexity and improve consistency in the manufacturing sector,” says Ms van Velden.

The proposed changes aim to ensure standards reflect real-world risks and align with international benchmarks. Manufacturers have said that the current rules are unclear and difficult to apply, leading to unnecessary costs and compliance burden.

As an example of the law’s confusion, a business owner told me they got conflicting advice from WorkSafe inspectors on identical machinery guarding in Auckland and Christchurch, deeming the same machine guarding to be compliant in one city but non-compliant in another city.

“During my nationwide consultation and roadshow, businesses described the law as full of grey areas, with outdated guidance that creates confusion and unnecessary cost. We’re acting on that feedback, with changes designed to address the specific pain points raised.”

One key change is the simplification of machine guarding rules, which support the safe use of machinery, in the Health and Safety in Employment Regulations.

As an example of how out of date the machine guarding rules are, there are some in the meat industry who believe that machine guarding rules conflict with food safety cleaning requirements.

We will be consulting on replacing the requirements with a more flexible, risk-based approach. WorkSafe guidance will continue to support businesses in applying appropriate controls.

Although this will be a great help to the manufacturing sector, it will be beneficial for a range of sectors working with machinery including agriculture, horticulture, construction and food production.

“Feedback on machine guarding has highlighted the need for greater consistency when using machinery. These changes will enable businesses to use a wider range of tools while applying updated safety measures to keep their staff safe.”

Wood processors and manufacturers also gave feedback that they feel constrained by Workplace Exposure Standards that don’t reflect operational realities or international benchmarks. 

“Many described the current approach as overly rigid and unclear, with one participant saying the standards are ‘an overreaction to risk which will cripple the industry’.”

The Workplace Exposure Standards for soft wood dust, hard wood dust, and welding fumes will be reviewed, with an aim to improve clarity and better align with international standards.

“Businesses expressed frustration that the wood dust standard is impractical and not based on realistic risk assessments. They want a system that is both protective and practical, and these changes aim to provide that.”

WorkSafe will also look at updating the Workplace Exposure Standard for flour dust, which is designed to minimise the risk of respiratory problems.

“This is an example of the Red Tape Tipline making a difference, addressing regulations that increase the price of food,” says Mr Seymour.

“Concerned bakers made a submission to the Ministry for Regulation, raising concerns that the permitted concentration of flour dust was so stringent it would ruin their business.

“One commercial stakeholder said they had invested millions in retrofitted air conditioning units, purchasing new industrial vacuum cleaners, and additional controls in bakeries including deep cleaning, but it was still almost impossible to comply with the regulation.

“These costs eventually flow down to prices at the checkout. It’s another example of how permissive regulations, no matter how small they might seem on paper, make a difference to the cost of everything in New Zealand.

“The review will consider international benchmarks and feasibility considerations, such as measurability. This will provide bakers and millers with more confidence that they have met safety standards, reducing the cost and stress of overcompliance and price of food,” says Mr Seymour.

This review will be undertaken in consultation with those in the manufacturing sector over the coming months to ensure they are practical and effective.

“Simplifying machine guarding rules and reviewing the Workplace Exposure Standards will make it easier for people to do the right thing, without compromising safety,” says Ms van Velden.

“These changes will save time and costs for businesses and workers as we cut-red-tape to make it easier to do business. When our Kiwi businesses thrive, there are more jobs and lower prices for all New Zealanders.”
