A new outpatient hysteroscopy service launched at North Shore Hospital will help women get faster diagnoses by combining their first specialist assessment and diagnostic procedure into a single visit, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is a practical, patient-focused pathway that means women can get the answers they need sooner, without the stress and delays of multiple appointments or hospital admission,” Mr Brown says.

“Previously, women needing a hysteroscopy would attend an initial specialist appointment and then wait weeks to undergo the procedure in theatre under general anaesthetic. The new approach removes that delay for women suitable to for this treatment model.

“Now, women needing an uncomplicated hysteroscopy procedure can choose to have both the specialist assessment and the procedure in a single outpatient appointment. That means fewer hospital visits, less time off work or away from family, and a much more streamlined experience.

“For women with a high suspicion of cancer, this pathway can reduce the diagnostic timeline by two to six weeks compared to traditional models. That time could make all the difference.”

North Shore Hospital expects to deliver around 60 outpatient hysteroscopy clinics over the next 12 months, with approximately 240 procedures.

“Every outpatient procedure frees up valuable theatre space and clinical teams for patients who require more complex surgery. That’s better for patients, and better for the whole system.”

This means that a significant proportion of uncomplicated hysteroscopies that would have otherwise been performed in theatre under anaesthesia can now be done safely as outpatient procedures.

The new service follows similar successful models already operating in Auckland, Counties Manukau, and Waikato.

“This is part of a regional effort to improve the quality, timeliness, and experience of care for women undergoing investigation for gynaecological cancers. It will also play an important role in meeting our faster cancer treatment target by speeding up diagnosis and helping women start treatment sooner.

“We’re focused on what matters: putting patients first, getting people seen sooner, and delivering a health system that works better for patients,” Mr Brown says.
