Work is back underway on Dunedin’s new inpatient building, marking a major step forward in the Government’s commitment to delivering this critical health project, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“It’s great to be back in Dunedin to see physical works now underway again on the former Cadbury site. This visible progress clearly demonstrates our commitment to delivering this vital project.” 

The early construction phase will see 134 pile caps installed, made from steel-reinforced concrete. Around 4,300 cubic metres of concrete will be poured across the site, with approximately 490 tonnes of reinforcing steel used in total. 

“This work will take about six months and includes detailed inspections of every pile to ensure the facility is built to the highest design and safety standards.” 

The next major construction phase is the substructure, which is expected to begin in early 2026, with contract awards due soon following strong market interest. 

“This phase will prepare the site for base isolators and IL4 foundations – ensuring the hospital can keep functioning after a major earthquake or natural disaster. That’s essential for the people of Dunedin and the wider region.” 

The inpatient building will be the largest single health facility in New Zealand, covering approximately 70,000 square metres. 

“We’re delivering a hospital that’s not only future-proofed for changing models of care and technology but also built to grow with the population. The design allows for flexibility, scalability, and high-quality care delivery for decades to come. 

"Significant progress has also been made on the outpatient building, which will begin delivering care to patients in a modern, purpose-built facility from next year. 

“Our Government is committed to delivering both buildings and ensuring the people of Dunedin and surrounding Otago and Southland region have a fully operational, modern hospital. 

“By 2031, Dunedin will have a resilient, fit-for-purpose health facility that will serve the city and wider region for generations to come. We are getting on with the job – and today’s progress is further proof that this Government is delivering,” Mr Brown says.
