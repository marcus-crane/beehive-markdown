Selwyn District is the first council in the country to launch its new water services entity, Selwyn Water, meaning safe, reliable, and affordable drinking water and wastewater for ratepayers, Local Government Minister Simon Watts says.

“The launch of Selwyn District’s water service entity today marks a significant milestone of water reform, and I look forward to seeing similar Local Water Done Well plans progress in the coming months,” Mr Watts says.

“Selwyn District Council is also the first council to have a Water Services Delivery Plan accepted and approved by the Secretary for Local Government, Paul James and the first to establish a water services council-controlled organisation (CCO) under the Coalition Government’s Local Water Done Well policy.

“Selwyn District has demonstrated it has a financially sustainable plan for the delivery of water services that meet health, quality, and environmental standards, along with community expectations.

“I will be watching with interest how Selwyn Water manages the projected price increases for consumers during the initial years of their plan. I expect the Commerce Commission, as the economic regulator, will closely monitor to ensure the delivery of forecast levels of capital investment, justify the price.

“It is also my expectation that Selwyn Water will keep a close eye on its charges for new infrastructure to ensure that growth pays for growth.

“I am encouraged by advice from officials that future partnership opportunities with neighbouring councils are a core consideration in Selwyn District Council’s Plan.

“These future partnership opportunities have significant potential to deliver greater efficiencies, standardisation, knowledge sharing, and ultimately, lower costs for consumers.

“Selwyn Water’s constitution provides flexibility if other councils and communities seek the benefits of a regional water services CCO. This option bodes well for the future of water services in the wider region.

“The Department of Internal Affairs will continue to encourage councils to progress discussions with neighbours regarding future consolidation of water services for the benefit of consumers.”

Mr Watts says Selwyn’s progress demonstrates the effectiveness of local leadership when backed by sound, practical Government policy and legislation, including Local Water Done Well.

“Selwyn Mayor Sam Broughton, his councillors and staff have the Government’s congratulations for their vision and hard work in making such swift progress.”
