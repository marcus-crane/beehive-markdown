The Government is fulfilling a significant commitment to vulnerable Kiwi kids, with the appointment of Dr Ang Jury, ONZM as Chair of the new Board for the Independent Children’s Monitor.

The Monitor is one of three statutory bodies having oversight of the Oranga Tamariki system, along with the Children’s Commissioner and the Ombudsman.

“This marks a significant step for vulnerable children,” Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston says. 

“The legislative changes I have taken through Parliament this year have enabled this appointment, reflecting commitments in the National-ACT coalition agreement to create a truly independent monitoring and oversight agency for Oranga Tamariki.

“As current chief executive of Women’s Refuge, Dr Jury is an outstanding appointee and will serve a five-year term. She brings expertise in the wider social and Oranga Tamariki sectors. 

“Her commitment and senior leadership experience will support the successful establishment of the new Board from 1 August 2025.”

Dr Jury’s role with Women's Refuge is expected to conclude by the end of the year. 

Other Board members will be appointed in due course.

The Monitor’s current Chief Executive, Arran Jones, will remain in his role from 1 August 2025 to 31 July 2026 to oversee and support the organisation’s transition.
