Parents will know more about how their children are doing at school with the confirmation of a new assessment tool in Years 3-10 classrooms from 2026, the latest part of the Government’s plan to teach the basics brilliantly.

Janison Solution Pty Ltd will deliver the Student, Monitoring, Assessment and Reporting Tool (SMART) which will enable twice-yearly assessment of reading, writing and maths in schools nationwide.

“Last year the Auditor General found there was no consistent and comprehensive summary of student achievement and progress in New Zealand, and what information the Ministry of Education had was more detailed for some students than for others. This new tool changes that,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“The check-ins will be low stakes measures of student progress and provide teachers with information on next steps in learning. They’ll give parents confidence as to how their children are progressing so they can support learning at home. It will also provide crucial information to the Government to know where to invest more resource to help accelerate learning.” 

SMART will be modern, flexible and curriculum aligned. It will also be bilingual to cover pānui, tuhituhi and pāngarau in kura. Years 9 and 10 have been included so parents and teachers know how ready students are for NCEA.

“This builds on our new suite of classroom tools that help parents and teachers understand more about student progress. The Phonics Checks undertaken at 20 weeks of schooling and repeated at 40 weeks identifies a child’s reading ability early and wrap around support if needed. A similar approach is being taken with maths, from 2026 every child will have their maths ability checked in Year 2. 

“I am committed to helping parents clearly understand their child’s progress at school, because when parents are informed and involved, students are more likely to reach their full potential,” Ms Stanford says.
