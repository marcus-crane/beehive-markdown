Tāwhaki Joint Venture’s crucial role in the Government’s drive to grow our space and advanced aviation sectors has received a $5.85 million boost, Space Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“These are rapidly growing sectors, with space alone growing 53 percent in the five years to 2024, contributing $2.47 billion to the economy in 2023-24,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government sees space and advanced aviation as having huge economic potential, and that’s why we’re working towards delivering a [world-class regulatory environment for advanced aviation](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-helping-advanced-aviation-take) by the end of this year, as signalled less than a year ago.

“The first step towards this was Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre being allocated permanent Special Use Airspace - essentially a test flight area that gives advanced aviation companies the freedom to safely trial next-generation technologies.

“Already companies such as Kea Aerospace, Syos and Dawn Aerospace are using Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre for test flights,” Ms Collins says.

“The Crown’s $5.85 million in operational funding over the next three years will support the Tāwhaki Joint Venture to grow its role as a national aerospace centre and innovation hub.

“This funding will help it scale up aerospace operations, attract new customers, and strengthen New Zealand’s position in the global advanced aviation sector.”

Tāwhaki was established in 2021 by the Crown and two Rūnanga, Te Taumutu and Wairewa, and has established key infrastructure at Canterbury’s Kaitorete Spit, including a sealed runway and hangar.

“The operational funding takes the Crown investment in Tāwhaki to more than $35 million, with this latest phase aimed at ensuring the venture continues to grow, attract commercial operators and deliver long-term value for the region and the country.”
