Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti has launched New Zealand’s first AI Strategy to boost productivity and grow a competitive economy.

“AI could add $76 billion to our GDP by 2038, but we’re falling behind other small, advanced economies on AI-readiness and many businesses are still not planning for the technology,” says Dr Reti.

“We must develop stronger Kiwi AI capabilities to drive economic growth, and this Strategy sends a strong signal that New Zealand supports the uptake of AI.

“The Government’s role in AI is to reduce barriers to adoption, provide clear regulatory guidance, and promote responsible AI adoption.

“We’re taking a light-touch approach, and the Strategy sets out a commitment to create an enabling regulatory environment that gives businesses confidence to invest in the technology.

“Private sector AI adoption and innovation will boost productivity by unlocking new products and services, increasing efficiency, and supporting better decision-making.

“New Zealand’s strength lies in being smart adopters. From AI-powered precision farming techniques to diagnostic technology in healthcare, Kiwi businesses can tailor AI to solve our unique challenges and deliver world-leading solutions.”

The Strategy aligns with OECD AI Principles and the Government will continue to work with international partners on global rules to support the responsible use and development of AI.

“New Zealanders will need to develop trust and give social licence to AI use, so the Government has also released Responsible AI Guidance to help businesses safely use, develop and innovate with the technology,” says Dr Reti.

The Government will use existing legislation and regulations such as privacy, consumer protection and human rights, to manage risk and privacy concerns.
