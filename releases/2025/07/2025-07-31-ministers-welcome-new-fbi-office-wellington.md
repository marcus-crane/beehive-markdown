The FBI’s upgrade of its Wellington office demonstrates the strength of the Five Eyes partnership and enhances the safety and security of New Zealanders, the Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS Judith Collins and Police Minister Mark Mitchell say.

The Ministers met with FBI Director Kash Patel, who officially opened the new Wellington office at the US Embassy earlier today and installed a permanent Legat position. 

“We exchanged a range of insights on areas such as trans-national organised crime, counter-terrorism, cyber-security and espionage,” Ms Collins says.

“NZSIS and GCSB relationships with overseas partners like the FBI, as well as their support to New Zealand Police, are an important part of how the intelligence agencies deliver on their mission to keep New Zealand safe and secure.”   

Mr Mitchell says Director Patel’s visit should send a clear message to criminals whose offending causes harm in our communities, wherever they are, that they cannot hide behind an international border.

“New Zealand Police are continually working with their overseas counterparts like the FBI to catch those engaged in illegal, harmful activities such as drug smuggling and online child exploitation, as well disrupting and preventing this offending from happening in the first place,” he says.

“Police are part of a global effort on law enforcement. Director Patel’s visit was an excellent opportunity to share our common concerns while reinforcing the importance of New Zealand and the US working together to protect our citizens.”

Director Patel is the most senior member of the US administration to visit New Zealand since the start of President Trump’s second term in office.
