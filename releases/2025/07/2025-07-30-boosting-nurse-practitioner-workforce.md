Expressions of interest open today for registered nurses wanting to take the next training step in their career to become nurse practitioners, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Too often, patients wait longer than they should to see a health professional. Expanding the nurse practitioner workforce means faster, more consistent care for those who need it most,” Mr Brown says.

“That’s why we’re supporting up to 120 registered nurses each year to become nurse practitioners in primary care.”

Nurse practitioners are highly trained clinicians who can assess, diagnose and treat complex conditions, prescribe medicines, and manage ongoing care.

“In rural communities, nurse practitioners often serve as the lead primary care provider for patients, delivering essential care close to home.

“Nurse practitioners are a vital part of a modern health system. They reduce pressure on GPs, strengthen continuity of care, and help ensure patients are seen sooner and treated faster.

“There are currently 897 nurse practitioners registered in New Zealand, including 339 working in primary care. We’re committed to growing this workforce and enabling more nurses to work in the nurse practitioner advanced scope of practice.”

Next month, primary care scholarships will open for nurses who want to undertake advanced practice education, such as registered nurse prescribing.

Applications are also open for primary care employers to recruit and support up to 400 graduate nurses each year. Funding includes $20,000 for each graduate registered nurse employed by rural primary and community health providers, and $15,000 for those employed by urban providers. 

“This is about backing frontline professionals and making sure every New Zealander can get the care they need, when they need it,” Mr Brown says.
