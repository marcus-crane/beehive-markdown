The Royal New Zealand Air Force has established its first dedicated space unit with the reactivation of the No. 62 Squadron today, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“This reflects our commitment to protecting New Zealand’s interests and security in the rapidly evolving space domain,” Ms Collins says.

“Space is vital for modern life. We rely on space-based infrastructure for a range of critical services, from weather observation to financial transactions.

“This is an important signal that we’re taking space security seriously.”

No. 62 Squadron was reactivated at a formal ceremony at RNZAF Base Auckland today. Originally active during World War II, the squadron supported Allied operations through the innovative use of radar technology. Now, its mission shifts to space domain awareness.

“The squadron’s initial focus will be on monitoring, analysing, and understanding space activity to safeguard national and international interests,” Ms Collins says.

“Recent global developments have highlighted the need for resilient, advanced defence capabilities.This move is part of the work the New Zealand Defence Force is doing to maintain a combat-capable, flexible force.”

The reactivation supports the recent Defence Capability Plan which outlined $12 billion of planned commitments to upgrade the Defence Force over the next four years.
