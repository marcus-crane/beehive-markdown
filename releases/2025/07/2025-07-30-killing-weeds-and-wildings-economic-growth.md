Tourism and rural businesses will benefit from Government action to eradicate invasive weeds from popular landscapes including progressing the development of world-leading early detection technology, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says. 

The Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai is New Zealand’s biggest tourism provider – conservation tourism is worth $3.4 billion a year - but the ongoing protection of our iconic landscapes is facing significant financial and environmental challenges,” Mr Potaka says.

“Tourism is a key part of our plan to grow the economy to create jobs, lift wages and help Kiwis get ahead. Through the International Visitor Levy (IVL), we’re providing $10 million over the next three years to ensure our popular mountains, parks, and islands, remain beautiful for years to come.

“Locations include Abel Tasman, Aoraki / Mt Cook, Tongariro, Stewart Island, Mackenzie Basin, Molesworth, and Te Paki and North Cape / Otou near Cape Reinga.

“In Aotearoa New Zealand, nearly two million hectares are affected by wilding pines. Without intervention, these trees can spread at a rate of five per cent per year. The cost of this to New Zealand’s nature, productivity and economy can grow exponentially over time. 

“I’ve announced an extra $3 million to the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme, led by Biosecurity New Zealand, for important control work in the Molesworth and Mackenzie Basin areas. This builds on significant previous IVL investments to urgently tackle wilding conifers across Canterbury, Marlborough, Otago and on Rangitoto in the Hauraki Gulf.

“A further $7.45 million will go towards managing other significant weeds. For example in Rakiura, Abel Tasman, Te Paki, and North Cape/Otou, such as marram, spartina, and pampas grasses that affect natural dune and estuary ecosystems, and our coastal scenery.

“When it comes to tackling invasive weeds, taking early action is essential. IVL funding will also go towards the development and rollout of an innovative, smart software tool to detect weeds when they first invade. 

Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard highlighted the annual boost in funding to combat wilding pines, which threaten farmland, water catchments, and native biodiversity, while increasing the risk of wildfires.

“The Government is focused on protecting the productive heart of our economy – our rural communities. That’s why there has been significant investment into the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme, including an extra $2 million announced in Budget and annual $10 million baseline funding. 

“Since 2016, the Government has committed more than $150 million to the fight to contain and control the spread of wilding pines, alongside more than $33 million contributed by partners and communities.” 

“This year’s investment continues to support the people doing the work alongside Government – regional councils, Iwi, farmers, researchers, and volunteers, whose combined effort has pushed back some of the worst infestations and protected key landscapes,” says Mr Hoggard.

**Notes to editor**: The funding covers work across the next three years (2025 –2028) and comes from money raised under the new $100 International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy rate.
