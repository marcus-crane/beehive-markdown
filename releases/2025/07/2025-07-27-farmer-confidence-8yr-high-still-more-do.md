Farmer confidence has surged to the highest level in eight years, with Minister of Agriculture Todd McClay describing it as a clear sign of the resilience of New Zealand’s farmers and a sector leading the charge towards our goal of doubling export value in 10 years.

“The latest Federated Farmers Confidence Survey shows a remarkable shift in sentiment, with confidence lifting from -66 per cent when the Government took office to +33 per cent this July,” Mr McClay says.

This result reflects the hard work of 360,000 rural New Zealanders and a Government focused on backing the sector with smart and practical rules.

The last Labour government’s war on farmers eroded trust and stalled investment. Today’s announcement shows the war has ended.

“This Government has worked hard to change the settings, but there’s still more to do to ensure farmers can deliver growth for all New Zealanders,” Mr McClay says.

The survey highlights major improvements across key indicators including:

- Profitability - at its highest level ever recorded, with two-thirds of farmers reporting they are making a profit.
- Productivity - with a net 23 per cent of farmers forecasting increased production over the next 12 months.
- Mental health - pressures have eased significantly, with fewer farmers reporting stress compared to last year.

“After years of rising costs and uncertainty, our focus is on giving farmers the tools to do what they do best—lead the world in producing high-quality food and fibre. That means replacing the Resource Management Act, changing National Direction including the NPS-FM, and launching a contestable wellbeing fund to support rural New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

“It’s pleasing to see policy changes returning value to the farm gate.”
