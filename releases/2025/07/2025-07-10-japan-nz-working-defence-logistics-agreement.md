New Zealand and Japan are developing a logistics agreement to support ongoing defence cooperation between our two countries, Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Defence Minister Judith Collins have announced.

“Japan is a crucial partner for New Zealand,” Mr Peters says following a meeting with Japanese counterpart Iwaya Takeshi at the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Kuala Lumpur today.

“We are both committed to the international rules-based system, and to maintaining security and prosperity in our region.” 

Ms Collins says the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement will detail how our militaries can better support one another when undertaking exercises, training and other activities together.

“Our militaries are already doing more together, and the agreement will provide practical support to help enable this cooperation,” Ms Collins says.

“This is an important step as New Zealand pulls its weight on the world stage as it will ultimately strengthen our interoperability and ability to work closely with our partners.”

The agreement will set out how logistical support, including the provision of supplies and services, will be managed when the New Zealand Defence Force and the Self-Defense Forces of Japan operate together.

Examples include refuelling activities at sea using HMNZS Aotearoa, or the reciprocal provision of food or medical supplies during joint humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities.

New Zealand and Japan are also working on an Information Security Agreement which will provide a legal framework for sharing more classified information.
