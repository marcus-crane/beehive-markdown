A new digital model of care is transforming how heart failure is managed in Hawke’s Bay, delivering faster treatment, fewer hospital visits, and better outcomes for patients, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This Government is focused on practical, patient-centred improvements to healthcare,” Mr Brown says.

“Instead of long waits, repeated hospital visits, and lengthy travel for more remote patients, people are now receiving tailored, home-based care that’s faster, safer, and more effective.”

The remote patient monitoring pathway supports people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction – a condition where the heart does not pump blood as it should. A key part of treatment is titration – the process of slowly adjusting medication doses to the safest and most effective level, based on how a patient responds.

“Traditionally, this requires frequent in-person appointments and can take many months. This new approach means patients can be safely monitored and have their medications adjusted from home.”

The service uses hospital-supplied smart kits, including a tablet, scales, blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximeter, so patients can check their vital signs daily and connect with clinicians via regular video consults.

“This is about delivering more care, closer to home. Instead of travelling in for every check-up or medication change, patients can be supported where they’re most comfortable, while more frequent monitoring is enabling health professionals to step in more quickly if anything changes.”

Results show clear improvements:

- Hospital readmissions within 30 days have dropped to zero, from a previous rate of 25 per cent
- Appointment attendance has improved, with no missed appointments compared to a previous 15.3 per cent no-show rate
- Medication titration now takes 6 – 8 weeks, a substantial reduction from the previous 6 – 8 months
- Increased capacity for clinical teams, enabling more patients to receive timely care

“Under the old pathway, it could take up to nine months for patients to reach the right combination of medications. The new pathway is accelerating access to care, reducing hospitalisations, and making it possible for more patients to be seen and receive the care they need.

“This is a smart, patient-focused solution that’s delivering real results for patients with heart failure in Hawke’s Bay,” Mr Brown says.
