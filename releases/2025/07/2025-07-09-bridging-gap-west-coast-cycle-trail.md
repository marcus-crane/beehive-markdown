A new cycle bridge on the West Coast Wilderness Cycle Trail will bring more visitors to the region and boost the local economy.

“I’m thrilled to be supporting the construction of the Totara River Rail Bridge, ensuring visitors can once again ride this popular trail from start to finish,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“The West Coast Wilderness Cycle Trail is one of our Great Rides and attracts both international and domestic visitors alike, showcasing the stunning scenery of the West Coast.

“Investment in this piece of infrastructure will benefit the local businesses and communities, particularly in the township of Ross located at the trail end.” 

The Totara River Rail Bridge, a few kilometres north of Ross, has been closed for structural assessment and repairs since August 2024, cutting off the final 15km section of trail between Ross and the Treetops Zipline and Walkway. 

“While cyclists can still enjoy parts of the trail, they currently cannot reach Ross – meaning the township, along with the wider region, is missing out on valuable visitor spending.  This investment will help turn that around, bringing more visitors back.” 

This investment is part of the first stage of the Government’s Tourism Growth Roadmap, which also includes additional international marketing funding and other activity to encourage more international visitors to New Zealand. 

“The Roadmap sets out the Government’s plan to double the value of tourism, currently our second largest export, by 2034.

“We want to welcome more visitors to New Zealand, and we want to enable our regional communities to provide a high-quality visitor experience.

“New Zealand’s Great Rides are national treasures, and it is important we look after them for future generations,” Louise Upston says.
