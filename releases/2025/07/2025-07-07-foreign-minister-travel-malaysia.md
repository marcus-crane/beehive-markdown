“In our 50th anniversary of Dialogue Relations with ASEAN, we will highlight the value of the deep partnership between New Zealand and South East Asia, and will engage on the strategic issues impacting the stability of our region. We will also discuss opportunities for enhancing our partnership and cooperation.”

While in Malaysia. Mr Peters will attend the annual ASEAN-New Zealand Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, and ASEAN Regional Forum.

The Minister attended the inaugural East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005 and a further nine since. Mr Peters will also hold several bilateral engagements with counterparts while in Kuala Lumpur.

“Since coming into government in 2023 we have significantly increased New Zealand’s focus and resources applied to South and South East Asia.”

This visit to Malaysia is a further opportunity to strengthen New Zealand’s partnership with ASEAN and reiterate our support for Malaysia’s priorities as 2025 ASEAN Chair.”
