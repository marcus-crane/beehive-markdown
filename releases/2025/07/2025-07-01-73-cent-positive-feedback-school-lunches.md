Associate Education Minister David Seymour is pleased to see the Healthy School Lunch Programme Term 3 menu has received positive feedback from three quarters of students, and complaints have fallen by 92 per cent, while at the same time taxpayers are saving over $130 million.

“The menu for Term 3 is being tested with students across the lower North Island. The result is 73 per cent positive feedback. Any parent knows getting children to like something is no easy task. I’d say if you’re winning 73 per cent of the time, that’s a great result”, Mr Seymour says.

Taste testing took place at schools across Taranaki, Palmerston North, Wairarapa, Wellington, Hawke’s Bay, and the Bay of Plenty. In total more than 120 students provided feedback during these sessions, forming the basis for the 73 per cent positive rating.

“Since the beginning of Term 1 2025, the Programme has delivered over 13.8 million nutritious meals, to 242,000 students, in 1011 schools,” says Mr Seymour.

“This marks the first time a single national supplier has provided meals at such scale, let alone meals which children enjoy, are nutritious, and are delivered on time. We are providing a high-quality service which is affordable for taxpayers.

“The Programme has taken on feedback and responded to issues as they arise. For example, in Term 1, students were unhappy with menu variation and meal quality. The variation and quality improved in Term 2, and students say they’ve been enjoying their lunches.

“The Programme must also be financially responsible. That’s why we are committed to reducing surplus meals. We are working towards this by ensuring students enjoy the meals and adjusting order volumes to better align with student attendance. 

“Previously there were issues with meals not arriving on time. The Programme got more trucks, streamlined delivery routes, and heard from principals and schools how they could address concerns. Now they deliver on-time, more than 98 per cent of the time, every day. 

“Many of the previous issues arose from the use of ‘stop gap’ frozen meals, exacerbated by Libelle’s liquidation. This has been fixed. Equipment was upgraded, and staff numbers increased, to increase meal production and control quality better. Production is now exceeding daily targets, and two million meals are expected to be ready for distribution by the start of Term 3.

“Since March, complaints to the Ministry have reduced by 92 per cent. The transparent feedback system has allowed the programme to be responsive and effective at improving processes.

“The programme has also already realised taxpayer savings of over $130 million. $8 million of those savings will go to ensuring 10,000 children in early learning services receive a taxpayer funded lunch every day. 

“When the Government manages its accounts like families and businesses have to, money goes a lot further.”
