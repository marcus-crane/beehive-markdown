Members of a Judicial Conduct Panel have been appointed to inquire into and report on the alleged conduct of acting District Court Judge Ema Aitken, Acting Attorney-General Paul Goldsmith says.

“The Judicial Conduct Commissioner recommended a Panel be set up to inquire into Judge Aitken’s alleged conduct at the Northern Club on 22 November 2024. I accepted that recommendation.

“Following consultation with the Chief Justice, I have now appointed Panel members: the Honourable Brendan Brown KC, the Honourable Justice Jillian Mallon and the Right Honourable Sir Jerry Mateparae, GNZM, QSO, KStJ.

“I have also appointed Tim Stephens KC as special counsel in the Panel’s inquiry.

“Following its inquiry, the Panel will provide me with a report, including its opinion as to whether consideration of Judge Aitken’s removal is justified.

“I won’t be making any further comment until then.”
