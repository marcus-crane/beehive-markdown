Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says the cruise industry is poised for another significant step forward, with the Carnival line announcing a return to homeporting in Auckland.

“I’m thrilled to hear that Carnival Adventure will drop anchor in Auckland for its 2027 winter season, the first ship to homeport in Auckland since 2023,” Louise Upston says.

“A homeport is where a cruise ship begins and ends its voyages, making Auckland a base for passenger boarding, provisioning and crew operations. Having a ship homeported here over winter is a real vote of confidence in New Zealand’s tourism sector.

“This decision by Carnival means more visitors, more jobs and more opportunities for local businesses. That’s great news for our Auckland hospitality, retail and accommodation sectors.

“It also offers New Zealanders the chance to cruise from a home city on short break holidays.”

Carnival Adventure will be homeported in Auckland from 25 May to 29 July 2027.

The announcement comes as New Zealand prepares to welcome an estimated 177,000 cruise visitors across nearly 40 ships during the 2025 - 2026 season.   

Louise Upston says the Government recognised the growing contribution of cruise tourism to New Zealand, injecting $1.37 billion into New Zealand economy last financial year,

“Cruise is now extremely significant to tourism and is why I led a meeting with cruise and port sector representatives in July to discuss how we could all make the most of the opportunities and remove any barriers.  

“We’ve worked hard to provide clarity on regulatory costs and support new ways to manage biofouling.

“Our Government has also set up a Fast-Track Approvals process supporting efficient consenting for much-needed infrastructure like Port of Auckland’s development of a new wharf and passenger terminal for cruise vessels. 

“And we’ve confirmed ongoing cruise access to Milford Sound. 

“Today’s news reinforces the significance of those decisions and reaffirms that New Zealand is open for business and committed to supporting the cruise sector’s growth.”
