The Government has confirmed the appointment of the permanent Aviation Council, which will strengthen sector leadership and help shape the industry’s future. 

Associate Transport Minister James Meager confirmed the 14-person forum, while speaking at the NZ Airports Hui in Blenheim this morning. 

“This is another significant step towards strengthening and growing the aviation sector. The permanent Council will help us seize future opportunities to support economic growth and enhance aviation safety and efficiency,” Mr Meager says. 

“The Council’s strategic leadership is key to a strong and resilient aviation industry which supports our economy, connectivity and emergency response capability.”

The Aviation Council’s permanent establishment was confirmed in the recent Aviation Action Plan, which outlined 25 actions to grow and future-proof the sector. 

Members include government agencies, regulators, industry associations, and nationally significant aviation businesses like Air New Zealand and Auckland Airport.

“The Council’s work will be instrumental in delivering the actions outlined in the Action Plan, such as workforce pipeline issues, regulatory bottlenecks and infrastructure needs,” Mr Meager says. 

“They will report annually on the Action Plan’s progress, ensuring it stays relevant by updating it at least every three years. 

“The permanent membership includes formal representation for smaller airlines to ensure we remain focused on supporting regional connectivity. It also includes industry voices through the Aviation Federation and the Aviation Industry Association to help prioritise workforce development.

“The advanced aviation sector is also represented through Kea Aerospace who will provide the insight we need to grow our $2.5 billion advanced aviation and space industry.

“I thank the Interim Aviation Council for their contribution over the past two years, particularly Air Ruatoria’s Māhanga Maru, who advocated for regional airlines while long-term representation was formalised.

“I look forward to working with the permanent appointments as industry and government navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead”.
