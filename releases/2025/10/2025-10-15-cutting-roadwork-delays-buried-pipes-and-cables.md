The Government is cracking down on the delays and cost blowouts caused by pipes and cables buried under our roads.

“Infrastructure projects up and down the country are slowed down because often no one knows exactly where underground pipes and cables are, or what condition they’re in,” Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Too often the same road gets dug up twice in a matter of months, or a project is delayed for months on end because the utilities weren’t where the plans said they were. That’s a waste of time and money, and it causes huge disruption to businesses and the public.

“The Stage 1 Cameron Road redevelopment in Tauranga is a classic example, where inaccurate utility records caused months of delay and millions of dollars in extra cost.

“Earlier this year, Cabinet signed off a programme to improve New Zealand’s asset management systems. As part of this work, I have asked the New Zealand Utilities Advisory Group to look at options for strengthening underground utility records, including the potential to expand Wellington City Council’s successful pilot of an underground asset register.

“The idea is simple: every time the road corridor is opened - whether to fix a water leak, install a bus lane, or move electricity cables - the register is updated. It builds a library of underground asset information that keeps everyone on the same page.

“The current National Code of Practice requires utility operators to keep accurate records, but compliance is inconsistent, and many older assets were installed with poor or no records at all.

“The Code was meant to be self-regulating, but it’s clearly not working as intended. We need a system that actually saves time, cuts costs, and keeps projects moving.”

The review will be completed early next year.
