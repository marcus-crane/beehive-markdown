KiwiRail directors Rob Jager and Bruce Wattie will complete their service on 31 October 2025, and two new directors have been appointed from 1 November 2025, Minister for Rail Minister Winston Peters announced today.

“KiwiRail must deliver the goods, so it is pleasing the former acting chair Mr Jager and chair of the risk, audit and assurance committee Mr Wattie finished by signing off on the year-end operating surplus which exceeded their $110 million target,” Mr Peters says.

“Mr Jager led Shell New Zealand, was a nine-year director of Air New Zealand, has deep knowledge of health and safety systems, and stepped up as acting chair in 2024 – all of which is acknowledged today.

“Mr Wattie joined the KiwiRail board in 2020 and has been an accomplished director and committee chair, particularly driving better insurance arrangements for the company.

“Earlier this year, we appointed Sue Tindal as chair along with two new directors and strengthened our expectations of KiwiRail to reduce costs and lift earnings, volumes, reliability and safety.

“This week, Cabinet approved the appointment of chartered accountants Murray Harrington and Alastair Bell as new KiwiRail directors, each bringing strong public sector financial acumen, experience in infrastructure and network management, optimising balance sheets, and competence in core audit functions.

“When the taxpayer builds an asset like railways, we expect it to be made use of and not left to waste on the side of the road and that is why we are driving strong focus on turning KiwiRail into the successful business New Zealanders expect it to be,” Mr Peters says.
