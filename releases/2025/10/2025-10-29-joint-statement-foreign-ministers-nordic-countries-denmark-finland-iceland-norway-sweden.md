\[Joint Statement delivered by the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic Countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) and New Zealand, at the Nordic 5/New Zealand Foreign Minister's meeting, Stockholm 29 October 2025]

At a time of intense geostrategic change, we, the Foreign Ministers of the five Nordic countries and New Zealand, wish to underline the alignment of our values, our commitment to international law and the careful management of geopolitical issues, as well as our firm commitment to sustainable economic development and partnerships. 

We will continue to work collaboratively to uphold and strengthen the rules-based international order. The norms contained therein address significant issues – including global environment issues, security and disarmament, human rights, development, trade and economic issues – and contribute to their peaceful, equitable and just management. We reiterate in this context the important role of international courts and reaffirm our unwavering support for the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.

We are all steadfast supporters of an effective and inclusive multilateral system, with the United Nations at its core, that delivers effective, measurable impact on the ground, where it is most needed. We strongly support an effective and fit-for-purpose United Nations. This is why we highlight ambitious and innovative reform under the UN80 initiative initiated by the UN Secretary-General.  It is essential to enhance respect for the United Nations Charter, including the respect of the sovereignty and, territorial integrity of all states, and the prohibition on the threat and use of force in international relations. 

We are deeply concerned about the proliferation of armed conflicts around the globe and will contribute to the best of our ability to the prevention, management, and peaceful resolution of conflicts. 

We condemn Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression on Ukraine, which continues to inflict human suffering and has serious consequences for Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security. We support efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, including by increasing pressure on Russia to reciprocate Ukraine’s call for a comprehensive ceasefire and engage in meaningful peace negotiations. Our support to Ukraine is unwavering. We reiterate the need to ensure accountability to bring justice to the victims and to uphold the international rules-based order. We are committed to working together to deprive Russia of revenue from its oil trade, and countering shadow fleet activity. We condemn deepening Russia-DPRK military cooperation, especially North Korea’s continued military support to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. We urge China to cease any material support to Russia’s war efforts as well as to prevent the circumvention of sanctions. 

We very much welcome the agreement on the first phase of the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict put forward by President Trump and call on all parties to fully implement the agreement without delay. We stand ready to contribute to the implementation of the plan. We have consistently urged all relevant parties to work towards the two-state solution, which is the only way to ensure security and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians. We call on all relevant parties to facilitate safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid and adhere to international law.

We value our dialogue and cooperation within the NATO framework, as Nordic NATO members and as one of the Indo-Pacific partners of NATO, recognising our shared defence, security, and resilience interests, including cooperation in the defence industry. 

We are committed to an effective rules-based international trading system, with the WTO at its core. We look forward to advancing WTO reform at MC14. We welcome the instruments in place, such as the European Union - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, the Agreement on Climate Change Trade and Sustainability, and the Future of Investment and Trade Partnership. We look forward to further exchanges on trade policy, including the anticipated EU-CPTPP Trade and Investment Dialogue, given our shared commitment to facilitating and boosting trade that delivers for our businesses and communities. 

We are committed to fostering science, research, and innovation between our countries. We will look to engage together through initiatives like Horizon Europe. 

We are all dependent on a strong bioeconomy. We seek to provide solutions for our people and through trade with others. We have shared interests in aquaculture recognising Nordic leadership and New Zealand’s growing capabilities and investment in the sector.

We look to collaborate in the lead-up to the International Polar Year (IPY) in 2032/33.   

We welcome Nordic support for the Pacific, including through multilateral advocacy, and value our continued collaboration that supports Pacific priorities as set out in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
