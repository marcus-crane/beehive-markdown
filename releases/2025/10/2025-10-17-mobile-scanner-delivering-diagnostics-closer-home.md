More than 340 patients in the lower South Island have been able to access advanced cancer diagnostics closer to home through fortnightly visits from a mobile PET-CT service to Dunedin, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This has been a gamechanger for patients in the lower South Island who need a PET-CT scan,” Mr Brown says.

“Patients are now benefiting from easier access to high-quality cancer imaging, without the need to travel long distances for scans. The mobile service now visits Dunedin Hospital for three days every fortnight.

“Until December last year, most patients in the region who required a PET-CT scan were referred to Christchurch. Now, the majority are referred to the mobile imaging unit at Dunedin Hospital, with 347 patients scanned so far.

“This means earlier diagnosis, faster treatment decisions, and less stress for patients and their families.”

PET-CT imaging is an advanced technology used to diagnose and stage cancer, giving doctors a much clearer picture than traditional CT scans. By showing the exact location and extent of cancer, it helps clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment. In around 18 to 25 percent of cases, the results can lead to changes that improve how a patient’s care is managed.

Mr Brown says increasing access to diagnostics closer to home is a priority for the Government.

“This service is improving access for patients and ensuring those in the lower South Island can receive world-class diagnostic care closer to home.

“We are committed to ensuring patients in every part of New Zealand have access to the same quality services, no matter where they live.”
