Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong have launched the New Zealand-Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in Auckland today.

“Singapore is one of our closest partners. As small states, it’s important we work side-by-side to keep trade open, strengthen security, and defend the rules-based order,” Mr Luxon says.

“The CSP we signed today is designed to back business, grow investment, and help more New Zealand firms scale from Singapore into Asia. 

“What this boils down to for Kiwis is more jobs and higher incomes. 

“Through the CSP, we have committed to tackling the next generation of challenges together, from supply chain resilience and digital trade, to climate change and maritime security,” Mr Luxon says. 

The CSP will drive deeper cooperation across six pillars: Trade and Economics; Defence and Security; Science and Innovation; People-to-People links; Climate and Green Economy; and Supply Chains and Connectivity.

“Prime Minister Wong’s visit has not only marked 60 years of diplomatic ties between our two countries - it has set the direction for the next chapter of our partnership.”

As part of today’s announcements, New Zealand and Singapore also concluded a first-of-its-kind Agreement on Trade in Essential Supplies (AOTES) to help keep essential goods moving in times of crisis.

Prime Minister Wong departs New Zealand tomorrow.
