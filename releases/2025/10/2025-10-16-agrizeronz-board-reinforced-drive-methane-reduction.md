Two experienced agribusiness leaders have been appointed to the AgriZeroNZ board to help the public-private joint venture’s efforts to drive the adoption of new tools to reduce on-farm emissions.

Agriculture Minister Todd McClay today announced Simon Limmer and Murray Dyer have been appointed as directors for three-year terms. They will join an existing five-member board chaired by Rob Hewett.

“Simon Limmer is a former chief executive of Silver Fern Farms and an experienced sector leader who contributed to the establishment of AgriZeroNZ,” Mr McClay says.

Mr Limmer, who is the current chief executive of Indevin Group, is the Government’s appointee to the board. Murray Dyer is the sector appointee and is a principal partner at Prime Markets.

“Mr Dyer has more than 30 years’ experience across the agribusiness, energy, and infrastructure sector and is an excellent addition to the board,” Mr McClay says.

“Both appointments will help drive AgriZeroNZ’s upcoming work to rollout and drive uptake of new mitigation technology – keeping Kiwi farmers productive whilst achieving our recently announced biogenic methane reduction targets.

“Government and industry and have committed $400 million to accelerate the development new tools and technology to reduce on-farm agricultural emissions.”

AgriZeroNZ has already invested in 14 ventures and research projects with the first of these tools are expected to become available next year.

“We have increasing confidence in the pipeline of new mitigation tools. We expect to see up to 11 available by 2030,” Mr McClay says.

“We are committed to meeting our climate obligations without closing down farms and sending jobs and production overseas. This investment in AgriZero will offer farmers the tools they need to reduce on-farm emissions without reducing production.”
