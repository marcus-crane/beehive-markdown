The Government is providing a further $100,000 to Mayoral Relief Funds to help the Kaikōura and Hurunui communities impacted by severe weather, Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery, Mark Mitchell announced today.

The announcement comes in addition to the $150,000 contribution to the Southland and Clutha Mayoral Relief Funds announced this morning.

Kaikōura and Hurunui districts will each be provided $25,000 to assist with the ongoing response and recovery efforts following recent severe weather.

In addition, it has been classified as a medium scale adverse event. The Ministry for Primary Industries is contributing $25,000 each for Kaikōura and Hururnui districts through the Mayoral Relief Fund to support the initial recovery of the rural sector.

“Communities in the affected regions are doing it tough, and with another front approaching, further impacts are expected over the next 24 hours,” Mr Mitchell says.

“Today’s contribution to Kaikōura and Hurunui's Mayoral Relief Funds will provide support for the communities’ immediate and pressing needs, and will help them as they begin to recover from these events.

“I’ve spent time this week with affected communities and have been deeply impressed by the resilience, pragmatism, and grit shown by first responders, iwi and community leaders on the ground.

“Thank you for the work you are doing. The Government stands with you, and we are ready to provide additional support whenever and wherever it is needed.”

Mayoral Relief Funds help communities bounce back after an emergency. Local communities and councils understand where the immediate needs are and how to help individuals, whānau, community organisations, and marae.

The medium scale classification also unlocks further support for farmers and growers, which could include tax relief and enables MSD to consider Rural Assistance Payments and activating Enhanced Taskforce Green.
