The Government has formally confirmed the Streamlined Planning Process that will be used for Auckland Council’s new housing plan, known as Plan Change 120 (PC120), RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop says.

“In August, as requested by Auckland Council, Parliament passed a law allowing Auckland Council to withdraw its controversial Plan Change 78 (PC78). The Council asked for the ability to not apply the Medium Density Residential Standards (MDRS) and “downzone” areas of the city vulnerable to natural hazards like floods.

“The Government agreed to this request and the law now provides that the new plan change must deliver at least the same overall housing capacity as PC78 would have, while also enabling greater building heights and housing density around key stations that will benefit from the City Rail Link investment when it opens next year.

“By giving Auckland Council the option to withdraw PC78, we’ve returned decision-making to locals – Aucklanders will once again decide how and where housing growth happens in this important city for New Zealand’s future.

“Auckland Council has now formally withdrawn Plan PC78 and upon the Council’s request, responsible Ministers have now issued formal direction to the Council to enter the Streamlined Planning Process for PC120.

“As requested by Auckland Council, PC120 will proceed through a 20-month process (an increase from the 18 months initially signalled).

“Public submissions will be open from 3 November to 19 December 2025, followed by hearings in 2026 overseen by a panel with a minimum of eight and maximum of nine members. Four members will be appointed by Ministers, with the remaining members to be appointed by the Council. Ministers are working with the Council on who the Council will appoint as Chair.

“As I have said many times, it is important that Aucklanders have robust opportunities to participate in this important process. The Council itself has asked for a transparent process, and that’s exactly what we’re committed to delivering.

“Ministers have also issued a formal statement of expectations for PC120, which asks the hearings panel and Council to consider whether PC120 provisions unduly frustrate development, to test the appropriate distribution of housing capacity (including greenfield development), and to look at whether all planned rapid transit stops have been identified (including the Northwest Busway).

“We’ve consulted with Auckland Council on the draft direction and statement of expectations and refined these in response to some of the feedback. The Government has declined the request of the Council to remove the reference to greenfield development in the statement of expectations.

“As part of the process, a ‘friend of submitter’ service will be available to help Aucklanders engage with the plan change.

“I am confident the PC120 process will ensure local voices are at the centre of decisions on Auckland’s growth, while creating more housing options, making the most of the City Rail Link, and setting the city up for the future.

The direction takes effect from the date it is published in the New Zealand Gazette.

**Note to editors:**

- On 24 September Auckland Council voted to withdraw Plan Change 78 and replace it with Plan Change 120.
- Under the Resource Management Act, PC 120 must amend the Auckland Unitary Plan to provide at least as much housing capacity as PC78, enable greater density around key stations benefitting from CRL investment, and give effect to the intensification policies of the National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD).
- A direction is required because the Council is using the Streamlined Planning Process for an Auckland Housing Planning Instrument. A direction is secondary legislation and takes effect from the date of Gazettal.
- Ministers consulted with Auckland Council on the draft direction before issuing it.

The direction, including the statement of expectations, is available \[[The Resource Management (Direction to Auckland Council to use the Streamlined Planning Process to Prepare Proposed Plan Change 120: Housing Intensification and Resilience) Notice 2025 - 2025-sl6084- New Zealand Gazette](https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2025-sl6084)]. Further information on PC120 is available on Auckland Council’s website.
