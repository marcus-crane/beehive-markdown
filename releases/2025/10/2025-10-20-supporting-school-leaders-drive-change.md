Education Minister Erica Stanford has launched the Curriculum Roadshow for Leaders, a nationwide initiative designed to support school leaders as they lead curriculum change across New Zealand.

“The Roadshow was developed in direct response to requests from the sector for more support. It’s about the importance of collaboration, leading through changes, and sharing best practice. It focuses on helping schools implement a strengthened national curriculum with greater clarity and confidence,” Ms Stanford says.

The programme brings together national and international experts, including keynote speaker Dr Nathaniel Swain, who share evidence-based insights on structured teaching approaches.

It offers a clear overview of the curriculum changes, practical strategies for implementation, and resource packs to support planning and professional conversations with staff.

As part of the wider curriculum refresh, the Roadshow also supports school leaders to prepare for the staged release of curriculum content. The final curriculum content for Years 0-10 English and Mathematics is available now for use from the start of Term 1, 2026.

Other learning areas (Social Sciences, Science, Health and Physical Education, the Arts, Technology, Learning Languages) will be rephased and introduced in two stages in 2027 and 2028. This provides schools with more time to plan and progress their implementation.

“This Government remains committed to getting 80 per cent of Year 8 students achieving at or above curriculum expectations by 2030. This Roadshow will help equip school leaders with the tools, knowledge, and networks they need to lead curriculum change that delivers better outcomes so more students reach their potential,” Ms Stanford says.
