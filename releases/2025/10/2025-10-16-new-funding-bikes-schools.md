Kiwi kids will be able to learn cycling safety skills, alongside more bike tracks being built in schools, thanks to new funding for the Bikes In Schools programme, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

The Government has confirmed that the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) will provide up to $3.5 million in new funding so the Bikes in Schools programme continues, ensuring many primary and intermediate students will have access to bikes and tracks in their schools.

“Bikes in Schools, first funded under the previous National government, is a great programme that provides an opportunity for our primary and intermediate school kids to learn the basics of how to ride a bike safely.

“Bike riding is a really useful skill for life, and we want to make sure Kiwi kids get the chance to learn how to ride safely from a young age. Jumping on a bike is a great way to get around, keep fit, or just have fun with your mates and family.”

The Bikes in Schools programme, supported through the Bike On New Zealand Charitable Trust (BONZCT), helps schools build their own tracks, provide bikes and helmets for students, and enables kids to learn and practice their safe biking skills during the school day and outside of school hours.

“The programme gives kids the chance to build confidence, stay active, and pick up key skills in a safe school setting before they head out onto the road. Learning about helmets and doing regular bike checks also means they’re set up with the knowledge they need to ride safely,” Mr Bishop says.

“Since 2010, more than 400 schools have got on board with Bikes in Schools, helping thousands of kids to learn and practice safe biking skills. I want to thank Paul McArdle and the team at the BONZCT for pushing this work forward, and the many teachers and parents who make it possible.

“NZTA has confirmed up to $3.5 million from the National Road Safety Promotion Programme to keep Bikes in Schools running through to June 2027, with future funding to be considered in the next National Land Transport Programme.

“It was great to be at Wilford School in Petone today to open their new bike track. Seeing the impact this programme has on students and the wider community shows exactly why it matters, and I’m looking forward to seeing it continue.”
