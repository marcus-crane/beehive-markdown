Foreign Minister Winston Peters leaves this weekend for the United Kingdom and the Nordic region. 

While in the United Kingdom, Mr Peters will take part in the annual UK-NZ Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue with his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, undertake other political calls, and participate in a debate at the Oxford Union. 

“The United Kingdom is integral to our security and prosperity,” Mr Peters says.  “My visit will renew the strong partnership we have with the UK and identify areas where we can work together to address the deteriorating international situation.” 

Mr Peters will also travel to the five Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. 

While in Stockholm, he will attend the first ever New Zealand-Nordic 5 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. 

“There are few countries in the world more likeminded than New Zealand and our Nordic friends. We have collectively benefitted from our partnerships, but there remains much more we can learn from each other,” Mr Peters says. 

Mr Peters will hold one-on-one talks with his Nordic counterparts to discuss geopolitical issues, bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and opportunities in trade and innovation. 

“There is no opting out of the geopolitical realities we face. For small states it is imperative we maintain bonds with countries that share our values and our commitment to a rules-based international order. This visit will help lay the foundations for future cooperation and partnership,” Mr Peters says. 

Mr Peters departs New Zealand on 19 October and returns on 2 November.
