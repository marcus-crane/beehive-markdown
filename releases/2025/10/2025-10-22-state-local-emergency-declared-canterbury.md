The Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell has declared a state of local emergency for the Canterbury Region, to assist in the response to the current severe weather.

The Minister signed the declaration at 03:24pm today.

“I have made this declaration as the Canterbury Mayors have not yet been able to be sworn in following the recent local elections,” Mr Mitchell said.

“The National Emergency Management Agency have been in close contact with the Canterbury Civil Defence Emergency Management Group and confirmed that a declaration is necessary.

“The state of local emergency will ensure local Civil Defence have access to the emergency powers they need to respond and support emergency services during this event.”

“This is a significant weather event that is causing impacts around many parts of the country. My thoughts are with everyone that has been affected.

“Listen to advice provided by your local Civil Defence Emergency Management Group and emergency services and follow any instructions. Put safety first. Don’t take any chances.

**Notes to editors:**

Minister Mitchell is travelling to Canterbury tonight to support local government and first responders during this emergency.

Under section 69 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 the Minister can declare a state of local emergency in certain cases, including if it has not been or cannot be declared by an authorised person at a local level. This includes in times when an emergency arises following a local election but before elected representatives have been sworn in.

Only elected representatives of the members of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Group can declare a state of local emergency. Following a local election there may be no-one available to declare as members cannot act as an elected representative until they are sworn in (clause 14, Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002).
