More whānau in Kaikohe will soon have a warm, secure place to call home, through an Iwi - Crown partnership delivering 100 affordable rental homes, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

“These homes will give whānau stability, connection, and pride, building the foundation to plan for the future,” Mr Potaka says.

The Bisset Road development will result in over $50m investment bring new opportunities, creating local jobs, apprenticeships, and business contracts in Kaikohe and across Te Tai Tokerau.

“Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi is leading the way with local solutions for local people. This partnership will ease the pressure on Kaikohe housing market and retain investment in Te Tai Tokerau.”

Backed by $34.1 million from the Government and $17.4 million from Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi, the project represents the Far North’s largest community-led affordable housing development.

The development directly addresses the towns toughest housing challenges, including overcrowding and limited rentals. Homes will be warm, dry, and modern, improving health and wellbeing for whānau.

“Over 25 years, all 100 homes will stay affordable, with rents capped at 80 percent of market rates, giving whānau long-term stability and room to grow. Te Hau Ora o Ngāpuhi will utilise local trades, timber, and suppliers, creating jobs and apprenticeships throughout construction.

The project is part of the Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga announcement at Waitangi Day 2025, which will result in over 400 affordable rentals for Māori being developed by 2027.

“This partnership shows what happens when Iwi and Government work side by side. We’re creating real homes, local jobs, and opportunities that last,” Mr Potaka says.

This builds on what our Government has delivered for housing so far:

- Funded more than 2,000 new social homes through Budgets 2024 and 2025.
- Established a $250 million Flexible Fund to back community and Māori housing providers.
- Invested $82 million in upfront payments to get homes built faster.
- Committed to 1500 homes to be built by Community Housing Providers

Work at Bisset Road is expected to begin later this year, with all 100 homes complete by mid-2027.
