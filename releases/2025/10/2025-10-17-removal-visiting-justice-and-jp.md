Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee has announced that Fale Andrew Lesa has been removed from office as a Justice of the Peace and a Visiting Justice.

“Complaints from members of the public, and media reports, suggested that Mr Lesa had misrepresented numerous aspects of his qualifications and experience,” Mrs McKee says.

“I was concerned and asked my officials to look into the matter and report to me.

“I have heard from Mr Lesa directly. However, he has not been able to satisfactorily explain himself fully to me.

“Integrity and honesty are fundamental attributes for Justices of the Peace and Visiting Justices, given the nature of the functions that they perform.

“It is clear to me that Mr Lesa’s behaviour shows a long-standing pattern, on many occasions and over many years, of being willing to mislead, or exaggerate, over numerous important matters of fact about himself. That behaviour is inconsistent with the attributes necessary for a person who is a Justice of the Peace and a Visiting Justice.

“Accordingly, I reached the view that he should be removed from office as a Justice of the Peace and Visiting Justice, and I made that recommendation to the Governor-General.

“Mr Lesa has, as a result, been removed from office.”
