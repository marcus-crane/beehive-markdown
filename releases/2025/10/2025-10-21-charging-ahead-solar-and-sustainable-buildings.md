The Government is stepping up reforms to accelerate sustainable construction in New Zealand, as a new building consent exemption for rooftop solar panels comes into force.  

“By supporting sustainable building practices, we can create warmer, healthier homes, reduce power bills and build stronger, more resilient communities across New Zealand,” Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk says. 

“Earlier this year, I announced commonsense changes to the Building Act to clarify that a building consent is not required to install rooftop solar panels on existing homes and commercial buildings.  

“I’m pleased to confirm this exemption will become effective from tomorrow and will apply to all buildings. 

“Until now, decision-making on solar panel consents has varied between councils, creating uncertainty for homeowners who want to make smart decisions in reducing their carbon footprint and energy bills. 

“Making the process simpler by removing burdensome red tape is expected to save Kiwis around $1,200 per consent and help avoid unnecessary delays. 

“It remains important that installations are carefully managed and comply with the Building Code.  

“For rooftop installations over 40 square metres in total area per roof, or in very high wind speed areas, a chartered professional engineer must provide or review the design of the structural fixings for the exemption to apply. 

“Most residential rooftop solar arrays are between 25 and 30 square metres, so the majority of households will be able to install their solar panels without involving an engineer. 

“Earlier this year, the Government announced a further incentive to encourage more New Zealanders to switch to solar by committing to fast-track building consents for new residential buildings with solar electricity generation in their design, halving processing time from 20 working days to just 10. 

“Today, I am announcing that the Government is expanding that fast-track consent pathway to sustainable buildings, which will be defined in the Building Act. 

“To qualify, buildings will need to meet performance criteria demonstrating it has at least one of the following features: high energy efficiency, water efficiency, low embodied carbon, or climate resiliency.  

“Legislation to create a fast-track building consent process for sustainable buildings, including those with solar panels, will be included in a Bill I intend to introduce to Parliament early next year. 

“The Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will set the performance criteria for each sustainable building attribute through secondary legislation, ensuring clear guidance for builders and developers. 

“Giving Kiwis more choice and making it easier and more affordable to build the homes and infrastructure our communities need are top priorities for this Government. 

“By accelerating rooftop solar generation and reducing regulatory barriers for sustainable buildings, we are helping Kiwis shrink their power bills and live in healthier homes.” 

**Notes to editor:**

*Rooftop solar* 

- Rooftop solar arrays under 40 square metres do not require an engineer’s design or review, unless they are in very high windspeed areas - classified as greater than 44 metres per second (over 158 Km/H).
- For rooftop solar arrays 40 square metres or over per roof, or located in very high wind speed areas, solar panel installers will often have pre-engineered kitsets with a unified sign-off from a chartered professional engineer available for use.
- Installations using pre-engineered and approved kitsets will generally not require a chartered professional engineer to be involved in the installation and inspection of the rooftop array.

*Sustainable buildings* 

- The fast-track building consent process for buildings with rooftop solar panels will be rolled out first with uptake and impacts on the consenting system monitored and considered prior to implementing the fast-track consent process for sustainable buildings.
