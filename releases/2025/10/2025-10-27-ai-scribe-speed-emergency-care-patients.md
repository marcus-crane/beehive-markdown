An artificial intelligence (AI) scribe tool will be rolled out to 1000 doctors and frontline staff working in emergency departments across the country, Health Minister Simeon Brown says. 

“Delivering modern health infrastructure, including digital tools that make a real difference for patients and staff, is a priority for the Government,” Mr Brown says.

“Too many doctors have told me that paperwork and documentation take up too much of their day. This tool will help free them up to spend more time with patients – listening, diagnosing, and treating – rather than writing down or typing up notes.”

The AI scribe securely records a consultation and automatically creates draft clinical notes, referral letters, and follow-up summaries. The doctor reviews and confirms these notes, saving time while making sure important information is accurately captured.

“This allows doctors to spend more of the appointment interacting directly with patients, while the technology captures the details for them. It also helps ensure nothing important is missed, leading to more consistent follow-up care.”

The tool is tailored to New Zealand’s clinical language and systems, meets all privacy requirements, and includes strong security protections to keep patient information safe. It is already being used successfully in some primary care settings, so patients may already have experienced it during an appointment with their GP.

Mr Brown says a successful pilot in Hawke’s Bay and Whanganui showed strong results and the practical difference technology can make for both doctors and patients.

“Doctors using the AI tool were able to see, on average, one additional patient per shift because of the time saved. That means faster care for patients and less waiting time in emergency departments.

“Based on this success, Health New Zealand has purchased an initial 1000 licences for frontline staff in emergency departments, enabling its nationwide rollout.

“Doctors and nurses want to focus on the person in front of them. This tool helps them do that – making the consultation more personal, while still capturing all the details needed for ongoing care.”

Mr Brown says Health New Zealand will continue exploring other ways AI and digital technology can help improve care and make the health system work better for patients.

“We need to embrace AI as a way to maximise our health workforce, giving clinicians tools that save time, reduce pressure, and allow them to spend more time with patients.

“AI will never replace clinical skill or judgement, but it can support our people to do what they do best – provide timely, quality care to New Zealanders. 

“We’re committed to improving access and quality across the health system. AI will play an important role in supporting frontline healthcare staff and helping patients get the care they need, faster and more efficiently, long into the future.”
