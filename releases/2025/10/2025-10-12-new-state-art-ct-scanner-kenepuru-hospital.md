Patients in Porirua and surrounding communities now have access to faster, more accurate diagnostic imaging, with a new state-of-the-art Photon Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) scanner operational at Kenepuru Hospital, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is Kenepuru Hospital’s first scanner, representing a major step forward for medical imaging in the region,” Mr Brown says.

“It delivers sharper, faster, and more detailed scans, helping patients get the care they need sooner and closer to home.

“By bringing scanning capability to Kenepuru Hospital, patients who would otherwise travel to Wellington Hospital for CT scans can now be treated locally. This will reduce travel for patients and staff, improve convenience for families, and ease pressure on regional services.”

“It will boost the region’s outpatient scanning capacity by more than 5000 scans a year, reducing pressure on Wellington’s tertiary hospital scanners and improving patient flow for inpatients and emergency department cases across greater Wellington region.

“The addition of advanced technology PCCT scanning will also enhance acute chest pain services, allowing quicker and less invasive diagnostic treatment for cardiac patients who currently require angiography procedures.”

The Kenepuru Hospital scanner is the second PCCT scanner to be installed in New Zealand, following the first at Christchurch Hospital in September. A third scanner is expected to become operational at Wellington Regional Hospital by mid-2026.

The PCCT scanner produces significantly higher image quality than traditional CT machines, allowing specialists to detect very small structures and subtle cardiac abnormalities that were previously difficult or impossible to see.

“The improvement in imaging is like moving from black-and-white television to Ultra HD. It means patients can often avoid invasive procedures and overnight stays, while staff can focus on those with more complex needs.

“We are committed to delivering modern, quality health infrastructure that enables better care for New Zealanders. This new technology is another step towards ensuring patients receive world-class care closer to home in Porirua,” Mr Brown says.
