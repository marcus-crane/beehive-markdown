Foreign Minister Winston Peters and UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper held the second annual NZ-UK Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in London today. 

“The UK is one of New Zealand’s oldest and most important international partnerships,” Mr Peters says. 

“In the current adverse strategic environment, the UK-NZ relationship is only becoming more and more important.

“Our discussions at today’s Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue underlined the vast array of issues on which New Zealand and the UK must cooperate even more closely.”

Discussions included bilateral security, economic and strategic cooperation; working together in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific region; and combating Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.

“This was a valuable opportunity to discuss our shared values, as natural partners in a challenging global environment. New Zealand is committed to working with our like-minded partners to uphold the international rules-based order,” Mr Peters says.    

Mr Peters invited Foreign Secretary Cooper to visit New Zealand in 2026 for the third annual Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue.

While in London, Mr Peters also met Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Seema Malhoutra; Shadow Foreign Secretary, Priti Patel; and the Leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage. 

During his ongoing European trip, Mr Peters will also visit Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
