Farmers, growers, and foresters are encouraged to not take unnecessary risks and to heed weather warnings today, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay says.

“A state of local emergency is in place for the Canterbury region. Canterbury, Wellington and Wairarapa south of Carterton are under a rare red level strong wind warning,” Mr McClay says.

“Flying items, falling trees, and toppled powerlines could pose a threat to life. I encourage farmers, growers, and foresters not to take any unnecessary risks and to put human safety first.

“Farmers should wait until wind warnings have been lifted before attempting to repair or move damaged farm irrigators, or to clear toppled trees.

“People in affected areas are being encouraged to stay indoors or seek shelter away from trees, to avoid travel, and prepare for power cuts. My thoughts are with everyone hunkering down until the winds ease.

“The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has staff who are monitoring the weather situation and are working closely with civil defence emergency management teams across the country and providing support where required.”

Farmers and growers who require support are encouraged to contact their local Rural Support Trust on 0800 787 254.
