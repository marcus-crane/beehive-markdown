The Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery Mark Mitchell declared a state of local emergency for the Southland Region at 9am this morning.

“A state of local emergency is necessary as a precautionary step due to concern about the potential impacts from power outages on other lifeline utilities in the Southland Region from the significant weather event yesterday,” Mr Mitchell says.

“I have made this declaration as the Southland Mayors have not yet been able to be sworn in following the recent local elections.

“The state of local emergency will ensure local Civil Defence have access to the emergency powers they need to respond and support emergency services during this event.

“My thoughts are with everyone in Southland and elsewhere who have been affected by this event.

“Listen to advice provided by your local Civil Defence Emergency Management Group and emergency services and follow any instructions. Put safety first. Don’t take any chances.

“With further bad weather expected for some parts of the country early next week, people should stay up to date with the latest weather information from MetService,” Mr Mitchell says.

**Notes to editors:**

Under section 69 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 the Minister can declare a state of local emergency in certain cases, including if it has not been or cannot be declared by an authorised person at a local level. This includes in times when an emergency arises following a local election but before elected representatives have been sworn in.

Only elected representatives of the members of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Group can declare a state of local emergency. Following a local election there may be no-one available to declare as members cannot act as an elected representative until they are sworn in (clause 14, Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002).
