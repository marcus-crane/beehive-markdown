Women on the Kāpiti Coast now have easier access to breast screening with the opening of a new fixed site in Waikanae, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Women’s Minister Nicola Grigg announced today.

“This is a significant step forward for women in Kāpiti,” Mr Brown says.

“Until now, the Kāpiti Coast has been served by a mobile breast screening unit, which also covers the greater Wellington region, Hutt Valley, and Wairarapa.

“Now, women can book appointments and be screened closer to home in a purpose-built facility. The new fixed site will provide more consistent access and greater capacity to support the increased number of women eligible under the Government’s expanded national breast screening programme.

“The site is also more spacious than the mobile unit, offering a more comfortable environment for women attending screening.”

The facility includes a new mammography machine, a lead-lined x-ray room, and upgraded furnishings, fittings, and IT systems, all funded through the breast screening age extension project.

Ms Grigg says mammograms can detect breast cancer before any changes can be felt, giving women the best chance of successful treatment.

“October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and this new site is a timely reminder of how important early detection is,” Ms Grigg says.

“Breast cancer is the most common cancer among New Zealand women, affecting one in nine over their lifetime, with around 3400 new cases each year. Sadly, around 650 mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends die from breast cancer every year.

“The good news is that 95 percent of women with breast cancer survive 10 years or more when detected through screening. With nine women learning today that they have breast cancer, making screening more accessible and convenient has never been more important.”

Mr Brown says the opening of the new site complements the Government’s phased expansion of the national breast screening programme, which now includes women aged 70 and 74 as the first step.

“This new site means women in Kāpiti can access the healthcare they need close to home. Early detection saves lives, and easy, reliable access to screening is a vital part of that,” Mr Brown says.
