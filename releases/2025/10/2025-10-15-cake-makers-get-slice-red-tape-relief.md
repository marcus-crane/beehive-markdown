The Government is cutting red tape for home-based cake makers as part of a wider work programme to make it easier to operate and innovate in the food sector, Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard and Regulation Minister David Seymour announced today.

“By November this year we will be reducing costs for home based cake makers by removing ongoing verification and revising registration requirements under the Food Act,” says Mr Hoggard

“There is no reason low-risk cake makers should have to navigate the same level of red tape and compliance costs as a large commercial bakery, but currently they do.

“These changes fix what matters for bakers. They will find it easier and cheaper to operate, opening the door for more people to turn their hobby into a business or an extra income stream. For consumers, it means more choice and competition – especially in smaller towns where options can be limited.

“Businesses take food safety seriously because they want their customers to come back, and to spread the word. Where we have rules, they should be proportionate to the actual risk.”

Minister for Regulation David Seymour says this is another example of the Red Tape Tipline helping Kiwis frustrated with frustrated with disproportionate regulation.

“People shouldn’t be bogged down in compliance for the sake of it. The Red Tape Tipline is giving Kiwis a voice, and it’s working,” says Mr Seymour.

“Dozens of cake makers got in touch to say the current requirements didn’t make sense. The Ministry investigated, agreed, and now we’re fixing it. That’s how regulation should work, responsive to those who are affected and focussed on what really matters.

“We’re acting on the tips we get through the red tape tipline by removing regulation and making it easier for Kiwis to get things done. We want to hear about red tape like this that’s getting in the way – I encourage anyone with a red tape issue to report it on the [Ministry for Regulation website](https://consultation.regulation.govt.nz/regulatory-issues/tell-us-about-a-regulatory-issue/).”

“Today’s changes are just the first step and work is underway on further red tape cuts for the food sector,” says Mr Hoggard

“In recent months I’ve met with nearly 20 food businesses across the country, and attended roundtables with members of Hospitality New Zealand, the Restaurant Association and the New Zealand Food and Grocery Council.

“The issues raised at those meetings, along with feedback on the Red Tape Tipline, are informing this work programme. But if you’re a business I haven’t heard from, get in touch.”

Additional changes MPI officials are working on include:

- Reducing regulatory costs for more low-risk businesses
- Assistance for businesses to innovate and test new products
- Providing more flexibility for testing, without compromising safety
- Simplifying record keeping requirements
- Making it easier to export food products
- Applying consistent rules and verification across the country
- Providing free food safety training
- Establish a strengthened level playing field by managing more unregistered businesses

“Whether you operate a food truck, export to the world, or anything in between, I want to make your life easier.”

“Less time on paperwork means more time creating jobs, innovating, and serving Kiwis,” says Mr Hoggard.
