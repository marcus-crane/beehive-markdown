The New Zealand Government has made a payment to the Government of Samoa of Samoan Tala (SAT) 10 million (approximately NZD 6 million) following the grounding and sinking of HMNZS Manawanui in October last year.

Today marks a year since the HMNZS Manawanui sank off the Safata District coastline on the south side of Upolu, Samoa. All 75 passengers and crew survived.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters says the payment follows a request from the Government of Samoa.

“We have responded to the Government of Samoa’s request in full and with good faith. We have always said we will do the right thing,” Mr Peters says.

“We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.”

Mr Peters says New Zealand continues to work with Samoa on decisions around the ship and its future.

“Working with the Government of Samoa, our focus continues to be on minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response. These are our absolute priorities,” Mr Peters says.

A comprehensive Court of Inquiry into the causes of the incident has been concluded and considerable work to implement the recommendations is underway.

Any disciplinary proceedings that may arise are yet to be determined, but NZDF advises that the investigation is reaching its closing stages.
