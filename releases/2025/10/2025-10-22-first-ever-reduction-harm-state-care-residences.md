Minister for Children Karen Chhour has today announced the achievement of a reduction of harm in state care residences, the first reduction of its kind in New Zealand’s history.  

“I am grateful to be able to confirm the first ever reduction of harm within Youth Justice and Care and Protection residences, a 14% decrease since 2024, this latest data shows our focus and hard work is getting results.  

It is tragic that any harm occurs, but we have made a number of investments and changes to practice to get meaningful reductions to harm. We are fixing what matters.  

There has been a significant programme of change across all of our residences and we believe that our strengthened systems and clear focus on safety supports the reduction of harm in residences.  

I made improving safety in residences one of my key priorities for Oranga Tamariki when I first became Minister for Children, and Oranga Tamariki have stepped up to this challenge.  

They have implemented improved and greater training, enhanced recruitment, and strengthened leadership.  

Training initiatives include frontline leadership training being rolled out across secure residences to ensure teams have the support and specialist knowledge needed to reduce harm.  

They also include better induction programmes for staff have also been introduced in our youth justice residences, which has a strong focus safety, including proactive behaviour management.  

We’re also investing in a number of safety and quality improvements to the facilities at youth justice residences. We have introduced a practice of only using see-through bags in these residences so that the contents can be observed, this supports safety by preventing unauthorised or potentially harmful items being brought in, even inadvertently.  

When children and young people have experienced harm in a residence, there is planning for immediate safety, a medical response is provided when needed, and the Police are involved when required.  

This work aligns with, and was very much inspired by, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care, particularly the heartfelt words of survivors who wanted us to ensure their experiences weren’t repeated. We have listened, and we thank you for speaking up.  

We have refocused the children’s system on what matters – the safety and wellbeing of children, whether in the community or residences – and the results are clear,” says Minister Chhour.
