Residents of the Chatham Islands now have access to permanent ultrasound services at the Chatham Islands Health Centre, marking a major step forward in rural healthcare delivery, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is a significant milestone for the Chatham Islands community, improving access to both routine and emergency diagnostic care. It will also support visiting specialists, helping them deliver more comprehensive care during their time on the islands,” Mr Brown says.

“Until now, residents had to travel long distances to the mainland for basic diagnostic services. With this new technology, we’re improving access to early diagnosis and bringing care closer to home, while saving time and reducing costs for patients.

“The system enables routine scans for conditions such as gallstones, bladder issues, and deep vein thrombosis, performed by local staff with remote guidance from sonographers and doctors at Christchurch Hospital. This allows timely assessments and follow-up care without the disruption and expense of travel.

“In urgent cases, scan images are live streamed to Christchurch, allowing medical teams to confirm diagnoses and prepare for patient transfers. This ensures continuity of care and better treatment planning before the patient even arrives.”

A successful live trial was conducted yesterday with ICU and radiology teams in Christchurch in a simulated clinical environment. The service is expected to expand as staff gain training and experience, including some maternity scans.

“This initiative reflects our commitment to strengthening rural health services and ensuring all New Zealanders have access to timely, quality care, no matter where they live. It’s a great example of how technology and collaboration can transform healthcare delivery in remote communities,” Mr Brown says.
