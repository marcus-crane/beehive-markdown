Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey has celebrated the addition of peer support workers in Dunedin Hospital’s Emergency Department today with a visit to the region to meet some of the team. 

“For people arriving at an emergency department in mental health crisis, the experience can feel overwhelming. Having a peer support specialist alongside them, someone with lived experience who understands what they’re going through can make a huge difference,” Mr Doocey says. 

Dunedin Hospital is the sixth major hospital to implement the service since September last year. 

“We’ve already seen the impact this service is having in other hospitals. It’s helping people feel heard, supported, and more connected to ongoing care. I’m pleased we’re moving quickly to expand this model across New Zealand so more people can benefit.” 

The Dunedin service will be delivered by Life Matters Suicide Trust, who have been offering peer-led support and advocacy in the community since 2014. Their team will build on this work inside the hospital, complementing the drop-in and crisis services they already provide locally. 

“Knowing there is someone in the room who has walked a similar journey and come through it can give people real hope,” Mr Doocey says.

“Peer support specialists also play an important role in linking people back into community services, helping to set them up for better outcomes once they leave hospital.

“As New Zealand’s first Minister for Mental Health, I’m determined to better utilise and strengthen the peer support workforce. Their expertise and empathy are invaluable in our mental health system and part of a silent revolution taking place.”

Since its launch at Middlemore Hospital in September 2024, the peer support service has been rolled out to Auckland City, Wellington, Christchurch, and Waikato Hospitals, with more to follow.

“Peer support workers are a part of our mental health plan for faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.

“This Government is focused on building a stronger workforce so that when people take the brave step of asking for help, that support is available.”
