From today more Kiwi families can apply for more help with the cost of early childhood education (ECE) under the Government’s expanded FamilyBoost scheme.

Households are from today able to submit claims for their costs from July to September.

“The expansion of the scheme means more families are eligible for FamilyBoost, and the refunds are more generous,” Finance Minister Nicola Willis says.

“Now, households with combined incomes up to just under $230,000 are eligible – this was previously capped at $180,000.

“Meanwhile, the eligible households can now claim back 40 per cent of their ECE costs, up to a maximum of $300 a week. This was previously set at 25 per cent.”

Nicola Willis encouraged families with children in ECE to check their eligibility on the Inland Revenue website.

“It’s very easy to register and apply for FamilyBoost. Just head to the Inland Revenue website – ird.govt.nz/familyboost."

“More than 68,000 households have already benefited from FamilyBoost, making life with a little one that much easier.

“The Government knows every little bit helps, and I encourage any family with children in ECE to check their eligibility and apply, so they have more money in their pockets, and can focus on the things that matter most.

**Notes to editors:**

The Income Tax (FamilyBoost) Amendment Act increased the proportion of ECE fees families can claim from 25 to 40 per cent.

Previously, an eligible household with fees of $100 a week could claim $25. Now, it’s $40 – an increase of $780 over the year. The amount they receive will depend on their household income.

FamilyBoost is paid on fees up to $300 a week so the maximum a family can now claim increases from $75 to $120 a week.

The Act also increased the household income limit for FamilyBoost from $180,000 a year to just under $230,000, making about another 21,000 households eligible for help with ECE costs.

Legislation supporting the changes – which expanded access to the scheme –[passed into law at the end of September,](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/families-get-extra-help-ece-costs) with all parliamentary parties in favour except the Green Party.
