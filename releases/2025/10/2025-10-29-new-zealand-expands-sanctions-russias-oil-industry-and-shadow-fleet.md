Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil trade while meeting with the Nordic 5 Foreign Ministers in Stockholm. 

“New Zealand is sanctioning 65 shadow fleet vessels involved the shipment of Russian oil, a key source of revenue funding Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” Mr Peters says. 

New Zealand has also sanctioned actors from Belarus, Iran, and North Korea, involved in refining and transporting Russian oil, and in facilitating oil-related payments. 

“These actors are part of a broader network enabling the trade in Russian oil, undermining global efforts to curtail funding for Russia’s illegal war,” Mr Peters says. 

“By targeting the oil supply chain, New Zealand is acting decisively in support of international efforts to bring Russia to the negotiating table.” 

Since the Russia Sanctions Act came into force in March 2022, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,900 individuals, entities, and vessels, alongside a range of trade measures. This is New Zealand’s 33rd round of Russia sanctions.
