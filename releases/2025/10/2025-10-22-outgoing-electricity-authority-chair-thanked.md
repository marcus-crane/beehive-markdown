Electricity Authority Chair Anna Kominik has announced her resignation, Energy Minister Simon Watts says.

“I want to acknowledge the work Ms Kominik has led over her tenure and thank her for her contribution. As chair, Ms Kominik has led significant reforms in the electricity sector and I am confident they will build a more secure and affordable electricity market for consumers,” Mr Watts says. 

The timing of Ms Kominik’s decision was linked to another professional opportunity, and because the time is right following the Frontier Economics Review of Electricity Market Performance. She will remain as chair until a replacement is appointed.  

Prior to leaving, Ms Kominik will commence a Board-led organisational review of the Authority.

“Following the Frontier report, the Government has signalled a commitment to strengthen the Authority’s enforcement capacity and analytical capability. The Electricity Authority Board will commission the report and will work with Government on the recommendations early in 2026,” Mr Watts says.

“The purpose of the review is to ensure the regulator is able to deliver on its widened pro-competitive mandate, while at the same time being anchored in consumer benefit and public value.”

The current Authority vacancies will be publicly advertised on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website [Current board vacancies | Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/who-we-are/board-appointments/current-board-vacancies)
