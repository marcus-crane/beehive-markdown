The first step of the nationwide breast screening age extension is underway, with women aged 70 and 74 now eligible for free screening, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Women’s Minister Nicola Grigg say.

“Breast cancer remains the most common cancer affecting New Zealand women,” Mr Brown says.

“Expanding free breast screening to include women aged 70 and 74 is the first step in a four-year rollout. Each October for the next three years, eligibility will extend to include women aged 71, 72, and 73.

“The extension means women will be eligible for an average of two to three extra mammograms once the programme is fully implemented, and around 130,000 additional women will be eligible for screening every two years. This phased approach ensures health services can expand in step with demand while maintaining quality care.

“Health New Zealand is also recruiting and training more staff, investing in mammography and ultrasound machines, opening new screening and assessment facilities, and building four new mobile screening units.”

Confirmation of the age extension was announced in April 2024 as part of the Government’s 100-Day Plan to deliver better public services. Until now, free screening was available to women aged 45 to 69 every two years. A pilot in Nelson and Marlborough, launched in October 2024, is helping guide the nationwide rollout.

Ms Grigg says early detection remains the most powerful tool in the fight against breast cancer.

“Each year, around 3,400 New Zealand women are diagnosed with breast cancer. Screening is one of the most effective ways to detect it early and improve survival rates,” Ms Grigg says.

“Women who participate in breast screening are less likely to die from breast cancer. Once the full age extension is in place, it’s expected to detect breast cancer earlier in about 60 more women annually – giving them a far better chance of successful treatment.

“That will make a real and lasting difference for women and their families across New Zealand.”

The extension will also help improve outcomes for Māori and Pacific women, who experience higher rates of breast cancer and lower screening participation.

Mr Brown says the rollout is being supported by a new digital platform that makes breast screening faster, simpler, and more accessible.

“The system automatically identifies eligible women, sends screening invitations, and enables secure online booking and management of appointments,” Mr Brown says.

“This technology is already helping more women get screened on time, ensuring more cancers are caught early. By extending free screening and harnessing smart digital tools, we’re making it easier for women to get the care they need, when they need it.

“This is an important step forward in catching cancer earlier, saving lives, and ensuring women across New Zealand have access to timely, quality, life-saving care.”
