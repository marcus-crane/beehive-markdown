Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey has announced two new appointments to the Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission Board, alongside a new Deputy Chair and two reappointments.

“The Government is focused on delivering faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response. It is the Commission’s role to hold the Government to account to ensure we are delivering those results,” Mr Doocey says.

“Dr Barbara Disley, a current board member, has been appointed Deputy Chair for a five-year term. Hayden Wano continues as Chair of the Commission.

“The two new members who have been appointed are Josiah Tualamali’i and Rae Lamb.

“There are also two existing members that have been reappointed who are Professor Sunny Collings and Tuari Potiki.

“Wayne Langford continues his term as a member.

“I want to acknowledge outgoing board members Kevin Hague and Alexander El Amanni for their significant contributions to the Commission during their terms.”

“As leaders in mental health and wellbeing, the Commission’s board members are powerful advocates for ensuring services meet the needs of New Zealanders. It is great to have such strong mental health advocates bringing specialist expertise and diverse perspectives to the table.”
