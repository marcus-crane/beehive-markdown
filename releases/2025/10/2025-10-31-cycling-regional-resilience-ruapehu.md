Two destination-making cycle trails will deliver more visitors to the Ruapehu region and boost the Central North Island economy.

“I’m thrilled to announce the Government will fund the completion of the Te Ara Mangawhero and Te Hangāruru trails, connecting them into the Mountains to Sea – Ngā Ara Tūhono cycle journey,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“These two routes are among the last sections needed to complete the full trail from Mount Ruapehu to the Tasman Sea, with just one section remaining before cyclists can complete the 231km journey.”

Minister of Conservation Tama Potaka says “This kaupapa is linking our people, our stories, and our whenua (land). Completing these trails will strengthen local communities and regional economies while enhancing the environment that sustains us.

“Ngā Waihua o Paerangi Trust and Te Korowai o Wainuiārua are leading this mahi (work) alongside Ngā Ara Tūhono Trust and the Department of Conservation. This is another powerful example of partnership in action. Together, they’re creating experiences that honour the rich experiences and cultural significance of the land.

“Visitors come to Aotearoa New Zealand for our landscapes, our bush, and our stories. Te Ara Mangawhero and Te Hangāruru will nurture that connection, places where visitors and locals alike can experience the beauty, meaning, and identity of this region.

“We are focused on practical partnerships that protect our taiao, celebrate our culture, and strengthen regional economies, ensuring our natural heritage continues to sustain people, place, and purpose for generations to come.”

Due to be completed by early 2027, the works totalling $10.8 million will be funded by the International Visitor Levy and the recently announced Major Events and Tourism Package.

Sections of the track will be open to the public as they are completed, with the full project due to be concluded in early 2027.

“Our Government’s Major Events and Tourism Package has been designed to drive visitor spending, support local businesses, and create jobs up and down the country. Ready-to-go projects like these cycle trails will bring more visitors to the region, entice them to stay longer, and build confidence in the local economy,” Louise Upston says.

“Adding to the diversity of experiences in the Ruapehu district will develop long term resilience across our tourism sector. It’s a stunning part of New Zealand and it deserves to be showcased.”
