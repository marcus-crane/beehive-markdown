Three practical initiatives to improve our freight system will support economic growth, productivity, resilience and safety, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“New Zealand’s freight system is the driving force behind our economy. It gets food and fibres from farms to factories, and then on to shops in New Zealand, or to ports to be exported for overseas markets. Freight underpins economic growth and supports tens of thousands of jobs,” Mr Bishop says.

“As our population grows, so does the demand for goods and the need to accommodate increased freight traffic on our state highway network.

“Each year around 300 million tonnes of freight moves around New Zealand, largely by our Kiwi truckies, covering more than 30 billion tonne kilometres – and freight volumes are expected to increase by 55 percent over the next 20 years.”

“We need to support our freight system to keep up with demand as our economy grows. Today I am pleased to confirm three meaningful steps the Government is taking to keep our freight system trucking along:

1. Launching an Action Plan for Freight
2. Updating the National Freight Demand Study
3. Establishing a Freight Advisory Council

“The Action Plan for Freight, led by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) places a strong emphasis on maximising the economic value of freight, improving the use of freight data to drive investment decisions, delivering infrastructure that considers the needs of the freight sector, and making improvements to regulatory settings to increase productivity.

“Primary actions in the plan include re-confirming the nationally and regionally strategic freight networks using current data, establishing appropriate road freight levels of service, researching strategic vulnerabilities of the freight network, reviewing and updating the current rest area strategy, updating the methodology for measuring interpeak freight travel time predictability, and delivering the Commercial Vehicle Safety Programme.

“We have heard from freight industry groups about the challenges they face and the need for specific improvements, and I want to thank them for their continued advocacy. NZTA has incorporated this feedback in the creation of this action plan where it delivers public benefit and it is my expectation that through regular and ongoing engagement, further practical initiatives will continue to be added over time.

“NZTA is well placed to lead this work, as our state highways carry almost 75 percent of all freight journeys and connect our regions, cities, towns, inland ports and freight hubs, main seaports, and airports. Together with local roads, that rises to 93 percent of all freight journeys.

“NZTA will also continue to support KiwiRail through the Rail Network Investment Programme (RNIP) to focus investment on the busiest and most productive parts of the existing rail network to help meet their target to increase the Nett Tonne Kilometres of freight moved by rail.

“Every mode of transport needs to play their part in a well-functioning freight system, through road, rail, coastal shipping, and air – with each mode delivering its own value proposition for customers.

“We’re also updating the National Freight Demand Study. This study has previously looked at total changes in freight movement by mode (road, rail and coastal shipping), commodities transported, and the origin and destination of freight across different regions, and freight forecasts. It provides invaluable data for the freight sector and government.

“The study was paused by the Ministry of Transport last year, and since then the freight sector has been calling for its reinstatement.

“I have listened, and I agree with them – the insights this study generates are essential for making smart investment decisions.

“The National Freight Demand Study will now be the responsibility of NZTA, who will fund and publish it to better understand current and future freight patterns in New Zealand.

“Finally, the Government will create a Freight Advisory Council. The Council, which will be made up of leaders from across the freight sector and convened by the Secretary of Transport, will meet to discuss issues and opportunities. They will also provide insights and advice to Ministers and relevant government agencies, helping them make informed decisions as we drive our economy forward. We’ll have more to say about membership of this Council soon.

“Whether it’s making better use of freight data to drive investment decisions or improving regulatory settings for increased productivity, these actions for freight will smooth the road for our importers, exporters and freight operators so they can get their goods out across the country, quickly and safely.”
