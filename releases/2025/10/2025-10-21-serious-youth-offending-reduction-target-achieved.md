There has been a 16% reduction in children and young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour, achieving a key government target four years early. 

Minister for Children Karen Chhour says, “I am proud to announce that the Government Target Three – 15% fewer children and young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour by the end of 2029 – has been not only achieved but surpassed. 

We’re fixing what matters by keeping communities safer and supporting young people to make better choices, while holding those who don’t to account. 

This is a remarkable turnaround for a significant national issue that was out-of-control only 18 months ago. 

Under the previous government, youth offending was persistent and getting worse – with a 21% increase in serious and persistent offending between June 2022 and June 2023, and a further 3% increase in serious and persistent offending on top of that between June 2023 and April 2024. 

Greater investment in transitional support for young serious offenders, greater coordination between Courts, Oranga Tamariki, and Police, the Military-Style Academies, and innovative government-funded community-led re-offending reduction programmes have all contributed to this hugely meaningful result. 

This has also been achieved thanks to the hard work of our amazing Oranga Tamariki, Courts, and Police staff. 

People voted for safer communities and better aspirations for young people, that is exactly what we have delivered.”
