Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey has welcomed the introduction of peer support workers in North Shore Hospital’s Emergency Department, completing the rollout of the service across all three major Auckland hospitals.

“With North Shore now on board, it’s great to see the whole Auckland region benefitting from peer support in EDs. This is about making sure people in mental distress have the right support at the right time,” Mr Doocey says.

“For anyone in mental health crisis, arriving at a busy emergency department can be overwhelming. Having a peer support specialist there, someone with lived experience who understands what they’re going through can bring real comfort and hope.”

Mr Doocey says the service is already making a meaningful impact around the country.

“People tell us they feel listened to, supported, and more connected to support because of this service. That’s why we’re moving quickly to expand it nationwide.

“Peer support specialists are available to listen, share their experience, and reassure people there is a way forward. They can also link people to community mental health services where needed, helping to set them up for better outcomes once they leave hospital.

“As New Zealand’s first Minister for Mental Health, I want to see us make better use of the expertise and empathy peer support workers bring. We’re embedding this workforce not only in EDs but also in new crisis cafés opening around the country, and in our refreshed eating disorders strategy.

“Peer support workers are a part of our mental health plan for faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
