Biosecurity, Food Safety and Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard travels to Chile today to represent New Zealand at the World Dairy Summit.

“The World Dairy Summit is the leading event in the annual global dairy calendar, bringing together farmers, processors, scientists, marketers, and policymakers from more than 60 countries,” Mr Hoggard says.

Our farmers set global standards for efficiency, and we should highlight their successes internationally.

I'm looking forward to discussing our innovative, sustainable, and high-quality dairy products with partners and customers at upcoming panels, including the Leaders Forum.

More than 80 percent of people around the world rely on dairy to meet their nutritional needs, the sector is also estimated to contribute to the livelihoods of more than 600 million people.

Together, we can champion dairy as a vital source of nutrition and highlight the essential role it plays in supporting economies across the globe.

The dairy sector will play a significant role in doubling the value of New Zealand’s exports by 2034 and the Government is committed to growing our $27 billion dairy sector.

Attending the World Dairy Summit reinforces our commitment to opening doors for our dairy sector to support the success of Kiwi farmers and processors.”

Minister Hoggard will also visit Argentina to meet with New Zealand agribusinesses, and to Uruguay to officially open a new manufacturing facility built by Auckland BioSciences, a New Zealand life sciences company known for producing high-quality animal sera.
