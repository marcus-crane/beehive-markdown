Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey announced on the final stop of the Rural Health Roadshow that Whakatāne’s Resilience Café, the town’s local crisis recovery café, will receive a funding boost from the Government.

“Emergency departments aren’t always the best place for someone in mental distress. Crisis recovery cafés like Resilience, offer a peer-led, non-clinical space where people can go to get support and be heard,” Mr Doocey says.

The additional funding will enable the café to significantly extend its opening hours. The café was previously open Monday to Friday 7am to 3pm and will now be operating into weekday evenings 7am to 7pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. It will now also open on Saturdays 7am to 3pm.

The team will now be able to grow by at least two additional peer support specialists, meaning the café can double its capacity from seeing 15 people to 31 people at any one time.

“I’ve been calling lived experience the silent revolution, not because it’s new, but because it’s starting to gain more traction here in New Zealand. We are better utilising peer support workers in a range of settings, including emergency departments, eating disorder services, and crisis alternatives.

“I am proud that, since coming into Government, the peer support lived experience workforce has grown by almost 100%.

“The Resilience Café is a great example of a community organisation already making a difference, and this funding will help them reach even more people.

“Crisis Recovery Cafes are a part of our mental health plan for faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.”

Whakatāne marks the thirteenth and final stop on the Rural Health Roadshow. Minister Doocey attended a public meeting today to hear from the local community and the frontline.

“These roadshows have given me the invaluable chance to hear directly from rural communities and those working in rural health about what’s working well and where barriers remain.

“I want to thank everyone who took time out of their busy days to come along, hear what this Government’s plan is to improve health and mental health outcomes, and share their own stories.

“The bottom line is that people in our rural communities deserve timely, quality health and mental health support, no matter where they live. That’s exactly what this Government is committed to delivering.”

- The Government has committed to six new Crisis Recovery Cafes by June 2026, as well as boosting some of our existing cafes.
