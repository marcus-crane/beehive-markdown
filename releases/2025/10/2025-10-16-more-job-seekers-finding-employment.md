Minister for Social Development and Employment Louise Upston says the Government’s approach to tackling unemployment continues to make progress despite a challenging economic environment.

“Despite tough economic conditions, MSD stats out today show a 6 per cent rise in the number of main benefit recipients finding work compared to the previous June 2025 quarter,” Louise Upston says. 

“That’s 20,775 New Zealanders moving off the benefit and into work during the period.

“This figure also includes a 6.9 per cent increase in work exits from Jobseeker Support, and a small drop in the number of young people receiving Jobseeker Support over the same timeframe.

“As previously forecast, there have been increases in the number of people receiving a main benefit and Jobseeker Support over the quarter before employment conditions are expected to pick up towards the end of the year. 

“During this period, our Government continues to support jobseekers into work with investment in MSD’s frontline, and by introducing phone-based case management supporting 10,000 more people in case management at any one time.

“Our traffic light system and Kōrero Mahi seminars, which have been running since mid-2024, are helping jobseekers to stay on track with their obligations and seize every opportunity to get work or training. 

“Kōrero Mahi seminars are helping jobseekers to put their best foot forward with advice about finding the right job, CV writing and interview prep – small things which can make all the difference.

“We know many New Zealanders are still doing it tough and that’s why we provide this practical hands on support while people are looking for work. 

“It’s also why our Government remains focused on responsible economic management supporting wider recovery. We are reforming and driving Government policies to support job and income growth, ensuring Kiwis have the opportunity to get ahead.

“Today’s statistics are meaningful. Job seekers finding new roles always means more than just numbers. This data represents independence, security and lives turned around for thousands of New Zealanders and their families.”
