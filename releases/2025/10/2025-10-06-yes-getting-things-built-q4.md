The Government’s relentless focus on growth and pragmatic solutions to help New Zealand get ahead are features of its work programme for the rest of the year, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says.

“A lot more yes and a lot less no. That is the ethos of this Government and it’s what we will be delivering this quarter.

“We are making construction easier and faster, delivering smarter solutions to finance new projects like social housing developments, and pushing for more competition and growth in important sectors.

“There is no shortage of New Zealanders with great ideas for exciting projects, but they face too many obstacles bringing them to life. The sum of the actions in our Q4 plan will help get things moving. Growth will boost job opportunities and help increase incomes around the country.

“The planning system we will introduce to Parliament this quarter will enable farmers, building owners and businesses to do more with their own property, cutting through the reams of red tape that have been holding them back.

“We’re also pressing go on urban growth and more houses by introducing a law that will modernise how housing developments and infrastructure are financed.

“We’re pushing for more competition by creating an express lane to build new supermarkets under Fast-Track.

“And we’re getting on with introducing a new system for managing earthquake-prone buildings that is expected to save New Zealanders more than $8.2 billion and take away anxiety and stress.

“These aren’t just words on a page. These genuinely transformational actions will change the game for ambitious Kiwis who want to build things, grow their businesses, employ more people and contribute to a stronger economic future for New Zealand.”
