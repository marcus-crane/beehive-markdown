New Zealand continues to be a global leader in supporting international seafarers, with nearly $1 million in welfare funding confirmed for 12 of the country’s ports.

Associate Transport Minister James Meager announced the Maritime NZ grants, while opening the new South Canterbury Seafarers Welfare Centre in Timaru.

“99 percent of New Zealand’s imports and exports are transported via sea, so it’s critical for our economy that we are a country which treats international seafarers fairly, and ensures their rights are protected,” Mr Meager says.

The annual grants provide services which help meet New Zealand’s responsibilities under the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC).

This includes:

- Telephone and Wi-Fi services, so seafarers can contact loved ones when away from home.
- Welfare officers’ visits to ships when crew can’t come ashore, to check staff have access to necessary supplies and resources.
- Transportation for crew to undertake personal activities such as shopping and medical visits, when docked.
- Access to financial services, such as currency exchanges and transfers.
- Information about seafarers’ rights under the MLC.
- Funding for seafarer welfare centre operations.

“New Zealand is leading the way for international seafarers’ welfare. We are the first country to fund these services through industry levies, which are predominantly funded by charities overseas,” Mr Meager says.

“The grants scheme, now in its second year, means those who receive the greatest benefits from the services are the ones who contribute the most.

“We know the maritime sector is a key piece of New Zealand’s economy, and the industry’s commitment to pay for seafarer welfare services is an acknowledgement that healthy crews increase productivity, improve safety and help better protect our coastlines.”
