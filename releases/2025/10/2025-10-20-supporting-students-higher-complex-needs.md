The Government is launching the Expanded New Zealand Curriculum (NZC), a resource that will support around 12,000 students with high and complex additional needs from Term 1 next year.

“In the past, expert teachers and specialists in special education have had to adapt the national curriculum themselves so their students can learn from it meaningfully. They will now have a resource that is clear about what to teach each year of school and the evidence-informed practices to use,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

The support is a New Zealand first and provides specialist teachers with a tool to deliver curriculum-aligned teaching and learning for all students. It will support teachers to deliver that learning no matter what context they’re in satellite or specialist education.

“The Expanded NZC outlines specific learning in English and Mathematics and includes comprehensive guidance to make sure the needs of learners are recognised, and their progress and achievement is supported.”

The resource has been developed in partnership by with the Specialist Education Principals’ Association of New Zealand.

“As we roll out the new knowledge curriculum, it’s critical we’re providing support to children with high and complex learning needs so they get the best from it too,” Ms Stanford says.

“It’s essential that all Kiwi kids are supported to progress and achieve. Parents can be assured this evidence-informed resource will help students with complex needs. We want to ensure they are supported and set up for lifelong success,” Ms Stanford says.
