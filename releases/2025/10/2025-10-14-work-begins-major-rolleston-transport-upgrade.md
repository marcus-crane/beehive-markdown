Major roading improvements for Rolleston will drive jobs and economic growth in this growing part of Canterbury, says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

“The State Highway 1 Rolleston Access Improvements project will provide safer, easier and more efficient transport connections for people and businesses in the Selwyn district, the fastest growing district in New Zealand and an important gateway to Christchurch,” Mr Bishop says.

“The Rolleston Access Improvements project is one of the government’s Roads of Regional Significance projects and construction is now underway. Fulton Hogan has been selected by NZTA to do the physical works for the first stage of this project.

“The Rolleston project is just one of many transport projects kicking off before Christmas this year, part of the government’s huge $7 billion of infrastructure projects announced in July.

“The first stage involves a new roundabout at the Dunns Crossing and Walkers Road intersection with State Highway 1,making it safer and easier to enter and exit Rolleston, and more efficient for freight accessing the industrial area from the south.

“Stage one also includes a pedestrian and cycle subway under SH1 at the new roundabout, realignment and widening of the SH1, Dunns Crossing Road, and Walkers Road carriageways, the removal of the existing rail level crossing to be replaced with a new one on Walkers Road, and efficiency improvements at the Weedons interchange. Stage one is expected to be complete by the end of 2026.

“Stage 2 is due to start in the final quarter of 2026 and includes:

- a flyover connecting Rolleston township with business/industrial areas
- improved safety at high-risk highway intersections
- the removal of the two signalised intersections on SH1 (Hoskyns Rd and Rolleston Drive North)
- the extension of the two southbound lanes on the motorway to just south of the proposed bridge at Rolleston
- a southbound service lane to access businesses and Rolleston town centre;
- and major safety improvements and upgrades to the rail level crossing at Hoskyns Road.

“This project is another example of the Government backing economic growth in the regions and helping fast-growing communities to thrive.  

“The full Rolleston Access Improvements project is expected to be completed in late 2028, at a current estimated cost of between $180 to $200 million.”
