The New Zealand Defence Force has deployed a liaison officer to Israel to help inform the Government on possible next steps on the Gaza peace deal, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“The liaison officer will work out of a United States-led centre focused on the next steps to implementing the peace plan in Gaza,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government agreed that the deployment should initially be for six weeks.”

United States Central Command opened the Civil Military Coordination Centre in Israel on 17 October. It will act as a coordination hub for support to Gaza, monitor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, and support the implementation of the 20 Point Peace Plan to end the war in Gaza.

“The deployment will improve New Zealand’s understanding of coordination efforts on the ground and enable us to better assess options for any potential future contributions to the centre or other initiatives in support of sustained peace in Gaza,” Ms Collins says.

“Any future deployment will be a decision for the Government.”
