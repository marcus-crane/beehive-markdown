Small Business and Manufacturing Minister Chris Penk will travel to South Africa this week to represent New Zealand at the Group of Twenty (G20) Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting. 

“As an exporting nation reliant on trade, this is a significant opportunity to advance our interests with some of the world’s largest economies,” Mr Penk says.

The G20 is a grouping of the world’s most significant economies which make up 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 75 percent of international trade.  

New Zealand has been invited to participate as a guest country alongside G20 members to discuss a variety of trade and investment issues, including a reinforced commitment to upholding the international rules-based trading system. 

During his visit, Mr Penk will participate in a ministerial meeting on issues relating to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and advocate for New Zealand’s priorities of defending, strengthening, and modernising the organisation. 

Mr Penk will also seek to enhance the New Zealand relationship with South Africa. 

“New Zealand and South Africa enjoy a warm relationship based on shared democratic values, strong people-to-people and sporting links,” Mr Penk says.

“My engagements in South Africa build on these values by exploring opportunities with my counterparts for collaboration between our small businesses and governments.”

The annual Group of Twenty (G20) Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting will be held on 9-10 October in Gqeberha.

Mr Penk returns to New Zealand on 12 October.
