The Government will invest a further $3 million to extend the Active Me - Kia Tū Hardship Fund for another 12 months, Sport and Recreation Minister, Hon Mark Mitchell, says.

The Active Me - Kia Tū fund, delivered by Variety – The Children’s Charity, in partnership with Sport NZ, supports young New Zealanders facing financial hardship to access quality sport and recreation opportunities.

“Active Me – Kia Tū has made a huge difference in the lives of thousands of children,” says Mr Mitchell.  “This funding extension means we can maintain momentum while more sustainable, long-term funding options are explored.”

Since its launch in 2021, Active Me – Kia Tū has supported over 10,000 children and their whānau, providing grants of up to $300 per child annually to help them participate in sport and recreation. The initiative is designed to remove financial barriers and enable participation in physical activity, particularly in communities with high levels of deprivation.

An independent evaluation of the Active Me – Kia Tū fund in 2024 highlighted significant benefits for young people, including strengthened social skills, increased independence and confidence, as well as overall improvements in mental and physical wellbeing.

“The programme also supports the government target of reducing child and youth offending by 15%, as it takes a primary prevention approach, to address risk factors such as financial hardship and school disengagement. It helps to create positive, inclusive opportunities for connection and belonging, key preventative elements that can help create safer, more resilient communities,” says Mr Mitchell.

Sport NZ is currently undertaking further research into the affordability of sport and recreation. These insights will inform future strategies to reduce costs for participants and improve system-wide efficiencies, with the goal of developing a nationwide approach to supporting individual hardship.
