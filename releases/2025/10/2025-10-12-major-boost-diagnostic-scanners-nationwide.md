A $108 million upgrade to New Zealand’s diagnostic infrastructure will deliver 32 new and replacement CT, MRI, and SPECT scanners across the country, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Modern diagnostic equipment is essential to delivering timely, quality, and accurate care for patients,” Mr Brown says.

“This investment will increase national imaging capacity by around 6 per cent, significantly improving access to faster and more accurate medical imaging for patients across New Zealand.”

The upgrade is in addition to the three CT and three MRI scanners already committed through hospital redevelopment projects, bringing the total to 38 scanners.

“Communities in Northland, Counties Manukau, Taranaki, Hawke’s Bay, Palmerston North, and Porirua will benefit from additional scanners, expanding local capacity and enabling procedures such as CT angiograms for heart disease to be carried out in new locations for the first time.

“Three of the new CT scanners will be photon-counting models, including one announced today at Kenepuru Hospital. 

“These machines can deliver more detailed images and often remove the need for more invasive angiograms. That means quicker, lower-risk procedures for patients and more capacity in hospital labs for treatment.

“The new scanners are expected to enable around 32,000 additional CT scans and 6,800 additional MRI scans each year once fully operational. The new technology provides clearer images and greater diagnostic accuracy, while modern software makes them easier to operate.”

In total, the three-year procurement includes 31 replacement machines, renewing 29 per cent of the national scanner fleet, and seven new, additional machines across 14 hospitals. Once complete, 87 per cent of CT scanners and 93 per cent of MRI scanners will be within their 10-year useful life.

“This investment ensures hospitals have the modern equipment needed to deliver faster, more reliable diagnostic services, supporting the Government’s $65 million Diagnostic Improvement Programme to expand access to timely scans.

“Work is also underway to recruit the workforce needed to operate these machines, supported by the Diagnostic Improvement Programme and National Radiology Clinical Network.

“By upgrading equipment and expanding imaging capacity, we are taking practical steps to reduce wait times and bring care closer to home, so patients across New Zealand can get the tests and treatment they need when they need them.”
