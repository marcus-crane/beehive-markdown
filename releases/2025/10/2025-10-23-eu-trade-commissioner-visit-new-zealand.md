European Union Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will visit New Zealand this week to participate in the European Union-New Zealand Business Summit and first NZ-EU Trade Committee meeting.

Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay says it will be the first time an EU Trade Commissioner has visited since 2018, which was for the formal launch of free trade talks.

Commissioner Šefčovič will be joined by senior government representatives and business leaders spanning a range of sectors including construction, cybersecurity, food and renewable energy.

More than 400 businesses will connect at the summit in Auckland, with 26 European Union member states represented.

“This summit will open doors for trade, creating opportunities for business growth and investment and to reach our goal of doubling export value in 10 years,” Mr McClay says.

The inaugural NZ-EU Trade Committee meeting will also be held on Saturday in Queenstown.

“I’m pleased to be hosting Commissioner Šefčovič for this milestone meeting, which will ensure we are making the most of our high-quality Free Trade Agreement.

“We’re committed to unlocking the full potential of this agreement to boost trade, investment and partnership so businesses across New Zealand and Europe can flourish.

“The EU is an important trading partner for New Zealand, both for exports and imports. Two-way goods and services trade between New Zealand and the EU was worth NZ$21.58 billion in the year to June 2025, with New Zealand exports having increased by $2 billion since the FTA entered into force last year.”

Commissioner Šefčovič will arrive on Friday, October 24 and depart on Saturday, October 25.
