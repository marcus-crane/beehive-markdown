The Government has awarded $129,000 to Northland Regional Council to help cover the cost of removing seaweed that washed up on the region’s beaches during Ex-Tropical Cyclone Tam in April, Environment Minister Penny Simmonds says.

“The $129,000 grant is drawn from the recently established emergency waste funding,” Ms Simmonds says. 

“In the cyclone’s immediate aftermath, local hapū led the clean-up response, supported by Northland Regional Council and local volunteers, working swiftly, to remove more than 100 tonnes of the exotic and highly invasive caulerpa seaweed from the coastline. 

“The cyclone’s powerful swells uprooted large quantities of caulerpa seaweed from the seabed, blanketing beaches in thick green mats.

“When washed ashore, the fast-spreading marine pest can harm coastlines and marine ecosystems, so it was essential to remove the seaweed as quickly as possible to prevent further harm,” Ms Simmonds says.

“I am very pleased to award this funding to Northland Regional Council to help cover the costs from removing this waste, and I commend the local hapū, volunteers and council staff for their swift and dedicated efforts to protect Northland’s beaches.”

Ms Simmonds says the emergency waste funding was set up to help councils with the cost of managing waste following an emergency, helping to support the community with the response.

“The Government recognises the pressure councils are under in managing the aftermath of severe weather events, and we are committed to supporting them and their communities,” Ms Simmonds says. 

“As well as helping Northland, we have also been central to supporting the Tasman District Council in their recovery efforts following the extensive flooding in the region earlier this year.”

While the emergency waste funding was awarded to cover the costs of removing seaweed washed ashore by ex-Tropical Cyclone Tam, Northland Regional Council is also leading the Exotic Caulerpa Elimination Project. 

Supported by $6.2 million in funding from the Ministry for Primary Industries, the project aims to develop an innovative tool to remove the invasive seaweed from the ocean floor.
