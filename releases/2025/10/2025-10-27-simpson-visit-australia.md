Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Scott Simpson will today travel to Canberra and Sydney to strengthen New Zealand’s trans-Tasman partnerships and share insights on regulatory approaches, financial competition, and consumer protection.

While in Canberra, Mr Simpson will meet with ministerial counterparts in Australia’s Federal and State Governments to deepen cooperation between the two countries.

“This visit is an opportunity to explore how New Zealand and Australian regulators can work together to promote fairer markets and drive economic growth across both economies,” Mr Simpson says. 

The Minister’s programme also includes meetings with Australia’s National Anti-Scam Centre, the Australian Banking Association, and Google.

“Engagements with major global platforms will help us advance anti-scam initiatives, strengthen consumer protections, and create safer, more resilient digital environments for people and businesses on both sides of the Tasman.”

As Minister for ACC, Mr Simpson will also meet with key Australian stakeholders and officials to better understand the structure and operation of Australia’s various workers’ compensation schemes.

“While our compensation schemes are unique, by working together we can identify potential improvements, efficiencies, or collaborative opportunities to enhance outcomes for workers and employers in both nations.”

Mr Simpson returns to New Zealand on 1 November.
