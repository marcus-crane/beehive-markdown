Regional decision-making has been restored for New Zealand’s polytechnics, and industry put back into the driver’s seat for work-based learning, with the Government today making good on its promise to scrap Te Pūkenga, Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds says.

“This is an important milestone in rebuilding a vocational education and training system that’s locally and industry-led, regionally responsive, and future focused,” Ms Simmonds says.

“Vocational education trains the people who make our roads, build our houses, run our farms, fix our machinery and care for our people.

“The previous centralised model under Te Pūkenga took decision-making away from regions and industry, failed students and employers, and weakened local communities. 

“This Government is turning that failed system around - giving regions control, restoring financial accountability, and strengthening industry leadership in work-based training.”

The Education and Training (Vocational Education and Training System) Amendment Bill disestablishes the centralised model created under Te Pūkenga and enables the re-establishment of, initially, ten regionally governed polytechnics, with more to follow. It also establishes eight Industry Skills Boards to lead standard-setting, qualification development and temporarily manage work-based training across defined industry groups. These will be operational from 1 January 2026.

Most programmes, functions, assets, and staff of Te Pūkenga will move into the new polytechnics. A two-year transitional period will see the Industry Skills Boards manage existing work-based training while new arrangements are developed across polytechnics, private training establishments, and wānanga.

As announced by the Minister in July, Cabinet has confirmed which polytechnics will operate as stand-alone institutions, including those which will be supported by a new federation, and those which will temporarily remain within Te Pūkenga while continuing to work toward financial sustainability. Cabinet also confirmed in July which Industry Skills Boards will be set up.

“This reform delivers a stable, practical, and future-focused vocational education system,” Ms Simmonds says.

“It allows local providers to respond to regional needs, employers to shape training, and learners to gain skills that lead to real jobs. Communities regain local control, and polytechnics become financially sustainable.”

The legislation ensures vocational education is fit for the future, giving regions and industries the tools to meet local skills needs, support economic growth, and provide learners with pathways to meaningful employment.

“We’re rebuilding a system that works for apprentices, students, employers, and communities - delivering real skills, real jobs, and real value to support this Government in going for growth,” Ms Simmonds says.
