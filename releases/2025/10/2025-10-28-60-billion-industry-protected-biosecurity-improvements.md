Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says that changes to New Zealand’s biosecurity laws will strengthen protections against invasive pests and diseases while protecting and promoting economic growth.

“Food and fibre sector export revenue is forecast to reach $61.4 billion in 2026, making up more than 10 per cent of GDP – the primary sector really is the backbone of the economy,” says Mr Hoggard. 

“Our relative freedom from pests and diseases is a big part of our competitive advantage and underpins our world-leading food and fibre export industry.

“Any incursion can have a major impact though, economic analysis from NZIER says a Foot and Mouth incursion would cost about $14.3 billion a year. What matters is strengthening our biosecurity defences from pest and disease. We’re fixing the system so our food producers can keep doing what they do best.

“These changes underwent extensive public consultation between September and December last year. We’ve listened to the industry and the public to deliver practical fixes that make New Zealand more secure.

The changes include:

- Introducing a two-tiered infringement approach for passengers who fail to declare risk goods at the border. The fine will be $800 for those who do not declare high-risk goods such as fresh fruit and meat. The existing $400 fine will remain for other goods.
- New penalties designed to deter behaviour that puts New Zealand at risk, including fines for breaches of controlled area notices, including the power of arrest for obstructing the execution of a search warrant, and fines of up to $500,000 for serious offences.
- Making New Zealand’s import rules more efficient by making the development of import health standards more flexible by allowing risk assessments to be tailored to the scenario. This will enable higher volumes of trade and give exporters greater access to new materials to develop innovative products without lowering biosecurity standards.
- Improved management of established pests and diseases, including faster approval of pest management plans and faster processes to get responses underway in emergencies.
- Retaining compensation for direct and consequential losses in the event of an incursion, only when they are incurred within 24 months of an event, reflecting the need to strike a balance between fairness and prudent management of taxpayer money.
- Enabling minimum compensation entitlements to be varied by regulations or the Government Industry Agreement process.

“I have decided not to progress legislative changes that were consulted on that would have expanded biofouling controls beyond New Zealand’s territorial waters.

“The best way to manage any incursion is to keep unwanted pests and diseases out in the first place which is why the Government is committed to maintaining a strong border, and robust biosecurity systems.

“We hope to see a draft bill incorporating the changes progress through Parliament later next year.”
