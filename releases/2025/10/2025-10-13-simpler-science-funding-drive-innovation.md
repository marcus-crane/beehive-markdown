Better access to a new, more efficient science funding system will make it easier for researchers to focus on delivering results that matter for New Zealand, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti announced today.

Following recommendations from the Science System Advisory Group, a single, independent board, called Research Funding New Zealand, will be established to make most funding decisions.

“The message from the science and research community has been loud and clear – the current funding system is too complex, too bureaucratic, and takes time and energy away from actual research,” says Dr Reti.

“So, this Government is simplifying the way we fund science, so our researchers can spend less time on paperwork and more time on discovery, innovation, and results that will grow our economy and benefit New Zealanders.

“Research Funding New Zealand will replace the multiple layers of decision-making, taking on the Endeavour, Marsden and Strategic Science Investment Funds – currently administered by three separate funding bodies.

“The change doesn’t change the value of funding available for science, innovation and technology in New Zealand, instead reducing duplication and making the process easier to navigate for applicants.”

Under the new model, public investment in science will be focused on the economy, the environment, health and society, and technology.

An in-principle decision has also been made to transfer health research funding from the Health Research Council to Research Funding New Zealand, with existing funding continuing be invested in critical health research.

“These changes are about smarter investment and stronger outcomes and aligns science funding with similar structures in other small, advanced economies,” Dr Reti says.

“By streamlining funding and improving accountability, we’ll drive science that grows our economy, supports our exporters, tackles environmental challenges, and improves the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.”

The Government will continue to back a broad range of science – from blue-sky research through to applied and commercial innovation – but with a system that is simpler, faster, and more focused on impact.

The transition to Research Funding New Zealand will be phased carefully over four years to ensure continuity and minimise disruption. All current research contracts will continue, and the Government will work closely with the sector to ensure the new approach delivers for scientists, industry, and the country.

“This is about getting the system working better – less bureaucracy, clearer priorities, and a stronger focus on research that makes a difference,” Dr Reti says.
