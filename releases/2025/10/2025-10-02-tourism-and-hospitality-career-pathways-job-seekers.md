Minister of Social Development Louise Upston says the opening of the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC) in Auckland represents an important opportunity for job seekers.

With the NZICC due to open in February 2026, the Ministry of Social Development is in discussions with SkyCity about how it can help fill the wide range of jobs needed when the NZICC opens.

Louise Upston says the multi-purpose convention space will be a jewel in New Zealand’s infrastructure, attracting live events, large conferences and exhibitions.

“With the strong pipeline of events that NZICC already has confirmed, we know there are going to be many job opportunities and MSD will be working closely with SkyCity to help fill permanent and part-time roles, drawing on the talent profiles it holds for Auckland’s job seekers.

“MSD’s relationship with the NZICC and other Auckland employers enables a skilled pipeline of local employees for local jobs in many different roles – many supporting the tourism and hospitality sector.

“Tourism and hospitality are important career paths for New Zealanders and are key parts of growing our economy. 

“This will continue to be important for the Government as we look to increase our investment in the tourism sector and boost international visitor numbers.” 

“More than half (52 per cent) of the people receiving Jobseeker Support in Auckland are moderately to highly skilled, with experience in logistics, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism and retail.

“These are people who will have skills transferrable to tourism jobs and other sectors which support tourism growth. With experience already under their belts, they’re ready to hit the ground running in new roles.

Louise Upston is in Auckland for the latest in a series of MSD Into Work events, bringing MSD’s employment team and employers together to look at getting more job seekers into work.

“Working with MSD, employers at these Into Work events say they find the right people for the job and get support for new employees with a smooth transition into work and long-term success.

“MSD is really stepping up to the mark as a modern, fit for purpose employment service. Its frontline staff are doing great work.”
