Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones have welcomed the approval of the second housing project under the Fast-track Approvals Act. 

Fulton Hogan Land Development Limited lodged an application for the Milldale project in April 2025, which has now been approved by an independent expert panel.

Minister Bishop says the Milldale development in the Auckland suburb of Wainui, is expected to deliver around about 1100-residential allotments.  

“The development will provide much-needed housing for the suburb of Wainui. 

“The project is expected to inject $595 million over a three-year period into the Auckland region. It is also expected to support 3,100 full time equivalent jobs over the development period for the project.

“The Milldale approval, fast on the heels of the Maitahi Village development in Nelson, demonstrates Fast-track's value as part of our wider resource management reforms, by speeding up housing development through reducing unnecessary planning and approval barriers.

“I’m pleased to see the system starting to deliver approvals in these key areas to help address our significant infrastructure deficit and increase housing supply.”

Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said he was looking forward to more regional housing developments reaching the approval stage, along with other regional projects in the pipeline.

“I’m working with Minister Bishop on legislative changes to speed up the process and get projects under way faster.”
