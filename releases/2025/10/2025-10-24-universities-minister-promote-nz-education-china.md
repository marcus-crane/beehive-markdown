Universities and Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti will travel to Beijing this month to promote New Zealand’s high-quality education offering at the China Annual Conference and Expo for International Education (CACIE).

New Zealand is the Country of Honour at CACIE 2025, one of the largest international education events in China, drawing over 35,000 participants. Minister Reti will lead a delegation of New Zealand universities and tertiary education providers to highlight the strength of New Zealand’s education system and its close partnerships with China.

“Education is a key aspect of the New Zealand-China relationship, built on enduring partnerships that have grown over the years,” says Dr Reti.

“I am delighted that New Zealand is the Country of Honour at this year’s CACIE.

“This visit will build on the positive momentum of the Prime Minister’s visit in June. We’re deepening our education links through student exchanges, institutional partnerships, and joint research that benefit both countries, and I look forward to discussing what the future holds with my ministerial counterparts.”

The visit supports the Government’s Going for Growth agenda to grow the value of international education and unleash growth and innovation in New Zealand. China is New Zealand’s largest source of international students, with over 22,000 Chinese students enrolled for study in the first term of 2025.

In the year ending June 2025, New Zealand earned $1.43 billion from Chinese students coming here to study, according to Statistics NZ. Education travel accounted for 47 per cent of all services New Zealand exported to China.

“New Zealand is committed to delivering a high-quality experience for international students,” says Dr Reti.

“We are proud that Chinese students consistently rate their time in New Zealand highly, especially the connections they make and the quality of their education experience.”

China is also New Zealand’s fourth largest partner in terms of scientific co-publications and one of our key research, science and innovation collaborators. While in China, the Minister will meet with his Chinese Science and Technology counterpart.

“This is a valuable opportunity to connect with existing partners and explore new opportunities for education and research cooperation between our countries,” Dr Reti says.

Dr Reti departs New Zealand on Monday 27 October and will return to New Zealand on Sunday 2 November.
