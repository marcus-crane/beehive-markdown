It’s game, set and match for sports fans, with the Government announcing a $5 million investment in a new Centre Court roof for Auckland’s Manuka Doctor Arena.

“I’m thrilled our recent support package for major events and tourism will help secure the future of this important sporting asset for Auckland and New Zealand,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“Stanley St is an iconic venue and has played host to at least a million spectators over the years, with hundreds of matches from high-profile tennis stars including Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Serena Williams.

“Today’s investment not only future proofs Centre Court against the weather but also expand the types of events which can be held there, attracting more visitors and supporting our economy.

“It will also increase seating capacity and give more Kiwis the chance to experience world class sporting action.”

Established more than 100 years ago, the Manuka Doctor Arena currently hosts the ASB Classic for both men and women in the immediate lead-up to the Australian Open – the first Grand Slam of the year. It is also an important venue for the wider Auckland community.

This is the first infrastructure investment announced in the Government’s new $70 million [Major Events and Tourism Package,](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/immigration-and-tourism/tourism/major-events-and-tourism-package) designed to energise the events sector, boost visitor numbers, and drive economic activity across New Zealand.

“If we want to continue to attract world-class events to New Zealand, we need to have world-class facilities to go along with them,” Louise Upston says.

“Tennis Auckland already works really hard to promote and host what is a show-piece sporting event for New Zealand.

“This roof will mean more certainty for organisers, players and fans alike, and I love that we’re able to announce baseline funding to support it. 

“Upgrading existing events and tourism infrastructure like this bolsters associated activities in our cities and regions and improves the overall visitor experience.

“This is a first announcement, but local communities and businesses up and down the country will benefit significantly as we make further decisions, particularly around our hugely popular cycle trails.”

The Government’s $5 million investment will support Tennis Auckland in co-funding its Centre Court Roof project estimated to cost $15 million and planned for completion in 2027.
