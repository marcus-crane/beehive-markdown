Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey and Sir John Kirwan today launched Ask Groov, Health New Zealand’s first endorsed AI powered wellbeing guide for adults.

“Access to mental health support should never be a barrier. With Ask Groov, faster access to support is available 24/7, when and where people need it,” Mr Doocey says.

“With this launch, we’re taking a significant step forward in making mental health support more accessible, practical, and personalised, helping New Zealanders take control of their own wellbeing.

“The Government’s mental health plan focuses on faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response. Innovative tools like Ask Groov gives Kiwis faster access to support and allows us to get in early, preventing problems from escalating.

“The Ask Groov tool is designed to complement, not replace, the care provided by trained professionals. It helps people with mild to moderate needs manage everyday challenges such as stress, sleep issues, or relationship pressures before they escalate.

“Tools like Ask Groov equip people with practical strategies they can use to get through difficult times. By integrating innovative technology with expert clinical guidance, we are building a stronger mental health support system that reaches more people, faster.

“It’s especially great to be here today with Sir John Kirwan, who co-founded Groov alongside Adam Clark. John has been instrumental in breaking down stigma and supporting better mental health across the country.”

Sir John Kirwan highlighted to Minister Doocey that Ask Groov provides people with a safe space to ask their own questions in their own words and receive trusted, science-backed answers. He also notes that the tool has been specifically designed for Kiwis, with content that is reliable, evidence-based, and focused on wellbeing. He passed on this is the kind of support he wishes had been available when he was struggling.

“The tool has been deliberately designed with safety at its core. Ask Groov uses advanced AI techniques to ensure advice comes from information developed or approved by Groov’s clinical experts, so guidance is always safe. If a user needs more support, the tool automatically escalates them to human services such as 1737,” Mr Doocey says.

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
