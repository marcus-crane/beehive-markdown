Dr Mark Hickford has been appointed as a member of the Law Commission for a five-year term and will serve as the President for the next six months, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Dr Hickford has outstanding legal credentials and I am delighted to welcome him to the Commission.  

“Not only does he have the ability to work in complex legal environments, he has sound senior management experience and appreciates the issues involved in maintaining the capability of an organisation.

“Dr Hickford will initially work part-time with the Commission while completing a short-term contractual obligation with Te Puni Kōkiri.

“He will also serve as President of the Commission for a six-month term pending the confirmation of a new President in the New Year.

“I would like to thank the out-going President, Dr Kawharu for her able leadership, her work in the review of the Evidence Act 2006, and in reviewing the law relating to hate crime.”
