A Christchurch Care and Protection Residence will be upgraded and re-opened for children with high and complex needs, with a focus on therapeutic, trauma-informed care. 

Admissions to Te Oranga were paused in 2021, due to staffing issues and chronic underinvestment in the care of vulnerable children. Before resuming operations late next year, the residence will undergo a significant infrastructure upgrade.

Minister for Children Karen Chhour says, “Today’s announcement reflects this Government’s commitment to improving the care experience for children and young people, and my commitment to fixing what matters. 

It also reflects the hard work undertaken to raise professional standards across Oranga Tamariki frontline staff.

Te Oranga Care and Protection Residence in Christchurch was not closed due to a lack of need, but because it had been allowed to become rundown and staff professionalism was not made a priority under the previous government.”

When complete, Te Oranga will provide up to 10 additional beds. 

“The re-building and re-opening of Te Oranga would not be possible without the significant improvements made by Oranga Tamariki over the past 18 months. 

Improved professionalisation, greater training, and long overdue investment in facilities has allowed Te Oranga to safely resume housing young people. 

This investment re-introduces much needed capacity across the residential network, ensuring that children and young people who are at risk and experiencing challenges in the community are safely supported in the most appropriate environment.

Once re-opened, Te Oranga will be a therapeutic environment for children with high and complex needs that will centre around safety, wellbeing and dignity, and supports young people to return home,” says Minister Chhour.
