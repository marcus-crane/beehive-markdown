Defence Minister Judith Collins will today travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus).

“In times of increasing international tension, face-to-face talks are more important than ever,” Ms Collins says.

“I am looking forward to meeting with counterparts to discuss complex defence and security issues, sharing New Zealand’s perspective and deepening existing relationships.”

This year marks the 50th anniversary of New Zealand’s dialogue relations with ASEAN, as well as the 15th anniversary of the first ADMM-Plus meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. The forum is an opportunity to engage on regional security issues and strengthen defence cooperation in the Indo-Pacific with the goal of upholding peace, stability and prosperity.

In addition to attending ADMM-Plus, the Minister will hold a number of bilateral meetings with Defence counterparts.

“As a small trading nation, we rely on the international rules-based order, underpinned by collective security and open trading relations,” Ms Collins says.

“That is why we are investing in our national security and economic prosperity while pulling our weight on the world stage.”

Ms Collins will return to New Zealand on 3 November.
