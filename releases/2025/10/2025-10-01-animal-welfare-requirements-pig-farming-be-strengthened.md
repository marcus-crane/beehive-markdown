The Government is introducing changes to the Animal Welfare Act 1999, raising welfare outcomes for pigs in New Zealand while providing farmers appropriate time to make the changes, Associate Minister of Agriculture (Animal Welfare) Andrew Hoggard announced today.

“These proposed changes set new requirements for the use of farrowing crates and mating stalls, and requirements for space for growing pigs,” Mr Hoggard says.

“Together, these proposed new requirements will be amongst the highest in the world and demonstrate the importance New Zealanders place upon animal welfare.

“Because these are substantial changes, the Government will give farmers sufficient time to prepare for them, with the requirements coming into effect on 19 December 2035.

“This approach provides the sector with a realistic timeframe to make changes to their practices and farms adapting to the new requirements without disrupting domestic pork supply or putting undue pressure on pig farmers.”

Under the proposed new regulations:

- minimum spacing requirements for grower pigs will increase by 13.3 percent.
- the time sows are confined in farrowing crates will be reduced from a maximum of 33 days to seven days, and a requirement to provide manipulable and deformable materials to enable farrowing sows to engage in nest-building behaviours; and
- use of mating stalls will be limited to no more than three hours at a time, down from seven days.

This decision follows five years of consultation with industry, key stakeholders, veterinarians and the public.

“We’ve listened to and considered a broad range of perspectives. I’d like to thank all those that have provided their perspectives and expert advice to ensure our approach is scientifically robust and economically viable”

“The proposed amended regulations aim to ensure New Zealand retains its reputation for high animal welfare outcomes, while making sure we keep a viable pig farming industry in New Zealand, and Kiwis have access to locally grown pork.

“We’ve worked hard to minimise the costs for farmers. Nevertheless, many of these changes will require significant financial investment, infrastructure modification, and changes to practices on farm.”

The Code of Welfare for Pigs is currently being finalised and will be issued after the Amendment Bill is approved by Parliament to ensure alignment between the new requirements pig farmers will need to operate within.

“The approach of separating out the regulations and the Code of Welfare was the best way to replace the regulations that are set to automatically revoke on 18 December 2025, give the sector a realistic path to compliance, and uphold the welfare standards expected by New Zealanders.”

**Notes for editors**

The changes that are proposed are as follows:

- farrowing crates: a regulation allowing confinement of sows for a maximum of three days pre-farrowing, and four days post-farrowing. This will replace the current requirement of a maximum of seven days before farrowing and up to four weeks post-farrowing. There will be no changes to the requirements of the crate size.
- a requirement to provide ‘manipulable and deformable materials to enable farrowing sows to engage in nest-building behaviours.’ This will now be required for all facilities, not just those facilities constructed after 3 December 2010.
- mating stalls: a regulation allowing use for up to three hours at a time, with no limit on the number of times they are used. This replaces the current regulation of the use of mating stalls for no more than seven days per reproductive cycle.
- spacing requirements are measured through a formula known as a ‘k value’. The area for static space allowance for pigs is calculated from metabolic liveweight using the model equation: Area (m2) per pig = k x liveweight 0.67 where k is a constant. The formula gives an indication of the ‘footprint’ of a pig that is lying down (without sharing space with another pig). A k value of 0.019 represents the static space (area occupied when the pig is not moving) while lying on its belly while a k value of 0.047 represents a pig recumbent on its side. The minimum value for k under New Zealand regulations is currently 0.03.
