A Crown facilitator will be appointed to assist Waitaki District Council to amend and resubmit its water service delivery plan under Local Water Done Well, Local Government Minister Simon Watts says.

“The Secretary for Local Government has asked the Council to amend its plan to include an assessment of the current condition, lifespan and value of the district’s drinking water, wastewater and stormwater networks as required under the Local Water Done Well legislation.

“Our priority is for the Waitaki ratepayers to have a plan that will ensure the costs of necessary water infrastructure upgrades are fair, transparent, and do not lead to disproportionate rate increases.

“I have considered my options and have decided to appoint a Crown facilitator, to assist the Council to ensure its amended plan contains the information required to accurately assess the financial projections and overall financial sustainability of its plan.

“I would also like to be assured that the Council has the time and resources to consider all viable water services delivery models that would benefit Waitaki’s ratepayers.”

The Council is now required to conduct an asset condition assessment and update its plan by 30 June 2026, allowing six months for the assessment and a further three months to amend the plan.

“I have notified the Mayor of Waitaki of my decision and expect to confirm an appointment to the role of Crown facilitator by mid-November,” Mr Watts says.

“I am confident the Crown facilitator will help ensure the Council has the expertise and tools to undertake its asset condition assessment and consider its delivery model options, and update its plan accordingly.”
