A reservation over the Kermadec Arc north of New Zealand will remain in place for a further two years, continuing restrictions on mineral permitting in the area, Resources Minister Shane Jones says.

The reservation, established in 2010 and renewed through successive declarations, is made under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 and prevents the granting or extension of permits for prospecting, exploration, and mining of minerals other than petroleum. The area covers about 412,690 km² of seabed and subsoil in the Kermadec Ridge system. 

“The Kermadec Arc is an area of immense environmental and national importance. It is home to unique marine ecosystems and is likely to contain substantial deposits of critical minerals such as copper, zinc, and gold - resources vital for the global clean energy transition,” Mr Jones says. 

“Global interest in the minerals on and under the ocean’s seabed is growing. Our approach to managing a significant opportunity like the Kermadec Arc needs to be informed and strategic.

“Through the Minerals Strategy for New Zealand to 2040, we’ve committed to improving data and research on our mineral resources, and this two-year extension gives us time to progress that work so future decisions on potential development, and the allocation methods that best maximise benefits for New Zealanders, are based on robust evidence.”

The new reservation takes effect on 5 January 2026 and will expire on 4 January 2028. At that point, the Minister for Resources will decide whether to declare a new reservation.
