It has been another busy and productive year in the House as the Government continues to fix the basics and build the future, Leader of the House Chris Bishop says. 

“We are continuing our mission to rebuild the economy, restore law and order and reduce the cost of living, in large part by the legislation we have progressed in the House,” Mr Bishop says.

“2025 has seen 81 Government Bills pass their third readings to become law. A further 91 Government Bills passed their first reading, and 79 Government Bills were reported back from select committee. 

“Important Government legislation passed this year has included:

- Budget 2025 legislation which included Investment Boost, a major new tax incentive to encourage businesses to invest, grow the economy, and lift wages;
- The United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement Legislation Amendment Bill, which furthered New Zealand’s trading relationships with the UAE, a major win for Kiwi exporters;
- The Resource Management (Consenting and Other System Changes) Amendment Bill, which made consenting infrastructure projects easier;
- The Public Works (Critical Infrastructure) Amendment Bill, which streamlines the process for critical infrastructure being built in New Zealand, and;
- The Income Tax (FamilyBoost) Amendment Bill, which provides tens of thousands of families with additional help towards early childhood education costs.

“I am particularly proud that the Parliament Bill passed into law unanimously this year. It was an important constitutional moment which modernises the legislation that governs Parliament and core parts of our democracy and has been in development for a decade. 

“I’d also like to take the opportunity to thank the hard workers who make our Parliament run smoothly, including the House Office, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the cleaners, and staff from the chamber, security, reception, the Parliamentary Library and Hansard, as well as my colleagues on the Business Committee and the Deputy Leader of the House Hon Louise Upston.

“Parliament will be back in January, and we’re looking forward to another successful year to round out the 54th Parliament.”
