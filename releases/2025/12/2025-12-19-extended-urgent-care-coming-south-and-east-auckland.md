People in South and East Auckland will soon be able to access urgent care earlier, later, and overnight, reducing pressure on hospitals and keeping care close to home, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

Getting urgent care in South and East Auckland is about to become significantly easier, with longer hours now in place and full round-the-clock services coming early next year.

From 17 December, Tāmaki Health has extended urgent and after hours care at Local Doctors Ōtara from 7.30am until midnight. This will move to full 24/7 care from 19 January 2026.

“These changes mean people can get help for urgent health issues any time of the day or night, without going to hospital unless it is a genuine emergency,” Mr  Brown says.

“Families deserve care that is close to home, easy to access, and good value. Extending Ōtara’s proven service overnight means whānau can get timely, high-quality medical attention when they need it, while easing pressure on emergency departments.”

After hours services between 5pm and 8am remain free for children and subsidised for those who need it most, helping ensure urgent care stays affordable and accessible.

East Auckland will also benefit from expanded urgent care next year. From 1 March, Eastcare will extend its closing time from 11pm to 1am, while continuing to open from 7am.

“These improvements mean more Aucklanders can get the right care, in the right place, at the right time,” Mr Brown says.

The changes form part of the Government’s national Urgent Care and After Hours Framework, which aims for 98 per cent of New Zealanders to live within a one-hour drive of in-person urgent care.

Recent progress under this framework includes expanded weekday urgent care services in Lower Hutt from 1 December 2025 and a new 24/7 urgent care service in Dunedin from 17 December 2025.

Further improvements are planned across the country next year, including a new 24/7 urgent care service in Whangārei, expanded support for rural communities, 24/7 services in Tauranga, and extended daytime urgent care in Invercargill.

“We are also introducing a more consistent national approach to fees and subsidies, so costs are fair, predictable, and responsive to local needs,” Mr Brown says.
