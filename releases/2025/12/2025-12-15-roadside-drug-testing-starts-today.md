Drug-impaired drivers should expect consequences, with roadside drug testing starting today in the Wellington District before rolling out across the country, Transport Minister Chris Bishop and Police Minister Mark Mitchell say.

“The rollout of roadside drug testing delivers on a key commitment to crack down on dangerous driving that puts innocent New Zealanders at risk,” Mr Bishop says.

“The Government committed to introducing saliva-based roadside drug testing by December 2025, and today we’ve delivered.

“New screening devices are now being rolled out, starting in the Wellington District, and I’ve just seen Police administer one of the very first tests. This is a big step forward for road safety.

“Drivers who get behind the wheel despite being impaired by drug use put themselves and others at serious risk. Around 30 per cent of all road deaths now involve an impairing drug.

“Drug users, be warned: if you take cannabis, meth, MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine and get behind the wheel, you’re putting innocent lives at risk - and we will not tolerate it.”

Police Minister Mark Mitchell says roadside drug testing will give Police the tools they need to better detect and deter drug-impaired drivers.

“Testing drivers at the roadside will help reduce the deaths and serious injuries caused by drug driving,” Mr Mitchell says.

“From April 2026, Police will scale up testing, and by mid-2026 it will be operating nationwide. Once it’s in place across the country, drivers can expect to be tested anytime, anywhere.

“My message is simple – if you’ve taken impairing drugs, don’t drive. If you do, expect to be caught and face the consequences.”

At the roadside, Police will be able to screen drivers’ saliva for four drugs – THC (cannabis), methamphetamine (meth), MDMA (ecstasy), and cocaine – using a screening device. If the test is positive, a saliva sample will be collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis, where it will be tested for 25 impairing substances. Drivers will only receive an infringement penalty following a positive laboratory result.

A driver who tests positive at the roadside will be required to take a second screening test. Two positive tests will result in the driver being prohibited from driving for 12 hours to address any immediate safety risk.

**Notes to editor:**

- The laboratory will test all 25 substances listed in [Schedule 5](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2022/0005/latest/LMS378964.html) of the Land Transport (Drug Driving) Amendment Act 2022.
- Drivers who refuse or fail to comply with a roadside drug test will be issued with a $400 infringement and 75 demerit points, and prohibited from driving for 12 hours.
- Most drivers will be free to go within about 10 minutes, provided they return a negative screening test result.
- Drivers cannot use a prescription or medical note at the roadside to stop them from undergoing a test or to dispute a positive saliva screening test result.
- Once an infringement is issued, the driver will have the ability to apply for a medical defence if it is for a drug that has been prescribed to them.
