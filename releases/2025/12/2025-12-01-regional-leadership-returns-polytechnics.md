Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds has announced the ministerial appointments to the inaugural governing councils of New Zealand’s ten re-established polytechnics, marking a milestone in returning decision-making and accountability to the regions.

“I am pleased to confirm these appointments, which restore local leadership and strengthen connections with communities and industries,” Ms Simmonds says.

The polytechnic council ministerial appointees are:

- **Ara**: Hugh Lindo, Chair; Michael Rondel, Deputy Chair; Rick Hellings, Member; Andrea Leslie, Member.
- **EIT**: David Pearson, Chair; Chris Collins, Deputy Chair; Tam Jex-Blake, Member; Kerry Marshall, Member.
- **MIT and Unitec**: Alastair Bell, Chair; Simon Harding, Deputy Chair; Ward Kamo, Member; Professor Sharon Brownie, Member.
- **NMIT**: Tony Gray, Chair; Sarah-Jane Weir, Deputy Chair; Lynette Rayner, Member; Lester Binns, Member.
- **Open Polytechnic**: Darren Linton, Chair; Dr Neil Barns, Deputy Chair; Maea Puriri-Pivac, Member.
- **Otago Polytechnic**: John Gallaher, Chair; Rowena Davenport, Deputy Chair; Michael Collins, Member; Scott Mason, Member.
- **SIT**: Rex Chapman, Chair; Maree Howden, Deputy Chair; Chris Ramsay, Member.
- **Toi Ohomai**: Deryck Shaw, Chair; Christa George, Deputy Chair; Roana Bennett, Member; Leith Comer, Member.
- **UCOL**: Leanne Southey, Chair; Troy Hobson, Deputy Chair; Dr Pim Borren, Member; Ian McKelvie, Member.
- **Wintec**: Sheree Ryan, Chair; Ken Williamson, Deputy Chair; Sarah Morton-Johnson, Member; Edgar Wilson, Member.

The ministerial appointments begin immediately, with the Orders in Council establishing the polytechnics now in effect. To avoid all appointments expiring at the same time, councils have a combination of two-, three-, and four-year terms, in line with their individual constitutions. Each council includes three or four ministerial appointments.

“This marks a clear shift from centralised decision-making to a system where regional voices lead, creating stronger, more resilient, and community-connected polytechnics,” Ms Simmonds says. 

“With these appointments, our polytechnics now have the ability to respond quickly to local and industry needs, deliver practical skills, and provide meaningful jobs for learners.”

The return to regional governance empowers communities and industries to have a stronger voice in shaping vocational education. These appointments are a key step in rebuilding a vocational education system that is locally led, industry-aligned, and accountable, ensuring polytechnics can deliver real value to learners, employers, and regional New Zealand.

“I thank all appointees for stepping into these vital roles. Their expertise will help ensure our polytechnics remain responsive, future focused, and connected to the needs of their communities,” Ms Simmonds says.
