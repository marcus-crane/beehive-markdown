Kiwi farmers, growers, and primary producers are driving New Zealand’s economy with food and fibre exports set to reach a record $62 billion next year, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay has announced.

The forecast is for the year to 30 June 2026 and is in the latest Situation and Outlook for Primary Industries (SOPI) report, released today.

“The projection builds on this year’s record-setting $60.4 billion - from meat and wool to kiwifruit and cherries, our producers are remarkable. The world wants New Zealand’s high-quality, sustainable, safe food and fibre,” Mr McClay says.

Exports are forecast to rise 3 per cent from the previous year, and an impressive 16 per cent higher than two years before. Exports are expected to climb to more than $63 billion in the year to 30 June 2027.

The sector is well positioned to capitalise on robust demand and strong prices, supported by good growing conditions and higher production in most areas.

"It's an outstanding result, especially considering a tough year with challenging global conditions and extreme weather impacting producers,” Mr McClay says.

“The Government is backing the sector’s success, and the growth reflects a lot of on-the-ground hard work.

“The food and fibre sectors now account for 83 per cent of all New Zealand goods exports.”

**Key forecasts for the year ending 30 June 2026 include:**

- Meat and wool export revenue lifting 7 per cent to $13.2 billion
- Horticulture export revenue lifting 5 per cent to $9.2 billion
- Forestry export revenue lifting 2 per cent to $6.3 billion
- Dairy export revenue lifting 1 per cent to $27.4 billion

“We’re cutting red tape through significant reforms, building trade, driving higher producer returns, delivering tools and technology to tackle agricultural emissions, and investing in the health of rural New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

“Farmer confidence is back up, farm profitability is improving for many producers, and New Zealand is turning the corner out of recession thanks to our export-led economic recovery.

“We’re also taking steps to boost productive and sustainable growth through more flexible land use.

“Farmers and growers should be able to choose what they do behind the farmgate if they can show it will have a lower or no greater environmental impact.

“One in every seven people work in food and fibre – a successful sector means thriving communities, a growing economy and a prosperous New Zealand.”
