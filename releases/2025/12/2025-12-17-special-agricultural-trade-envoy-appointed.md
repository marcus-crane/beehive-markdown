The Minister for Trade and Investment, and Minister of Agriculture Todd McClay has announced the appointment of Nathan Guy as New Zealand’s Special Agricultural Trade Envoy (SATE).

The position supports key Government objectives, including ensuring New Zealand’s trading partners understand our approach to agriculture and primary production.

The role also focuses on raising the performance of New Zealand’s agricultural and primary sector exports in global markets, thereby contributing to the Government’s goal of doubling the value of exports in 10 years.

“Nathan Guy’s immediate priorities will be to advocate for New Zealand’s primary production interests from the perspective of a practising farmer,” Mr McClay says.

“I have asked Mr Guy to show particular focus on India and GCC markets, to leverage the opportunities that trade agreements with these countries would present.”  
Nathan Guy is a dairy farmer, agribusiness leader, and a former Minister for Primary Industries.

He is currently the Chairman of the Meat Industry Association and Independent Chair of Apiculture New Zealand. He has extensive experience advocating for New Zealand’s agricultural exporters, both on the domestic and global stage.

Mr McClay says Nathan Guy’s background promoting New Zealand’s producers both as a Minister and as a farmer means that he is uniquely well placed to tell the story of New Zealand’s primary production sector to the world.

Nathan Guy replaces Hamish Marr, who has held the SATE role since 2023.

“Hamish has made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand’s agricultural trade interests,” Mr McClay says.

“He has been highly effective in conveying the message that New Zealand agriculture is not a threat to others but rather that we can complement our partners to our mutual advantage.”

Nathan Guy will take up the role on 1 January 2026.
