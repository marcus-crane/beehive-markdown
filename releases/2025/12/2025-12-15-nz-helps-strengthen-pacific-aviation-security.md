Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced New Zealand will invest an additional $13.3 million, over five years, to strengthen aviation security in the Pacific region. 

 The investment will go towards new airport x-ray and scanning machines, as well as technical and training support, at 11 Pacific airports. It builds on the existing airport security equipment programme in the region.

“This investment will benefit the Pacific by improving transport security, helping Pacific states comply with international aviation standards, and making air travel safer and more secure for all travellers in the Pacific,” Mr Peters says.

“New Zealand is strongly committed to addressing the risks of trans-national crime and other security threats in the Pacific, as demonstrated through this significant partnership.”

Associate Minister for Transport James Meager, who has responsibility for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says the work will be delivered by New Zealand’s CAA in cooperation with aviation regulators and airport authorities in Niue, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. 

“This initiative reflects New Zealand’s commitment to safe, secure regional aviation, ensuring that Pacific communities remain connected through strengthened aviation security and infrastructure,” Mr Meager says.
