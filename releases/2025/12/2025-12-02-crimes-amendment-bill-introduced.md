Criminals will soon face stronger penalties for attacking first responders, coward punches, human trafficking, and retail crime with the Government’s Crimes Amendment Bill being introduced, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Our government is committed to fixing the basics in law and order, and ensuring victims’ interests are at the centre of the justice system. A vital part of that, is making sure criminals face real consequences for crime.

“Where others may flee, first responders and prison officers run towards danger to help those who need urgent assistance. Assaulting them puts multiple lives at risk, so there must be greater consequences for these heinous acts of violence.

“We also know how dangerous coward punches are. People can be killed or suffer lifelong brain injuries, yet perpetrators often receive lenient and insufficient sentences. That changes with this legislation.

“Retail crime is an ongoing challenge, and police and business owners need additional tools to protect their livelihoods. For too long business owners have been left feeling helpless as thieves walk out with whatever they please. It has to stop.

“We promised to have this introduced before the end of year, and now we’re delivering. We aim to have this passed into law before the next election.”

The Crimes Amendment Bill includes:

- New specific offences for assaulting first responders or prison officers, as committed to in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement.
- Two new specific coward punch offences, as committed to in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement.
- Additional citizen’s arrest powers.
- A new shoplifting infringement regime, as committed to in the National/New Zealand First coalition agreement.
- Strengthening trafficking and people smuggling laws to stop criminals using loopholes to evade real consequences for crime.
