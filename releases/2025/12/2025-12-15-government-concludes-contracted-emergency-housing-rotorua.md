The Government has officially shut down contracted emergency housing in Rotorua, marking the end of a system that failed the city and its community, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

“For years, Rotorua, an incredible centre famous worldwide for its landscapes, culture, history, and attractions, became an ongoing location for a broken emergency housing system,” Mr Potaka says.

“Under the previous Government, families – including those raising children –    became stuck in temporary living arrangements with no end in sight.

“We promised real change for whānau and individuals so they could move into stable homes, and we have delivered.

“Since coming into Government, we have reduced the number of people in emergency housing by 85 percent.

“Referrals into contracted emergency housing motels ceased on 15 June 2025, and we have since worked intensively to secure permanent placements.

“With the final whānau rehoused last month, all contracted motels are already preparing to return to the market,” Mr Potaka says.

“Rotorua is finally back on the front foot. It is safer, stronger, and open for growth. Our Government continues to back Rotorua to reclaim its reputation, grow its tourism economy, strengthen its housing supply, and unlock new opportunities for the city.

“I want to acknowledge business, tribal and civic leadership on this matter over many years.”

Rotorua MP Todd McClay says delivering on this Government’s election promise today is a huge moment for the city, the community and the now former motel residents.

“For too long our local community endured the social, economic and reputational costs of emergency housing. It was an unacceptable situation imposed on us when the last Labour Government used Rotorua as a dumping ground for the country's homelessness problem.

“Families are now in proper homes and Rotorua finally has the fresh start it deserves. This is what so many in the community have been fighting for.

“Rotorua is an incredible place to live, work and play and there is nothing greater than watching it return to its full vibrancy.

“This is the end of homeless motels. We now have our town back.”

**Notes to editor:**

While contracted emergency housing (CEH) has ended in Rotorua, Emergency Housing (non-contracted) remains available in Rotorua, as it does across the country. As at 31 October 2025, there were nine households in Emergency Housing in Rotorua.

Emergency Housing continues to operate as a last-resort option for people in genuine need and is separate from the CEH motels that have now closed.
