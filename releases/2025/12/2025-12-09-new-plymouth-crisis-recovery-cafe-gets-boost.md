Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey today visited Koha Café where he announced New Plymouths local crisis recovery café, will receive a funding boost from the Government.

“Emergency departments are often not the best environment for someone in mental distress. Many people have told me that brightly lit, busy, clinical spaces can feel overwhelming and are not always therapeutic. Crisis cafés offer an alternative. They are a calm, peer-led, non-clinical space where people can get support,” Mr Doocey says.

“I’ve always said the solutions already exist within our community sector, they just need the opportunity to be backed. This café is a great example. It will be run by Taranaki Retreat, which has been providing mental health support to people across Taranaki for the past 11 years.

“They are already making a difference in the community, and this new investment will help them reach even more people.

“Lived experience roles are starting to gain more traction here in New Zealand. We are better utilising peer support workers in a range of settings, including emergency departments, eating disorder services, and crisis alternatives.

Mr Doocey says it’s been heartening to hear that they are already making a real difference.

“One worker told me that, reflecting on her own experience the peer support service is exactly what she wishes she had when she was struggling, someone who can say, I see you, I hear you, I know what you’re going through.

“Today’s announcement forms part of our mental health plan. Last month, I announced a crisis response package that includes more clinical workers in crisis assessment teams, two new 10-bed peer-led acute alternative services, and additional peer support workers in emergency departments and crisis recovery cafés.

“My focus is on delivering faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.”
