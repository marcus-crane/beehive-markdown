Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop says new guidance from the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission will help improve how government agencies maintain and manage the country’s infrastructure.

“Central government owns nearly half of New Zealand’s infrastructure assets, yet for too long we haven’t been as good as we should be at looking after what we already have,” Mr Bishop says.

“Every homeowner knows that if you don’t paint the weatherboards, eventually they rot. The same principle applies to schools, hospitals, roads and public buildings.

“For years we’ve seen the consequences of poor asset management. Leaky hospitals and classrooms, mould in police stations and courthouses, rail service outages, and Defence Force personnel living in sub-standard accommodation. It’s not acceptable and New Zealanders deserve better.

"The new Asset Management and Investment Planning guidance provides clearer expectations for agencies and sets out what good practice looks like.

“For the first time, agencies have one clear, practical source of guidance that explains what they need to do, how to measure their progress, and how to align asset management with investment decisions. It strengthens accountability and helps ensure maintenance and renewal are properly planned and funded.

“Asset management maturity varies widely across the public sector and tends to be lowest in the big social infrastructure sectors like health, education and justice. We need to fix this. Too many agencies report non-compliance with Cabinet expectations, whether that’s depreciation funding, reliable asset registers, or up-to-date asset management plans.

“Common problems include limited understanding of asset management, competing priorities, poor information about asset condition, and a general acceptance of inadequate practice. This guidance makes clear the standard expected and gives agencies the tools to lift their performance.”

Mr Bishop says the new guidance sits within a wider Government work programme to improve the performance and long-term stewardship of New Zealand’s infrastructure.

“We’ve launched this guidance as part of phase one of our broader asset management work programme, which is focused on practical improvements agencies can make now. Phase two will follow with longer-term system changes, informed by the upcoming National Infrastructure Plan.

“The message is simple. Most of the infrastructure we will rely on over the next 30 years already exists. If we don’t look after it properly now, taxpayers will pay far more to replace it later.

“The guidance gives agencies a clear pathway to better care for the assets they are responsible for, make smarter investment decisions, and deliver more reliable services for New Zealanders.”
