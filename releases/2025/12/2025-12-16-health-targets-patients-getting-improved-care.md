Kiwis are receiving faster access to healthcare, with the latest quarterly results showing year-on-year improvements across all health targets despite a busy and challenging winter, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

"Our frontline teams have made steady progress ensuring New Zealanders can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it," Mr Brown says.

"These improvements mean real benefits for patients – faster cancer treatment, more children protected from disease, and shorter waits for surgeries and specialist assessments that improve people’s lives.”

Key improvements for the July to September quarter compared to the same time last year:

- **Faster cancer treatment:** 86.8 per cent of patients started treatment within 31 days, up from 84.6 per cent last year. This is supported by the Government's $604 million Pharmac boost delivering 33 new cancer medicines.
- **Improved childhood immunisations:** 82.6 per cent of children fully immunised by age two, up from 75.7 per cent last year - the largest gain across all targets – protecting thousands more young Kiwis from preventable diseases.
- **Shorter emergency department stays:** 68.9 per cent of patients admitted, treated or discharged within six hours, up from 67.5 per cent last year, despite higher attendances – meaning our doctors and nurses are treating increased volumes of patients and still getting people seen faster.
- **Shorter waits for elective procedures:** 65.9 per cent of patients received treatment within four months, up from 62.2 per cent last year.
- **Shorter waits for specialists:** 62.3 per cent of patients had their first assessment within four months, up from 61.2 per cent last year.

“Strong improvements in immunisation rates mean parents giving more Kiwi kids the best start to life, protecting them and others from preventable diseases.

"Despite union strikes cancelling around 13,500 procedures and appointments between July and September, patients are still spending less time waiting than last year for life-changing elective surgery.

"Our Elective Boost has delivered thousands of additional hip and knee replacements, cataract surgeries, and other procedures since February, helping more Kiwis get ready for an active summer. This is about getting Kiwis back to work and helping them return to the activities they love with their families.

“This progress happened during a busy and challenging winter, when emergency departments were treating more patients with winter illnesses. Despite this, our healthcare workers got patients through emergency departments faster than last year, while also reducing wait times across the healthcare system.

"Making it easier to access care when you need it is a key priority for our Government. While our health targets are driving progress, we know too many Kiwis are still waiting too long to be seen. Our focus remains on ensuring every New Zealander can access timely, quality healthcare.

“I want to thank our healthcare workers for their dedicated work throughout a challenging winter, and for continuing to put patients first. Together, with a record $30 billion annual investment and more doctors and nurses on the frontline, we are rebuilding the system around patients, strengthening accountability, and driving better outcomes.”
