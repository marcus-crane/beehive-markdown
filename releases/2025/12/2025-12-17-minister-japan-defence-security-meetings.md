Defence Minister Judith Collins will travel to Japan tomorrow for defence and security meetings.

“I am looking forward to travelling to Tokyo to discuss regional security issues with Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi,” Ms Collins says.

“Japan is an important partner for New Zealand, with both our countries committed to international order and stability.

“I look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our already close bond.” 

Ms Collins will return to New Zealand on 20 December.
