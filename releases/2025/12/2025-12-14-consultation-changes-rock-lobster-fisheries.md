The Government is seeking feedback on proposed changes for two important rock lobster stocks as part of its twice-yearly fisheries sustainability review, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

The proposed changes affect rock lobster fisheries in the North Island’s Gisborne, East Cape, and Māhia region (CRA 3), and the South Island’s Otago region (CRA 7). 

“Rock lobsters are highly valued by many New Zealanders. They’re a taonga species to tangata whenua, prized catch for recreational fishers and, commercially, they contribute millions of dollars to our economy each year,” Mr Jones says.

“The latest information about CRA 7 suggests it’s doing well and can sustain further commercial harvest, which is reflected in the proposed catch settings for this fishery. 

“When a fishery can sustainably handle more harvest and contribute to our economy and communities, we should allow it. On the other hand, it is in everybody’s best interests to give fisheries a break when they need time to recover. 

“The latest information for the CRA 3 fishery, which extends from East Cape around Māhia Peninsula to Wairoa River, suggests the fishery is likely to be under pressure. 

“In April 2024, I reduced the overall take for this fishery by 19 percent and reduced the recreational daily bag limits. At the time industry also voluntarily agreed not to fish an additional 10 percent of Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) over two years (2024/25 and 2025/26). 

“Despite these efforts, the fishery needs more support to recover and proposals have been developed to help increase rock lobster abundance in this fishery.”

The proposals were developed by Fisheries New Zealand with support from the National Rock Lobster Advisory Group, representing customary, recreational and commercial fishing sectors and environmental interests. 

In addition to proposals for rock lobster, the Southern blue whiting stock (SBW 6B, Bounty Platform) will be reviewed as part of this sustainability round. Proposals for Southern blue whiting are being finalised and consultation for that stock will begin in mid-January.
