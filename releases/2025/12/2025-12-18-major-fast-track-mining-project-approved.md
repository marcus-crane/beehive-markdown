The first major mining project, Waihi North, has gained consent today to expand operations until 2043 through the Fast-track process, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Resources Minister Shane Jones say.

"Oceana Gold’s Waihi North mining project is a nationally significant investment that will deliver substantial economic benefits for the Waikato region and New Zealand,” Mr Bishop says.

“A project of this scale and complexity requires numerous consents, permits and authorisations across a range of decision-makers. The one-stop shop of the Fast-track process brings all these approvals together.”

The project took 112 working days to approve, from the time the panel was convened. Mr Jones estimates that had it gone through the usual process, approval would have taken longer than five years.

Mr Jones says the project is expected to generate $5.2 billion in additional silver and gold exports over its 18-year life - around $286 million per year.

“That annual figure is equivalent to 64 per cent of New Zealand’s wool exports and 14 per cent of wine exports. It is a substantial boost to New Zealand’s exports.

“The [Waihi North Project](https://www.fasttrack.govt.nz/projects/waihi-north) will support around 800 jobs in Hauraki District and beyond over its 18-year life, and these well-paid jobs will inject millions into the regional economy while boosting export earnings for the country.”

Mr Bishops says the expert panel concluded that over the life of the project, Crown revenue including corporate tax, PAYE and royalties, will deliver a net present value of $422 million.

“That revenue will go towards meeting our future healthcare, education and infrastructure needs - investments that will benefit every New Zealander.”

Oceana Gold (New Zealand) Limited lodged the application in April 2025 for staged expansion of its existing gold and silver mining operations at Waihi. The application sought environmental, wildlife, heritage and access permissions to establish new open pit and underground mines, and tailings and rock storage areas across several sites.

The consent extends mining operations beyond the original planned expiry in 2030, to 2043.
