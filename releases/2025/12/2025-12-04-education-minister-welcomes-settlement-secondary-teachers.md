Education Minister Erica Stanford is welcoming the successful conclusion of pay negotiations for secondary teachers following a majority vote from Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) members to accept the most recent offer.

“I’m delighted for secondary teachers across the country who will be receiving pay increases at the start of the next school year. This agreement recognises the effort and hard work of secondary teachers who are committed to raising achievement for students across the country each and every day,” Ms Stanford says.

The conclusion of secondary teachers’ pay negotiations after five months of bargaining came following a majority vote from Post Primary Teachers' Association / Te Wehengarua members to accept settlement of the Secondary Teachers’ Collective Agreement (STCA).

The settlement includes a cumulative pay increase of 4.7 per cent by January 2027 for teachers on the top two steps of the base salary scale. In addition, teachers who are growing in their career and moving up the scale will continue to receive annual step increases along with a 4.6 per cent pay increase by January 2027.

The settlement includes an increase in the value of middle management and senior management allowances from $2,000 to $2,400 while the value of units rise from $5,000 to $5,500, bringing the pay increase to 2.9 per cent in year one. The agreement also introduces a Principal’s Nominee Allowance of $2,500 per annum + 1 hour of release time from Term 2, 2026 for the nominee.

“Investing in our education system is investing in everyone’s future. We are firmly committed to backing teachers to succeed in the classroom and deliver the world-leading education Kiwi kids deserve,” Ms Stanford says.

On 4 December, Post-Primary Teachers Association (PPTA) members voted to accept the offer to settle the Secondary Teachers’ Collective Agreement. Nearly 25,000 secondary teachers will benefit from settling the STCA.
