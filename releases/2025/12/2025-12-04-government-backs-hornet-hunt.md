Intensive efforts are under way to combat yellow-legged hornets from Auckland’s North Shore, says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard.

Mr Hoggard, who visited biosecurity operations in Auckland today, says the response has escalated significantly over recent weeks with more traps, ground searches and efforts to raise public awareness.

“There’s a narrow window to eradicate this hornet and seeing the efforts on the ground today, I know our people are absolutely committed to removing this pest.

The work at the regional control centre in Auckland is an impressive operation with staff working seven days a week,” Mr Hoggard says.

I’m getting daily updates from Biosecurity New Zealand, and I’ve directed them to take appropriate steps to respond to the threat.”

Mr Hoggard says it’s important that Biosecurity New Zealand’s actions be guided by expert advice.

“That’s why I support Biosecurity New Zealand’s move to set up a technical advisory group comprising experts from countries with experience managing hornet incursions.”

Biosecurity New Zealand met with the group again this week to confirm the response is on track and identify any additional actions that could make a difference.

Electronic tracking technology, used successfully overseas, will be used to help locate nests if hornet activity increases over summer.

With ramped up surveillance more hornets are expected to be found in coming months,

"Reporting by the public and beekeepers is still our best shot at detecting these hornets. But I need your help on this one, I'm asking Aucklanders – make checking your property and hornet hunting part of your routine.

"At this stage of the Hornets life cycle check under eaves, decks, soffits, garages, sheds, boats, and trailers – low-to-ground spots near water where it's sunny.

In a months’ time they’ll move to secondary nests – So look high in trees, mid-canopy level, or in hedges and buildings near water.”

“If anyone sees a suspected hornet or nest, report it immediately to Biosecurity New Zealand at [report.mpi.govt.nz](https://report.mpi.govt.nz/pest/)  or by calling the exotic pest and disease hotline on 0800 809 966.”
