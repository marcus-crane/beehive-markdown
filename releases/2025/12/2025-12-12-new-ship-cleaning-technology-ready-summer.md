New in-water cleaning technology to help commercial vessels meet New Zealand’s biofouling requirements and protect our marine environment will be in use in Auckland this summer, says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard.

The system, co-developed by Port of Auckland and New Zealand Diving and Salvage Limited (NZDS) with support from Biosecurity New Zealand.

The technology targets hard-to-clean areas of vessel hulls, such as sea chests and propeller shafts, providing a safe and practical solution for spot cleaning in port. This reduces the need for offshore cleaning and minimises disruption to passenger and cargo operations.

“It will help vessel operators meet their biosecurity responsibilities without disrupting passenger or cargo operations.”

Biosecurity New Zealand received the application in October and completed its evaluation in December following successful trials on domestic vessels. Provisional approval means the system can now be used this summer for arriving vessels, including cruise ships.

“The work reflects Biosecurity New Zealand’s commitment to helping vessel operators comply with biofouling and other biosecurity requirements. Marine growth on vessel hulls – poses a biosecurity risk to New Zealand's marine environment.”

“This government is committed to ensuring New Zealand’s environment, unique marine ecosystems, aquaculture industry, and economy are protected from biofouling.

“At the same time, we are very aware of the commercial pressures faced by the shipping and cruise industries, and the need to make compliance with New Zealand’s biosecurity requirements as straightforward as possible.”

Biosecurity New Zealand will continue working with NZDS to refine and optimise the technology.
