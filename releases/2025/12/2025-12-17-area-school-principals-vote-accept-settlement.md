Education Minister Erica Stanford welcomes the successful conclusion of pay negotiations to renew the Area School Principals’ Collective Agreement.

“Area schools principals play an integral role in our rural communities. This settlement delivers meaningful improvements to pay and conditions and reflects a firm commitment to strengthening professional learning and development and raising student achievement,” Ms Stanford says.

The new collective agreement which benefits over 140 principals includes:

- A cumulative increase to u-grade remuneration component of 4.7% within 12 months
- Introduction of an NCEA Change Implementation Allowance of $6,000 per annum, to recognise the significant work principals do to lead changes in our national secondary school qualification
- Increase in the Area School Principal Payment by $1,500, phased over two years
- Increase to Career Structure payments by $1,500
- An allowance for principals who are appointed as mentors of $5,000 per annum.

“This settlement is a result of productive negotiations and good faith bargaining. We back our teachers to succeed in the classroom and help build our country’s future,” Ms Stanford says.
