As proud stewards of the land, New Zealand’s farmers and growers work hard to care for the environment. The Government is making this easier by approving regulations for a nationwide rural recycling scheme covering agrichemicals and farm plastics, Environment Minister Penny Simmonds says.

“This initiative is about fixing the basics while building the future with practical solutions that protect the environment, support our farmers, and ensure a productive, sustainable primary sector,” Ms Simmonds says.

The industry-led scheme will bring the existing Agrecovery and Plasback programmes into a single national system, offering free-to-use, simple, and accessible services for all users of in-scope agrichemicals and farm plastics.

“We consulted on these regulations earlier this year and received strong support from the rural sector. Farmers and growers have been working towards this for a long time. Today, we’ve made it happen,” Ms Simmonds says.

Building on voluntary schemes operating for nearly 20 years, the regulations establish a nationally consistent product stewardship framework for agrichemicals, their containers, and farm plastics – helping farmers cut waste, reduce environmental impact, and improve long-term productivity.

“Plastic products are essential to New Zealand’s world-leading agri-economy, but rural communities know that waste like containers, plastic bags, and bale wrap can pile up,” Ms Simmonds says.

The scheme creates a unified system where producers, sellers, and users share responsibility for the full product lifecycle, ensuring practical solutions for rural communities and the environment.

It won’t just benefit farmers. Forestry, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism and local authorities will also have access to national take-back services, making safe disposal easier for all New Zealanders.

“Key industry stakeholders support the scheme because it offers a better alternative to burning or burying plastics, reducing environmental risk and supporting cleaner, safer rural communities,” Ms Simmonds says.
