International visitors are spending more and arriving in greater numbers, driving growth in New Zealand’s tourism sector and economy, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“Tourism is New Zealand’s second-highest export earner, and the latest data shows the sector is delivering real benefits for New Zealand,” Louise Upston says.

International Visitor Survey results released this week show that:

- Between July and September, international visitors spent $2.1 billion, up 9.3 per cent on the same period in 2024.
- For the year ending September 2025, total spend reached $12.3 billion, a 5.3 per cent increase.

Visitor numbers also rose to 3.43 million in the year ending September 2025, up 6.1 per cent on the previous year. Growth in spending reflects not only more visitors but also a shift toward higher-spending travellers, particularly those from the USA. 

“These figures are a clear signal that tourism is powering ahead, playing a critical role in strengthening our economy and creating opportunities for communities across the country.”

International visitor numbers for the year ending September 2025 are now back to 88 per cent of 2019 pre-pandemic levels, showing strong progress in the sector. 

This means more accommodation bookings, more people exploring our regions, and more jobs.

“The Government is committed to supporting the sector through the Tourism Growth Roadmap, which sets out our plan to double tourism export value by 2034.

“We want to ensure tourism continues to deliver value for New Zealand and unforgettable experiences for visitors, and these results show we’re on the right track,” Louise Upston says.
