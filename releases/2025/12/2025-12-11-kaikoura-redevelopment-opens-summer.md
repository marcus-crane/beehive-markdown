The completion of Kaikōura’s waterfront redevelopment marks a major milestone for the revitalisation of the region, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones says.

“Wakatu Quay redevelopment is a critical infrastructure asset, it supports Kaikoura economic development following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake which saw the region’s culture, social, natural and economic life significantly impacted,” Mr Jones says.

The Wakatu Quay redevelopment in the town on the South Island’s east coast, was officially opened today,

“This redevelopment strengthens Kaikōura’s appeal as a destination and helps support the local economy, following the damage and disruption caused by the earthquake.”

Tourism is central to Kaikōura’s economy, with around half of the district’s workforce depending directly on tourism, while another third supports the visitor industry.

The development features a new building that can host tourism, hospitality and cultural events. Its modern, marine-inspired design incorporates cultural and environmental elements.

The building is expected to be a catalyst for private sector development in the Wakatu Quay precinct, which has also been upgraded and landscaped as part of the project.

The project received more than $10 million in funding from the former Provincial Growth Fund, with $1.07m of co-funding from Kaikoura District Council. 

The redevelopment was opened with a dawn blessing and ribbon-cutting ceremony this morning.

“The partnership between central government, Kaikōura District Council, iwi and other local stakeholders have been critical to this project’s success,” Mr Jones says.

The council engaged a local construction company for the project. More than 40 people were involved in the redevelopment, with more than half being local workers. The construction was completed within a year.

“It’s fantastic that the precinct is open for summer with its stunning views of the sea and mountains. This redevelopment is uplifting the district and is an important milestone for future development.”
