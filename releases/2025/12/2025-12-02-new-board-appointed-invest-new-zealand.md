Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay today announced inaugural board appointments for Invest New Zealand, the country’s newly established investment promotion agency.

“Invest New Zealand will be key to attracting high-quality foreign investment that drives innovation, economic growth, and creates jobs. This board brings deep domestic and international sector knowledge, governance experience, and a commitment to New Zealand’s future,” Mr McClay says.

Established in July 2025, Invest New Zealand works with multinational corporations and foreign investors to bring people, businesses, skills, and capital to New Zealand. It also engages with investors applying for an Active Investor Plus Visa.

The board will be chaired by Rob Morrison, with Carmel Fisher as deputy chair and David Tapsell, Richard Hedley, Mary MacLeod and Ross George as its members.

“I thank the establishment board members, Charles Finny and Catherine Savage, for their service during this important establishment phase and wish them well in their future endeavours,” Mr McClay says.

“I am confident the new board will deliver strong leadership and attract the investment New Zealand needs.

“Growing capital means growing production, jobs and the economy.”
