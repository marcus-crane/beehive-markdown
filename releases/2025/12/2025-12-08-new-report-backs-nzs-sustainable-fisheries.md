A new scientific report shows New Zealand’s fish stocks are in good shape overall, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“Fisheries New Zealand’s Status of the Stocks report shows 87.2 percent of the country’s 149 scientifically evaluated stocks are sustainable. There are plans in place to get the 19 fish stocks identified as needing support back to where they should be,”Mr Jones says.

“I know fishers are committed to sustainability and I’m working with them to ensure we have reasonable measures in place.”

The latest report backs [United Nations’ findings](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/global-report-praises-nz%E2%80%99s-sustainable-fisheries) earlier this year that New Zealand’s fisheries are among the world’s most sustainable.

“Our fish stocks can fluctuate from year to year but there’s been a steady increase in the percentage of scientifically evaluated stocks that are sustainable since reporting began in 2009.

“Over the past three years, this level has remained above 87 percent.”

The seafood sector employs around 9000 people, provides food for Kiwis, and wild-capture fisheries generate around $1.5 billion in exports annually.

"Our quota management system remains at the heart of New Zealand’s fisheries’ success story, but I’m always open to new ideas to ensure a sustainable industry and fishery.

“In August, I announced the Government is progressing a package of [major fisheries reforms](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/fisheries-reforms-support-economic-growth) are built on science and will ensure more responsive fisheries management so our fishing industry can continue to get value from New Zealand’s sustainable fisheries resources.

“These changes will build on the generations of hard work that have gone into making New Zealand recognised for its good management of fisheries resources.

“Knowing our seafood comes from sustainable fisheries is good news for fishers, consumers, and for the sector’s ongoing health,” Mr Jones says.
