The Government has introduced the Arms Bill to Parliament, bringing New Zealand one step closer to fairer, fit for purpose firearms laws, says Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee.

“This marks the final phase of reform of New Zealand’s firearms laws, building on earlier work to strengthen Firearms Prohibition Orders and improve the regulation of clubs and ranges,” says Mrs McKee. 

“There are over 50 policy changes included in the Bill. These are intended to strengthen public safety while also reducing regulatory burdens on licenced firearm owners.”

Key changes include:

- Updates to over 60 existing offences and the creation of eight new ones.
- Ensuring gang membership automatically disqualifies an individual from holding a firearms licence.
- Enabling more flexible rules relating to storage so firearms can be securely stored at any location approved by the regulator.
- Establishing an independent Firearms Regulatory Agency with a chief executive reporting directly to the responsible Minister, not the Police Commissioner, and the removal of sworn Police Officers from the regulator.
- Improvements for specialist users including dealers, pest controllers, gunsmiths, collectors, museums, and other businesses.
- Closing loopholes and clarifying the law.
- Creating a new independent Firearms Licensing Review Committee responsible for reviewing licensing decisions.
- Removing the regulator’s ability to require additional information in the Registry outside of what has been prescribed in regulation.
- Updating the law to respond to emerging technology, including 3D printing.

The Bill will deliver on the ACT-National coalition commitment to ‘rewrite the Arms Act 1983 to provide for greater protection of public safety and simplify regulatory requirements to improve compliance and pass it through all stages during this term of Parliament.’

“I look forward to seeing the Bill progress to a full six-month select committee process where all New Zealanders can have their say,” says Mrs McKee.
