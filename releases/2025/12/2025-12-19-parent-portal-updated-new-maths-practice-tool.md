Parents will know more about what their children are learning at school and will have the tools to help them learn at home through new updates to the Parent Portal, Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

The Ministry of Education’s Parent Portal digital resource is now live with every learning area of the refreshed knowledge-rich curriculum from Year 0 to Year 10, including draft areas. The interactive resource allows parents to see what their child will learn under the proposed new curriculum, across every year level, in a clear and understandable way.

“The refreshed curriculum is designed to ensure children are learning the fundamentals they need, and it gives clarity to teachers on what to focus on in the classroom. We’re making sure there’s clarity at home, too,” Ms Stanford says.

"The Parent Portal will also be getting updated with activities and resources to support reinforcing key learning from the last year at home over summer.

“The first resource will be a curriculum-aligned, freely available online maths practice tool for children in Years 3 to 8, and will be available from next Tuesday. This will cover basic facts, fractions, rounding, working with money, place value, counting patterns, square numbers, and word problems. There will be further content uploaded in January for children ready for more topics.

“Parents want their children to achieve to the best of their abilities at school, and we’re providing the information and resources they need to be involved in their child’s learning. Our education reforms are putting educational achievement at the heart of learning, making sure all Kiwi kids get the chance to unlock their potential and thrive,” Ms Stanford says.
