State Owned Enterprises Minister Simeon Brown has announced the appointment of two new Crown directors, one to the Airways Board and another to the Kiwi Group Capital Board (KGC).

“Strong governance is essential to the success of Crown companies, and these appointments will help ensure effective leadership in two critical sectors,” Mr Brown says.

Mayurie Gunatilaka joins the Airways Board as a director for a three-year term. She brings extensive governance experience in complex infrastructure projects in New Zealand and overseas, along with strong strategic expertise. Her leadership in infrastructure planning and delivery will help Airways maintain its focus on providing safe, innovative, and efficient air navigation services.

Susan Petersen joins the Kiwi Group Capital Board as a director for a three-year term. She is also serving as Chair of the Kiwibank Board, making her the first KGC director to hold a position on Kiwibank’s Board.

KGC is adopting a conventional commercial approach of overlapping board memberships between the Bank and the Holding Company, designed to strengthen the Board’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives and enhance its future resilience. To maintain independent oversight, KGC will limit the number of KGC directors appointed to the Kiwibank Board to the lower of three or one half of KGC’s total directors.

“These appointments bring proven expertise and strategic insight to the Boards, ensuring they are well placed to deliver for New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.
