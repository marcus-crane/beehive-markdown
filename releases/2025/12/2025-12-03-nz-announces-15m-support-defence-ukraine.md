Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Defence Minister Judith Collins have announced a $15 million contribution to a NATO and United States initiative to supply Ukraine with weapons and equipment.

“The defence of Ukraine has significant implications not only for the security of Europe, but also for the Indo-Pacific,” Mr Peters says.

“This is why New Zealand and Australia have today announced significant contributions to the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL). We are working together to support Ukraine as we navigate an increasingly challenging strategic environment.”

The PURL aims to speed up the delivery of critical weapons and equipment to Ukraine, so it can defend itself – its number one priority while peace efforts continue. 

“New Zealand stands in solidarity with Ukraine as it enters a fourth winter defending itself from Russian aggression,” Ms Collins says.

“The challenge for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to defend its cities and its people remains immense in the face of the ongoing and relentless bombardment of Ukraine by Russian drones.”

New Zealand’s contribution to the PURL will only be used for the procurement of weapons or equipment that align with New Zealand’s international obligations and domestic policies.
