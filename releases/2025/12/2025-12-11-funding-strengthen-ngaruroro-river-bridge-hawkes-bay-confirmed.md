Transport Minister Chris Bishop has welcomed news from the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) that funding has been approved for strengthening work on the State Highway 50 (SH50) Ngaruroro River Bridge, south of Fernhill, Hawke’s Bay.

“The SH50 Ngaruroro River bridge is an important part of the transport network in Hawke’s Bay and the current speed and weight restrictions have been hugely frustrating. I know freight operators will be relieved that with funding now approved, strengthening work can finally get underway,” Mr Bishop says.

“Temporary restrictions on the Ngaruroro River bridge have been in place since October 2022 after an assessment identified that, while the bridge was structurally safe to use, it did not have the capacity to sustain heavy traffic demands.

“Total project costs are expected to be around $10–$20 million. Design and consenting is now complete and NZTA will be engaging with stakeholders in the coming months. The contractor will be confirmed shortly and construction is expected to start in 2026 and take approximately 11 months to complete. Temporary traffic management will continue to be in place throughout construction.

“Once the strengthening work is completed, current restrictions on the bridge will be removed, and the bridge will become suitable for High Productivity Motor Vehicles (HPMVs) and 50MAX configurations. This is a considerable upgrade, as the bridge has never been suitable for these types of vehicles, even before the 2022 restrictions were put in place.

“This is another example of the Government listening to what our regions need to support economic growth, jobs, and improve the reliability of transport networks across our local communities.”

“I’ve heard from the freight sector just how important this corridor is, and what a difference the strengthening work will make to productivity and resilience. I’ve been a strong advocate for this vital work and look forward to our network operating at full capacity again”, Napier MP Katie Nimon says.

“I want to thank local communities across Hawkes Bay, alongside MPs Katie Nimon and Catherine Wedd, for their patience and advocacy for this important project. I know we are all looking forward to this strengthening work getting underway as soon as possible”, Mr Bishop says.

“NZTA will confirm more details over the coming months. In the meantime, the current 30km/h speed limit and weight restrictions will remain in place, to protect the bridge and ensure it can continue to be used safely. I look forward to this strengthening work getting underway as soon as possible.”
