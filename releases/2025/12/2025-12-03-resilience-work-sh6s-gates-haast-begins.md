The Government continues to invest in the resilience of the South Island’s state highways, with $5 million of work underway on critical improvements to State Highway 6 (SH6) around the Gates of Haast, South Island and Associate Transport Minister James Meager has confirmed.

“The Gates of Haast gorge’s bridge on the Haast River connects a 140-kilometre journey between Haast and Wanaka and is a vital tourism link to glaciers on the West Coast. As an important lifeline, it’s essential we make the bridge and surrounding area as resilient as possible,” Mr Meager says.

“Landslides, slips and washouts are a reality along this corridor. The Gates of Haast project will improve the resilience of SH6 and the Haast River bridge by better protecting it from river erosion.

“The project includes a micro pile wall being installed along the banks of the Haast River to form a new protection system. Existing protection around the base of the bridge, and its supports, will also be upgraded, and a rock barrier built to protect the riverbank.

“South Island-based Moore Construction has been chosen as the contractor to deliver the work, with the team already set up on site. At an overall project cost of around $5 million, including contingency, the project is expected to be completed in around five months.

“Projects like this are critical to improving the reliability and resilience of our state highways, helping to ensure our local communities stay connected, and tourism and freight operators can continue to get where they need to go.”

“This investment follows recent confirmation of next steps for the SH6 Epitaph Slip site and is yet another example of our Government listening to the needs of our West Coast community and delivering.”
