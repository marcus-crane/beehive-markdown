Transport Minister Chris Bishop has welcomed news that a contract has been confirmed for design, consenting, and construction of the new two-lane bridge to replace the Pepe Stream Bridge on State Highway 25 (SH25).

“At more than 80 years old, the current single-lane bridge is a bottleneck, with severe congestion experienced during holiday periods. Funding has already been confirmed by New Zealand Transport Agency NZTA, and I’m pleased progress has been made to get a delivery contractor on board,” Mr Bishop says.

“We know going into summer that the Coromandel is a great holiday spot for many Kiwis. We also know the traffic heading into the eastern side of the Coromandel, can get very congested. Once this bridge is complete, it will help ease some of this traffic so Kiwis can get on with their holidays at the beach quicker.

“Fulton Hogan will build the new two-lane SH25 Pepe Stream bridge, working with engineering consultants WSP to support the design and preparation of resource consent applications.

“The new bridge includes a 3-metre-wide shared path on the eastern side, a 1.5-metre-wide footpath on the western side, with a pedestrian crossing and safety refuge planned near the Pepe Road intersection.

“At a cost of $22 million, construction of the new two-lane bridge is expected to start in late 2026 and be open to traffic by December 2027. In the meantime, traffic management staff will again be in place over the summer holidays to assist traffic over the old bridge.

“SH25 through Tairua will remain open while the new bridge is being built and the old one demolished, with brief closures expected occasionally at night. One of the first tasks for the team will be to remove the current shared footbridge and install a temporary shared path on the western side of the existing bridge.

“I want to thank the local community and Coromandel MP Scott Simpson for their advocacy and patience, I know we are all looking forward to construction getting underway on this project as soon as possible. A public information day is planned by NZTA in February 2026 to provide more details on the new bridge design, traffic management, and other construction details.”

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson welcomed the news, saying the new bridge will be an economic boost for Tairua and the wider Coromandel.

“Today’s announcement marks real progress for Tairua. The community has been calling for a safer, more reliable bridge for many years, and today’s development is a real step forward,” Mr Simpson says.

“The new two-lane bridge is a long-overdue investment in the safety, resilience, and vitality of our community. It will significantly improve the journey for locals, make holiday travel smoother for visitors, and strengthen the Coromandel’s economic future.”
