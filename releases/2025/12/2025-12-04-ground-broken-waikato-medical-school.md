Construction is now underway on the Waikato’s new medical school – a major milestone in the Government’s plan to train more GPs and strengthen access to primary care in regional New Zealand, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti say.

“Today’s sod-turning on the New Zealand Graduate School of Medicine is a significant step forward for the University of Waikato, for regional development, and – most importantly – for the future of primary care in regional New Zealand,” Mr Brown says.

With $82.85 million in Government funding and more than $150 million from the University and philanthropic partners, the project represents a major long-term investment in medical education and in the health of communities across the Waikato and New Zealand.

Cabinet approved the business case in July, allowing the University to progress new teaching facilities and begin planning clinical placements. The graduate-entry programme will create a more flexible pathway into medicine, attracting a broader range of students and supporting a stronger, more diverse workforce.

Mr Brown says the medical school builds on the Government’s wider investment in the primary care workforce pipeline.

“Breaking ground today delivers one of the most significant workforce investments in a generation. From 2028, the Waikato medical school will train an additional 120 doctors each year, on top of the 100 extra places being added at Otago and Auckland between 2024 and 2026.

“Together, these initiatives will increase the number of New Zealand-trained doctors, improving access to timely care and strengthening primary care.”

With a strong focus on primary care and rural health, the school will offer clinical placements in rural and regional settings.

“This is about making it easier for people to see a doctor when they need one,” Mr Brown says.

“A workforce trained in and connected to rural communities is essential to keeping people well, treating disease early, and reducing long-term health impacts. At the same time, the Government is investing in the immediate needs of our primary care workforce with our Primary Care Tactical Action Plan.”

Dr Reti says this milestone is an exciting development for the University of Waikato and the wider region.

“By expanding its education and training programmes, the University is creating new pathways for students and driving academic and economic growth across Hamilton, the Waikato, and rural communities.

“This is about more than a new building – it’s an investment in people. Providing access to medical education locally means students can train closer to home while helping build a resilient, regionally connected workforce.

“This approach supports regional development, builds local expertise, and strengthens healthcare across rural New Zealand.”

The first intake of students is expected in 2028.
