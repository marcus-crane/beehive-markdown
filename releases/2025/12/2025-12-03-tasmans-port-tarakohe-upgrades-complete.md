The completion of a multimillion-dollar upgrade of a key port in Tasman District is a major step forward for economic development and resilience, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Fisheries Under-Secretary Jenny Marcroft say.

Port Tarakohe in Golden Bay underwent a $12.7 million upgrade and is now the only all-tide, all-weather, deep-water port in Tasman District.

“This is a key infrastructure upgrade that enhances the port’s capacity, supports commercial use, and provides a vital back-up route during State Highway 60 closures on Tākaka Hill Road,” Mr Jones says.

“The port is an important asset for regional resilience and connectivity ensuring continuity of freight, fuel, medical supplies, and emergency response capabilities. The wharves support the area’s growing aquaculture industry as well as marine tourism and transport operations.”

“This new facility is vital for the aquaculture sector,” Ms Marcroft says.

“The previous single-wharf facility was at capacity, creating congestion for mussel farmers and other users. The upgraded infrastructure creates more space and will allow for the development of more mussel farming, which is expected to unlock close to a billion dollars of value over 25 years.”

The upgrades include a new wharf to replace the old timber wharf, repairs and improvements to an existing concrete wharf, new commercial berths, breakwater extension and new service facilities.

The project received $6m in government funding, including $600,000 from the former Provincial Growth Fund. Tasman District Council co-funded $6.7m. 

“With the challenges this region has faced recently, it’s great to see infrastructure like this ensuring vital access to Golden Bay in times of need,” Mr Jones says.
