Small-scale meat processors will save money and deliver safe food to their customers more easily thanks to new rule changes confirmed today, says Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard. 

Under the new rules, processors with a very low throughput will be subject to reduced sampling and testing requirements while maintaining current high food safety standards. In practice this means a minimum of 30 carcasses sampled in the first season, reducing to 12 in subsequent seasons, compared to the current requirement of 60 samples for most animals.

“For small businesses, these changes are a big deal—they’ll make it easier to try new things and help keep local food supplies strong. 

These small-scale micro abattoirs are an important part of the sector. They bring farmers and consumers together, build local connections and foster small business innovation.” 

The new rules are proportionate to the food safety risk so processors can more easily do what they do best. They strike the right balance of food safety oversight while recognising the reality of small-scale operators.” 

The changes come after careful engagement with micro operators who told officials the rules were unnecessarily restrictive and costly with no additional benefit to food safety. 

“Our review found that we could fix what matters by making adjustments that move barriers for the processors while maintaining our risk and science-based approach. 

“It will allow smaller operators to enter the sector without facing onerous and overly expensive compliance.  

“The government is dedicated to helping primary industries succeed and will keep looking for ways to cut unnecessary rules,” says Mr Hoggard.
