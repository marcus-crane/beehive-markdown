Transport Minister Chris Bishop announced today that a new two-lane bridge will be built on State Highway 2 (SH2) near Tāneatua in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, replacing the existing one-lane Pekatahi Bridge.

“SH2 is a vital link connecting Gisborne and the Tairāwhiti region with the Bay of Plenty, Hamilton, and Auckland. The highway supports tourism, essential fuel and food supplies, and the export of local products. The current one-lane Pekatahi Bridge is frankly not fit for purpose and needs to be replaced,” Mr Bishop says.

“We’ve listened to the local community and freight industry concerns about the current one-lane bridge. It’s rough, uneven, and requires frequent, disruptive maintenance. Originally, a deck replacement was planned to begin in early 2026, however, detailed inspections have revealed a full replacement is needed.

“Replacing the existing one-lane bridge is in the best interests of the region to support economic growth, strengthen the state highway network, and ensure more reliable journey times for locals and freight moving between Tairāwhiti, the Bay of Plenty, and the Port of Tauranga.

“Funding of around $5 million has been approved by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) for detailed design and consenting of a new two-lane bridge. This work will begin as soon as possible, with NZTA expecting to complete this work by the end of 2026. NZTA also already owns the necessary land to deliver the project.

“Construction of the new two-lane bridge is likely to begin in mid-2027, taking around 18 months to complete. The total estimated cost to deliver the new bridge is expected to be between $64 and $69 million. This figure includes final demolition of the existing bridge. Final costs will be confirmed once construction funding is approved and a contractor is appointed.

“The new two-lane bridge will be constructed next to the current bridge, meaning no long-term closure of the current bridge during construction. This will minimise disruption and ensure continued access for the local community and road users.

“The bridge will be delivered using a modern standard design, making it efficient and cost-effective to build. The design will include earthquake-resilient foundations for improved seismic safety, and an elevated deck to protect against flooding and extreme weather. It will also be built to a standard that accommodates High Productivity Motor Vehicles (HPMVs), meaning better outcomes for freight.

“In the meantime, NZTA will ensure the existing bridge continues to service the community by installing steel plates on the deck and actively monitoring and maintaining the structure. This work is expected to start early 2026.”

“I am delighted this bridge will be replaced with a two laned sensible option. As the only remaining one lane structure on SH2, and not being in great shape, it has been the topic of many a conversation in the Eastern BOP over the past two years and beyond,” says East Coast MP Dana Kirkpatrick.

“It is a critical route for inter-regional traffic, exports to the Ports and our local communities and this commitment by the Government and NZTA is welcome news.”

“I look forward to work getting underway on the new two-lane bridge and NZTA taking advantage of any opportunity they can to bring this important work forward”, says Mr Bishop.

**Note to editors:**

- The Pekatahi Bridge is part of the End-of-Life Bridge Programme. While there is no immediate risk to the bridge structure, resilience investigations have resulted in a greater priority for replacement being assigned to the bridge.
- NZTA’s maintenance team will continue to monitor the current bridge closely and maintenance will still be required until the new bridge is open. The next planned deck maintenance and closure is scheduled for 15-18 December 2025. The team will be replacing planks, tightening bolts, and repairing the surface.
- Steel plates are currently being procured for the bridge deck and are expected to be installed in early 2026. NZTA continue to engage with local stakeholders around the bridge deck replacement and will now do so on the bridge replacement.
