New Zealand’s new Tertiary Education Strategy will ensure providers deliver the skills, knowledge, and opportunities students need to build strong careers and contribute to a more productive, competitive economy, say Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti and Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds.

The new Strategy provides clearer and more deliberate direction for the tertiary system, deepening its focus on employment outcomes, innovation, and supporting learners to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

Dr Reti says the Strategy represents a refocus on what matters most for learners and the country.

“The previous Government’s strategy lacked sufficient emphasis on employment outcomes, career development, and the skills and research capabilities needed for a productive, future-focused economy.

“This Government is putting results at the centre. This new Tertiary Education Strategy is about developing the workforce New Zealand needs to grow and delivering research and innovation that create real value for our communities and our economy.”

The Strategy sets five priorities:

- **Achievement** – Ensuring learners gain skills that lead to strong careers and economic security.
- **Economic Impact and Innovation** – Delivering adaptable skills and research that drive productivity and commercialisation.
- **Access and Participation** – Supporting people from all backgrounds to gain relevant skills throughout their lives.
- **Integration and Collaboration** – Strengthening partnerships between providers, employers, iwi, and communities.
- **International Education** – Growing international student numbers and global engagement.

Dr Reti noted that the Strategy is aligned with wider reforms to strengthen universities and the Science, Innovation and Technology system, ensuring the sector is better connected to national priorities and economic needs.

Ms Simmonds says the redesign of vocational education will further support students to access high-quality, relevant training.

“The redesign ensures vocational education is more responsive to regional and industry needs – a key focus of the Strategy,” Ms Simmonds says.

Te Pūkenga is being replaced by regional polytechnics, and Workforce Development Councils by Industry Skills Boards.

“The Strategy also reinforces the importance of foundation education and work experience for young people at risk of long-term poor employment outcomes. We cannot afford to leave them behind,” Ms Simmonds says.

“A good education is essential to prosperity and quality of life. This Government wants all New Zealanders to realise their potential and contribute to our country’s success.”
