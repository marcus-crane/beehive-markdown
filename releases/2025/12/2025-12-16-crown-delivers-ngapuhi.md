The Crown’s relationship with Ngāpuhi has taken a significant step forward with legislation which returns the historic Kororipo Pā passing in Parliament today, Treaty Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith and Conservation Minister Tama Potaka say.

“The return of the pā reflects the Crown’s commitment to right the wrongs experienced by Ngāpuhi. Advancing Treaty settlement negotiations with Ngāpuhi groups remains a priority, and we are eager for these conversations to begin,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“This moment is the result of three years of dedicated negotiations between the Crown and Ngāti Rēhia, supported by hapū with deep connections to Kororipo Pā.

“Ngāpuhi have stood alongside Ngāti Rēhia in this journey, and it was a privilege to welcome both Ngāti Rēhia and their Ngāpuhi whanaunga to the House today to witness this important occasion.”

“Kororipo Pā is significant to New Zealand as a place of learning, diplomacy and trade.  It was a hub of interaction between Ngāpuhi, missionaries and settlers – a place where rangatira gathered to deliberate matters of war and peace, politics and progress,” Mr Potaka says.

“Ngāpuhi have long called for the return of Kororipo Pā, and today we honour their perseverance and leadership across generations. This is not just a legislative milestone – it is a celebration of enduring relationships and shared history.”

Kororipo Pā will transfer to Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Rēhia Trust on 23 January 2026. They will hold it as kaitiaki on behalf of Ngāpuhi.

The site will retain its historic reserve status and public access to the reserve will not be affected.
