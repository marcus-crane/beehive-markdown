Thirty-two graduate veterinarians will begin their careers in rural New Zealand through the Government’s Voluntary Bonding Scheme for Veterinarians (VBS), Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard announced today.

“Veterinarians are essential to animal health and the productivity of our primary sector – it’s vital we support these regional roles. From Reporoa to Gore, and Whangārei to Dannevirke, graduates will be placed in 26 communities across the country,” Mr McClay says.

“This scheme not only helps ease the rural vet shortage but also gives young professionals a strong financial start to their careers.

“The scheme remains a key part of the Government’s commitment to supporting rural resilience and primary sector growth.”

Each VBS recipient will receive $55,000 over five years, in return for working in rural areas with a focus on production animals and working dogs.

“It ensures farmers have access to high-quality animal care, which is essential for maintaining productivity and animal welfare standards,” Mr Hoggard says.

“It also gives new vets the chance to gain diverse experience in supportive, close-knit communities.”

The VBS was launched in 2009 and is administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries. There have been 516 recipients since inception, including the latest group.
