Recognising International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Minister Louise Upston has reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to breaking down barriers and improving the lives of disabled people.

The worldwide theme for 2025 is *Fostering disability inclusive societies for advancing social progress,* which Louise Upston says the New Zealand Government endorses. 

“We know disabled people want to participate in their communities, to make decisions themselves and to thrive,” Louise Upston says.

“While there is still plenty of work to do, progress has been made this year. Today, it’s particularly important to recognise the commitment of the disability community in achieving these goals.  

“Strongly framed on consultation with the community, just yesterday we launched the refreshed New Zealand Disability Strategy 2026–2030, an action-focused plan designed to deliver real results for disabled New Zealanders and their families.

“This strategy sets out actions across five priority areas – education, employment, health, housing, and justice – to tackle the factors contributing to disadvantages many disabled people and their households continue to face.

“There are other important Government steps taken this year as well, including:

- In Education, delivery of the most significant investment in learning support in a generation, including an extension of the Early Intervention Service
- Consultation getting underway on a new Carers’ Strategy Action Plan, focusing on recognition, health and wellbeing, and financial security for carers
- Changes to Disability Support Services taking effect from February 2026, giving people more choice and control over their flexible funding and ensuring fair, consistent assessments nationwide, with carers’ needs also being considered
- Boosted funding for improved residential care facilities of $240 million to ensure 89 residential care providers are better supported
- Increased Disability Support Services funding for residential care of $60 million each year over the next four years – bringing the total new investment to over $ 1 billion annually

“Our Government is committed to building a disability system that is fair, consistent, transparent and sustainable,” Louise Upston says.

“Today I also want to recognise and say thank you to families, whānau, and everyone in the sector for the vital roles they play in supporting disabled New Zealanders.”
