The first tranche of the Government’s major events funding announced today showcases many exciting international and homegrown music acts, sports matches, arts and cultural events kicking off in 2026.

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston announced the successful bids in Christchurch against a backdrop of Kiwi legends Six60 and Synthony teasing a brand-new show for the Garden City.

“Today’s acts and events are just the start, offering something for hundreds of thousands of fans and visitors, along with a big boost to New Zealand’s economy,” Louise Upston says.

“Among the highlights, American rockers Linkin Park will play in Auckland, Ultra Music Festival brings its Miami-famous electronic dance music to Wellington and I’m personally excited for the collab of local legends Six60 with Synthony in Christchurch.

“Today’s lineup brings some very exciting acts and invests more than $5 million. There’ll be many more names – including star international acts – announced early in 2026, along with support in our regions.

“This first round is an integral part of our $70 million Major Events and Tourism package, designed to drive economic activity and confidence. In total, we’ll be supporting over 70 events, either directly or indirectly, through the Events Attraction Package and Events Boost Fund.

“From music to sports fans to art enthusiasts, we’re investing in an exciting and diverse line-up because major events don’t just attract visitors – they inject life and energy to cities and town, creating vibrant communities and unforgettable experiences.

“The economic benefits are huge – hotels fill up, restaurants and cafes thrive, tills ring in our shops, and local businesses see a surge in customers.

“This is just the beginning. We’ll continue to set the stage for a massive year in 2026 and I’m looking forward to announcing other high-profile, international events early in the new year.

“I’ve been delighted with the calibre of applications for funding – New Zealand promoters say the interest is high so we’re continuing to work carefully through the process to ensure robust contracts can be signed as soon as possible.

“Already, this package means a boost for our tourism and hospitality industry, with more reasons for people to come to New Zealand, stay in local accommodation, dine in our restaurants, visit attractions and shop while they’re here,” Louise Upston says
