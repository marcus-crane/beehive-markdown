Health Minister Simeon Brown has welcomed today’s release of *The State of Cancer in New Zealand 2025*, which provides an updated view of progress in cancer control over the last five years.

“Cancer touches almost every New Zealander, whether it’s you personally, a family member, a friend, or someone in our community. That’s why improving cancer care and outcomes is one of this Government’s top priorities,” Mr Brown says.

“The Cancer Control Agency’s report shows we’re making real progress in prevention, early detection, and treatment. Smoking rates continue to fall across all ethnicities, screening programmes are more effective and accessible, and long-term survival rates have improved over the past two decades.”

The Government is delivering a series of initiatives to strengthen cancer care and improve outcomes for New Zealanders, including:

- Delivering 33 world-class cancer medicines through our $604 million Pharmac investment, giving patients access to the best treatments available.
- Expanding breast screening to include women aged 70-74, enabling thousands more to benefit from early detection.
- Progressively lowering the bowel screening age to match Australia with 58 as the first step, improving early detection and saving lives.
- Establishing the faster cancer treatment target to speed up access to specialist care.
- Investing in critical cancer infrastructure, including new LINAC machines and upgraded treatment facilities nationwide.
- Expanding stem cell transplant services so patients can access life-saving treatment without delay.
- Initiating New Zealand’s first cervical cancer elimination strategy.
- Investing in the cancer workforce to ensure patients receive the best care possible.

“These actions reflect our commitment to delivering faster, fairer, and more effective cancer care for every New Zealander.”

The report also makes clear that the number of people diagnosed with cancer will rise sharply – from more than 30,000 in 2025 to over 45,000 by 2044.

“While progress is being made, there is more work to do. The expected growth in diagnoses reinforces the need for a health system that is prepared, innovative, and focused on results.”

To support this, the Cancer Control Agency is refreshing the New Zealand Cancer Action Plan 2019-2029. The updated plan will help the system prepare for the increase in diagnoses and will be released next year.

“We’re committed to building on the progress already made and preparing for the challenges ahead. By continuing to invest in prevention, early detection, and treatment, we can ensure New Zealanders have access to world-class cancer care now and into the future.”
