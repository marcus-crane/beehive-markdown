New Zealand’s economy is already benefiting from the new visa-free pathway for Chinese and Pacific travellers with eligible Australian visas, with more than 13,000 visitors already making the most of the opportunity to visit.

“Our immigration settings play a critical role in strengthening our country’s economic future. New Zealand is a dream destination for people around the world. It’s fantastic to see the level of interest just one month after the changes were introduced. More visitors benefit Kiwi businesses and help grow our economy,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

“More than 24,000 New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) requests have been approved for travellers to come here and we expect these numbers to keep growing, adding to the roughly 240,000 visitors each year from China and the Pacific Islands.

Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says the surge in visitors is great news for the tourism industry and wider economy.

“As our second largest export, tourism is vital to New Zealand, and these changes are supporting businesses in our regions right across the country,” Ms Upston says.

“We’re seeing strong interest in the South Island in particular, with 43 percent of Chinese and Pacific visitors travelling on this pathway arriving in Christchurch and 22 percent in Queenstown.”

“More visitors means more bookings for accommodation, more tours, and more people dining in our restaurants and cafes. It’s a real boost for jobs and regional economies.”

“If people are planning their holiday for the Chinese New Year, it’s easier than ever to include New Zealand into travel plans now. Now is a great opportunity to join the thousands who already have, and experience our warm Kiwi hospitality, world-class cuisine, and stunning landscapes.”
