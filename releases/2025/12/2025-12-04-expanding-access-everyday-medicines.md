Registered nurse prescribers can now prescribe nearly double the number of medicines, significantly expanding access to timely, local care for New Zealanders, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Improving access to healthcare in communities is a key priority for the Government. These changes will mean people can get the medicines they need more quickly, with fewer delays and better continuity of care,” Mr Brown says.

Under the changes authorised by the Director-General of Health, registered nurse prescribers will be able to prescribe 211 additional medicines, on top of the over 240 medicines they can already prescribe. 

“These medicines cover a wide range of common and long-term conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, respiratory conditions, and menopause symptoms. Expanding the range of medicines registered nurse prescribers’ can prescribe will make a real difference for people who rely on regular, ongoing treatment.”

New Zealand currently has around 1,570 registered nurse prescribers working across primary care, community health, and specialist services such as diabetes, respiratory, and sexual health.

“Pharmacist prescribers also play an important role in hospitals and general practice settings, supporting more integrated and effective care. They can already prescribe over 1,700 medicines and will see their list expanded by 20 additional medicines.

“The expansion of the range of medicines reflects the advanced education, training, and clinical expertise of nurse and pharmacist prescribers, and builds on wider work to improve access to medicines. 

“This includes expanding prescriber regulations to give nurse practitioners and other prescribing professions greater flexibility within their scope of practice, as well as changes allowing podiatrists to prescribe certain medicines.

“From 1 February 2026, some New Zealanders on stable long-term medicines will also be able to receive prescriptions for up to 12 months, reducing costs and making it easier for people to stay on top of their medicines.”

Mr Brown says empowering health professionals to work at the top of their scope will help deliver better, faster care for communities across New Zealand.

“This is about ensuring our highly trained workforce can use the full extent of their skills, improving care for Kiwis while reducing pressure on other parts of the health system.”
