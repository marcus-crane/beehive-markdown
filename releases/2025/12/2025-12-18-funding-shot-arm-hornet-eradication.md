The Government has announced additional funding to support efforts to eradicate yellow-legged hornet in Auckland, following detections on the North Shore earlier this year.

Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says the Government has committed $12 million to cover the cost of the response to 30 June 2026.

“This funding gives us the best possible chance to eradicate yellow-legged hornet,” says Mr Hoggard.

“The hornet is a predator that poses a serious threat to honeybees and, by extension, to New Zealand’s agricultural sector and overall economy. It’s crucial we prevent it from establishing here to protect what matters most to New Zealand—our environment, our primary industries, and the livelihoods that depend on them.

Biosecurity New Zealand will contribute $2 million from its baseline funding. The remaining $10 million will come from reprioritised funds.

“If costs rise, the Government will consider further funding.”

Mr Hoggard says Biosecurity New Zealand is working with industry partners as part of the Government Industry Agreement, which includes cost sharing for the response, as well as engaging with beekeepers via their groups.

“I’m confident that strong and swift measures are in place to deal with the hornet, and we will continue to draw on the knowledge of our local and international experts who are guiding our work.”

The response has escalated since it began on 3 November. So far, Biosecurity New Zealand has:

- Detected and safely destroyed 37 queen hornets and 28 nests.
- Deployed more than 730 traps and that number is increasing with the extension of the surveillance zone out to 11km.
- Working closely with more beekeepers for enhanced surveillance around hives – over 575 registered apiaries within the 11km zone.
- Searched thousands of properties within 200m of confirmed finds and that number grows every day.
- Established an independent technical advisory group to guide the response.
- Purchased electronic tracking gear to trace nests by attaching transmitters to foraging worker hornets.
- Launched a national advertising campaign urging the public to report suspected sightings.
- Raised public awareness through markets, schools, businesses, and libraries.

“I can’t overstate the importance of public vigilance. I am asking that all eyes are on this, if you suspect you’ve seen a yellow-legged hornet, please report it immediately to Biosecurity New Zealand,” says Mr Hoggard.
