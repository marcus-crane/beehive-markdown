The Government has published the Whole of System (Core Crown) Report on Treaty Settlement Delivery 2025, providing transparency for Treaty settlement delivery and setting a benchmark for performance across Government.

“Accountability is critical to maintaining the integrity of settlements, and to ensuring the that the Crown delivers on its obligations," Māori Crown Relations Minister Tama Potaka says.

“The report today shows encouraging progress and increases across the system. Currently, 83.3 percent of commitments are complete or on track, up from 76.7% in 2024. Delivery issues have also reduced from 4.9 percent to 3.5 percent.

"It is positive to see this progress made in the last year, however there is still work to do to strengthen Treaty relationships and ensure timely delivery of our commitments."

This year's report includes deeper insights from Crown agencies, and for the first time, insights from post-settlement governance entities **(PSGEs).** This provides a more balanced view of the Treaty relationship and the practical aspects of delivering on commitments.

PSGEs described their Treaty relationships as generally constructive, but emphasised that success depends on reciprocal engagement, timely delivery, and adequate resourcing. 

In instances where these elements are strong, PSGEs report confidence in building future-focused partnerships. Where there is more room for improvement, they reported friction and resource pressures.

"Strong Treaty relationships are built on trust and partnership. This report helps keep those priorities front of mind for every agency,” Mr Potaka says.

“Looking ahead, I will be closely monitoring progress made by agencies to strengthen post-settlement relationships with PSGEs, and to ensure timely delivery on commitments,” Mr Potaka says.
