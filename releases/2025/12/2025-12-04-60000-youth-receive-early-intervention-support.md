More than 60,000 at-risk young Kiwis will benefit from a $20.7 million investment into youth development programmes focused on early intervention and prevention support, Youth Minister James Meager says.

53 organisations across New Zealand will receive up to three years’ funding to deliver evidence-based programmes supporting at-risk young people to remain in or re-engage with education, develop skills and qualifications which increase their chances of finding a job, and build confidence and resilience.

The package comprises of two funds to support those aged 12 to 24 years:

- The [Place-Based Youth Development Fund](https://www.myd.govt.nz/funding/current-funding/place-based-youth-development-fund) (up to $5.912 million per annum), which provides funding to local organisations to deliver community-led programmes and services. This could include regular mentoring, and the development of practical skills like creating a CV or improving financial literacy.
- The [Youth Development Contributory Fund](https://www.myd.govt.nz/funding/current-funding/youth-development-contributory-fund) (up to $1.25 million per annum), which provides funding to organisations providing shorter-term programmes. This could include mentoring with a youth worker, community service projects, and outdoor education activities.

“Each programme is unique, and could include a focus on core cognitive skills, academic support, career readiness, community/civic engagement, physical/recreational activities, or personal development,” Mr Meager says.

“They will be tailored to each region’s specific needs, recognising that services are best delivered in the community, by the community.

“For example, *The Y Central South Island*’s 20-week programme focuses on long-term skill development through mentoring, work-readiness, and future pathways exploration support. The Y will also provide school holiday programmes and workshops for young people not currently engaged in formal education, with the aim of better preparing South Canterbury youth to re-engage with education or enter employment.

“The *Golden Bay Workcentre Trust* based in Tākaka offers year-round support through activities focused on wellbeing, confidence, leadership and community connection. They will operate a youth drop-in service, 1:1 support and coaching with tailored development plans, and programmes to reconnect youth with their education and transition into employment.

“Supporting young Kiwis to achieve better life outcomes isn’t just a social investment, it’s an economic one. This high-value and outcome-driven funding improves at-risk youth’s long-term wellbeing and reduces long-term costs to the taxpayer, freeing up more resources to invest in other high-priority areas.

“These funds align with my priority for Ministry of Youth Development funding to support programmes which demonstrate successful outcomes and align with government targets of increasing school attendance and reducing youth unemployment and offending.”
