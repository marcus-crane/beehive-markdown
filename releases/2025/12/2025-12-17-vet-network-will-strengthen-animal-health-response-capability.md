A new biosecurity veterinary network will strengthen New Zealand’s ability to respond to a significant animal disease outbreak such as foot and mouth disease, says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has contracted the Veterinary Council of New Zealand to establish and maintain a network of private veterinarians that can be rapidly mobilised to assist in the response to a significant animal disease outbreak, called VetNet-Biosecurity.

“An incursion of foot and mouth disease in New Zealand would have dramatic impacts, with an immediate halt to most exports of animal products, and a potential and ongoing drop in export values of around $14.3 billion a year.”

Last year, Cabinet endorsed an approach of urgent eradication of foot and mouth disease.

“Immediate and decisive action will be required if an outbreak occurs. If this disease gets to New Zealand, we will need the help of veterinarians in private practice who have the knowledge and training to provide support in the field.”

The aim is to have 200 private veterinarians who can provide support in the field in the event of a significant outbreak.

“The response from veterinary practices demonstrates a real willingness among vets to be involved in a largescale biosecurity response.

Veterinarians perform key roles in biosecurity emergencies, such as clinical examinations, collecting samples, overseeing depopulation, and ensuring animal welfare standards are maintained. MPI employs a large number of veterinarians, but many more will be needed in the event of a significant disease outbreak.”

Veterinarians who are mobilised in a response will continue to be employed by their practice while they work full-time in a response for an agreed period. MPI will provide training and financial compensation to practices involved in the network.

“The great news is this training is also available free of charge to all New Zealand-registered veterinarians who want to increase their biosecurity knowledge and training, not just those who are part of VetNet-Biosecurity,” says Mr Hoggard.

“This is a great opportunity for veterinarians to further develop their understanding of biosecurity, including on-farm biosecurity protocols and exotic disease detection.”
