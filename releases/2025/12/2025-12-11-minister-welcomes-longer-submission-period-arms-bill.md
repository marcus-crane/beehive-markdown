Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee is welcoming the Justice Select Committee’s decision to allow a longer submission period for the Arms Bill and is urging New Zealanders to share their views on how it can be improved.

“This Bill will affect every Licenced Firearm Owner, and my goal is for the final law to make it easier for responsible people to safely use and possess firearms. To achieve that, the Committee needs to hear from the people on the ground,” says Mrs McKee.

“I’m encouraging all New Zealanders with an interest in firearms to make a submission. Tell the Committee what you support in the Bill, what needs improving or clarifying, and what further changes you want included. This process is how we arrive at better, more practical law.

“Many Licenced Firearm Owners will be hunting and enjoying the outdoors over summer, often without reliable internet or access to a computer. This may make it difficult for some people to make a submission.

“I wrote to the Committee to raise this concern and asked them to consider extending the submission period. I’m pleased the Justice Committee has recognised the issue and extended submissions by nearly four weeks, giving people more time to make their voices heard.

“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get firearms law right, and I’m determined that New Zealand ends up with the world’s best firearms laws once again. That requires genuine input from the people who interact with the system every day.

“For too long, major changes to firearms law have been rushed through with little to no consultation. I’m proud to be part of a Government delivering a fair, fit-for-purpose law that will receive a full six-month select committee process.”

Earlier consultation has shown the value of public engagement. More than 8,500 people made submissions on the Arms Act rewrite earlier this year, providing over 700,000 individual points of feedback.

Submissions on the Arms Bill close at 11.59pm on Monday, 16 February 2026 and can be made here: [Arms Bill - New Zealand Parliament](https://www3.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/54SCJUST_SCF_E30C016E-D93C-439D-8EFA-08DE360DAD5F/arms-bill)
