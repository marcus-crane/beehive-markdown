Hunting and Fishing Minister James Meager is celebrating results from this year’s *National Wild Goat Hunting Competition*, which saw the removal of 10,349 wild goats from New Zealand’s landscapes, for a total of 33,418 since the event’s inception.

“This competition exemplifies the power of hunter-led conservation efforts. When not managed properly, wild animals do serious damage to our native bush, farms and forestry. This competition highlights practical and collaborative ways the hunting community can help manage numbers,” Mr Meager says

Now in its third year, the competition is run in partnership between the Department of Conservation and the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association, along with crucial support from businesses and sponsors. 

“863 people participated in this year’s event, including 211 hunters under 18-years-old, along with two slightly older Ministers of the Crown. Wild goats act as an excellent introductory species for the next generation of hunters who are interested in conservation outcomes,” Mr Meager says.

“The competition is also influencing hunter behaviour, with 75 percent of entrants saying they are more likely to hunt wild goats because of the event. This highlights the power hunters, landowners and agencies partnering together can have in protecting our environment and encouraging more Kiwis into the outdoors.

“The initiative has wide-spread backing from the hunting sector, who donated more than $70,000 worth of competition prizes, including time and resources as collection points for the goats’ tails. This resulted in almost 20 percent of entrants winning one of 153 rewards.

“I want to thank everyone involved in the organisation and participation of this event, which has quickly become a key event in the hunting sector’s annual calendar.”
