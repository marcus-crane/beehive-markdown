The first stage of the Our Whare Our Fale housing programme in Eastern Porirua has been completed, supporting local jobs and delivering new affordable homes for families, say Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti and Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka.

Eighteen warm, energy-efficient homes and a communal fale (gathering place) have now been built– the first milestone toward up to 300 affordable homes planned by 2034.

The construction phase has already created work for around 36 people across trades, engineering, and support services, with further employment expected as new stages begin.

“This programme is strengthening the local economy while helping families into stable, healthy homes designed for multigenerational living,” Dr Reti says.

“This development reflects the Government’s focus on practical action to lift housing outcomes. It supports families to achieve home ownership and live in healthy, sustainable communities,” adds Mr Potaka.

The initiative is led by Central Pacific Collective (CPC) in partnership with Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira and the Ministry for Pacific Peoples, supported by a $114.6 million Government investment.

To keep homes affordable, the programme includes:

- Wrap-around financial support, including shared-equity to help with deposits and ongoing housing costs
- Perpetual land leases from Ngāti Toa to remove land costs, and
- Homes built at cost rather than market-rate margins.

“This programme shows the value of working alongside community organisations and iwi to improve economic and health outcomes for families,” Mr Potaka says.

“Initiatives like Our Whare Our Fale are making a real difference. They build affordable homes, strengthen financial skills, and give families the security they need to thrive. This is the kind of progress we want to see across the country,” says Dr Reti.

“I want to acknowledge Central Pacific Collective, Te Rūnanga o Toa Rangatira and the Ministry for Pacific Peoples. Their partnership is delivering real results for families.”

A further 32 homes are expected to be completed by late 2026, creating ongoing employment throughout the construction period.

Families are expected to begin moving in by the end of the year.
