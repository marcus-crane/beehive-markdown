The Government has unveiled the host iwi and theme for next year’s national broadcast of Matariki, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“I’m delighted Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei in Auckland has agreed to host next year’s official ceremony. 

“They’ve been welcoming the wider Auckland region to their public Matariki events for years. It’s estimated about 5,000 people attended this year, becoming the largest celebration in the country.

“This will help showcase the wider region and what makes the Māori New Year unique for the area. 

“The theme for next year’s event will be Matariki Herenga Waka – For Everyone.

“This theme is about all people coming together to celebrate Matariki 2026 in Auckland, the city of sails, or wherever they may be in New Zealand.

“The Māori New Year is a time of reflection, celebration, and preparation. It is a time to remember loved ones, come together with whānau to give thanks to what we have and look forward to the promise of a new year. 

“While the theme changes from year to year the values of reflection, celebration and preparation remain the same.”
