A new scanner featuring the latest imaging technology has been installed at Wellington Regional Hospital, giving patients faster, higher-quality scans with reduced radiation exposure, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The new SPECT-CT scanner replaces an older model and will operate alongside a recently installed unit, giving Wellington Regional Hospital two modern scanners to support patient care,” Mr Brown says.

“These advanced machines will help diagnose a wide range of patients across the region, including those receiving cancer treatment, children needing specialised imaging, and people requiring inpatient care.”

SPECT-CT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography – Computed Tomography) combines two advanced imaging technologies in a single scan.

The Nuclear Medicine SPECT scan shows how organs and tissues are functioning, with the CT scan providing detailed anatomical images.

“By combining these two technologies in one scan, clinicians get a much clearer picture of what’s happening inside the body. This supports earlier detection of disease, more accurate diagnoses and better monitoring of treatment.”

The project also includes a full refurbishment of the scanning room to enhance the patient experience.

“The new space features soft lighting, scenic wall decals and modern design elements to create a calmer, more comfortable environment. This is especially important for children and patients undergoing longer scans that can take several hours.”

The installation of the new scanner is part of the Government’s wider $108 million upgrade to diagnostic imaging across New Zealand, delivering 32 new and replacement CT, MRI, and SPECT-CT scanners nationwide.

“By upgrading equipment and enhancing imaging quality, more patients will benefit from earlier detection, improved treatment decisions and better care across a wide range of health conditions,” Mr Brown says.
