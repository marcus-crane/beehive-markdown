Education Minister Erica Stanford is welcoming the successful conclusion of pay negotiations for community education professionals following a majority vote from Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) members to accept settlement.

“Community education promotes a culture of lifelong learning and helps people to gain new and valuable skills outside and beyond school. Across the country, community educators teach in adult education, music and the arts, and provide specialist tutoring services,” Ms Stanford says.

“The Community Education Collective Agreement (CECA) will benefit over 1,000 Community Education professionals each year, with the settlement providing pay rate increases to all staff.

“Community education providers play a valuable role in our education system. The settlement is a positive outcome for educators and shows what can be achieved through focused, good faith bargaining.”
