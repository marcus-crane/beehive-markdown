Minister for the Accident Compensation Corporation Scott Simpson has today thanked outgoing Chief Executive Megan Main for her service.

“Megan Main has led the Corporation since 2021, during a period of significant change and scrutiny for the organisation. She has brought experience from across the health and public service, including leading New Zealand’s Managed Isolation and Quarantine system during Covid and holding senior leadership roles in both New Zealand and Australia,” Mr Simpson says.

“Throughout her time as Chief Executive, Megan has remained focused on delivering the core roles of the Accident Compensation Corporation. Megan has worked with the Board and partners to improve client outcomes and strengthen service delivery. Recent results are promising. 

“I want to acknowledge Megan’s decision to not renew her contract next year as Chief Executive and thank her for her contribution over the last four years.” Mr Simpson says.

The ACC Board will shortly commence a formal recruitment process to find a new Chief Executive.

“We all have a role to play to ensure we can better support New Zealanders who have been injured by an accident. We are focused on restoring the Scheme to its founding promise – putting clients first and delivering the fast, efficient rehabilitation New Zealanders expect and deserve,” Mr Simpson says.
