Legislation which improves court timeliness by updating procedures and adding more High Court Judges has passed in Parliament today, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Courts Minister Nicole McKee say. 

“Speeding up court processes is one of our three key priorities as we fix the basics in law and order,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Court delays affect everyone, the profession included. It just takes one thing to be out of place and everything grinds to a halt. Another adjournment. Justice delayed once more. 

We need to improve access to justice so New Zealanders can get on with their lives. Ensuring victims are at the heart of the justice system underpins all of our work.”

“This Bill is about delivering faster justice for victims, families, and businesses,” Mrs McKee says.

“By lifting the cap on High Court Judges from 55 to 60, we can hear the most serious cases sooner, so violent offenders are dealt with quickly and victims can get closure and move on with their lives.

“The improvements to court procedure are designed to ensure judges are focused on the most critical tasks and decisions such as dealing serious criminal matters.”

The Judicature (Timeliness) Legislation Amendment Bill will:

- Allow a new judge to take office up to three months before another judge retires.
- Provide a new process under the Senior Courts Act to efficiently deal with civil cases that are an abuse of court process in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, and to restrain vexatious litigants from repeatedly bringing proceedings.
- Amend the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 to enable a District Court Judge to make an order to manage multiple charges against a single defendant in one District Court locations at the pre-trial stage.
- Amend the Criminal Procedure Act to enable a Court of Appeal Judge to remit first appeals relating to District Court criminal trials to the High Court where appropriate;
- Amend the Coroners Act 2006 to enable coroners to close inquiries when new information becomes available, or circumstances change. This will not apply to inquiries that are required to be opened by law, such as where a death appears to be self-inflicted, or has occurred in care or custody.
