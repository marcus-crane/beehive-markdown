The Crown has signed an agreement in principle to settle the historical Treaty claims of Ngai Tai, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“This is a significant step in the settlement process, since Ngai Tai submitted their first claims over 150 years ago. Negotiations towards a comprehensive deed of settlement will follow shortly.

“It includes a substantial package of conservation land, financial and commercial redress of $12 million and the reservation of marine space for Ngai Tai to apply for aquaculture resource consents.

“The Crown acknowledges that as a result of its acts and omissions, Ngai Tai suffered loss of their land and the consequential impacts on them as a people. The agreement in principle is a step in the process of the Crown addressing these acts and omissions.”

Ngai Tai is an iwi based around Tōrere in the eastern Bay of Plenty.

The Whakaaetanga Matua – Agreement in Principle outlines the proposed settlement with Ngai Tai. Details of the settlement will be negotiated in the coming months.

A copy of the agreement in principle is available online at:
