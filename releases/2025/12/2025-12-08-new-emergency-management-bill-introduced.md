“The Government has introduced a new Emergency Management Bill today, set to strengthen New Zealand’s emergency management system” says Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell. 

The Emergency Management Bill will replace the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, and enable the improvements identified by the Government Inquiry into the Response to the North Island Severe Weather Events of early 2023. 

“Having attended several local states of emergency since becoming Emergency Management Minister, I have seen firsthand the need to improve how we manage, respond to, and recover from emergencies. This new Bill will make a real difference on the ground.”

“The Bill strengthens the role of local communities and iwi in emergency management by ensuring they have places at the decision-making table for local emergency management and requiring engagement with communities and iwi during development of local plans and the national plan.

The Bill also provides more clarity about roles and responsibilities at the national, regional, and local levels, to ensure faster decisions are made by the right people.

Other changes in the Bill will help to minimise disruption to the infrastructure that provides essential services during emergencies, ensure agencies have the right powers available when an emergency happens, and enable a higher minimum standard of emergency management across the system.

“We’ve also listened to the many people who have provided feedback relating to animals and included changes in the Bill that will improve animal welfare during and after emergencies.” says Mr Mitchell. 

“Given the significant and often long-lasting impacts of emergencies, it’s important that we make sure the legislative settings are fit-for-purpose and enable the emergency management system New Zealanders expect.”
