After delivering standout results, a pilot connecting high school students with New Zealand manufacturers to grow the future workforce will expand into new regions.

“We know that meaningful, well-paid employment is one of the most powerful ways to change a person’s life and open doors to future opportunities,” Small Business and Manufacturing Minister Chris Penk says.

“The Earn as You Learn pilot, launched in Waikato in February, is a government-backed and industry-led initiative that gives students paid, real-world experience in manufacturing while they study, helping bridge the gap between classroom learning and hands-on skills.

“Students spent two days a week in the classroom at Wintec’s Rotokauri Campus and three days working with some of the region’s most advanced manufacturers as they earned an NZ Certificate in Manufacturing Level Three.

“The pilot has delivered learner completion rates of more than 80 percent, with many graduates already stepping into jobs with the businesses that supported the programme. Eight out of ten participating employers have also agreed to continue next year, and more firms are in talks to join up.

“This has been a gamechanger for attracting and developing talent in the manufacturing sector, and the programme will now expand into the Hutt Valley and Canterbury next year, followed by Auckland in 2027.

“Regional steering groups are leading the expansion, with the goal of increasing graduate numbers from 17 this year to between 100 and 150 by 2027.

“Manufacturing risks facing ongoing shortages of skilled workers. Earn as You Learn helps secure the future of a sector that contributes eight percent to national GDP and underpins 60 percent of our export economy, while giving young Kiwis the chance to step into exciting careers in a rapidly evolving field.

“I want to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of Advancing Manufacturing Aotearoa, Hanga-Aro-Rau, Wintec and the Waikato Engineering Careers Association for their work on this programme, alongside the businesses who hosted students throughout the pilot.

“It’s a powerful example of what industries can achieve when they work with vocational educators and government to build a pipeline of talented workers.

“Waikato is just the beginning for the Earn as You Learn programme. Our task now is to take this proven model nationwide and ensure New Zealand has the skilled manufacturing workforce it needs for the future.”
