The Government is delivering faster access to mental health support with the addition of 31 new specialist beds at Manor Park Private Hospital in Lower Hutt, Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey announced today whilst visiting the facility.

“These new beds will ensure more people receive faster access to the right support, in the right place. The beds will help reduce unnecessary hospital stays, ease pressure on emergency departments, and most importantly deliver better care for people,” Mr Doocey says.

The new beds include:

- 15 beds for adults with high and complex long-term mental health needs, offering a recovery-focused environment better suited to their care than traditional acute inpatient units.
- 16 psychogeriatric beds**,** including:
  
  - 8 for long-term secure care for older adults in the region.
  - 8 for short-term transitional support**,** helping Wellington and Hutt Valley residents while their long-term care needs are assessed.

“Hutt Valley and Capital Coast are below the shorter stays in ED target of being admitted, discharged or transferred in six hours. This investment will help improve patient admissions and aims to contribute toward improving their performance.

“We are shifting how we support people in need of mental health support. Units like this, ensures that when someone is in need of support, they are in a safe, supportive environment that is designed to help them get well.

“Currently, too many people who require long-term support are placed in facilities that are not meeting their needs.

“By opening these additional long-term beds, we can ensure this changes. People with the most complex needs can now receive more therapeutic care, that will improve their quality of life.

"Mental health care must be underpinned by high-quality infrastructure that enables clinicians and support staff to deliver the safe, effective, compassionate care Kiwis deserve.

“Today’s announcement of more beds is part of this Governments mental health plan to deliver faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response.”
