The Government is continuing to supercharge school property, increasing maintenance funding for the first time since 2010 so more students benefit from safe, warm and dry classrooms.

“Since coming into office, we have consistently driven efficiencies in school property delivery so more schools, communities and children benefit sooner. Investing in maintaining school buildings to get more life out of them is a responsible use of taxpayers' money,” Education Minister Erica Stanford.;

“That’s why we’re delivering a major increase to school capital funding so our classrooms are well maintained, and students benefit sooner. Five Year Agreement (5YA) funding covers a 5-year period and can be used for upgrades, modernising or replacement works on existing buildings.”

From July 2026, the base rate will rise by 50 percent – from $30 per square metre to $45 per square metre. The minimum 5YA allocation for small schools will also double, from $45,000 to $90,000. The 5YA rate has not been updated since 2010.

“We’re providing schools with greater certainty and flexibility to plan effectively. This investment will support them to plan and deliver larger essential upgrades and modernisation over the long term,” Ms Stanford says.

The first group of 450 schools will receive increased allocations from 1 July 2026. Doubling the minimum allocation is particularly significant for the smallest schools - 24 schools will double their existing funding in the first year.

This package builds on the $58 million investment directly to schools for small maintenance projects. More than 2,400 state and state integrated school have been paid their one-off grant to help fast-track much-needed property maintenance.

“We’ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback from principals and boards who can finally tackle those day-to-day tasks like painting buildings, fixing windows and doors, and trimming old trees over summer.

“All Kiwi kids deserve to thrive at school, that starts with warm, safe and dry classrooms. Our priority is getting spades in the ground as soon as possible so schools, families and communities’ benefit,” Ms Stanford says.
