Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee is cutting unnecessary red tape so restaurants with on-site retail areas can finally sell take-home alcohol to their customers.

The Government will amend the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act to allow restaurants to apply for an off-licence, if they also sell takeaway food or non-alcoholic beverages prepared by the business.

“Right now, restaurants that prepare and sell food products like sauces, pastries or desserts for consumption off site are effectively barred from selling customers a bottle of wine to take home,” says Mrs McKee.

“These rigid rules have created absurd barriers to responsible businesses providing a unique experience their customers want.

“They’re already trusted to supply alcohol in their restaurants through an on-licence. This change will simply allow them to apply for permission to sell it for off-site consumption too – subject to the normal licensing process.

“La Bella Italia in Petone is one well-known example. They’ve had to jump through all sorts of hoops just to sell a bottle of wine that someone may have enjoyed with their meal. Nonsensical rules like this help no one.

“One of the hidden costs of regulation is that lawmakers and regulators can’t possibly predict every innovative or unique business model New Zealanders will come up with. When the rules can’t adapt, they block good ideas and kill the spirit and ambition of the people behind them.

“This red tape relief is about trusting responsible operators, giving customers more choice, and letting entrepreneurial hospitality businesses get on with what they do best.

“I want to acknowledge Hutt South MP Chris Bishop, who first introduced this reform as a Member’s Bill and kept attention on the issue for many years. I also want to thank Mike Butterick, who then took up the Bill and continued to champion it before I adopted it as part of the Government’s broader alcohol reforms.”
