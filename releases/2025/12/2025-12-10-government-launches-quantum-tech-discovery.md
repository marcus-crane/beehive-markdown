Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti has launched a $1.35m discovery phase to explore a national quantum technologies platform aimed at creating jobs, attracting partnerships, and boosting New Zealand’s economy.

Research in quantum technologies explores how particles behave at the smallest scales, and quantum computing has the potential to solve highly complex problems that would take today’s computers years to calculate.

“Quantum technology underpins breakthroughs in computing, secure communications, and sensing and measurement – areas that can transform industries and create new opportunities for New Zealand businesses,” Dr Reti says.

“The New Zealand Institute for Advanced Technology will undertake a discovery process to explore New Zealand’s domestic quantum tech capabilities and international opportunities for commercialisation.

“This discovery process will look at how New Zealand can step up and accelerate our quantum technology research to drive innovation, create high-value jobs and secure our place in the global tech economy.

“New Zealand already has strengths in several quantum research areas. Earlier this week, three New Zealand–Korea collaborations were announced, which will help lay the foundations for secure quantum communication networks and open future high-value opportunities for New Zealand and our international partners,” Dr Reti says.

The discovery phase will run from December 2025 to June 2026 and will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers and businesses to explore both scientific and industry capabilities and needs. An advisory panel will be convened to provide input and expert advice.

If the discovery process shows readiness for a quantum technology investment, then the New Zealand Institute for Advanced Technology will move ahead with design and initiation of a quantum technology research platform.

The quantum technologies discovery phase is the third activity of the new Institute for Advanced Technology. It follows investment in a future materials and magnet technologies research platform hosted by Paihau–Robinson Research Institute in May, and investment in an Artificial Intelligence research platform announced in September.
