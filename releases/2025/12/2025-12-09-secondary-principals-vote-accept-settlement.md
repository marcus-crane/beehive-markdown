Education Minister Erica Stanford welcomes the successful conclusion of pay negotiations for secondary principals, with a majority vote from members of the Secondary Principals’ Association of NZ (SPANZ) and the Post Primary Teachers Association (PPTA) to renew the Secondary Principals’ Collective Agreement.

“Secondary principals play a pivotal role delivering on our priorities, raising student achievement and leading school communities. This agreement recognises their significant contribution to making a difference for our young people. I’m thrilled they will benefit from pay increases from Term 1 next year,” Ms Stanford says.

The new collective agreement which covers around 330 secondary principals includes base salary increases of 4.7 per cent, a new $15,000 allowance that recognises principals’ work to lead changes to NCEA and recognition for those who contribute to new programmes to support aspiring and beginning principals.

“Today’s agreement is a result of mutually constructive negotiations and bargaining in good faith process. I thank the Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche for seeing these negotiations through to a successful conclusion.”

“We are firmly committed to backing teachers to succeed in the classroom to help ensure every student, regardless of background, has the chance to reach the potential at school,” Ms Stanford says.
