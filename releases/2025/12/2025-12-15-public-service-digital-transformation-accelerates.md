The Government is taking the next step in its plan to modernise and streamline digital services for New Zealanders by simplifying and coordinating the delivery of IT systems, Digitising Government and Public Service Minister Judith Collins says.

“Logical digital groupings of government agencies will be progressively established and will share common IT platforms, which will reduce duplication and improve efficiency,” Ms Collins says.

“Taking a centralised approach to digital investment and procurement could save up to 30 percent on the projected $13 billion technology spend across the public sector in the next five years. That means potential savings of $3.9b – money which can instead be spent on delivering better public services, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. 

“Part of this drive for efficiency involves establishing a new government digital agency at the Public Service Commission (PSC), with the existing Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) functions transitioning from the Department of Internal Affairs to the PSC on 1 April. The new Government Digital Delivery Agency will work under a functional chief executive – someone who is responsible for a specific area of work - who will hold the GCDO role."

“We are modernising government services to make them simpler, faster and more cost-effective for New Zealanders,” Ms Collins says.

“These changes represent a significant shift in how the public service operates, ensuring digital investment is coordinated, cost-effective, and focused on delivering services that save time and improve outcomes for New Zealanders.

“A smarter approach to IT spending supports the Government’s priorities to get the books back in order, restore fiscal discipline, strengthen the efficiency and performance of the public service, lift productivity, and drive sustainable economic growth.”
