Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds has confirmed the ministerial appointments to the eight new Industry Skills Boards (ISBs). These appointments begin immediately, as the ISBs are now formally established through the Orders in Council.

“These high-calibre appointees bring deep industry knowledge, governance capability, and a commitment to supporting a vocational education system that delivers the skilled workforce New Zealand needs,” Ms Simmonds says.

Each ISB is made up of six industry-nominated members and two ministerial appointments, who have also been nominated by industry, reflecting a strong emphasis on industry leadership supported by experienced governance. 

To ensure continuity, each ISB includes one ministerial appointment with a three-year term and one with a four-year term, so not all appointments fall due at the same time.

The ISB ministerial appointees are:

- **Construction & Specialist Trades**: Gregory Wallace, Tina Wieczorek.
- **Education, Health & Community**: Dr Vanessa Caldwell, Stewart Eadie.
- **Electrotechnology & IT**: Ross Beal, Kingi Wetere.
- **Energy & Infrastructure**: Wayne Scott, Andrea O’Brien.
- **Food & Fibre**: Christopher Lewis, William Beetham.
- **Manufacturing & Engineering**: Nathan Busch, Dr James Neale.
- **Services**: Russell Clements, John Fiso.
- **Transport**: Shaun Johnson, Suhail Sequeria.

Ms Simmonds says the ISBs, which replace the former Workforce Development Councils, will set standards, shape qualifications, endorse programmes, and ensure vocational training stays aligned with employer expectations and workforce needs.

“The ISBs reflect the industries they represent and will help ensure New Zealanders gain the practical, trusted qualifications that industry relies on,” she says.

“We're building a modern, connected work-based learning system that supports quality jobs and drives the economic growth powering New Zealand’s future.

“I want to thank all appointees for their willingness to serve and the contribution they will make to the future of vocational education and training.”
