A Fast-track approval for an Auckland quarry is great news for the city’s construction sector, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Resources Minister Shane Jones say.

Stevenson Aggregates Ltd’s Drury quarry has received approval to expand after lodging its application in April.

“This approval took just 85 working days following the commencement of the expert panel. Without Fast-track, gaining consent for a project like this would take between two and four years” Mr Bishop says.

“The Sutton block is estimated to produce up to 240 million tonnes of aggregate over 50 years.

“Aggregate is essential for Auckland’s growth, supporting housing, construction, and infrastructure. The Sutton Block extension will help meet the city’s demand for aggregate.

“Fast-track is streamlining quarrying approvals so applicants don’t have to navigate multiple, costly layers of consents, over a far longer timeframe, as they have done using existing RMA processes.”    

Mr Jones says aggregate was included on New Zealand’s Critical Minerals List because of its economic importance to New Zealand.

“The Government has a significant public infrastructure pipeline in the Auckland region which requires a stable and affordable supply of aggregate.

“It is important quarries are near demand centres. A common industry estimate is that the cost of aggregate doubles after the first 30km it is transported.”

The project was listed in Schedule 2 of the Fast-track Approvals Act 2024 and was approved by an independent expert panel today.
