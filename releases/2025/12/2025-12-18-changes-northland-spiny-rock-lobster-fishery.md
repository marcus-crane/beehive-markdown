Northland’s rock lobster fishery will have a reprieve from fishing to help build stocks of spiny rock lobster, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“I have decided to close most of the east coast of Northland to both commercial and recreational spiny rock lobster fishing and reduce recreational daily limits,” Mr Jones says.

“This fishery is a priority for me and I’m aware people have concerns about low spiny rock lobster numbers. Rock lobsters play an important role in the marine ecosystem by helping keep kina numbers in check. The changes I am making will help restore balance by increasing the numbers and size of spiny rock lobsters in the fishery.”

Most commercial spiny rock lobster fishing off the east coast of Northland has already stopped under a voluntary industry closure.

“I commend the industry on taking action to support this fishery. However, I consider that further measures for both commercial and recreational fishers are needed to give the fishery the best opportunity for recovery.”

Summary of the changes:

- The CRA 1 closure will extend from Ohao Point, including Pārengarenga Harbour, to Hauraki Gulf at Cape Rodney
- The recreational daily catch limit for spiny rock lobster will reduce to two per person per day in the CRA 1 fishery, which includes the west coast of Northland
- A portion of the CRA 2 fishery will also close between Te Ārai Point and inner Hauraki Gulf.

The inner Hauraki Gulf was closed [to spiny rock lobster fishing earlier this year](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/inner-hauraki-gulf-closed-rock-lobster-fishing).

“These changes will create a chain of restrictions down the east coast and mean the coastline and most of the waters from Northland to Coromandel Peninsula will be off limits for spiny rock lobster fishing.

“To protect against fishers simply switching from spiny to packhorse rock lobster (PHC 1), I have set a nationwide recreational catch limit of three packhorse rock lobsters per person per day.

Consultation on the changes took place between August and September and Fisheries New Zealand received more than 600 submissions expressing a range of views. 

The changes will take effect from 1 April 2026.
