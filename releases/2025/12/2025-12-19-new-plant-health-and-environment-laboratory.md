The Government has committed to a major biosecurity investment to protect New Zealand’s primary industries and drive economic growth, says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop.

The Ministers today toured the construction site of the new Plant Health and Environment Laboratory (PHEL) at the Mt Albert Research Centre in Auckland.

“This facility will play a critical role in protecting New Zealand’s environment and economy from plant pests and diseases, while supporting surveillance, diagnostics, and emergency response capabilities,” says Mr Hoggard.

“The new facility is a strategic investment to replace the Ministry for Primary Industries’ (MPI) aging Tāmaki PHEL with modern, fit-for-purpose facilities that will support New Zealand’s biosecurity system for the next 50 years.

“The services this facility will provide are essential to maintaining the trust of our trading partners and New Zealand’s access to export trade markets.

“New Zealand’s $60.4 billion food and fibre sector accounts for approximately 82 percent of New Zealand’s goods exports. Protecting and growing this sector is critical to achieving the Government’s goal of doubling export value by 2034.

“Strengthening New Zealand’s defences against biosecurity threats and the potentially devastating impacts for our primary industries and environment is more important than ever as the risk of new pests and diseases increases with climate change and an increasingly complex trade environment,” says Mr Hoggard.

Mr Bishop says the start of construction is a major milestone for the Government’s infrastructure programme.

“We’re delivering a world-class scientific facility that will strengthen our biosecurity system, support our primary industries and create hundreds of jobs in the process.

“Once complete, this facility will be one of the most advanced biosecurity centres in Australasia.”

“This programme is part of the $7 billion construction programme, aimed at boosting jobs and economic growth through infrastructure investment before Christmas.

“This is exactly the kind of vertical infrastructure we need to support innovation, resilience and long-term economic value.”

Site preparation works have been completed, foundations have been constructed, and the structure is starting to take shape. Crown Infrastructure Delivery is managing the delivery of the facility, with Southbase Construction the lead contractor.

Construction is scheduled to finish in 2028, and the facility is expected to be ready for service in January 2029.
