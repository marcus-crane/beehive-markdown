Space Minister Judith Collins today launched a $1.8 million pilot programme through which Kiwi space companies can develop their technologies, that could ultimately form part of a future national space mission.

“The Kiwi Space Activator will help more Kiwi businesses and universities move novel space technology and concepts from the laboratory to the skies, further boosting New Zealand’s reputation as a hub for space innovation,” Ms Collins says. 

“Capability developed through these innovative projects could feed into a future national space mission, with potential applications for resource management or monitoring illegal fishing, among other areas. 

“We want to turn big ideas into big impact, and this is the first step in our journey.”   

The New Zealand Space Agency will administer the pilot programme which will have two rounds of funding. Up to $600,000 will be offered for each successful project, with a total of $1.8 million available over two years. The pilot will support a minimum of three projects.

“Round one projects need to be ‘ready to fly’ - meaning they have technology that can be tested on a rocket, satellite, or high-altitude platform within 18-24 months,” Ms Collins says.

"The Kiwi Space Activator is designed to support projects that align with challenges identified by government agencies, such as maritime security, space situational awareness, biosecurity, and ecosystem health.

“Projects can also meet a New Zealand Space Agency challenge for delivering core components of a satellite in an innovative way – for example power supply or communications systems. 

“This pilot programme will help shape future government support for the space sector and ensure New Zealand remains at the forefront of global space innovation.”

The Kiwi Space Activator is open to New Zealand-based organisations only. Round one applicants must contribute at least 30 percent of project cash costs, while in-kind and cash co-funding will be accepted for round two.

Applications are open and close on 1 March 2026. For more information on eligibility and how to apply see the New Zealand Space Agency [website](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/space/industry-and-innovation/kiwi-space-activator).
