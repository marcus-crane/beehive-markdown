New Zealand will host the third Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly in Wellington next week, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced. 

It is the first time the Assembly has been held in the Southern Hemisphere. 

“The Assembly brings together Parliamentarians and experts from across the world to discuss how they can work collectively to raise awareness of Antarctica’s importance, and support the work of the Antarctic Treaty,” Mr Peters says. 

“The Treaty has been maintaining peace and promoting scientific collaboration in the Antarctic for close to seven decades, but we know the region is not immune to the impacts of our changing climate or shifts in the geopolitical landscape.” 

Mr Peters says the Treaty provides the framework to respond to challenges facing the Antarctic, whether it be sea level rise, warming oceans, or strategic competition for resources. 

“We must work together to ensure the long-term protection of the Antarctic as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, which supports our shared security and prosperity. 

“The Assembly’s aim is to create a network of Antarctic advocates in Parliaments and communities around the world, who will speak up for Antarctica’s continued protection and conservation.” 

The Assembly will take place on December 8 and 9 and will be chaired by National MP Andrew Bayly.
