The $200 million Gas Security Fund will open on 12 January 2026 to expressions of interest to help increase the availability of natural gas in New Zealand, Resources Minister Shane Jones says.

“We are looking for proposals that will accelerate or increase the volume of gas to market as quickly as possible, or which will enable gas to be stored so it is available when most needed for industry and homes,” Mr Jones says.

“Natural gas remains critical in our energy system while we transition to more renewable energy sources. Until then, it’s needed to get us through periods of high demand and for industries that require consistent, high-temperature energy.

“Declining gas production is pushing up costs for businesses and households and constraining economic growth. This fund will support activities that secure supply now and into the future, delivering short to long-term benefits,” Mr Jones says.

A gas advisory panel is being established to ensure decisions are informed by deep commercial and technical expertise, particularly given the complexities of gas exploration and market conditions in New Zealand, Mr Jones says.

The panel will provide expert technical advice to the decision-making ministers – Mr Jones and Associate Finance Minister Chris Bishop.

Members of the panel will be named in due course.

The 12 January 2026 opening date for expressions of interest for the fund follows the Government’s [announcement last month](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/widened-scope-co-investment-new-gas) that it has broadened the fund’s scope from new exploration to include existing fields and storage options.

The Gas Security Fund is administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s Kānoa – Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit.

“Once the fund opens on 12 January, we encourage expressions of interest to be submitted as soon as possible. More information can be found on the Grow Regions website, and interested parties can also speak to Kānoa officials,” Mr Jones says.

“We are moving at pace to restore confidence in New Zealand’s gas sector and support businesses that rely on it for their ongoing industrial needs and the benefit of New Zealand’s wider economic growth.”
