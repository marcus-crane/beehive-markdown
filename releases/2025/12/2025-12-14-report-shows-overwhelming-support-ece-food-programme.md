Associate Education Minister welcomes the Ministry of Education’s ECE Food Programme Survey Report. The report shows overwhelming support for the service provided by KidsCan in delivering taxpayer funded meals for up to 10,000 ECE children who need them.

The list of positive ratings given to KidsCan from 130 (42.5 per cent) of the centres receiving taxpayer funded meals, and who participated in the survey were:

- Supplier Reliability and Consistency 97.5 per cent
- Supplier Food Safety and Hygiene 98.5 per cent
- Communication 98 per cent
- Flexibility and Adaptability 99 per cent
- Service and Professionalism 95 per cent

“I would like to acknowledge KidsCan for their amazing work supporting children’s learning since 2005. In 2019 they launched a national early childhood programme which provided healthy lunches to over 6,000 early learners with the highest needs. In 2025 this number increased to 16,000, with $4 million in additional funding each year from this government,” says Mr Seymour.

“Sir Peter Gluckman’s research clearly demonstrates that good nutrition is one of the key factors affecting early brain development. The more we can do to support good nutrition from a young age, the more likely children are to reach their potential.

“The report makes key findings on the effects taxpayer funded lunches observed by centres on each of the child development stages.”

In the children’s physical development stage 77 per cent of services reported

improvements in energy and stamina, 34 per cent reported improvements in sleep patterns, 32 per cent reported improvements in digestion, 29 per cent reported fewer absences, and 26 per cent reported healthier weights.

In the cognitive and learning development category 62 per cent of services reported improvements in concentration, 67 per cent reported improvements

in participation, 34 per cent reported improvements in memory and problem solving, and 28 per cent reported improvements in language and fine motor skills.

In the emotional and behavioural development category 69 per cent of services reported children were more settled and calmer, 45 per cent reported positive shifts in mood swings and emotional outbursts, 34 per cent reported improvements resilience, and 39 per cent reported children were better at self-regulating.

In the social and interpersonal development category 51 per cent of services reported positive shifts in children’s interactions with each other, 42 per cent reported children were more confident, 89 per cent reported children tried new foods, and 72 per cent reported meal times created a stronger sense of belonging.

“Savings from the new school lunch programme mean that KidsCan can deliver these benefits for 10,000 additional Kiwi kids,” Mr Seymour says.

“The Healthy School Lunch programme is expected realise taxpayer savings of $145 million in 2026. $4 million of those savings each year will go to ensuring 10,000 children in early learning services receive a taxpayer funded lunch every day.

“When the Government manages its accounts like families and businesses have to, money goes a lot further.”
