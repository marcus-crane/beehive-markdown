Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston and Immigration Minister Erica Stanford are welcoming the first China Eastern Airlines flight connecting Shanghai, Auckland and Buenos Aires, marking a major milestone for tourism.

Adding to its existing daily Shanghai to Auckland flights, China Eastern’s new route will connect China and South America via Auckland with twice-weekly flights.

“It’s great to see this new route launching between Asia and South America via New Zealand improving air connectivity and supporting travel, trade and tourism,” Louise Upston says.

Speaking from the tarmac at Auckland Airport, Louise Upston said she was excited to see Auckland Airport continue to grow as a hub for international travellers and that increased air connectivity is vital for New Zealand’s future economic growth.

“We are very firmly focused on growing tourism beyond 2019 levels and China Eastern's Southern Link marks a new milestone for New Zealand as a tourism and trade gateway.

“International tourism is a crucial part of this Government’s focus on economic growth and building the future for our country. We’ve taken a number of steps both to boost visitor numbers and make it easier for people to come and enjoy everything New Zealand has to offer.”

“We’ve already streamlined the experience for Chinese visitors who can now transit via New Zealand on a NZeTA without having to apply for a separate transit visa,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says.

“Our immigration settings play a critical role in strengthening our country’s economic future. We are focused on delivering smart and responsive immigration solutions to support that,” Ms Stanford says.
