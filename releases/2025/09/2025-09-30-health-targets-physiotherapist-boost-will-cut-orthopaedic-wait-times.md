New investment to grow the physiotherapy workforce will ensure better access and shorter wait times for orthopaedic care, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Ensuring all New Zealanders can access timely, quality healthcare is a priority for our Government,” Mr Brown says.

“The new Musculoskeletal (MSK) orthopaedic pathway, introduced in August 2024, is already making a real difference. So far, more than 7200 first specialist assessments (FSAs) and over 9500 follow-up appointments have been completed – and this is just the beginning.”

The MSK orthopaedic pathway enables experienced physiotherapists to assess and treat patients with hip, knee, back, or shoulder conditions. Patients are triaged earlier and receive a faster diagnosis, with these physiotherapists able to identify whether surgical or non-surgical treatment is required. 

Recognised internationally, this model has been shown to reduce unnecessary surgery and support better outcomes for patients.

“To build on this success, we are expanding the Advanced Clinical Practice Physiotherapist workforce, with Health New Zealand recruiting an additional 15.6 FTE on top of the 21.47 FTE already delivering FSAs across the country.

“One full-time physiotherapist in these advanced roles can deliver around 1200 FSAs per year, significantly increasing capacity to assess patients requiring orthopaedic appointments.

“In addition, up to 50 experienced physiotherapists will be supported to undertake postgraduate training at the Auckland University of Technology and the University of Otago, enabling them to complete FSAs as part of the pathway.

“By enabling physiotherapists to take on more assessments, we are freeing up hospital specialists to focus on patients who need their care most – helping us achieve our target of 95 per cent of patients receiving their FSA or elective treatment within four months.

“It’s a smarter use of our workforce, allowing more people to be treated, and more quickly.

“The expansion of the MSK orthopaedic pathway means faster assessments, shorter wait times, and better outcomes for patients. It’s about putting patients first and delivering the quality healthcare New Zealanders deserve.”
