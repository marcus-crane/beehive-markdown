Landcorp has launched a new livestock equity partnership opportunity, designed to support equity-building pathways for farm operators and strengthen the future of farming in New Zealand, State Owned Enterprises Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is a welcomed initiative that directly supports the Government’s priorities to strengthen rural employment, improve farm productivity, and create genuine pathways to ownership for the next generation of farmers,” Mr Brown says.

“By enabling operators to take financial responsibility behind the farm gate, we’re backing high performance and helping unlock the full potential of New Zealand’s farming sector.”

The equity partnership model builds on the State Owned Enterprise’s 2024 introduction of contract farming options for dairy farmers, including sharemilking and contract milking arrangements across four farms: Quarry and Otago in the Central Plateau, Waimakariri in Canterbury, and Ruru on the West Coast.

The first property available for expressions of interest is Mahiwi Farm, a 708-hectare livestock operation located 35 minutes west of Wairoa. The farm offers a strong balance of breeding and finishing country, with clear potential for improved performance.

“This model is about opening the gate and creating opportunities for the next generation of Kiwi farmers.

“The benefits extend beyond individual farms. It supports local employment, develops skills in rural communities, and helps ensure that high-performing farms stay in Kiwi hands, contributing to a resilient and productive agricultural sector for the long term.

“By offering equity options, we’re providing real pathways for more New Zealanders to take ownership and shape their future on the land,” Mr Brown says.
