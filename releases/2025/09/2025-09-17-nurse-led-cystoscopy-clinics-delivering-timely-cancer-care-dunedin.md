A new nurse-led cystoscopy service at Dunedin Hospital is helping bladder cancer patients receive their essential follow-up care on time, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Bladder cancer requires lifelong, regular monitoring. Timely access to surveillance cystoscopies makes a real difference for patients and their families,” Mr Brown says.

“Two highly skilled nurses are now running a weekly flexible cystoscopy clinic, carrying out surveillance procedures that keep patients on track with their care while easing pressure on specialists. 

“Since the service began in November 2024, 290 patients have been seen, with all 150 patients on the planned surveillance programme receiving their cystoscopy on time. The nurses are now completing 10 to 15 follow-ups every week.”

Around 65 per cent of Dunedin’s current follow-up cystoscopy patients are suitable for the nurse-led service. Without this change, many patients would have been overdue, and additional specialist sessions would have been needed at locum rates.

Mr Brown says the model is not only improving access for patients but also making smarter use of the workforce.

“This is a fantastic example of innovation in our health system. It ensures patients are seen when they need to be, while also freeing up specialist doctors to focus on first specialist assessments and more complex procedures. That’s a win for patients and for the wider hospital system.

“It will also play an important role in achieving our faster cancer treatment target, by helping patients get the right tests sooner and enabling treatment to begin without unnecessary delay.”

Similar nurse-led models are already in place at Counties Manukau and Waitematā, where nurse practitioners provide both diagnostic and surveillance cystoscopies.

“This initiative shows the value of empowering our skilled nursing workforce. By making better use of their expertise, we are improving access to care, supporting our specialists, and making sure patients receive timely, quality treatment,” Mr Brown says.
