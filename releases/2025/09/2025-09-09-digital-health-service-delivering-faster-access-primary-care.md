More than 21,000 consultations have already been delivered through the Government’s new 24/7 digital health service launched in July, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This service is giving New Zealanders faster access to care when they can’t see their usual GP, helping them get the support they need, when they need it,” Mr Brown says.

In its first months, the service has:

- Delivered 21,740 consultations to 19,331 people across New Zealand.
- Been used most often when a timely GP appointment wasn’t available (71.6 per cent of bookings).
- Provided treatment for 83.5 per cent of patients, without needing an in-person GP follow-up.

“Most people were able to get answers and treatment straight away, easing pressure on emergency departments by addressing non-urgent issues earlier and in the right setting.

“This service is reaching people in every corner of the country, from our busiest cities to our smallest rural towns. That shows it is making a real difference for those who might otherwise face long waits or long drives just to see a doctor.”

Working-age adults and parents are the biggest users, with strong uptake among 20–39-year-olds and children under 10. It’s also being used across all communities, with every ethnicity well represented.

“This digital service provides easily accessible healthcare when it’s needed, bridging the gap when people might otherwise be left waiting, worrying, or unsure where to turn. For many families, that makes a real difference in their daily lives.

“Our Government is committed to ensuring every New Zealander can access timely, quality healthcare. Digital health solutions are a key part of delivering that,” Mr Brown says.
