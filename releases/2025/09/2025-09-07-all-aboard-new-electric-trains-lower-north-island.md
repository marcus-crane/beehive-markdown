The Government’s $802.9 million investment into the Wairarapa and Manawatū rail lines has now reached a major milestone, with Greater Wellington Regional Council today signing a contract for a new fleet of 18 battery electric multiple unit (BEMU) trains, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“French multinational rail transport systems manufacturer, Alstom, has been selected to deliver 18 state-of-the-art battery-electric trains, the first to operate in New Zealand. The new train fleet will significantly improve travel times and passenger experience on the Wairarapa and Manawatū lines,” Mr Bishop says.

“These new trains will replace the ageing diesel locomotive-hauled fleet which dates back to the 1970s and has frustrated commuters for years. They will deliver faster, more frequent and more reliable services for passengers travelling between Wellington, the Wairarapa and the Manawatū.

“This upgrade will enable the doubling of peak services on both lines and additional off-peak services. We expect up to 15-minute travel time savings for commuters between Wellington and Masterton, and increased speeds on the Wairarapa line.

“These modern battery electric trains will deliver real benefits for commuters, increase productivity, support economic growth, and allow Kiwis to get where they need to go quickly and safely.

“Delivering reliable, effective, and efficient public transport is a priority for our Government. We campaigned on delivering the Lower North Island Rail Integrated Mobility Programme (LNIRIM) to improve service reliability, provide more travel choices for commuters, and reduce congestion on our roads – and I’m pleased to see this progress.”

The Government is funding approximately 90% of the costs for the procurement of the trains and infrastructure upgrades on the two lines, with the remainder funded by two regional councils, Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) and Horizons Regional Council (HRC).

Greater Wellington chair Daran Ponter says Alstom was selected through a robust, two-stage global procurement process.

“With a focus on providing passengers with comfortable and accessible rail journeys, we welcome Alstom to the LNIRIM programme to design and build trains for New Zealand conditions and to maintain the fleet for 35 years,” Cr Ponter says.

“Designed for New Zealand conditions, the new trains switch to batteries on tracks without overhead power, using technology proven in countries like Japan and Germany.”

Horizons chair Rachel Keedwell says the new train fleet will be named ‘Tūhono’, meaning ‘to connect or unite’, representing how urban centres and regional communities will be better connected.

“Tūhono trains will help our regions thrive by improving access to work, education and recreation for heartland New Zealand,” Cr Keedwell says.

The new trains are scheduled to enter service from 2030.
