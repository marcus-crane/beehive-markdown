Immigration Minister Erica Stanford will head to the United States this week to lead a delegation of immigration and investment private sector participants to promote our Active Investor Plus visa, with events hosted by Invest NZ who have organised the delegation.

“Since our changes were implemented on 1 April, the Active investor Plus visa has generated significant new proposed investment in New Zealand of over $1 billion, with US investors submitting the most applications. 

“Heading to the US will provide an opportunity to meet with potential investors who want to know more about what New Zealand has to offer.

“We’ve said that New Zealand is open for business, and investor migrants are clearly attracted to our growing reputation as a safe, pro-business, high-potential economy.

“Attracting investment to New Zealand is crucial to boosting economic growth. It will also support our businesses to expand, hire and grow – and that means more opportunities for New Zealanders.

“It’s fantastic to see this response so far. We welcome investors’ capital, knowledge, contribution to New Zealand’s economic growth, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet with them.”

The delegation will travel to meet potential investors in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco at events hosted by Invest NZ.

Minister Stanford will travel to the United States on 15 September and return on 21 September.
