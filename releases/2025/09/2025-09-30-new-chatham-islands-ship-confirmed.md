The Government has confirmed the company that will procure a new Chatham Islands supply vessel, in a significant milestone which will see it operational in 2027.

The joint venture of McCallum Bros Ltd and Nova Marine Carriers SA (MBL JV) will supply a new 78 metre ship, designed to service the bespoke needs of the Chatham Islands community, Associate Transport Minister James Meager says.

“Contract negotiations will ensure the Chathams have a secure, reliable, long-term service which maintains or exceeds current levels, and has capacity to grow alongside the Island,” Mr Meager says. 

“This represents a major step in the progress of a replacement supply vessel, which is a vital economic and community lifeline for the Chatham Islands.

“At nearly 40 years old, the current Southern Tiare is older than I am and is nearing the end of its commercial life. Increasing unreliability and high maintenance costs have created significant hardship for a community which relies on it to import and export critical supplies.

“MBL JV’s practical, future-focused proposal meets locals needs, and ensures a reliable service which can be scaled-up to support future increased demand. It also gave us the greatest confidence a new ship can be delivered in-budget before the current vessel retires, without substantial upgrades required to existing infrastructure.” 

Mr Meager made the announcement as part of a two-day trip to the Chatham Islands, where he is visiting local businesses and community groups.

“It is important for Ministers to connect with the community in-person and reaffirm our Government’s commitment to supporting Chatham Islanders,” Mr Meager says.

“Due to the unreliability of the Southern Tiare we’ve seen examples of petrol running out, diesel supplies nearly exhausted, and livestock unable to be moved resulting in widespread culls. This deeply impacts livelihoods and wellbeing and must be resolved.

“This new service will support the Chatham’s economy, particularly fishing, farming, and tourism, and ensure essential supplies continue to reach the community for at least the next two decades.”
