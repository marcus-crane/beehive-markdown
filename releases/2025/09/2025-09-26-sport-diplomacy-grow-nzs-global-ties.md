Sport will play a bigger role in strengthening New Zealand’s international ties, boosting trade, and showcasing our country to the world under a new Government strategy launched today, Associate Sport & Recreation Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Sport is a universal language. It opens doors, builds trust, and connects people in ways traditional diplomacy can’t. We’ve all seen how a game of rugby, cricket, or hockey can create bonds between nations that go well beyond sport itself.

“New Zealanders are rightly proud of our Kiwi athletes and teams who perform so brilliantly on the world stage. Now we’re backing our country’s sporting strengths to advance New Zealand’s interests overseas.

“The Sport Diplomacy Strategy, released today, will use our proud sporting reputation to grow international connections, support our goal of doubling exports over the next decade, and develop ties with countries across the world.

“The Strategy’s initial focus is on India, the Pacific, and the United States. These are markets where we can deliver strong diplomatic, and economic results - and where sport can make a real difference as we grow these relationships and open up new opportunities for New Zealand exporters and businesses.

“This work builds on successes such as the Prime Minister’s trade mission to India earlier this year, where sport played a central role. That visit saw the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation in Sports between Sport New Zealand and India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.

“In 2026 we’ll mark 100 years of sporting ties between India and New Zealand with a series of major events and tours. Cricket, hockey, and other sports will bring Kiwi and Indian communities together to celebrate our shared history and future.

“The centenary celebration with India will be far more than a series of sporting events; it will be a nationwide programme of sport, culture, business, and diplomacy.

“New Zealanders know that sport isn’t just about what happens on the field - it’s about the friendships, trust, and connections that last long after the final whistle.

“By working together across government, the Sport Diplomacy Strategy will deliver for our athletes and sporting bodies, while also boosting trade, tourism, education, and investment.

“It’s about using sport to strengthen New Zealand’s place in the world and build a more prosperous future.
