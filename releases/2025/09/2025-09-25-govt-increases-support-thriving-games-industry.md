Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti has announced more support for early-stage game studios and startups, to boost New Zealand’s fast-growing game development sector.

From 2026, the Government will provide an additional $2.75 million a year to the Centre of Digital Excellence (CODE) – twice their current funding. This will support more prototype, production, and travel grants for emerging game developers.

“New Zealand’s game developers are creating world-class products and jobs while generating hundreds of millions in export earnings,” Dr Reti says.

“CODE’s support for our gaming sector is highly successful. Typically, for every 1,000 pitches to publishers, in recent years only 1.6 per cent are securing signing deals. On the other hand, studios supported by CODE have an incredibly success rate of 40 per cent.

“CODE’s programmes currently receive twice as many applications as they can fund. By doubling funding for CODE we’re backing our innovators to grow faster and reach global markets.”

The industry earned $513 million in 2024 and is projected to surpass $750 million in 2025, with revenue on track to hit $1 billion by 2027 – mostly from overseas sales.

Employment grew 29% last year – creating 321 more jobs – with studios like Grinding Gear Games and PikPok leading the way.

“This is about more than games – it’s about high-tech jobs, export growth and putting New Zealand creativity on the world stage,” Dr Reti says.
