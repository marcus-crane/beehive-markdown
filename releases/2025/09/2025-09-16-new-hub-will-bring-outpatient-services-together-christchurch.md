The refurbishment of Christchurch Hospital’s new Ambulatory Care Hub is now complete, with services beginning to transition into the new space, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This $4.7 million hub marks a major step forward for outpatient care in Canterbury, making it easier for patients to access the services they need from one location,” Mr Brown says.

Following the relocation of the Emergency Department to the Waipapa building in 2020, the ground floor of Parkside Block A has been repurposed to create an integrated Ambulatory Care Hub.

“The hub brings six key outpatient services together in one location: the Medical and Oncology Day Units, Respiratory Physiology, Sleep Services, ECG, and Neurophysiology. It also includes a dedicated diagnostic centre, providing essential respiratory, EEG, and sleep studies in a coordinated and patient-friendly environment.

“Bringing these services together creates a smoother, more coordinated experience for patients. They can move between appointments more easily, and staff will be able to provide care more efficiently. 

“The Oncology Day Unit will also benefit from additional infusion chairs, boosting capacity and ensuring patients begin cancer treatment on time, supporting the Government’s target of delivering faster cancer care.

“A new drop-off area at the front of the building will also ensure convenient access for patients and their families.

“This is what smart, patient-focused health infrastructure looks like. We are committed to building a health system that delivers for New Zealanders, ensuring people can access the outpatient care they need, when and where they need it,” Mr Brown says.
