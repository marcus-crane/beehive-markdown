Minister for Trade and Investment, and Agriculture Todd McClay will lead a high-level delegation of 21 New Zealand businesses to Riyadh this coming week to promote and strengthen trade and investment ties with Saudi Arabia.

“This mission will raise the profile of New Zealand businesses in a market predicted to be the 6th largest global economy by 2050 with enormous long-term potential, building partnerships that can deliver growth, jobs, and prosperity on both sides,” Mr McClay says.

“Saudi Arabia is one of the most dynamic markets in the Middle East worth USD$2.8 trillion and is driving one of the largest global transformations and rebuild programmes through its Vision 2030 strategy,” Mr McClay says.

“This mission will showcase the very best of what New Zealand has to offer —safe, high-quality food and beverage, innovative agricultural expertise, world-leading construction and technology solutions, and a creative sector that is globally recognised.

The Government is ambitious about doubling the value of New Zealand’s exports in 10 years, unlocking new opportunities for Kiwi exporters, and supporting Saudi Arabia in their food security and development goals.

Saudi Arabia is already one of New Zealand’s largest and fastest-growing export destinations in the Middle East. Exports have more than doubled in four years, from $620 million in June 2021 to $1.35 billion in June 2025 bringing two-way trade to $1.58 billion.
