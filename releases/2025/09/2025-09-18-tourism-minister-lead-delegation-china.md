Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston will travel to China on Monday to lead an industry delegation on a tourism-focused trade mission.

The delegation will travel to Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing to meet with Chinese airlines, e-commerce platforms and tourism industry professionals.

“The mission will promote New Zealand’s tourism sector, meet with local travel-trade businesses and organisations to better understand the Chinese market, and strengthen our relationship with China,” Louise Upston says.

“China is New Zealand’s third largest tourism market, with nearly 250,000 arrivals in the year ending July 2025.

“This mission will build on the positive momentum of the Prime Minister’s visit in June. It will strengthen the relationships we’ve developed with key trade partners and promote New Zealand as a fantastic year-round destination.”

The Minister will also travel to Beijing to meet with Minister of Culture and Tourism, Sun Yeli. 

Industry delegates are from the aviation, accommodation and hospitality, cruise and visitor attraction sectors, as well as tour operators.

“This mission also builds on our efforts to increase the number of Chinese visitors to New Zealand, by making it quicker, easier and cheaper for Chinese nationals to come to New Zealand via Australia from November, if they hold an eligible Australian visa,” Louise Upston says.

“New Zealand visitor visa offerings for Chinese nationals are more generous than other groups of travellers, reflecting the importance of the relationship with China.

“Most Chinese visitors receive a five-year multiple entry visitor visa, making it easier for Chinese visitors to return to New Zealand. Average processing times for Chinese visas are currently the fastest they’ve ever been at five working days.

“Smoothing their passage to New Zealand will help us grow the economy by boosting the tourism sector, connecting friends and family, and strengthening trade and business relationships.”

The Minister and her delegation will be in China from September 23-27.
