Finance Minister Nicola Willis today announced the appointment of Hayley Gourley to the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

The MPC is the independent decision-making body responsible for setting the Official Cash Rate (OCR), which influences interest rates and plays a critical role in maintaining price stability in New Zealand.

“Hayley Gourley brings extensive experience across corporate, rural, and financial services sectors to the role. Her roles at both board and executive level in leading agribusinesses provide her with a unique perspective that will enhance the Committee’s discussions.

“Ms Gourley’s appointment follows the recommendation of the Reserve Bank’s Board. She will begin her four-year term on 1 October 2025, succeeding Professor Bob Buckle, who will retire from the MPC at the end of September 2025.

“I want to acknowledge Professor Buckle’s significant contributions to the MPC. I thank him for his dedicated service and the expertise he has brought to the role.”
