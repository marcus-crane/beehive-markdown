The Government is making changes to New Zealand’s universities to give students the best possible opportunities, making sure they’re developing the skilled workforce New Zealand needs and driving cutting-edge research that powers economic growth.

Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti today announced a package of initiatives to modernise the sector and ensure taxpayer investment delivers real impact for New Zealanders.

“Our universities are world-class – in the top three per cent globally – but they must evolve to meet the demands of a fast-changing society and economy,” Dr Reti says. 

“These changes will help universities focus on what matters: developing the workforce we need now and in the future, and delivering excellent research and innovation that creates real value for New Zealand.”

The initiatives include:

- **A new Tertiary Education Strategy**, aligning teaching and research with New Zealand’s future skills and innovation needs.
- **A University Strategy Group** to strengthen collaboration between universities, government, industry and global experts.
- **A simplified Tertiary Research Excellence Fund** to replace the $315 million Performance-Based Research Fund – cutting red tape while rewarding quality teaching and impactful research.
- **Stronger quality assurance systems** to maintain academic excellence, support international competitiveness, and enhance student mobility.
- **Updated governance and accountability rules** to ensure universities are well-led and focused on quality teaching and qualifications.

Dr Reti says the reforms will set universities up to compete on the world stage while ensuring research investment supports economic growth and delivers benefits at home.

“These changes are about working together, simplifying where it makes sense, and strengthening leadership and quality,” says Dr Reti.

“Collectively, they will make sure our universities continue to deliver opportunities for students, impact for businesses, and growth for New Zealand’s economy.”

The new initiatives have been informed by a report by the University Advisory Group, led by Chair Sir Peter Gluckman. 

They will be rolled out in consultation with universities, other tertiary education organisations, students and industry, with further details to come in the months ahead.
