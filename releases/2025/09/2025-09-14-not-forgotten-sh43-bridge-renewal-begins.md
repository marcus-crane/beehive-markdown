Construction on a new bridge replacement on State Highway 43 (SH43) the Forgotten World Highway will get underway this month, kicking off a raft of priority bridge replacements across the country, says Transport Minister Chris Bishop.

“In the next two years, 13 bridges and culverts right across the country will either be replaced or receive significant renewal work. This is an increase on the nine bridges and culverts which originally formed this project to replace priority bridges,” Mr Bishop says.

“Replacing and renewing these bridges and culverts is an important step in bridging the gap between old infrastructure and a modern, resilient transport network for people and freight.

“Kururau Stream Water Drive, between Taumarunui and Whangamōmona, is the first of these bridges to begin construction.

“The SH43 Forgotten World Highway is an iconic back country journey and is an important route for tourism in New Zealand. Because of the remote nature of the Forgotten World Highway, taking alternative routes can also add significant time to journeys. This bridge replacement will ensure locals and visitors can continue to use this highway efficiently in future.

“The Kururau Stream Water Drive on SH43 is a hand dug culvert tunnelled through soft, sedimentary rock. At around 80 years old, it’s an example of early local engineering. However, the structure has suffered natural erosion over time, leading to the need for a more reliable replacement for the state highway network.

“Construction on a new 20-metre bridge at the SH43 Kururau Stream Water Drive location is expected to begin later this month. The new modern, resilient bridge will be built over an 8-month period and will bypass the current ageing water drive structure with an improved alignment. This project is expected to cost around $3.6 million.

“The work to repair or upgrade many end-of-life bridges and culverts was given the green light by NZ Transport Agency in July last year. Since that announcement, a further four priority locations have been added to the list, and NZTA has worked through the design, consenting, and contracting so construction can start.

“Many of these culverts or bridges are important connections between rural communities and are vital routes for industry, freight and tourism.

“Increasing productivity and economic growth is a key priority for this Government, and with many bridges across the country requiring speed and weight restrictions due to their age and condition, it is essential these bridges are replaced with more modern and resilient structures.

“Our state highways are critical routes for freight and tourism and serve as important lifelines for communities around New Zealand. We expect our state highway bridges to be well maintained and managed and that’s why this replacement and maintenance work is so crucial.

“I look forward to seeing work on the Kururau Stream Water Drive Bridge get underway.”
