Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health Matt Doocey and Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson are in Te Kūiti today as part of the Rural Health Roadshow.

“Te Kūiti is the tenth roadshow stop. I started the roadshow in Levin and have since visited Wairoa, Wānaka, Ōamaru, Hanmer Springs, Gore, Tūrangi, Kaitaia and I was in Hāwera yesterday,” Mr Doocey says.

“These roadshows are an opportunity for me to hear direct feedback from rural communities, like Te Kūiti and those who are working in rural health about what’s working well and where the barriers may be. It is also a great opportunity to hear how well the Rural Health Strategy is being implemented.

“Te Kūiti is home to one of six rural urgent care prototypes being rolled out across the country this year. Each prototype will test practical improvements to rural services, such as improved access to diagnostics, on-call pharmacy support, and digital tools to back up rural clinicians.

“Access to healthcare is one of the biggest concerns for people living in rural and remote areas. Budget 2025 invested $164 million over four years to strengthen urgent and after-hours care nationwide, meaning 98 per cent of Kiwis will be able to access these services within one hour’s drive of their home.

“The funding includes targeted support for more than 70 rural and remote communities, including extended after-hours, 24/7 on-call in-person clinical support and improved access to diagnostics and medicines.

“All New Zealanders deserve timely access to quality care, and this Government is committed to improving health and mental health outcomes, including for the one in five people living in rural communities,” Mr Patterson says.

“I’m looking forward to meeting with people in Te Kūiti and hearing firsthand about their experiences with healthcare in their community. It’s important we understand both the challenges and the opportunities so we can work together to improve access and outcomes in the rural setting.”
