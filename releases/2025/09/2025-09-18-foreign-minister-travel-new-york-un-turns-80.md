Foreign Minister Winston Peters is travelling to New York this weekend to attend the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

“The 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is an important moment for reflection about the state of the international, rules-based system that New Zealand has long championed,” Mr Peters says. 

“New Zealand was a founding member of the United Nations and we have always argued that all states - no matter their size - should have a say in how the world operates. But there is no doubt that the scale, complexity and persistence of the challenges facing the world are putting immense stress and strain on the United Nations. New Zealand, working with partners, needs to continue to press for reforms to ensure the United Nations can rise to the world’s challenges as humanity enters the second quarter of the 21st Century.” 

While in New York, Mr Peters will attend the Two State Solution conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, participate in a number of thematic and geographic events, hold a range of bilateral meetings with Foreign Minister counterparts and senior UN officials, and deliver New Zealand’s national statement to the UN General Assembly.

“Major conflicts - including in Ukraine, Gaza, South Sudan and Myanmar - loom large as world leaders gather in New York next week. Our time in New York will be an ideal opportunity to gather information about how a broad range of partners are viewing and tackling the challenges facing the world - to help inform our own policy positions on a number of issues. 

“This includes the complex issue of the recognition of Palestine, which New Zealand has approached cautiously and deliberately over months. Next week’s engagements will help us to finalise New Zealand’s position on this important issue, drawing on the latest available information.”

Mr Peters departs for New York on Sunday 21 September, and will return to New Zealand on Tuesday 30 September.
