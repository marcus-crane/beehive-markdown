Communities in Gisborne, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Lakes, and Taranaki are seeing shorter waits and faster treatment, the latest health target results show, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Healthcare performance in the Midland region is turning a corner. We are continuing to put patients first to ensure more patients can access timely, quality care close to home,” Mr Brown says.

These quarterly results mark the first annual milestone toward our 2030 targets. Key improvements in the Midland region from April to June include:

- **Faster cancer treatment:** 92.4% of cancer patients starting treatment within 31 days, with Waikato up 12.6 percentage points and Bay of Plenty up 5.1 from the previous quarter.
- **Childhood immunisations:** 75.1% of children fully immunised by age two, with Waikato up 3.8 percentage points, Lakes up 1.3, Bay of Plenty up 7.7, Taranaki up 2.2, and Gisborne up 6.4 from the previous quarter.
- **Shorter stays in emergency departments:** 76.8% of patients admitted, transferred, or discharged from emergency departments within six hours, with Waikato up 6.3 percentage points, Lakes up 1.4, Bay of Plenty up 5.7, and Taranaki up 5.9 from the same time last year, despite increased attendances.

Waitlists for elective procedures and first specialist assessments (FSAs) are also improving.

“In the last quarter alone, thousands more patients across the North Island received hip and knee replacements, cardiology appointments, and cataract surgery,” Mr Brown says.

The latest figures show that in several districts, more patients are being seen within four months for FSAs and elective procedures compared to the previous quarter:

“These results mean more people are returning to their daily lives sooner. We thank our doctors, nurses, and other frontline staff whose daily commitment makes this improvement possible.

“While progress is being made, too many people are still waiting too long. Our focus is on continuing to reduce waitlists so more patients get the care they need.

“Backed by a record $30 billion annual investment into health, our Government is rebuilding the system around patients, holding it accountable for performance, and driving better outcomes.”
