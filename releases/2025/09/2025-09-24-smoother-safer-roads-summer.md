Another busy summer season of road maintenance and renewals means everyone will enjoy the benefits of smoother roads thanks to the Government’s record investment in state highway maintenance and pothole prevention, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“NZTA’s annual state highway renewal programme is already underway, continuing delivery of the largest-ever investment into road rebuilding and resealing. This has been made possible through ring-fenced investment of $2.07 billion for pothole prevention, focusing investment into road and drainage maintenance and renewals.

“The overall volume of more than 2,100 lane kilometres of newly rebuilt or resealed roads will be similar to last summer. A significant portion – almost 300 lane kilometres – of this is dedicated to delivering new roads, replacing end of life seals and pavements with brand new materials that will last.

“Continuing our focus on rebuilding roads will reduce the number of potholes appearing on the state highway network during winter months, ensuring that New Zealanders experience stress-free travel year-round. After tripling delivery to over 300 lane kilometres last summer, producing the same result again this summer keeps the foot on the accelerator as NZTA continues working to improve the overall condition of the state highway network.”

Regions with significant programmes of new road building include Taranaki, West Coast, the coastal Otago area that includes Dunedin and Oamaru, and Southland. All of these regions will receive more than 20 lane kilometres of new roads. The innovative Tīrau to Waiouru programme is also continuing this year, with a mixture of road rebuilding and asphalt surfacing already underway in multiple locations. 

“We’re hearing that the travelling public is seeing and experiencing the difference this investment is making. Providing a safe, smooth and resilient state highway network that helps increase productivity by unlocking economic growth is a key priority for this government.

“Additionally, NZTA has adopted new risk-based traffic management guidance across all maintenance contracts, ensuring this work will be delivered effectively and efficiently - and with the right number of cones and signs for the work at hand. This will minimise disruption across the network while these works take place – often at times when many of us are finishing our Christmas shopping or taking our summer holidays.”
