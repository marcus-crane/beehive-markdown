Associate Agriculture Minister Mark Patterson travels to China today to the 36th Nanjing Wool Market Conference to promote New Zealand’s premium strong wool.

“China is New Zealand’s largest wool market, In the year ending 30 June 2025, we exported $446 million worth of wool, with $176 million going to China.” Mr Patterson says.

The Nanjing Wool Market Conference is China's leading and longest-running conference on wool, attended by all the world’s major market players.

“New Zealand has a great story around the innovation, sustainability, integrity and quality of our premium strong wool. This means we’re well placed to meet consumer demand in China for premium wool products.

“This opportunity brings together industry representatives, wool growers and processors, and trade experts to foster cooperation and promote and build on the commitment of the coalition Government to ensure the future success of New Zealand’s wool.

“Attending this global event is a valuable opportunity to strengthen relationships and discuss ways to grow New Zealand’s and China’s wool sectors.”

Mr Patterson will also meet with New Zealand wool businesses operating in China.

“This Government is committed to champion New Zealand’s wool sector, grow exports and return more to value to Kiwi farmers, processors, and manufacturers.

We’ve reopened the world’s largest wool processing facility in Napier following a $50 million rebuild, marking a major step forward for the industry.

We also drove changes that resulted in Kāinga Ora committing to using woollen carpets in new state homes.”

Minister Patterson will be in Shanghai and Nanjing China from 17–21 September.
