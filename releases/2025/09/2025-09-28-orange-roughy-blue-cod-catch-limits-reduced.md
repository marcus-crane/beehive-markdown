Catch limits for Chatham Rise and southern New Zea­­land orange roughy will be more than halved to support sustainability following a careful scientific assessment and public consultation, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

The changes are included in a suite of catch limit changes as part of a regular sustainability review. Reduced catch limits for three blue cod stocks, as well as increases for blue mackerel, rig, snapper and gemfish are also among the changes.

“The latest scientific information shows the Chatham Rise and southern New Zealand orange roughy fishery is under pressure, which is why I have decided to significantly reduce limits to allow the stock to recover,” Mr Jones says.

The total catch for the Chatham Rise and southern New Zealand orange roughy fishery will be reduced from 4995 to 2349 tonnes. As part of this limit, the east and south Chatham Rise sub-area will have a voluntary catch limit of 324 tonnes, down from the previous voluntary limit of 2755 tonnes.

“I have notified the industry that I expect it to adhere to the reduced voluntary catch limits in the east and south Chatham Rise area of the fishery, which has been identified as facing the most acute depletion of orange roughy.

“It is clear we need more good information to support future decisions about orange roughy. Officials will investigate additional options that will protect orange roughy spawning areas in the east and south of the Chatham Rise and provide me with advice on this in early 2026.”

Mr Jones has also decided to reduce catch limits for three blue cod fisheries that are under pressure, including reductions to recreational daily bag limits.

The blue cod changes include:

- Taranaki to Wellington commercial catch reduces from 34 to five tonnes and the recreational daily limit lowered to two blue cod per fisher per day.
- East coast of the South Island commercial catch limit reduces from 130 to 99 tonnes, and the recreational daily bag limit reduces to 10 blue cod per fisher per day.
- Southland recreational catch limit reduces to 10 blue cod per fisher per day.

Following public feedback, officials will engage further with recreational fishing organisations, tangata whenua and commercial fishers to determine if any wider changes are needed to how blue cod fisheries are managed.

“The twice-yearly reviews ensure our fisheries are sustainable, and when required we look at reducing catch limits. Equally, when fish stocks can sustainably support more fishing, fishers benefit through higher catch limits,” Mr Jones says.

“Many of our fisheries are thriving. Increasing catch limits for these means more fish on our plates and supermarkets, more export income, and security for the jobs our seafood industry supports around the country.

“Stocks included in the review that have had their catch limits increased include blue mackerel on the west coast of the North and South Islands, southern gemfish, rig, and snapper on the West Coast and top of the South Island.

“I want to acknowledge everyone who provided feedback as part of this sustainability review. The submissions from a wide range of people and groups played an important part in the advice I received and the decisions I have made.”
