The Government will provide a $50k injection to Nelson Tasman for domestic tourism marketing, giving a much-needed boost to local businesses following severe weather events, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“We know the region was hit hard by the severe weather and flooding events in June and July, and this has had a significant impact on local tourism and hospitality businesses,” Louise Upston says.

“According to a survey of tourism and hospitality businesses, almost 70 per cent have lost revenue through cancellations and an unexpected drop in visitors.”

“That’s why I’m pleased to announce the Government is providing this funding to ensure tourism continues to thrive in the region.”

The funding will be used for a domestic marketing campaign, showcasing all that the region has to offer.

“Domestic tourism is really important for the Nelson Tasman region, as it directly supports tourism and hospitality businesses, jobs and the local economy,” Louise Upston says.

“While there are a few localised areas which are still recovering from the weather events, the majority of the region is up and running, ready to welcome visitors over the spring and summer period.

“Nelson Tasman is open for business and we encourage Kiwis to go and enjoy some of the excellent experiences and hospitality of the region.”

The funding comes from the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy.
