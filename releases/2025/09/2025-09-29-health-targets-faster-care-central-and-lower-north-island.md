Patients in Wellington, the Manawatū, Hawke’s Bay, and Wairarapa are benefiting from faster treatment and shorter waits, the latest health target results show, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Healthcare performance in the Central region is improving steadily. Our focus remains on putting patients first and making sure more people get access to timely, quality healthcare," Mr Brown says.

These quarterly results mark the first annual milestone toward our 2030 targets. Key improvements in the Central region from April to June include:

- **Faster cancer treatment:** 86% of cancer patients starting treatment within 31 days, with Wairarapa up 6.4 percentage points and Hutt Valley up 4.9 from the previous quarter.
- **Childhood immunisations:** 83.9% of children fully immunised by age two, with Wairarapa up 1.8 percentage points and Hutt Valley up 7.5 from the previous quarter.
- **Shorter stays in emergency departments:** 65.3% of patients admitted, transferred, or discharged from emergency departments within six hours, with Whanganui up 1.6 percentage points, Hawke’s Bay up 1.9, MidCentral up 3.2, Wairarapa up 16.2, Hutt Valley up 7.2, and Capital and Coast up 4.4 from the same time last year, despite increased attendances.

Progress is also being made in reducing waitlists for elective procedures and first specialist assessments (FSAs).

“In the last quarter alone, thousands more patients across the Central region received the care they needed – from hip and knee replacements to cardiology and cataract surgeries, Mr Brown says.

The latest figures show that in several districts, more patients are being seen within four months for FSAs and elective procedures compared to the previous quarter:

“These improvements mean people are getting back to work and everyday life faster. We thank our doctors, nurses, and other frontline staff whose daily commitment makes this improvement possible,” Mr Brown says.

“While progress is being made, too many people are still waiting too long. Our focus is on continuing to reduce waitlists so more patients get the care they need.

“Backed by a record $30 billion annual investment into health, our Government is rebuilding the system around patients, holding it accountable for performance, and driving better outcomes.”
