Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced that New Zealand is lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil, joining Canada, the EU, and the UK.

“Lowering the price cap from USD $60 per barrel to USD $47.60 is a calculated step to curtail crucial oil revenues fuelling Putin’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,” Mr Peters says.

New Zealand has also sanctioned Russian actors involved in cyber-attacks against Ukraine. This includes Russia’s military intelligence, Unit 29155 of the General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate.

“Russian state actors have been illegally using malware against Ukrainian government networks.

“This is New Zealand’s 32nd round of sanctions. It targets 19 individuals and entities, and 19 vessels.

“We’re sanctioning actors involved in chemical weapons and disinformation, as well as shadow fleet vessels, alternative payment providers, and third-country facilitators in North Korea and Iran.”

Since the Russia Sanctions Act came into effect in March 2022, New Zealand has designated more than 1900 individuals, entities, and shipping vessels, alongside a series of trade measures.
