New proposals for a long-term approach to manage high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, commonly known as Bird flu, aim to reduce the impacts on poultry if the virus arrives here, says Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard.

“This virus is spreading rapidly across the world. If it arrives here, it will almost certainly establish itself in wild birds and could spread to poultry and other wildlife.”

“That could mean shortages of chicken and eggs for Kiwi families, serious animal welfare issues, and costs for farmers and growers. Our focus is on protecting people’s livelihoods and keeping food on the table.”

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is leading work to prepare for the possible arrival of HPAI H5N1, along with the Department of Conservation, the Ministry of Health, Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora, the poultry industry and local government.

Consultation opens today on proposals to manage HPAI H5N1 in poultry, including:

•    a requirement for commercial poultry operators to have an avian biosecurity control programme in place that sets out how their business will prevent and manage a potential H5N1 outbreak   
•    a requirement for poultry operators/owners to meet appropriate biosecurity standards, including standards for activities such as depopulation, disposal, cleaning and disinfection  
•    a requirement for operators/owners to keep records and provide information when required   
•    a requirement that avian biosecurity programmes be audited to ensure they are fit for purpose  
•    establishing offences and penalties (fines) for those who do not comply with the regulations.

“Since it emerged in 2020, the virus has spread across the globe except to Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific. Our efforts so far have paid off, we need to keep it that way.”

“We need a long-term approach to managing the disease that incentivises good biosecurity practices and early reporting of infection, protects human health and the domestic food supply, and provides for consistent standards across the industry.”

Some of the proposed regulations could also apply to semi-commercial poultry operators and non-commercial poultry owners – people who keep poultry but not as a main source of income. For example, these poultry owners could be required to use specific disposal or cleaning methods and provide information to MPI if their birds get sick.

“We know these proposals are likely to involve costs and other impacts for commercial poultry operators. We want to hear from farmers and growers about how the proposals could affect their businesses, so we can understand the impact of these costs.”

“By working together now we can reduce the risks of bird flu preventing food shortages, affecting people’s livelihoods, and endangering health outcomes. This is your chance to help make sure New Zealand is ready.”

Consultation will run for six weeks from 17 September 2025 to 2 November 2025.
