Patients attending Whanganui Hospital’s onsite dental unit will now benefit from a modernised and upgraded facility following a refurbishment, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The refurbished dental unit provides a brighter, more welcoming and accessible space for patients and families, ensuring the community can receive timely, quality oral healthcare in an appropriate environment,” Mr Brown says.

“The old space was outdated and cramped. The upgraded unit now has an enlarged waiting room to better accommodate a growing number of patients, along with a dedicated area for those receiving IV sedation.

“Access throughout the clinic has been improved for wheelchair users, while the reception area and front desk have been reconfigured to enhance both patient flow and safety from the moment patients arrive.

“A new recovery space has been created for patients who require sedation. This will support the growing number of patients being treated under IV sedation in the dental unit, which has reduced the need for general anaesthetic procedures and helped shorten that waitlist.

“Two dental rooms have also been modernised with new cabinetry and equipment, enabling staff to deliver care more efficiently and safely.”

To ensure treatment continued during the building works, a mobile dental unit was available on site for patients.

“With a new dentist now working regularly in the unit, more patients are now being seen. This refurbishment will ensure it can keep pace with the needs of the community.

“This Government is committed to delivering modern, fit-for-purpose health facilities that improve access to care. Whanganui’s dental unit upgrade is another example of our focus on ensuring patients receive care in the right setting.”
