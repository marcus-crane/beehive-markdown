A joint effort to build new accommodation in Buller using local labour, local procurement and local businesses has been warmly welcomed by Regional Development Minister Shane Jones.

Mr Jones officially opened the 10 units at Reefton Campground today.

The units are the result of a partnership between Buller District Council, Development West Coast and Endura (formerly Federation Mining).

“These units, which will ultimately increase Reefton’s accommodation offerings for locals and tourists, are a shining example of what can be achieved when private and public bodies work collaboratively for the betterment of their region.

“An understanding of what it takes to get things done, easing the regulatory path and a shared vision for the result, and we now have a brilliantly executed local asset,” Mr Jones says.

“If all councils and local bodies could work like this in co-operation with industries that seek to lift up the local economies in which they do business, imagine what could be achieved.”

The build provided employment for 50 local workers, and many West Coast businesses were involved, boosting the local economy.

Endura, which contributed $350,000 to the project, will lease the community-owned units for its staff working on the Snowy River mining project for at least three years. Thery will eventually be used for visitor accommodation, supporting the booming local tourism industry.

While in Reefton today, Mr Jones also visited the Reefton Powerhouse, a historic small-scale hydro scheme that has been restored, supporting the town and district and providing a new tourism attraction. 

Mr Jones also toured Reefton Distilling Co, a highly successful business established with the support of the former Provincial Growth Fund.
