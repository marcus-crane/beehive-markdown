The New Zealand Army is set to receive a suite of hi-tech digital communications devices and systems to help it protect our country and our people, Defence Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“In a volatile global environment with rapid technological change, it is imperative our soldiers are combat capable, lethal, deployable and interoperable with international partners,” Ms Collins says.

The $104 million investment covers military grade radio systems for Army personnel, along with deployable network infrastructure such as ground-based satellite technologies and servers.

“This war-fighting equipment will be modern, fit-for-purpose, secure and resilient, and ready to roll-out from 2027. The project is a significant milestone in the multi-phased Network Enabled Army programme, which is focused on enhancing the combat capability of our soldiers, making them safer.

“Specialised communications devices will help personnel make faster, more accurate decisions through the use of real-time information and secure voice and data communications.

“Some of the communications equipment currently used by our soldiers is more than 20 years old. “Upgraded radio systems and improved network capabilities will support communications and information sharing between deployed units, coalition partners, government agencies and NZDF commanders, whether they be overseas on military operations or at Defence Headquarters in New Zealand.

“This investment was included in the 2025 Defence Capability Plan, which outlined planned commitments worth $12 billion over the next four years and doubles our defence spending by 2032/33, as we pull our weight in a rapidly changing world.”
