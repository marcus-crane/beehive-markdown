Up to $300,000 of contestable funding is now available to support community events celebrating our national day and commemorating the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“The Commemorating Waitangi Day Fund supports community groups as they reflect on our shared history and the contributions of all cultures represented in New Zealand today.

“It supports events that bring New Zealanders together to recognise and celebrate all aspects of our national identity, on our national day, including the Treaty of Waitangi and its signing.

“This is a day that should be commemorated not only at Waitangi where the Treaty was first signed, but throughout the country – recognising that the Treaty itself travelled across our country.

“Many well-established events are delivered by communities across the country each year, which are treasured by the thousands of New Zealanders who attend them. New applicants are always welcome and encouraged to propose new ways for New Zealanders to participate in Waitangi Day events in their community.

“I encourage community groups, tangata whenua, and local councils to work together to organise local events that bring people and community together on our national day.”

Applications for the Fund are now open and close on Monday 20 October 2025.
