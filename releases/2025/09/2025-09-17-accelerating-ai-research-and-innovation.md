Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti has announced a major investment in AI research to build New Zealand’s AI capability, fast-track commercialisation, and drive economic growth.

The Government will invest up to $70 million over seven years through the New Zealand Institute for Advanced Technology to support innovative AI research and applications, develop world-class expertise, and sharpen New Zealand’s competitive edge.

“AI is transforming economies worldwide, and New Zealand must be bold and seize the opportunities,” Dr Reti says.

“Our existing AI research is expanding, with innovative work already under way in areas such as precision health and agriculture.

“This investment will accelerate that work by bringing our best researchers and businesses together to build capability, fast-track commercialisation, and create high-value jobs and new opportunities for Kiwi researchers.”

Dr Reti cited a recent partnership between the Auckland Bioengineering Institute and the Oden Institute at the University of Texas, supported by the Catalyst Fund, as an example of how AI can lift productivity, reduce costs, and deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders.

“New Zealand researchers, drawing on international AI expertise, are developing real-time digital models of the human body to personalise treatment, cut hospital costs, and generate millions in licensing revenue.

“Teams behind the project estimate that AI-driven public health solutions could deliver between $80 million and $160 million in annual healthcare savings. By combining AI with advanced modelling, this project could save up to $32 million a year in hospital costs through better management of chronic diseases and generate up to $16 million in annual licensing revenue from digital twin tools.

“The $70 million investment in AI through the Advanced Technology Institute can help scale up exactly this sort of ambitious, world-class research that strengthens our economy and positions New Zealand as a global leader in next-generation technologies,” Dr Reti says.

Investment in AI was recommended by the Prime Minister’s Science, Innovation and Technology Council, which recently appointed Grant Wright—an expert in digital transformation and product innovation through AI and emerging technologies.

“I am pleased to welcome Grant Wright as the newest member of the Council, which is working to shape a future-focused, resilient, and globally competitive science and technology ecosystem.”
