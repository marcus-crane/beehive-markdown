A ‘tough but fair’ approach, and greater unity across both our communities and government, is keeping people and property safer. 

Minister for Children Karen Chhour has confirmed a strong reduction in children and young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour dropping month-on-month since June 2024, a remarkable turnaround for what was once a national crisis. 

“As I tour the country, I am consistently hearing that communities are feeling safer. 

We promised to fix what matters to New Zealanders. We had been told that people felt unsafe, and that young people were going down the wrong path and harming their communities and their futures. 

This significant reduction in serious and persistent youth offending is just one example of how we’re fixing what matters. 

Community leaders are confirming to me that they are seeing the results on the ground, with young offenders no longer feeling above the law. 

Ram raids are down significantly. Kiwis are no longer being expected to live in fear that our cars have been stolen used by young offenders in a ram raid of our local small businesses.

Repeat offending has also decreased, with innovative initiatives like the Military-Style Academies and greater collaboration between Oranga Tamariki and Police getting results.”

The number of serious and persistent child and youth offenders is 14.6 percent lower than in June 2023, with current trends pointing to this continuing towards achieving Government Target Three several years before the target date.  

“I have also been informed that repeat young offenders are avoiding re-offending because they know Courts, Oranga Tamariki, and Police are working together more closely. They no longer believe they can avoid accountability and that their actions won’t have consequences.

We are investing in a number of safety and quality improvements to the facilities at youth justice residences, as well as greater investment in transitional support for young serious offenders. 

These investments from Budget 2025 will reduce both re-offending and the number of young people being held in police custody for an extended period of time. 

The reality is that there are times when that is the most appropriate place for them to be. I do not apologise for that. 

I hope these young offenders turn their lives around, and they are provided with opportunities to do so, but the safety of the community and victims is our highest priority,” Mrs Chhour says.
