More Kiwi businesses will soon be able to attract and retain the workforce they need, with the Government’s introduction of two new skilled migrant residence pathways.

Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis says skilled and experienced migrants play an important role plugging workforce gaps, and in turn helping businesses to grow.

“Businesses told us it was too hard for some migrants to gain residence, even when they had crucial skills and significant experience that was not available in the existing workforce. 

“We’re fixing it.”

From mid-2026, there will be two new residence pathways:

**Skilled Work Experience** **pathway**

- For migrants in skilled roles who have at least five years of directly relevant work experience, including at least two years of experience in New Zealand where they’ve been paid at least 1.1 times the median wage, and:

**Trades and Technician** **pathway**

- For migrants in specified skilled roles who hold a relevant qualification at Level 4 or above, and have at least four years of relevant post-qualification skilled work experience, including at least 18 months in New Zealand where they’ve been paid at or above the median wage.

Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says the Government is carefully balancing attracting higher-skilled workers, while managing migration levels responsibly, and ensuring New Zealanders remain prioritised for jobs. 

“This helps Kiwi businesses access the skills and experience needed to grow the economy, while hiring New Zealanders where they can.

“These changes are part of a suite of smart, flexible and nuanced immigration solutions we’ve introduced. 

"The Skilled Work Experience pathway is designed to help employers retain experienced workers who are already contributing to New Zealand’s economy and have demonstrated value in their roles.

“The Trades and Technician pathway recognises the practical skills needed in industries where sub-degree qualifications are widely used and valued.

“To ensure the new pathways are focused on where skilled and experienced migrants are most needed, additional eligibility restrictions will be placed on some occupations.”

Further information about these occupations and requirements, as well as occupations eligible for the Trades and Technician pathway, will be provided before the pathways open in mid-2026. 

“We are also reducing the amount of time that migrants with New Zealand university qualifications need to work in New Zealand before they can get residence. This is about further incentivising people to study here - and keep contributing after they graduate.”

Alongside the changes to the Skilled Migrant Category, Nicola Willis today released an update on the Government’s Going for Growth work programme, focused on the ‘Developing Talent’ pillar.

The update is focused on two key elements – the first, ensuring New Zealand’s skills and education system is world-class. The second is ensuring an immigration system that complements the domestic skills pipeline, by attracting the skilled and talented people needed to drive long-term business performance.
