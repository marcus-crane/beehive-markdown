Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston is welcoming a strong opening to New Zealand’s cruise season, thanks to joint government and industry efforts.

“With the first ship of the season Crown Princess having docked in Auckland today, it’s great to welcome her passengers and crew,” Louise Upston says.

“All up across almost 40 ships, we expect 177,000 cruise visitors to New Zealand for the 2025 – 2026 cruise season. Cruise has firmly established itself as an important part of our tourism sector.

“We know some cruise operators had questions about the New Zealand operational environment before they could commit to future scheduling.  We’ve worked hard to address those questions so forward planning can go full steam ahead once again. 

“Ministers met with cruise and port sector representatives in July to discuss how we could all make the most of the opportunities and remove the barriers. 

“As a result, we’ve 

- Worked on new ways to manage biofouling, so cruise lines have confidence any extra cleaning needed to meet biosecurity rules can be done safely and efficiently.
- Worked hard to provide clarity on regulatory costs facing the sector.
- Set up a Fast-Track Approvals process supporting efficient consenting for much-needed infrastructure like Port of Auckland’s development of a new wharf and passenger terminal for cruise vessels.
- Recently confirmed ongoing cruise access to Milford Sound.

“I also want to acknowledge the work of Port of Auckland who announced earlier today that it is in the final stages of developing an innovative in-port biofouling solution to clean niche areas of ships.” 

Louise Upston said she was now chairing a biannual cross-government and industry forum focused on supporting innovation and development in the cruise sector to maximise its contribution to the New Zealand economy and communities. 

“This reaffirms that New Zealand is open for business and committed to supporting the cruise sector’s growth. It sends an important message to the international cruise sector,

“I was encouraged to hear that cruise lines at the Seatrade Europe international expo earlier this month were very positive about recent developments in New Zealand. 

“The next big trade convention is Seatrade Miami in April 2026. I want to keep up the momentum and ensure all the cruise lines know New Zealand welcomes them and their passengers, so I will commit up to $25,000 in funding to boost New Zealand’s presence there.

“With the 2025 – 2026 season now open and the first passengers arriving, this bodes well for a bright future for cruise tourism in New Zealand,” Louise Upston says.
