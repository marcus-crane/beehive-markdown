Construction has begun on the State Highway 2 (SH2) Melling Transport Improvements Road of Regional Significance that will create a safer, more resilient and accessible transport system in Lower Hutt, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Turning the sod on the Melling Interchange is a huge step forward for a project that has been a long time coming. It’s going to be transformational for Lower Hutt – reducing congestion, improving safety, boosting public transport and active transport, and driving economic growth,”&lt; Mr Bishop says.

“After so many years of waiting, it’s exciting to see the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA), working with AECOM and Fletcher Construction, getting shovels in the ground.

“This project is part of a wider programme led by central and local government to boost economic growth in Lower Hutt, while also strengthening resilience and protection against floods and severe weather.

“Every day around 40,000 vehicles travel north and south of Melling on the state highway, making it one of the busiest intersections in Lower Hutt and a major choke point for commuters and freight.

“The project will deliver a new grade-separated Melling interchange and a bridge over the Hutt River, alongside upgrades to walking and cycling routes. It will also improve access to buses and trains through relocating the Melling train station south of its current site, complete with new park-and-ride facilities.

“The wider $1.5 billion RiverLink programme also includes major flood protection works and city centre revitalisation, with funding contributions of about $1 billion from NZTA, $295 million from Greater Wellington Regional Council, and $180 million from Hutt City Council.”

The Melling interchange and bridge construction is expected to be complete in 2031, with demolition of the old bridge to follow in 2032.
