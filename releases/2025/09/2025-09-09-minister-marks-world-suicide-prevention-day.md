Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey today joined MATES in Construction and ASB for World Suicide Prevention Day for the launch of the Construction Industry Wellbeing Survey.

“The theme of today is ‘Changing the narrative on suicide’ this means reducing stigma, reinforcing that it’s okay to not be okay, and encouraging people to ask for help. A simple check-in with a mate can make a real difference,” Mr Doocey says.

“New Zealand continues to face stubbornly high suicide rates. Last year, 617 people died by suspected suicide. Behind that number are grieving families, friends, colleagues, and communities.

“In June, we launched a new Suicide Prevention Action Plan with an increased investment of $16 million per year, bringing the total to $36 million.

“The plan has 21 new health actions and 13 new cross-agency actions to improve access to suicide prevention and postvention supports, grow a workforce that is able to support those at risk of, or affected by suicide, and strengthen our focus on prevention and early intervention.

“We’ve launched Top Up a new wellbeing promotion campaign, begun rollout of crisis recovery cafes and funded peer support workers in emergency departments. 

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.

“Everyone has a role to play in suicide prevention. New Zealand has come a long way in becoming more open to talking about mental health, and we are backing this up by putting more money into suicide prevention than ever before so Kiwis can be met with timely support.”
