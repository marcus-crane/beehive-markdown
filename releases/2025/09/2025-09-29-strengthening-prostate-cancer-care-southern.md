New Zealand’s first Advanced Practitioner Radiation Therapist specialising in prostate cancer is transforming care for men in the lower South Island, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This role is helping transform prostate cancer care in region, giving men faster access to treatment, more personalised support, and improved outcomes,” Mr Brown says.

“It means patients have consistent support throughout their treatment journey, while also freeing up specialists to see more people who need care.”

The Advanced Practitioner runs review clinics during treatment, leads six-week post-treatment follow-up clinics on behalf of radiation oncologists, and completes pre-first specialist assessments to prepare men before they even see a specialist.

“In August alone, around 60 patients received care through this role, demonstrating the value of this model.”

Mr Brown says the new approach is already showing tangible benefits for patients and clinicians alike.

“This is a great example of how innovative models of care can improve patient experience and ensure more New Zealanders receive timely, quality healthcare. While the role is currently focused on prostate cancer, there are already plans to extend it to a wider range of urological conditions in the future.”

“September being Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is also a timely reminder of the importance of early detection and treatment.

“Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among New Zealand men, with more than 4,000 cases confirmed each year. Tragically, around 700 fathers, brothers, husbands, and friends lose their lives to it annually.

“The good news is that when prostate cancer is detected early, the chances of successful treatment are far higher. That’s why awareness, early testing, and access to treatment are so important – they save lives.

“Early detection, combined with innovative models of care like we’re seeing in the South, gives men the best possible chance of living longer, healthier lives,” Mr Brown says.
