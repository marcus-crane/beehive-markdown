A first-of-its-kind survey of workers in the family violence and sexual violence sector shows improvements in training and collaboration, which will lead to better victim-centred services.

Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence Karen Chhour says the workforce survey has highlighted the importance of strong connections between the community sector and government agencies, as well as more consistent training.

“Workers in family violence and sexual violence prevention care for people and families who carry significant trauma and require highly specialised support.

“The workforce survey helps us understand who is in the workforce, their employment status, skill levels and how they apply training in their vital work helping people and families through significant distress.

“The latest workforce survey shows that nearly every single frontline worker surveyed has received family violence and sexual violence training (94% of those working in frontline family violence and sexual violence services have received specialist training) and use that training on a daily or weekly basis.

“While it’s promising that so many have received training, it is now our priority to ensure that this training is nationally consistent and of the highest quality.

“We have also prioritised better, and more, training to help staff across the public sector to support in family violence and sexual violence responses – including Courts, Corrections, and Police. These are being rolled out now, with the goal of reaching 10,000 workers in the next two years.

“The survey also asked about workers’ relationships with government agencies in their local community and has found that the majority have positive and collaborative relationships. This is important for enabling effective multi-agency responses to family violence and sexual violence, with all professionals working together to deliver victim-centred services.

“The next workforce survey is now open (available [here](https://preventfvsv.govt.nz/data-and-insights/fvsv-workforce-surveys)), providing workers the opportunity to share information about themselves and their work, to inform government planning for the family violence and sexual violence system,” said Mrs Chhour.
