Horticulture and job opportunities in Northland will get a major boost with the completion of Te Waihekeora Reservoir, a large water storage project south of Dargaville.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones officially opened the 3.3 million cubic metre reservoir’s opening at Te Kōpuru today.

“Northland is often at the mercy of drought but also flooding. It also has tremendous economic possibilities through its fertile soil but without the means to store the generous rainfall these possibilities are limited,” Mr Jones says. 

The water infrastructure will unlock more than 1000ha of land for horticulture. This could be quadrupled with the recently announced 22km [Kaipara pipeline](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.beehive.govt.nz/release/northland-water-security-receives-41m-boost__;!!Asq5-8xVch3Reg!sThhZdNtV6ik1626aMoInV162LaXTOFHUOY_wNVB-9NXaPH2azZceeIaFLDTMnbn8ySdgZpDI_2DTodrD_rQGU5rSM_4zPaXmPDb$) which will eventually connect the reservoir to Dargaville.

“Better water infrastructure enables higher-value land use, year-round productivity, and will give growers and farmers the certainty to invest, expand and innovate. Local growers and farmers, many of whom are iwi, can be optimistic about increased yields, in turn creating more jobs, boosting the local economy and reaching more markets.” Mr Jones says.

“Projects like this, which was funded by the former Provincial Growth Fund, help realise the full potential of our land, industries and people. It also achieves one of the Coalition Government’s key goals - doubling the value of New Zealand’s exports through smarter, more sustainable growth in food and fibre.

The completion of Te Waihekeora Reservoir, managed by Te Tai Tokerau Water Trust, marks a key milestone in the region’s economic journey. Together with the Kaipara pipeline, the project will deliver multiple benefits, including: 

- Strengthening water security across Northland.
- Supporting horticultural development, particularly for Māori-owned enterprises such as Te Uri o Hau Avocado Orchard Development, which is already drawing water from the reservoir and initial pipeline to grow crops.
- Stimulating economic growth through increased investment and activity in the region.
- Supplying water to key local users including Silver Fern Farms, the area’s largest employer, as well as surrounding farms and industrial operations.

Since 2018, government funding of almost $126 million has been announced for water storage infrastructure in Northland. This includes the $35m from the PGF for Te Waihekeora Reservoir, and a loan of up to $17.5m from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to support the Kaipara pipeline.
