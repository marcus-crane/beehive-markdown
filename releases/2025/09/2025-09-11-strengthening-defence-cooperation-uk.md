New Zealand and the United Kingdom have updated their statement on defence cooperation to reflect the rapidly changing world we live in, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“It’s been 10 years since we last articulated our defence cooperation with the United Kingdom, and the world has changed significantly in that time,” Ms Collins says.

“Russia’s illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, increasing strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and attacks on commercial shipping in the Middle East are among the issues affecting both of our regions, and it is vital that we stand firm in the face of current and future threats.”

Ms Collins and UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey signed the 2025 Joint Statement on Defence Cooperation between the UK and New Zealand when they met in London today.

“The international rules-based order that both countries rely on for economic prosperity is under increasing threat. That is why we have agreed to increase our interoperability, to support collective security,” Ms Collins says.

“Our countries’ militaries already train, deploy and operate side by side. Just recently our Navy frigate joined the UK-led Operation Highmast in the Indo-Pacific, our Army personnel have been working with UK counterparts to train Ukrainian recruits, and our Navy personnel have worked closely with the Royal Navy in the Pacific region, including through the deployment of Navy personnel on the HMS TAMAR over the past year.

“Today Secretary Healey and I agreed to enhance that work and to explore new areas of opportunity for closer cooperation, including innovation, defence industrial supply chains and common equipment.”

“In a deteriorating global environment, New Zealand is committed to working with like-minded partners to uphold the international rules-based order that is fundamental to our security and prosperity.”
