Three innovative trans-Tasman space projects designed to enhance maritime awareness, improve agricultural planning and secure satellite communications have secured up to $5.3 million in government funding.

“I am delighted to announce second-stage funding for three innovative, collaborative projects, all of which demonstrated clear plans for real-world impact in earlier feasibility studies,” Space Minister Judith Collins says.

“By building advanced space capabilities, creating new commercial opportunities and strengthening international competitiveness, these projects will boost our economies, bring New Zealand and Australia closer together and advance the Space and Advanced Aviation Strategy goal of accelerating aerospace innovation.”

Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti says the projects showcase the collaborative drive and commercial focus the Government is fostering through major reforms to New Zealand’s science and innovation system.

“These projects exemplify the spirit of collaboration and innovation that drives our science sector forward. By pooling expertise and resources with our Australian partners, we’re not only tackling shared challenges but also opening new opportunities for growth and technological advancement,” he says.

Funded through the Catalyst Fund, which fosters international science and innovation partnerships for New Zealand’s benefit, the projects are:

- Monitoring the Southern Indo-Pacific from Space – The Takehē Mission: Led by Restore Lab Ltd (NZ) and SmartSat CRC (Australia), this satellite mission will deliver advanced maritime domain awareness across the Indo-Pacific.
- Satellite Sensing in Agricultural Practices: Led by the University of Canterbury (NZ) and the University of Newcastle (Australia), this global satellite-based soil moisture monitoring system aims to boost water efficiency and drought resilience for farmers.
- Governance and Management of a Network of Free-Space Optical Communication Nodes: Led by the University of Auckland (NZ) and the University of South Australia (Australia), this project seeks to establish a trans-Tasman optical communications network for high-speed satellite data transfer.

“These projects harness the strengths of our researchers to build capability, support our economy and protect our national interests. Congratulations to all three teams, I look forward to watching your progress,” Ms Collins says.

The trans-Tasman projects are the result of an agreement between the New Zealand Space Agency and Australia’s SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre (SmartSat CRC) to collaborate on research projects that advance space science, leading to real world benefits.

New Zealand’s investment is matched by support from Australia.
