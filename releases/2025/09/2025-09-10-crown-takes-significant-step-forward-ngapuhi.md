The Crown has taken a significant step forward with Ngāpuhi as legislation that returns Kororipo Pā passes first reading in Parliament today, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Paul Goldsmith says.

“This marks the end of three years of negotiations between the Crown and Ngāti Rēhia, who have led these negotiations with the support of hapū with close connection to the site. It will be the first redress the Crown provides to Ngāpuhi, and demonstrates our commitment to a settlement. 

“Reaching a comprehensive settlement remains a high priority for the Government and we would like to progress negotiations as soon as possible. It is an honour to welcome Ngāpuhi into the house for their first Treaty settlement-related Bill reading.

“Kororipo Pā is significant to New Zealand as part of early settlement. It was a place of learning and trade between Ngāpuhi, missionaries and settlers. Ngāpuhi would assemble there before going to war and rangatira would meet to discuss politically important issues.

“Ngāpuhi has long sought the return of Kororipo Pā, on the banks of the Kerikeri River, as a historical site of great significance to all Ngāpuhi. I’d like to thank them for all their hard work in getting us here today.”

Kororipo Pā will transfer to Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Rēhia Trust in early 2026, which will hold it as kaitiaki on behalf of all Ngāpuhi. 

The site will retain its historic reserve status and public access to the reserve will not be affected.
