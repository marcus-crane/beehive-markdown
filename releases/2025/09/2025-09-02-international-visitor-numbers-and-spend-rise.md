Fresh data released today shows international visitor arrivals and spending are continuing to climb, giving a boost to our tourism sector and economy, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“Tourism is our second highest export earner and I’m encouraged to see our tourism numbers continuing to gain in strength.

“Welcoming more international visitors keeps our communities vibrant and our regions humming - supporting local businesses, creating more jobs and strengthening our economy overall.” Louise Upston says.

International Visitor Survey results show for the year ending June 2025, international tourism contributed $12.1 billion to New Zealand’s economy, up 4.3 per cent compared to the previous year.

This reflects an increase of 5 percent in international visitor arrivals, with 3.38 million visitors coming to New Zealand, up from 3.21 million in 2024.

When adjusted for inflation, this equates international spending to $9.6 billion or 86 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.

“I’m pleased to see the growth in visitor numbers and spending but there is still more work to do to get our tourism sector booming”. Louise Upston says.

“Amongst other initiatives, the Government recently released the Tourism Growth Roadmap, which sets out our plan to double the value of tourism exports by 2034.

“New Zealand is open for business, and we look forward to welcoming more visitors to our shores.”
