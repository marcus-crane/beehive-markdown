The Government is taking action to protect mainland New Zealand’s hoiho population through a temporary emergency fishery closure, and will seek public feedback on permanent measures, Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“I am implementing an immediate emergency closure of the set net fishery around the Otago Peninsula for a period of three months. During the closure period, officials will carry out public consultation on long-term bycatch measures to protect hoiho in the area,” Mr Jones says.

“As the self-proclaimed champion of the fisheries industry, I do not make this decision lightly. I am deeply conscious of the effect this will have on the livelihoods of fishers in the area, and people should not be under the misapprehension that I am softening my pro-industry stance. I acknowledge the voluntary closure put forward by fishers but if we are putting in place a closure, it needs to be more substantial than that proposed.”

“I have directed officials to consult on what permanent measures could be put in place to reduce the impact of fishing on hoiho.”

The public consultation on permanent measures to address hoiho bycatch is being developed by Fisheries New Zealand and will start in the next few weeks.

Proposals in this consultation will include extending a current set net ban around Otago Peninsula and an escalating response framework aimed at reducing hoiho bycatch in fisheries towards zero. 

Hoiho, yellow-eyed penguin, are a taonga species and the northern population, encompassing hoiho on the mainland and Rakiura/Stewart Island, is threatened.

“A new scientific assessment commissioned by Fisheries New Zealand, which will be publicly released shortly, shows the greatest threats to the northern hoiho are starvation and predation, followed by fishing and disease,” Mr Jones says.
