Minister for Trade, Investment, and Agriculture, Todd McClay, today announced the signing of five new commercial partnerships between New Zealand and Saudi Arabian companies, formalised at a ceremony during the Trade and Investment mission in Riyadh this week

“These partnerships mark an important step in deepening New Zealand’s trade relationship with Saudi Arabia and across the Gulf region. Together, they are expected to generate more than $100 million in commercial value for New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

“This will give our exporters a significant boost, reinforce New Zealand as a reliable trade partner, and contribute to our goal of doubling the value of exports in 10 years.”

“Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 is driving demand for premium, innovative solutions. Today’s new partnerships showcase the strength and diversity of New Zealand’s offerings in food and beverage, animal management, agri-tech, healthcare and the creative industries sectors well placed to contribute to this transformation,” Mr McClay says.

**Partnerships include:**

1. **NIG Nutritionals and Al Dawaa Pharmacies** – A distribution agreement to expand access to New Zealand-made nutrition products across Saudi Arabia.
2. **26 Seasons and Qassim Strawberry & Fruit Cooperative Society** – A partnership to develop and promote premium fruit production and supply.
3. **Gallagher Animal Management and Al Tajweed** – An agreement to provide advanced animal management solutions.
4. **Wētā Workshop and Rukun Creative Exchange** – A creative industries collaboration to bring New Zealand’s world-leading design and production expertise to Saudi projects.
5. **Wētā Workshop and Amaq Contracting Company** – A second agreement expanding Wētā’s footprint in Saudi Arabia through large-scale creative and construction ventures.
