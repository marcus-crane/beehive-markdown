The Government is investing $1.6 million to repair and reopen Tasman’s Great Taste Cycle Trail, which was badly damaged by recent storms. 

“This funding means the trail can reopen in time for summer, bringing visitors back to the stunning Nelson Tasman region, and supporting local businesses, jobs and communities,” says Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston. 

“Severe weather in June and July caused extensive flooding and wind damage. The funding will go towards repairing damaged sections, replacing infrastructure and creating alternative routes where riverbank paths are no longer possible.

“Reopening the trail will be a real win for the region, which has faced a tough winter. It’s not just about tourism, it’s about reconnecting communities and giving locals and visitors alike a chance to enjoy the outdoors and explore everything Nelson-Tasman has to offer.

“Good progress is being made to repair sections of the trail in readiness for the busy summer season.

“While more work is needed to reopen the section between Wakefield and Belgrove, getting most of the trail back up and running for summer will be a big boost for local businesses, including bike hire and tour operators, cafes and accommodation providers along the route.”

The 200km Great Taste Cycle Trail is one of 23 Great Rides that make up Ngã Haerenga, New Zealand Cycle Trails. More than 2 million people use these 23 rides each year, contributing an estimated $1 billion to regional economies.

The funding comes from the New Zealand Cycle Trail Fund, which is supported with revenue from the International Conservation and Visitor Levy.
