Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson travels to London this week to strengthen New Zealand’s international partnerships in insurance, emergency preparedness, and business competition.

“Resilience and disaster recovery are central priorities for this Government. My visit to London is an opportunity to promote New Zealand’s leadership in these areas, and to build stronger ties with global partners who share our challenges and ambitions,” Mr Simpson says.

The Minister will attend meetings involving the Insurance Council of New Zealand, including with Aon, Lloyd’s of London, and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.

Mr Simpson will also receive a detailed briefing from officials at the New Zealand High Commission, and take part in a series of events reflecting the breadth of New Zealand’s relationship with the United Kingdom.

This includes attending the 85th Anniversary Battle of Britain Service and Reception and supporting the Black Ferns in their Women’s Rugby World Cup semi-final against Canada.

Minister Simpson will be in London from 17–21 September.
