Thousands of New Zealanders who are already waiting too long for care will now wait even longer because the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) union has decided to strike again this week, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“It will mean thousands of New Zealanders face more disruption, including:

- Around 2,251 more surgeries and treatments such as hip, knee, and cataract operations cancelled or postponed.
- Additional delays for approximately 3,600 first specialist assessments.
- Postponement of around 8,000 critical follow-up appointments.

“Even appointments before and after the strike will be delayed, with impacts expected to drag on well beyond the strike itself. For many patients, that means more pain, more uncertainty, and more time without the care they need.

“We value our nurses and the vital care they give patients. That’s why our Government has invested heavily in our nursing workforce. The average salary for a registered nurse is now over $125,000 a year, including overtime and allowances, which aligns with base pay in New South Wales.

“Since 2011, NZNO union nurses’ pay has risen by nearly 74 per cent, which is more than double the wage growth of 35 per cent across the wider economy. Nurses also receive:

- Extra pay for nights, weekends, and on-call work.
- Additional leave for long shifts, long service, and sickness.
- Professional development payments of up to $6,000 a year for some roles.
- Five weeks’ annual leave after five years.

“This strike is a choice by the NZNO union to put politics ahead of patients. It will not shorten waitlists or improve care, it will only make delays worse for people already in pain and waiting for treatment. The NZNO union has also refused to disclose how its members voted on this strike.

“They should be upfront about it. Patients and nurses deserve honesty, not secrecy.

“Health New Zealand remains ready to negotiate in good faith. The current offer would see a new graduate nurse on $75,773 receive a total pay increase of $8,337 by the end of June 2026, including step progression.

“We will keep working to reduce wait times and get patients the care they need, when they need it. We thank the thousands of nurses who will continue to care for patients during this period, and we call on the NZNO union to stop playing games with people’s lives, step back from this strike and return to the bargaining table, and put patients first.”
