Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones have welcomed news that the first housing development has received consent under the Fast-track Approvals Act.

The Maitahi Village housing development in Nelson lodged its application in February 2025 and has now been approved by an independent expert panel.

Minister Bishop says the Maitahi Village development is expected to deliver approximately 180 homes, including 50 Ngāti Koata iwi-led houses, a retirement village with 194 townhouses and 36 in-care units, and a commercial centre.

“The development will provide much-needed housing and commercial infrastructure for the Nelson region.

“It is a significant investment in the future of Nelson and is expected to inject up to $308 million into the local economy.

“The Maitahi Village development is the second project to be approved through the Fast-track one-stop shop following the Port of Auckland wharf extension’s approval last month. I’m pleased to see the system starting to deliver approvals in these key areas to help address our significant infrastructure deficit and increase housing supply.”

Regional Development Minister Shane Jones said he was looking forward to more regional housing developments reaching the approval stage, along with other regional projects in the pipeline.

“I’m working with Minister Bishop on legislative changes to speed up the process and get projects under way faster.”
