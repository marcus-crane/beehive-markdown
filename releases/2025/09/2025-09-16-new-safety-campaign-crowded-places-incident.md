The launch of a new safety campaign guides Kiwis on what to do to stay safe during an armed offender incident in a crowded place, says Police Minister Mark Mitchell.

“The campaign communicates three easy steps for people to follow that will help them stay safe in the unlikely event of an active armed offender incident in a crowded place,” Mr Mitchell says.

“New Zealanders love to get together and this is all about being prepared in public spaces, such as a sports and events venues, transport hubs or places we shop.

“I want to be clear that we are not expecting increased danger or risk in New Zealand, and while the advice may seem obvious, similar campaigns overseas have been helpful at guiding people.”

“While it’s unlikely Kiwis will encounter an active armed offender in a crowded place – someone with a weapon trying to hurt many people – it’s important everyone knows what to do.

“There are three simple words to remember: Escape. Hide. Tell.”

- **ESCAPE**. Move quickly and quietly away from danger, but only if it is safe to do.
- **HIDE**. Stay out of sight and silence your mobile phone.
- **TELL**. Call the Police by dialling 111 when it is safe.

“I encourage discussions within businesses, community groups and families.

We all need to know how to respond in the unlikely event of an armed offender attack.

“Knowing what to do is the best way to keep ourselves and others safe.”’
