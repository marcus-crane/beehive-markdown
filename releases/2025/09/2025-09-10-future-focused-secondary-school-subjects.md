The Government’s ensuring young New Zealanders are prepared for the jobs of tomorrow, unveiling new future focused senior secondary school subjects.

“When our young people leave school, we want doors to open for them whether they’re going to tertiary study, learning a trade, or heading straight into work. These refreshed subjects will provide students with choice, purposeful pathways and opportunities for specialisation that set them up for success,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

“The Years 11-13 curriculum subjects being developed include many which are already available, some exciting brand-new subjects, and others have been named, organised or focused differently to create knowledge rich subjects and clearer pathways.”

Subjects are planned to be phased in from 2028 and are designed to create a future focused curriculum that recognises the growing importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in a future focused world, alongside other learning areas.

“Students will be able to specialise in areas such as Earth and Space Science, Statistics and Data Science, and Electronics and Mechatronics. There will also be a range of new specialist maths subjects including Further Maths.

Other new subjects include:

- Civics, Politics and Philosophy,
- Media, Journalism and Communications
- Te Mātai i te Ao Māori
- Pacific Studies
- Music Technology

To give students more choice, the Government is introducing new strengthened industry-led subjects.

These subjects include primary industry, health and wellbeing services, outdoor education, automative engineering, building and construction, infrastructure engineering, mechanical engineering, tourism and hospitality, and more.

“These pathways will be industry led and tertiary aligned so they meet what is expected in the professional world, making staying at school relevant for every child, no matter what their career pathway. This will enable students to leave school with a secondary and a tertiary qualification. We’re having one integrated system where all subjects, whether Ministry led or industry-led, are equal.

Te Marautanga o Aotearoa will be resourced with a first ever detailed curriculum in te reo Māori as well as new subjects including new Tātai Arorangi (Māori traditional systems of Earth and Sky), Te Ao Whakairo (Māori carving) and Te Ao Māori subjects.

“With the rapid development of AI, students will also be able to learn about and use generative AI in a range of subjects. This may include learning about how digital systems work, machine learning, cybersecurity, and digital ethics. We will also investigate a new Year 13 specialist subject on Generative AI for later development.

The curriculum for each subject will make the important learning clear for students and teachers, so the curriculum, rather than the qualification, is what drives teaching and learning.

Schools will be supported with an implementation package that will include professional learning and development, Curriculum Days and ready-to-use classroom resources, exemplars and guidance for all curriculum areas and year levels well in advance of implementation.

“When students get to high school, we want them to have access to innovative and dynamic subjects that will help grow New Zealand’s future and take on the world. We are creating clear, coherent pathways from school into study, training and employment - giving every student the skills and confidence to thrive in the future of work,” Ms Stanford says.
