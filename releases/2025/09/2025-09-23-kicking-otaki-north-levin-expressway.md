Construction has kicked off on the new 24-kilometre stretch of State Highway 1 from Ōtaki to north of Levin (Ō2NL), delivering major economic benefits for the region alongside big improvements to safety and reliability, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Breaking ground on Ō2NL is a huge moment for Horowhenua and the lower North Island. This expressway will cut congestion, improve safety, and give farmers and freight a more reliable route. It will also support the housing growth the region is experiencing,” Mr Bishop says.

“For years locals have been frustrated by crashes, delays and resilience issues on this stretch of road. Ō2NL is the fix.

“This project is part of the Wellington northern corridor the last National Government kicked off in 2013. It follows the success of Transmission Gully, Mackays to Peka Peka and Peka Peka to Ōtaki – all of which have slashed travel times and improved safety.

“The current Kāpiti highway carries up to 19,500 vehicles a day. The new Expressway is expected to create evening peak travel time savings of up to 15 minutes for trips from Otaki to north of Levin and 6 mins for trips from Otaki to Levin. That’s time back in people’s days, and it means goods can move more efficiently too.

“We’ve already seen the benefits the Kāpiti Expressway has delivered. Ō2NL is the vital next link – boosting economic growth nationally and locally, and helping unlock development opportunities in the Horowhenua.

“I want to acknowledge the tireless advocacy of local MPs Tim Costley and Suze Redmayne. Ō2NL is a great example of this Government getting on and delivering the transport projects that make a real difference for New Zealanders.”

The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2029.
