Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced that the contract for the construction of Dunedin Hospital’s new inpatient building has been signed with CPB Contractors Limited.

“Delivering this inpatient building is a key priority for the Government.  In January this year, I gave the people of Dunedin certainty that it would be built on the old Cadbury site, and in July construction work resumed,” Mr Brown says.

“Under the previous government’s plans, the project risked a $3 billion blowout. We’ve reset the approach and strengthened planning to ensure we actually deliver the safe, modern hospital that Dunedin and the surrounding Otago and Southland regions deserve.

“The $1.88 billion New Dunedin Hospital programme is New Zealand’s single biggest health infrastructure project and an economic boost for the region. 

"Construction of the inpatient building will provide more than 900 FTE jobs and contribute around $100 million annually to Dunedin’s economy at the peak of construction.

“I am pleased to confirm CPB Contractors Limited as the main construction partner for the delivery of this building.

“CPB has been involved from the early days, working closely with Health New Zealand’s design team on pre-construction activities. With their experience in New Zealand and Australia, we are pleased to have a contractor in place who has the appropriate experience to manage a project of this scale and complexity – approximately 72,000 sqm of space.

“This project is highly complex, which is why we have also put in place a Crown Manager to oversee delivery and ensure CPB completes it on time and within budget.”

Construction resumed at the former Cadbury site in July, beginning with foundations and pile caps. A crane will be in the sky mid-next year, with the hospital due for practical completion in 2030 and open to patients in 2031.

“This Government’s record investment reflects our commitment to delivering a modern, fit-for-purpose hospital that meets the needs of future generations and can adapt to changing models of care.

“With the main contractor now in place, the people of Dunedin, Otago, and Southland can finally look forward to the modern, world-class hospital they need, and now will get,” Mr Brown says.
