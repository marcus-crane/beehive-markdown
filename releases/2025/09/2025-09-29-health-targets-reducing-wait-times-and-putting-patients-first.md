Shorter waits, faster treatment, and more timely access to care are benefiting patients across New Zealand, with the latest quarterly results for April to June showing clear improvements, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“After years of decline, healthcare is improving steadily under this Government. We are putting patients first and refocusing our health system to ensure all New Zealanders can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it, but we know there is also still more work to do,” Mr Brown says.

These quarterly results mark the first annual milestone toward our 2030 targets. Key improvements from April to June include:

- **Faster cancer treatment:** 86.3 per cent of patients started treatment within 31 days, up from 83.5% last year, supported by the Government’s $604m Pharmac boost delivering 33 new cancer medicines.
- **Childhood immunisations:** 82 per cent of children fully immunised by age two, up from 76.5 per cent last year – the largest annual gain across all targets.
- **Shorter stays in emergency departments:** 73.9 per cent of patients admitted, treated or discharged within six hours, up from 71.2 per cent last year, despite increased attendances – meaning our doctors and nurses are delivering more care than ever and still getting patients seen faster.
- **Shorter waits for elective treatment and first specialist assessments (FSAs):** Patients waiting less than four months increased by 6.6 percentage points for elective treatment and 3.8 for FSAs – the largest quarterly improvements across all health targets.

“Our Government’s Elective Boost added more than 16,000 procedures, including hips, knees, and cataracts, from February to June through partnering with the private sector, helping to reduce waiting times for elective treatments. FSAs were delivered at 104 per cent of plan to June, meaning more patients are being seen than planned.”

Mr Brown says the latest figures show encouraging progress in ensuring more patients receive their FSA and elective procedure within four months.

- In Whanganui, patients waiting less than four months for an FSA increased by 18 percentage points compared to the last quarter, with Bay of Plenty up 10.1 and South Canterbury up 4.6.
- In West Coast, patients waiting less than four months for elective procedures increased by 17.9 percentage points compared to the last quarter, with Whanganui up 12.2, Wairarapa up 11.5, Hutt Valley up 11.5, Gisborne up 11.4, Northland up 11.1, Lakes up 10.9, Waitematā up 10.6, Taranaki up 10.4, South Canterbury up 6.1, and Nelson Marlborough up 6.1.

“These gains mean more patients are being seen sooner, receiving faster diagnoses, better outcomes, and timely access to the surgery they need.

“The latest results show the health system is turning a corner after the sharp decline that followed the removal of health targets by the previous government. We thank our doctors, nurses, and other frontline staff whose daily commitment makes this improvement possible.

“Waitlists are falling, cancer patients are being treated faster with more medicines available, and more children are being protected from preventable disease. Every improvement means more Kiwis getting back to work, returning to everyday life, and regaining their quality of life.

“There is still more work to do. Too many people are still waiting too long, and we will not stop until every New Zealander has timely access to care. With a record $30 billion annual investment, we are rebuilding the system around patients, holding it accountable, and driving better outcomes.”
