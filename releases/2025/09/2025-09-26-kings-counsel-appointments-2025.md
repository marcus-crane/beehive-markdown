Attorney-General Judith Collins today announced the appointments of 12 King’s Counsel.

The rank of King’s Counsel is primarily awarded to barristers sole who have met the overarching criteria of excellence in their careers, although some can be appointed in recognition of their extraordinary contributions to law.

“That is the case this year, with Chief Parliamentary Counsel Cassie Nicholson being made a KC in recognition of her significant contribution to the drafting of legislation for New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

The 11 barristers sole appointed, from 107 applications, are Brian Dickey, Tiana Epati, Kevin Glover, Katie Hogan, Sarah Jerebine, Paul Keegan, Simon Ladd, Richard Marchant, Balthazar Matheson, Matthew Smith, and Alan Webb.

“The standards to be appointed King’s Counsel are extremely high and I am delighted that our legal profession continues to feature such distinguished individuals,” Ms Collins says.

“I am also pleased to note the wide variety of practice areas in which our newest silks have experience, increasing the availability of King’s Counsel in specialist fields,” Ms Collins says.

“All of our new King’s Counsel have demonstrated a particular commitment to improving access to justice alongside their excellent work as advisors and litigators. They all have strong links to their communities and significant instances of pro bono, legally aided and similar work. I congratulate each of them and their families on their appointment.”
