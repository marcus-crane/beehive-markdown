Health New Zealand will deliver an additional 75,000 diagnostic procedures this year through its $65 million Diagnostic Improvement Plan, aimed at reducing wait times for critical diagnostic procedures such as MRI scans, colonoscopies, and colposcopies, Health Minister Simeon Brown says

“It is estimated that approximately 40,000 New Zealanders are waiting longer than they should for the tests they need. Long waits not only cause stress and anxiety for patients and their families, they also delay the start of treatment and put extra pressure on our hospitals,” Mr Brown says.

“This investment will expand access and reduce wait times so people can get answers sooner, doctors can diagnose problems earlier, and patients can begin the right treatment without delay. For many, getting the right test at the right time will be life-changing.”

Over the next year, the programme will deliver 74,950 additional procedures through both public and private providers, including:

- 64,000 radiology procedures
- 7100 colonoscopies
- 2200 cardiac tests
- 1650 colposcopies

“This initiative is being supported by targeted workforce growth, with work underway to expand training places in radiology and echo-sonography, ensuring we can meet future demand.”

The $65 million investment will enable Health New Zealand districts to increase both in-house delivery and outsourcing based on cost effectiveness, workforce sustainability, and patient access to maximise the amount of diagnostics services delivery for patients.

“This diagnostics investment is in addition to the recently launched $30 million investment in community-referred radiology, which allows patients to be referred for an ultrasound, CT, or x-ray directly by their GP, urgent care doctor, or nurse practitioner – without needing a hospital specialist or emergency department referral.

“Until now, patients would be on a waitlist to see a hospital specialist before even getting on the list for a scan. By significantly increasing the number of diagnostic procedures, patients referred directly by their GP will not only bypass the specialist wait but also face shorter waits for the scan itself.

“By boosting capacity and widening referral pathways, we are cutting out double-handling, reducing delays, and ensuring patients get the right diagnosis and treatment sooner.

“It will also free up hospital specialists to focus on first specialist assessments and elective surgeries while reducing pressure on our emergency departments, which will help deliver on the Government’s health targets.

“This is about putting patients first. Our focus is on making sure New Zealanders get access to the tests they need, when they need them, so they can get the answers and treatment they need, faster. I’ve also asked Health New Zealand to work with the APEX union to ensure this programme is successfully delivered,” Mr Brown says.
