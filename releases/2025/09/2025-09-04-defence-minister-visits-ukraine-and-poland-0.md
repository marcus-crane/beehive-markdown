Defence Minister Judith Collins has visited Ukraine, seeing firsthand the heartbreaking human cost of war to its people.

"Russia's illegal invasion has brought misery and destruction to the Ukrainian people for three-and-a-half long years now," Ms Collins says.

"New Zealand's response was swift when Russia invaded in February 2022 - and our support for Ukraine remains steadfast. This was the key message I conveyed in Kyiv."

While in Kyiv Ms Collins had formal talks with her Ukrainian counterpart, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal, and engagements with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the Office of the President and Deputy Minister of Defense Oleksandr Kozenko.

She also paid her respects at the Wall of Remembrance in Mykhailivska Square and visited the site of a residential apartment building hit by a Russian ballistic missile on 17 June, killing 23 civilians, including children. 

"Seeing the devastating impact of Russia's illegal war - the disruption to everyday life, the human cost, the impact on children, the physical destruction - was heartbreaking," Ms Collins says. 

"My visit, accompanied by Chief of Defence Force Air Marshal Tony Davies, was a tangible reminder of both New Zealand's strong support for Ukraine and our strong support for the international rules-based order.

"My counterparts said they deeply valued the fact we had made the effort to travel from the other side of the world to demonstrate New Zealand's support and solidarity for Ukraine, and that it gave them enormous strength.”

Ms Collins also visited Warsaw, Poland, where she met Deputy Foreign Minister Władysław Teofil Bartoszewski and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. She is also scheduled to meet Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz.

“Poland remains one of our most trusted partners in Central and Eastern Europe,” Ms Collins says.

“We are united by shared values and strategic interests that underpin our close relationship. 

"My engagements in Warsaw underline Poland's critical role as both the key logistical hub for support to Ukraine and the anchor of NATO’s eastern flank.”

Following engagements in Poland, Ms Collins will travel to the UK, to undertake defence and security-focused meetings.

“New Zealand and the UK have a deep and enduring security partnership, including through our Five Eyes relationship,” Ms Collins says.

“These ties play a vital role in safeguarding the security of both our nations and allow us to contribute to collective efforts to uphold global security. I look forward to engaging with UK counterparts in the days ahead.”

Ms Collins returns to New Zealand on September 13.
