The Government is providing an additional funding boost of $300,000 to support the ongoing clean-up work in the Tasman district resulting from the significant rainfall events in June and July 2025.

“Enhanced Taskforce Green programme was activated in July, enabling MSD to employ local job seekers to assist farmers and growers to recover from this event.” Louise Upston says. 

“Additional funding of $300,000, on top of the original $500,000, will enable local job seekers to continue the clean-up and return to those properties that need more support. Extending the programme until December 2025 will support these job seekers with the cost of living and give them work experience and the opportunity to transition to seasonal horticulture work without returning to benefit.”

Since starting the programme, 60 properties have been registered with MSD as requiring support due to severe or major property damage. Enhanced Taskforce Green provides support of up to three days for each property.  

“Landowners, farmers and growers are praising the incredible work that the crews have been doing from clearing fence lines to removing silt from paddocks. Their commitment to supporting the community has been warmly received.

“This is one of several supports across government contributing towards the district’s economic recovery and resilience after a natural disaster, while also supporting local job seekers gain skills and work experience.”
