Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey today officially opened Ngā Wai Ngāro, a new acute mental health facility at Palmerston North Hospital.

“This new unit marks a fundamental shift in how we support people in mental distress. It ensures that when someone is in need of support, they are in a safe, supportive environment designed to help them get well,” Mr Doocey says.

“This $66.6 million investment delivers 28 modern patient bedrooms, therapy rooms, a gym, natural light, outdoor areas and family spaces, all designed to create a more therapeutic environment that supports faster recovery.

“The opening today is part of the Government’s mental health plan to deliver faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.

“People go into mental health facilities to get well and be safe, which is exactly what this new facility is designed to do. Families should be able to trust that when a loved one reaches out for support, they are in a safe environment and receiving the support they need.

“This is a good example of what can be achieved when we listen to those voices who have lived experience, to staff on the frontline, and to the community.

“I acknowledge that today’s opening has been long awaited by many. It is an understatement to say this facility is a major step up from Ward 21, and I am confident it will deliver better mental health care for the region.”

The new facility will begin welcoming patients later this year, with a transition plan in place to ensure continuity of care before the existing Ward 21 formally closes.

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
