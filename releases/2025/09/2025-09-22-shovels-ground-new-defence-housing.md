The largest Defence housing project in decades is officially underway, delivering modern homes for military families and driving job growth in regional communities, Associate Defence Minister Chris Penk has announced.

“Our sailors, soldiers and aviators dedicate themselves to protecting New Zealand, and they deserve warm, modern homes to return to when off duty,” Mr Penk says.

“Too many homes across New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) camps and bases no longer meet the standards we expect for our servicemen and women.

"Some were built as far back as the 1930s and remain run-down, poorly laid out and poorly insulated because of decades of underinvestment, making them unsuitable for modern family living.

“Today marks a significant step forward, with shovels now in the ground for the Homes for Families programme – the most ambitious Defence housing initiative since the 1980s.

“Altogether, the Government intends to invest up to $600-million into the Homes for Families programme through the Defence Capability Plan.

“Construction has begun on eight new homes at Linton Military Camp, alongside five homes in Bulls for personnel at Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Base Ohakea.

“These new builds will include modern two- and three-bedroom homes, replacing outdated 1940s and 50s-era housing that no longer meet the needs of today’s military families or supports their wellbeing.

“Work is also underway on 10 brand-new, three-bedroom homes at Burnham Military Camp in Canterbury.

“In Auckland’s Bayswater, 61 new homes are being built by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei’s property development arm, which will be leased by Defence for personnel from the Devonport Naval Base.

“The Government also remains committed to delivering 50 new homes at Waiouru Military Camp and will announce further details about the project later this year.

"This is just the beginning. The Defence Force is preparing to go to market around the end of 2025 for additional new housing at Linton, Ohakea, Burnham and Trentham Military Camp.

“Defence families often relocate throughout New Zealand to ensure personnel are where they’re needed most, and it’s important we support them on this journey with homes that offer a secure family life.

“Beyond providing housing, this programme will also support regional communities by creating skilled construction jobs around our military camps and bases.

“That means new opportunities for workers and businesses, more money flowing into local communities and a boost to national economic growth.

“This Government is committed to creating good jobs for Kiwis and tackling New Zealand’s infrastructure deficit.

“That includes by ensuring the men and women who stand ready to serve and protect this nation have a safe roof over their heads.”
