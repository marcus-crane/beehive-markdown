Patients across Northland and Auckland are benefiting from shorter waits and faster access to care, the latest health target results show, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Healthcare performance in the Northern region is improving steadily. We are putting patients first and ensuring Aucklanders and Northlanders can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it,” Mr Brown says.

These quarterly results mark the first annual milestone toward our 2030 targets. Key improvements in the Northern region from April to June include:

- **Faster cancer treatment:** 85.1% of patients started treatment within 31 days, with Northland up 4.6 percentage points and Waitematā up 3.2 from the previous quarter.
- **Childhood immunisations:** 82.2% of children fully immunised by age two, with Waitematā up 4.2 percentage points, Auckland up 2.9, and Counties Manukau up 4.8 from the previous quarter.
- **Shorter stays in emergency departments:** 72.5% of patients were admitted, transferred, or discharged within six hours, with Northland up 1.7 percentage points and Waitematā up 2.7 from the same time last year, despite increased attendances.

Progress is also being made in reducing waitlists for elective procedures and first specialist assessments (FSAs).

“In the last quarter alone, thousands more patients across Auckland and Northland received the care they needed – from hip and knee replacements to cardiology and cataract surgeries,” Mr Brown says.

The latest figures show that in several districts, more patients are being seen within four months for FSAs and elective procedures compared to the previous quarter:

“These improvements mean more patients getting back to work, returning to everyday activities, and regaining their quality of life. We thank our doctors, nurses, and other frontline staff whose daily commitment makes this improvement possible,” Mr Brown says.

“Too many people are still waiting too long for care. We will keep working to reduce wait times and make sure more Aucklanders and Northlanders get the treatment they need, faster.

“Backed by a record $30 billion annual investment into health, our Government is rebuilding the system around patients, holding it accountable for performance, and driving better outcomes.”
