Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Rural Health Matt Doocey and Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson are in Greymouth today for the latest stop on the Rural Health Roadshow happening around the country.

“The West Coast has some of the most geographically spread-out communities in the country, which we know can make accessing healthcare a challenge. That’s why it’s important to be here today, to hear first-hand from people in Greymouth and across the Coast about what’s working, and where the gaps are,” Mr Doocey says.

“Budget 2025 invested $164 million over four years to strengthen urgent and after-hours care. For rural and remote areas like the West Coast, this means more support for extended after-hours services, 24/7 on-call clinical support, and better access to diagnostics and medicines. This means 98 per cent of New Zealanders should be able to reach urgent care within an hour of their homes.

“This Government is very clear that geography should never be a barrier for people accessing the healthcare they need. These roadshows have allowed me to have invaluable conversations with people on the ground.

“I am looking forward to hearing from the Greymouth community today and working together on the next steps to strengthen both mental health and rural health care on the Coast.”

“All New Zealanders deserve access to timely, quality care, and this Government is committed to improving health and mental health outcomes, including for the one in five people living in rural communities,” Mr Patterson says.

“It’s important we understand both the challenges and the opportunities for those living in rural communities like Greymouth so we can work together to improve access and outcomes in the rural setting.”
