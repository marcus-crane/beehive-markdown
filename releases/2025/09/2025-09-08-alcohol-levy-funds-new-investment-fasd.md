Associate Health Minister Matt Doocey today launched the Government’s new approach to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), bringing a significant funding boost and valuable action to further prevent FASD, improve diagnosis and support, and strengthen services for affected families.

“Today’s announcement not only increases funding in FASD but delivers more targeted community-based assessment, diagnosis and early intervention,” Mr Doocey says.

“I want New Zealand to be a country where people are supported to have alcohol free pregnancies, where FASD is better understood, where our workforce is better equipped and people living with FASD and their families are better supported.”

The Government increased the alcohol levy for the first time since 2009 from $11.5 million to $16.6 million annually. A total of $7.25 million of additional alcohol levy funding will be invested to:

- Roll out targeted community-based assessment, diagnosis and early intervention support for children and young people with FASD.
- Grow the nationwide “Nurture the Future Within” prevention campaign to raise awareness and support prevention efforts.
- Continue the community-led Te Iho Tātai-ā-Rongo support programme to connect families and professionals, foster collaboration, and provide neurodiversity training.
- Build a stronger workforce across health, justice, social services, and education to better recognise and respond to FASD.
- Increase the number of FASD navigators, peer support, and capability building for individuals with FASD to help young people stay connected, build life skills, and achieve their goals.

“This is a direct response to people waiting far too long for FASD support. It will also help build a stronger evidence base on FASD prevalence in our communities – we need better information about FASD and which initiatives are most effective in improving lives.”

“I want to acknowledge the FASD health and advocacy community, who have worked tirelessly to gain recognition for FASD and to support families, and loved ones, affected by it.

“FASD is widespread and impacts thousands of families. Around 1,800 to 3,000 babies may be born with FASD each year in New Zealand. It significantly affects lifelong health, learning, and development.

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.
