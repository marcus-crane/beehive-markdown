The appointment of three new members to the Civil Aviation Authority’s Board will bring fresh expertise and leadership to the entity, Associate Transport Minister James Meager says.

Mr Meager has appointed Mike Schubert and Peter O’Regan for three-year terms, beginning 8 October 2025. Mel Templeton has also been appointed as a new member, with her term beginning on 26 May 2026.

“These new board members’ extensive experience across aviation and governance will strengthen the CAA as it continues its focus on efficiency and performance, begins its first principles funding review and undertakes rule and technology changes to support an innovative aviation sector,” Mr Meager says.

“The Government is committed to growing the aviation sector, and strong governance is essential to delivering this commitment.

“This refreshed board will continue to provide the leadership needed to support the sector’s growth, enhance safety, and deliver better outcomes for travellers, businesses, and communities.

“I thank departing member Jill Hatchwell, and Charles Spillane, who will be finishing his term in May 2026, for their commitment to the Board.”
