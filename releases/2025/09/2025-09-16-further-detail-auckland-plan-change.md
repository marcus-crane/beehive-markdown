The Government will ensure Aucklanders can have their say on the city’s future growth, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Last month, as requested by Auckland Council, Parliament passed a law allowing Auckland Council to withdraw its controversial Plan Change 78. The Council asked for the ability to not apply the Medium Density Residential Standards (MDRS) and “downzone” areas of the city vulnerable to natural hazards like floods.

“If Auckland withdraws Plan Change 78, the Council must notify a replacement plan change which provides for equivalent housing capacity – but Aucklanders and Auckland communities will have much more choice and discretion about where that growth occurs.

“By giving Auckland Council the option to withdraw PC78, we’ve returned decision-making to locals. If Auckland follows this new plan change, the medium density residential standards will be removed, so for the most part the Council can once again decide how and when housing growth happens.

“As part of this process, the Government will also require Auckland Council to provide greater density around key stations that benefit from the new City Rail Link.

‘“Pretty much everyone agrees that greater housing density around CRL stations makes sense. It’s how we unlock the full benefits of this once-in-a-generation public transport investment.

“As I’ve said publicly many times, it is important that Aucklanders have robust opportunities to participate in this important process.

“The Council itself has asked for a transparent process, and that’s exactly what we’re committed to delivering.

“I cannot make formal decisions on the process until after I receive formal notice from Auckland Council. However, today I am announcing that I have confirmed to Mayor Brown that, subject to receiving formal notice from Auckland Council, I am looking at a submission period of 3 November to 19 December, in line with what the Council has requested. That gives Aucklanders a clear window to have their say on how and where housing growth should occur.

“In the new year, I consider it appropriate for hearings on the Plan Change to be held before an independent panel of experts, known as an Independent Hearings Panel (IHP). The IHP will hear from Aucklanders who have submitted on the plan change through the process.

“I am looking at setting an overall timeframe of around 18 months for the plan change process. This will give certainty to Aucklanders after years of delay and uncertainty but also makes sure the IHP has a good chance to do its work and consider the – doubtless – many submissions.

“This process ensures local voices are at the centre of decisions on Auckland’s growth, while creating more housing options, making the most of the City Rail Link, and setting the city up for the future.”

**Note to editors**

Auckland Council will vote on whether to withdraw Plan Change 78 in favour of a new plan change on 24 September.

If Council votes to withdraw, it will send a formal notice to the Minister Responsible for RMA Reform. Once that notice is received, the Minister may then set out the timeframes and processes by which the new plan change will proceed.
