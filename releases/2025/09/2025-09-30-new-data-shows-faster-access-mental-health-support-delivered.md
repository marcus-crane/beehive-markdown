With quarter four data now in, for the first time we can compare a full year of data to measure how well mental health and addiction services are performing across the country, Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey says.

“Encouragingly, more Kiwis are getting faster access to support with both primary mental health support and specialist services staying above target all year,” Mr Doocey says.

"We are also seeing positive progress across regions. Whanganui district went from 81.4 percent to nearly meeting the 95 percent target for 6 hour shorter mental health stays in emergency departments. Central region went from not meeting the specialist mental health support in 3 weeks target, to now achieving it.

“In the South Island, access to primary mental health support in one week has also improved from 75 percent to now being well above target at 84.7 percent. Southern district went from being the worst performing district at 66.4 percent, to one of the best at 91 percent.

“I have always said I won’t be happy with just meeting the targets nationally. The value of being able to measure how well the twenty health districts are performing is being able to see where may need extra support.

“Since the first mental health targets were introduced, I have met regularly with HNZ regional leaders to ensure plans are in place to lift areas of underperformance.

“Today’s results back that we’re turning the corner on reducing wait times and increasing the mental health workforce, with the frontline Health NZ mental health workforce growing around 10% since we came into Government.

“This Government is focused on delivering faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response. These targets ensure this is happening.

“At the end of the day, no matter where you are in New Zealand, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there when someone is reaching out.”
