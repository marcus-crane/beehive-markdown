A public reserve will finally be established on the iconic Miramar Peninsula – Te Motu Kairangi in Wellington, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka and Land Information Minister Chris Penk have announced.

“Watts Peninsula, also known as Mātai Moana, is a prominent landmark with enormous historical and cultural significance for many New Zealanders,” Mr Potaka says.

“The Watts Peninsula public reserve was first promised to the people of Wellington and New Zealand by the government in 2011,” Mr Penk says.

“I can today confirm that a reserve will be created on the northern tip of Miramar Peninsula, following the transfer of 72 hectares of land from Land Information New Zealand to the Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai (DOC).

“There is strong public interest in safeguarding the whenua (land) and I thank everyone who has advocated for this outcome.

“The area is home to pā sites, wāhi tapu (sacred places) and military heritage sites built from the 1880s through to the Second World War, including Fort Ballance.

“This decision will preserve a treasured part of Wellington and its rich history for future generations.”

Mr Potaka says a charitable trust will manage the reserve, with trustees appointed by Wellington City Council, Taranaki Whānui and DOC.

“The Trust’s role will be to protect, preserve, and promote the reserve as a place of ecological, historical, and cultural importance that all people can access and enjoy.

“Establishing the reserve offers an opportunity to regenerate Watts Peninsula for the benefit of all New Zealanders and overseas manuhiri (visitors) while protecting our beautiful indigenous flora and fauna.

“Ongoing funding for the operation and maintenance of the reserve will be provided by Wellington City Council, and Taranaki Whānui through the Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust.”

An official opening of the reserve will take place once it’s ready for public access.
