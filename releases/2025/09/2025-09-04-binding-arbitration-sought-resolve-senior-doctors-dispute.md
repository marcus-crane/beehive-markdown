Health Minister Simeon Brown has today written to Health New Zealand and the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists (ASMS) calling on both parties to urgently enter binding arbitration.

This action follows the collective agreement expiring 12 months ago, with mediation, facilitated bargaining, and an Employment Relations Authority recommendation failing to resolve the dispute. 

Most importantly, strike action continues to disrupt care for thousands of patients, with ASMS this week rejecting the latest offer and immediately balloting to strike, instead of returning to the negotiating table. A further strike later this month could impact care for thousands more patients.

The Government’s focus remains on ensuring New Zealanders have access to timely, quality healthcare.

Both parties have been asked to confirm their agreement to arbitration by Friday 4:00 PM.
