Fewer people in Auckland are waiting to see a cardiologist, with the cardiology first specialist assessment (FSA) waitlist down 25 per cent since November 2023, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Heart disease is one of New Zealand’s leading health challenges. It’s encouraging to see more Aucklanders getting timely access to specialist care when they need it,” Mr Brown says.

Between November 2023 and March 2025, the number of people waiting for a cardiology FSA reduced by 25 per cent, with patient numbers dropping from 3,829 to 2,847. The longest waits saw the biggest improvement, with those waiting over four months reducing by 73 per cent – from 663 to 179.

“These numbers represent real lives being changed. It means a dad with chest pain is seen quickly and started on the right treatment before a heart attack happens, an older woman with breathlessness finally gets answers and support, and families are no longer left waiting in uncertainty for that first crucial appointment.”

The results come after years of mounting pressure, with the cardiology waitlist having grown by 36 per cent in the previous three years. Now, progress is being made across all three Auckland districts:

- Waitematā – down 47 per cent
- Auckland – down 8 per cent
- Counties Manukau – down 20 per cent

The turnaround reflects the dedication of Auckland’s clinical teams, who have:

- Expanded clinic capacity through extra sessions and better use of resources.
- Improved reminder and follow-up systems.
- Streamlined scheduling systems to reduce delays in booking appointments.

“Our plan is working – we are backing clinical teams, improving referral systems, and ensuring hospitals have the capacity to deliver faster, smarter care.

“Reducing wait times for FSAs is a key Government priority, with a clear target: by 2030, 95 per cent of patients will be seen within four months.

“Patients are still waiting too long, and there is more work to do – but this latest data shows we are heading in the right direction,” Mr Brown says.
