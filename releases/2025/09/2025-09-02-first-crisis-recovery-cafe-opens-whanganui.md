Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey today opened Whanganui’s new Crisis Recovery Café at Warm Café, the first of six cafés being rolled out by the Government across the country.

“This is about real options for support, close to home. A place to feel heard, supported, and safe. EDs are often not the right environment when someone is going through a mental health crisis. Cafés like this one meet people where they are, offering compassionate, peer-led care in the heart of the community,” Mr Doocey says.

The new café is being delivered by Balance Aotearoa, working alongside iwi providers Te Oranganui and Hāpai Mauri Tangata, with Government backing to bring the idea to life.

Crisis Recovery Cafés are peer-led, non-clinical spaces with trained support workers, where people experiencing mental health or addiction challenges can sit down with people in a relaxed setting.

“Our crisis cafes have the potential to take pressure off our traditional crisis systems. Too often, people in crisis end up in EDs that aren’t right for them. Cafés like this offer a lower stress, more compassionate alternative.

“That said, alongside the cafés, we are also establishing peer support specialist roles in eight emergency departments by the end of the year. This will help embed a quiet revolution of lived experience and peer support across the system.

“We’re focused on delivering results – faster access to support, more frontline workers and a better crisis response.

“Our mental health plan is working. We’re turning the corner on reducing wait times and increasing the mental health workforce. Recent data shows the frontline Health NZ mental health workforce has grown around 10 percent since we came into Government, and over 80 percent of people are being seen within three weeks for specialist services.

“Whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member, reaching out for support, this Government is committed to ensuring support is there.”
