Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay departs today for Kuala Lumpur to attend a series of high-level ASEAN Economic Ministers’ Meetings.

“This year marks the 50th anniversary of New Zealand’s Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN, a milestone that underlines just how far we’ve come, and why we are committed to elevating our relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” Mr McClay says.

“Collectively, ASEAN is New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner, with two-way trade now worth more than $29 billion a year. Strengthening these relationships is vital to achieving the Government’s ambition of doubling the value of New Zealand’s exports in 10 years.”

“Over the past 15 years, trade with ASEAN has more than doubled under AANZFTA. Worth USD$4.13 trillion there is even more potential ahead, and Kiwi exporters are well-placed to seize those opportunities.”

Mr McClay says his focus in Malaysia will be on advancing New Zealand’s priorities with ASEAN counterparts and giving Kiwi businesses the certainty they need in a volatile global environment.

“At a time of global uncertainty, strong trade ties with ASEAN, and through AANZFTA, are essential. They mean more opportunities for exporters, more jobs for New Zealanders, and more growth across our regions.”

During his visit, Mr McClay will take part in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Ministers’ Meeting, the ASEAN Economic Ministers’ Closer Economic Relations Meeting, and the East Asia Summit Economic Ministers’ Meeting.

Mr McClay departs New Zealand on 23 September and returns on 26 September.
