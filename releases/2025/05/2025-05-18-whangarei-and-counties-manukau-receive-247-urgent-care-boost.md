Faster, more accessible urgent care for communities across Auckland and Northland will be delivered through Budget 2025, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The Government is making a significant investment to improve access to urgent and after-hours healthcare nationwide, including across the Northern region,” Mr Brown says.

“Strengthening urgent and after-hours care is a key part of our plan to ensure all New Zealanders – including Aucklanders and Northlanders – can access timely, quality healthcare, when and where they need it.

“Budget 2025 will fund a new 24/7 urgent care service identified for Counties Manukau, providing more accessible after-hours options and easing pressure on the region’s already busy emergency departments, including Middlemore.

“A new 24/7 urgent care service in Whangārei has also been identified, significantly improving access to care outside normal hours in Northland’s largest city.”

Communities across Auckland and Northland will also benefit from extended opening hours, and greater support for rural and remote providers, with changes being rolled out over the next two years.

“These investments will give people – especially in rural and remote communities – greater access to essential services like diagnostics and urgent medicines when they need them.

“More options in the evening, overnight, and on weekends for locals will also reduce pressure on emergency departments and deliver better outcomes for patients.”

Key Budget 2025 initiatives for the Northern region include:

- A new 24/7 urgent care service identified for Counties Manukau by late 2025.
- A new 24/7 urgent care service identified for Whangārei from 2026.
- Maintaining all existing urgent and after-hours healthcare services in the region.
- Extended after-hour services identified for Dargaville, Hokianga, Kaitaia, and Wellsford.
- Improved services for rural and remote Northland communities, including better access to diagnostics, urgent medicines, and 24/7 on-call clinical support.

“This Government is investing more in health than ever before, with a record $16.68 billion over three Budgets to improve health outcomes for Kiwis.

“Our investment will give Aucklanders and Northlanders more choice, reduce wait times, and bring care closer to home,” Mr Brown says.
