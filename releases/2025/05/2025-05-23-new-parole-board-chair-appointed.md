Retired High Court Judge Jan-Marie Doogue has been appointed chairperson of the New Zealand Parole Board, Attorney-General Judith Collins announced today.

“I welcome the appointment of someone with Justice Doogue’s legal acumen and administrative experience to this demanding role,” Ms Collins says.

Justice Doogue began her legal career with Cairns Slane in 1983 and became a partner of the firm in 1986. She joined the partnership of Morrison Morpeth in 1990 before joining the independent Bar in 1992 and being appointed a District and Family Court Judge in 1994.

She was appointed Chief District Court Judge in 2011 and served on the High Court Bench from 2019-2024.

Justice Doogue replaces Sir Ronald Young, who recently stood down after serving two terms,” Ms Collins says.

“I want to thank Sir Ronald for the able and committed leadership he provided throughout his tenure as chairperson, and in particular to the focus he placed on the role of victims within the parole process.”

Justice Doogue takes up her appointment on 15 July 2025.
