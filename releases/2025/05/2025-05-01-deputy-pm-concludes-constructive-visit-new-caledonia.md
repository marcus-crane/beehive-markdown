Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters has concluded a constructive and positive visit to New Caledonia - New Zealand’s closest geographical neighbour.

Mr Peters met the French Minister for Overseas Territories, Manuel Valls, and the President of the Government of New Caledonia, Alcide Ponga.

“We came to listen and learn, and to demonstrate New Zealand’s support for the continuation of dialogue on New Caledonia’s institutional future, led by Minister Valls,” Mr Peters says.

“These institutional discussions in Nouméa over the coming days send a positive signal to the Pacific region about the good faith efforts underway to return peace and stability to New Caledonia,” Mr Peters says.

“Since last year’s crisis, New Zealand has consistently said that no matter your position on New Caledonia’s institutional future, violence is not the answer - and progress can only be made through careful, inclusive dialogue.

“We wish everyone involved in the discussions in Nouméa in the coming week well. New Zealand, just like France and all our Pacific partners, wishes for a stable, secure, prosperous and cohesive New Caledonia.”

When Mr Peters last visited Nouméa in December 2024, he announced a support package to help New Caledonia’s recovery. During this visit, he recommitted New Zealand, during discussions with Minister Valls and President Ponga, to support New Caledonia’s development through ongoing constructive, practical support.

“New Zealand is not perfect, but we do have experience over recent decades in promoting economic development across our regions and communities,” Mr Peters says.

“Economic development is the key to social cohesion. We hope there are pragmatic lessons we can share with New Caledonia, working closely with French authorities, including through Caledonian entrepreneurs gaining a deeper understanding of the Māori economy.”

Mr Peters and Minister Valls also discussed regional security and foreign interference in the Pacific.

“New Zealand and France are long-standing partners on Pacific security issues, including humanitarian assistance and disaster response and fisheries surveillance. We have a shared interest in ensuring that the Pacific Islands region is protected from efforts by external influences to undermine good governance and democratic decision making.”

While in New Caledonia, Mr Peters also met with the Director-General of the Pacific Community (SPC), Dr Stuart Minchin. They discussed the SPC’s role in providing technical and scientific support to help drive the development of Pacific Island countries.

Mr Peters also met New Zealand Defence Force personnel taking part in the military exercise Croix du Sud currently under way in New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna, focused on humanitarian assistance and emergency response. In the exercise, NZDF staff are working alongside forces from other Pacific countries and likeminded partners - hosted by the French Armed Forces in New Caledonia.

Mr Peters arrives back in New Zealand later today.
