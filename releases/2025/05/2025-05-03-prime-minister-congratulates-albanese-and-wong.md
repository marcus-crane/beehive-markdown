Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has congratulated Anthony Albanese on winning the Australian Federal Election, and Lawrence Wong on winning the Singaporean election.

“I have been in touch with both Mr Albanese and Mr Wong to offer my congratulations on retaining office,” Mr Luxon says.

“When we spoke, Mr Albanese and I affirmed our strong working relationship. New Zealand has no better friend and no greater ally than Australia. Working together is even more important now as we both face the most challenging global environment in decades. We are stronger on the world stage together. 

“I look forward to continuing to work with Mr Albanese on a range of issues including our shared security, partnering in the Pacific, and making the trans-Tasman business environment ever more seamless.”

Mr Luxon has also congratulated Lawrence Wong on his recent election victory in Singapore.

“Singapore is a key partner for New Zealand in Southeast Asia, and I am eager to continue to strengthen our bilateral relations and collaborate on regional and global challenges.

“Both Australia and Singapore are indispensable partners for New Zealand. I am committed to enhancing our cooperation with both countries as we navigate the complexities of the current global landscape.”
