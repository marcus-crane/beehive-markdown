Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey will mark the official start of peer support specialists in Waikato Hospital’s Emergency Department in Hamilton today. It makes Waikato Hospital the fifth major hospital to implement the service since September last year.

“We know that this service is making a real difference for people presenting in mental health distress or crisis at busy emergency departments. We are moving quickly to rollout this important service around New Zealand, and it has been incredibly humbling to hear how it’s making a genuine impact for vulnerable Kiwis in a time of need,” Mr Doocey says.

“Having a peer support specialist available to listen and understand what someone is going through, share their story, and reassure them there is a way forward can provide enormous comfort when people need it most. Importantly, they can also better connect people with community mental health services, if needed, and help with a better outcome for the individual. 

“I believe the peer support workforce has been underutilised for too long in New Zealand. There is a big opportunity to better utilise it as we also roll out Crisis Cafes around New Zealand and look to refresh the eating disorders strategy.”

The initiative was first launched at Middlemore Hospital in September 2024, since then services have got underway at Auckland City Hospital, Wellington Hospital and Christchurch Hospital. A further three emergency departments will be added in the near future.

“I’ve been clear that one of the biggest barriers to people accessing timely mental health and addiction support is workforce shortages. While this Government is focused on significantly growing the clinical workforce, we need to make sure we are also looking to innovative ideas, like peers in ED, to make sure we are doing everything we can help New Zealanders access quality support when and where they need it,” Mr Doocey says.

- In March 2024, the Government announced that eight Peer Support Specialist services would be stood up across two years using uncommitted funding. Each Peer Support Specialist service is estimated to cost between $300,000 and $500,000 per hospital.
- A $1 million workforce fund has also been set up by the Government to provide Level 4 NZ Certificate in Health and Wellbeing (Peer Support) training and specific training for working in emergency departments
