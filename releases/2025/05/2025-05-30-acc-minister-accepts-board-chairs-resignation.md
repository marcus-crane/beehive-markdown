ACC Minister Scott Simpson has today accepted the resignation of ACC Board Chair Dr Tracey Batten and thanked her for her service.

“I would like to thank Tracey for her leadership of, and contribution to, the board of ACC since her appointment in 2019” says Mr Simpson.

“I acknowledge her decision to step down and thank her for her commitment to supporting better outcomes for New Zealanders. I wish her well for the future.

“ACC as an organisation is currently confronting a number of challenging issues, including significant financial challenges and concerns around the overall performance of the organisation. 

“In the coming months I will be making announcements about my turnaround plan for ACC.”

The resignation will be effective from 11 June 2025.

Current Deputy Chair David Hunt will step up to be Interim Chair.
