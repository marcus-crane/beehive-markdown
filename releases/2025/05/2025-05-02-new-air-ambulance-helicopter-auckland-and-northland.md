A new air ambulance helicopter commissioned today will significantly enhance emergency medical response capabilities across Auckland and Northland, Associate Health Minister Hon Casey Costello and ACC Minister Scott Simpson announced today.

“This state-of-the-art helicopter represents a major advancement in aeromedical service delivery, and we are pleased to see it become operational in this part of the country,” Ms Costello said during a visit to Northern Rescue’s Ardmore base where the aircraft is stationed.

“It’s great news that this helicopter will support people living in these regions as part of the Government’s investment to upgrade some of New Zealand’s air ambulance fleet.

“The Leonardo AW169 aircraft incorporates modern design features and capabilities that improve flight performance, increase safety and reliability, and enhance patient care during transport — especially in challenging weather conditions or remote environments.”

The helicopter is one of nine new or near-new aircraft being introduced across the national Emergency Air Ambulance Helicopter Service fleet throughout 2024/25, jointly funded by Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora and the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).

“Ageing helicopters are being replaced in Auckland, Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Taranaki and Wellington,” Ms Costello says.

The Auckland/Northland helicopter is the third in this fleet renewal programme and the first AW169 to enter service under this investment.

“Our Emergency Air Ambulance Helicopter Service plays a critical role in enabling time-sensitive care for people in urgent need, particularly in regional and rural communities,” Mr Simpson says.

“Notably, this is the first helicopter purchased using ACC Investment debt financing, which has enabled the ageing helicopter replacement programme to progress at a faster pace. This financing arrangement has contributed to savings of around $500,000 per year.”

The regions next in line for improved aircraft capabilities include Northland, which will also receive two additional leased near-new aircraft ready for use from July and Wellington, which will get a brand new replacement aircraft in August.

The Government’s broader investment into fleet renewal is aimed at replacing ageing helicopters with more capable, efficient, and future-ready alternatives.

“Our air ambulance services do great work and it’s important that the helicopter fleet is upgraded,” Ms Costello says. “Health NZ and ACC are also redesigning the aeromedical operating model to make the best use of air ambulance resources, and the $128 million of rotary wing air ambulance funding provided by the Government.”
