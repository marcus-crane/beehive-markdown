New Zealand’s sheep and beef farmers are delivering record-breaking red meat export sales and driving strong farmgate returns to the rural economy Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says.

“March was a standout month for our red meat exporters, with a record $1.26 billion in export sales—a 34 per cent increase on March last year. First quarter exports also hit $3.28 billion, up 28 per cent from last year. This is great news for farmers, processors, and rural communities across New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

The global appetite for high-quality, natural protein is continuing to grow, driving strong prices for New Zealand lamb and beef.  
“This reflects a deeper, longer-term shift in global consumer behaviour. People everywhere are turning to clean, high-quality, safe and sustainable animal protein, and New Zealand is delivering,” Mr McClay says.

Beef and Lamb New Zealand’s February forecast projected red meat export revenue to achieve an additional $1.2 billion for the 2024/25 production year. That outlook is well on track, thanks to our farmers hard work and world leading production, with April Stats NZ data confirming an additional $1.1 billion or 5 per cent increase in red meat exports over the past year bringing the total value to $10.6 billion.

The Government is doing its part to ensure farmers see more returns at the farm gate by restoring confidence, slashing red tape, and opening up new opportunities.

**Key actions to drive growth and keep Wellington out of farming include:**

- Removed agriculture from the Emissions Trading Scheme
- Currently banning full farm-to-forest conversions
- Started the process of replacing the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management
- Moved to fundamentally reform the Resource Management Act
- Halted unworkable winter grazing, stock exclusion, and Significant Natural Area (SNA) rules
- Begun rebalancing Te Mana o te Wai to restore the rights of all water users
- Disbanded Labour’s He Waka Eke Noa initiative
- Repealed the punitive Ute Tax
- Commenced an inquiry into rural banking
- Halted Labour’s costly Freshwater Farm Plans
- Completed a number of Free Trade Agreements that offer farmers greater opportunity in new markets
- Removed $733 million in non-tariff trade barriers

“Our farmers are world leaders in producing high-quality, safe, sustainable, grass-fed meat. This Government backs them 100 per cent, and we’ll keep cutting through the red tape so they can keep delivering for New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.
