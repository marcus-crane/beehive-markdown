Work is moving at pace on the State Highway 1 (SH1) Belfast to Pegasus Motorway and Woodend Bypass project, with geotech work beginning this week, Transport Minister Chris Bishop and Minister for the South Island and Associate Transport Minister James Meager say.

“The Government is committed to supporting the fast-growing Waimakariri District. This much needed transport infrastructure will boost economic growth, reduce congestion, improve safety and access to housing growth areas. SH1 approaching Woodend currently carries around 21,500 vehicles per day, of which nine percent is freight. The traffic volume is expected to reach 28,000 vehicles per day by 2048. There have been 280 crashes on SH1 through Woodend between 2014 and 2023, with three fatalities and 25 serious injuries,” Mr Bishop says.

“The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Board endorsed the investment case for the Belfast to Pegasus Motorway and Woodend Bypass Road of National Significance in November 2024, which proposes:

- Widening the southern section of the existing SH1 from two to four lanes.
- A new four-lane motorway bypass in the northern section.
- A grade separated interchange at the Williams Street intersection with SH1.
- Replace the Pegasus roundabout with an overbridge and signalised intersection.
- Kaiapoi Bridge seismic strengthening and widening.
- Construction of new bridges over the Cam River and overbridges at Woodend Beach Road and Gladstone Road.
- Tolling to support the construction and maintenance of the road.

“In addition to endorsing the investment case in November last year, the NZTA Board also approved $68.1 million in initial funding to complete detailed design work and advance an early works package, as well as around $37 million for property acquisition. Further funding to begin and complete main construction will be considered by the NZTA Board in due course.

“Delivering this project has substantial benefits, including a three-minute travel time saving along the state highway, and up to 10 minutes at peak. It is also expected to reduce traffic through Woodend from 21,000 vehicles per day to 8,000, and a reduction in deaths and serious injuries from 5.6 to 1.25 per year.

“The investment case endorsed by the NZTA Board sets an investment envelope between $800 million and $1 billion to design, consent, and construct the project.

“The Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2024 (GPS) requires NZTA to consider tolling for all new RoNS. The investment case confirms tolling is possible and the revenue will support the construction and maintenance of the road. The Government will consider this recommendation and announce next steps of the process in due course.”

“NZTA is continuing to move at pace on the project with the detailed design contract awarded to Aurecon and Tonkin + Taylor in March this year. Getting geotech works underway is an essential part of the design phase of the project and will involve drilling around 70 boreholes up to 35 metres deep and digging pits at individual sites within the construction area,” Mr Meager says.

“The geotechnical investigations will look at ground conditions, including soil and rock types, groundwater depths and the strength of soil and rock. This work will take around two months to complete.

“Once geotechnical data is available, NZTA will confirm the scope and design of an early works package and prepare and lodge consent applications. The early works package will likely begin in early 2026, while main construction is likely to begin later in 2026. The project is expected to take four years to complete.

“SH1 is a nationally strategic freight route and provides critical access to Christchurch City, Christchurch International Airport, Lyttelton Port, and the major health, education, commercial and industrial services in the Canterbury region. Delivering the Belfast to Pegasus Motorway and Woodend Bypass Road of National Significance will significantly improve reliability of the corridor and ensure people and freight can get where they need to go, quickly and safely.

“I want to thank local Waimakariri MP Matt Doocey, Banks Peninsula MP Vanessa Weenink, Kaikoura MP Stuart Smith and Mayor Dan Gordon who have been a staunch advocates of this project, as well as wider Canterbury MPs Hamish Campbell and Nicola Grigg. I know we’re all looking forward to seeing more progress in the months and years ahead as we move into construction as soon as possible.”
