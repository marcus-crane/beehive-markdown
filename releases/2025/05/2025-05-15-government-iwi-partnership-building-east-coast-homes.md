Te Tai Rāwhiti - East Coast whānau will enjoy greater access to modern housing thanks to a Government-Iwi partnership that will deliver 150 affordable homes, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

The Government is partnering with East Coast Iwi collective Toitū Tairāwhiti in a $75 million development that will deliver 150 affordable rentals in Gisborne, providing warm, dry, sustainable homes in a high-needs region for housing. The Government is contributing $49 million, and the Iwi collective is contributing the rest.

“The Tūranga Tangata Rite development today contributes to the Government’s wider $200 million commitment, announced in February, to deliver at least 400 affordable rental homes for Māori across key regions,” Mr Potaka says.

“The new Te Tairāwhiti houses, as well as being affordable rentals, will be warm, dry, and sustainable, designed for whānau to live well. With multigenerational layouts, shared communal spaces, and energy-efficient materials, these homes reflect tikanga Māori and are built to support wellbeing. They will also help get people out of temporary accommodation and into homes.

Mr Potaka says the project will also support local workforce development, with a strong emphasis on creating opportunities for Māori tradespeople and apprentices, supporting long-term employment pathways and regional economic resilience. 

“Many of the 150 homes we are announcing today will be constructed right here in Tairāwhiti, meaning local jobs with local businesses, and a growing local economy. These are homes for whānau, built by whānau.

“The development also tackles housing shortages in the region. Te Tairāwhiti has one of the highest levels of housing need in the country. Together with iwi, we are delivering the scale of housing that whānau deserve to address shortages and create opportunity.

“On top of this, partnering with land-owning Māori housing providers, and iwi collectives like Toitū Tairāwhiti, to build more affordable housing for Māori, makes sense.

“Through these partnerships, the Māori entities bring land and a minimum of 50 percent funding on the house build costs, meaning the Government can optimise its spending to enable more homes to be delivered in areas with high housing deprivation for Māori like the East Coast, Hawke’s Bay, Bay of Plenty, and Northland.”

Since November 2023, the Government has enabled the delivery of 1,000 homes through the Māori Housing programme. All the homes should be completed by mid-2027. The 150 homes in the Te Tairāwhiti development are scheduled to be completed by the end of December 2026.

**Notes to editor:**

Toitū Tairāwhiti Housing Ltd is a partnership between a collective of Ngai Tamanuhiri, Rongowhakaata, Te Aitanga a Mahaki and Ngati Porou, plus neighbouring iwi partners in the Bay of Plenty, Te Whanau-a-Apanui and Te Whakatōhea.

The Government will be contributing $48.75 million from the $200 million announced in February 2025 to enable 400 affordable rental homes targeted to supporting Māori land-owning entities to deliver more affordable rentals. Toitū Tairāwhiti will providing the remaining $26.25 million.

The homes will be manufactured off-site at two facilities, Builtsmart in Huntly and the other in Gisborne in a joint venture between Builtsmart and Toitū Tairāwhiti. This method allows the homes to be built quickly and then transported to site.
