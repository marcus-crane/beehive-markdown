The Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence, Karen Chhour, has launched a one-stop-shop directory for family violence training that will aide support workers to access training that helps them safely recognise and care for people and families affected by family violence.

“The family violence workforce are a deeply caring and thoughtful group who provide support to people and families during the most challenging times of their lives.

“Knowledge around how to best support these people continues to grow, and this directory will allow these frontline heroes to access the latest best practice guidance and find specific training that aligns with the Family Violence Capability Frameworks,” said Mrs Chhour.

The Family Violence Entry to Expert Capability Framework outlines the capabilities needed to respond safely and effectively to family violence for different roles and responsibilities. It sets out the expected capabilities of workers and practitioners, supporting them to continuously learn and increase their capability through Essential, Entry, Enhanced, and Expert levels.

“The message from victim survivors has been clear, we need to support this vital workforce by ensuring they are able to support them in ways that enable them to get to safety, stay safe, and start healing.

The training directory is another step in our efforts to build an effective system and strengthen the capabilities of those working in it. It’s just one way we are helping the helpers,” concluded Karen Chhour.
