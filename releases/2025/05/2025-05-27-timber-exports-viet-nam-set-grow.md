Forestry and Trade Minister, Todd McClay has today announced a new Cooperation Arrangement between New Zealand and Viet Nam that will grow timber exports and remove potential trade barriers for our forestry sector.

The arrangement will see New Zealand’s radiata pine recognised under Viet Nam’s evolving timber construction standards, opening more opportunities in this growing market.

“This will grow our $2.68 billion two-way trade and significantly bolster the $48 million worth of sawn timber we currently export into Viet Nam,” Mr McClay says.

“Viet Nam’s economy has more than doubled in the past decade and is expected to see some of the fastest global income growth over the next. That means more construction, more demand for sustainable products—and more opportunity for New Zealand timber.

“This agreement adds value to New Zealand wood products and offers opportunities in addition to exporting logs. It boosts our export potential and helps double our exports by value in 10 years.”
