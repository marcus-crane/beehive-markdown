North Island communities still building back after the 2023 weather events will get extra funding to complete recovery works on local roads, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Last year’s Budget invested nearly $1 billion into recovery and resilience projects in regions hit by Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary weekend floods.

“The Government remains committed to the communities working to rebuild lives and neighbourhoods. This Budget provides $219 million additional funding to help get these local roads repaired as quickly as possible.

“The NZ Transport Agency will distribute the funds to local councils to complete recovery works across affected local roads. This work is vital to restoring access to goods, services and employment opportunities to impacted communities in the North Island.”

Five councils will likely receive a share of the $219 million, across a three-year period from 2026/27:

- Central Hawke’s Bay District Council
- Gisborne District Council
- Hastings District Council
- Napier City Council
- Wairoa District Council

“This initiative provides certainty for councils that the Crown has made funding available to complete recovery works that allow them to budget appropriately for 2026/27 onwards.

“The Government remains committed to supporting people in affected communities to move on with their lives and look to the future.

“A resilient transport network in the East Coast and Hawke’s Bay regions will help deliver the infrastructure communities need to grow their businesses, get their kids to school, and ensure goods get from A to B efficiently.”

**Notes to editors:**

- ‘Response’ means the initial work necessary to restore safe access to damaged roads. ‘Recovery’ means the work needed to reinstate roads to their previous levels on a ‘like-for-like’ basis.
- Since 2023, the Crown has provided $2.9 billion for North Island weather events-related response and recovery works across the state highway and local roading network.
- Funding will be allocated over three years:
  
  - $106 million in 2026/27
  - $82 million in 2027/28
  - $31 million in 2028/29
- Auckland, Northland, Waikato, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, the Tairāwhiti and Hawke’s Bay regions, and the Tararua district suffered extensive and devasting damage from the early 2023 North Island weather events – Cyclone Gabrielle and the Auckland Anniversary floods.
- Although the NZ Transport Agency and local councils have undertaken a significant amount of response and recovery work, a return to pre-weather event service levels is still some time away.
- Funding for 2025/26 recovery work has been provided through previous Budgets.
- Budget 2025 funding covers the NZ Transport Agency’s contribution to complete local road recovery works, subject to councils meeting their share.
  
  - Funding assistance rates are the contributions that the NZ Transport Agency makes from the National Land Transport Fund to co-invest with councils in local transport networks.
  - For local road recovery work, the NZ Transport Agency uses Crown funding to provide higher, bespoke assistance to affected councils.

Local councils are responsible for delivering their own work programmes and governance arrangements, although the NZ Transport Agency reviews and approves their funding applications.
