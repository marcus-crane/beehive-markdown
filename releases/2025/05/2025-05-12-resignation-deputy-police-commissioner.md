Police Minister Mark Mitchell today announced the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Jevon McSkimming, has resigned.

Mr McSkimming has been on suspension since last December. Deputy Commissioners of Police are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

Mr Mitchell said Mr McSkimming resigned today, with immediate effect, before he could be dismissed.

“I can confirm a process had been underway for the Prime Minister to consider recommending the Governor-General immediately remove the Deputy Commissioner of Police from office,” says Mr Mitchell.

“I instructed the Public Service Commission to commence the process to remove Mr McSkimming from office after allegations of a very serious nature recently came to light, separate to the investigation that led to him being suspended.

“The Policing Act is very clear: A Deputy Commissioner of Police must be a ‘fit and proper’ person. They are rightly held to the highest standards of conduct and this new information called into serious question Mr McSkimming’s fitness for office.

“When Mr McSkimming was invited to respond to these allegations he chose to resign. Mr McSkimming’s resignation has confirmed my view that his continuation in the role was untenable.

“Police advise that their investigations into Mr McSkimming will continue, notwithstanding his resignation.

“As the latest information remains subject to ongoing Police investigation, I am unable to provide further comment at this time.”
