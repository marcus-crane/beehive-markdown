Defence Minister Judith Collins has announced the recipients of the Minister of Defence Awards of Excellence to Industry, highlighting the significant contribution they make to New Zealand’s security, economy and workforce.

“Congratulations to this year’s winners, whose work strengthens New Zealand’s defence capabilities and demonstrates the highest standards, skills, innovation and impact on local communities,” Ms Collins says.

“The winners include a New Zealand and Tongan-based construction company, which built the Pacific Leadership Development Programme classrooms and fale in Tonga, and an augmented and virtual reality developer who built simulated training courses with the Royal New Zealand Navy.

“Defence looks forward to enhancing its partnership with industry to supply military assets, equipment and infrastructure following the release of the 2025 Defence Capability Plan, which outlines $12 billion of planned commitments over the next four years.”

Associate Defence Minister Chris Penk says this year’s recipients demonstrate industry is a trusted partner to Defence.

“About 800 companies supply critical products and services to New Zealand’s Defence industrial base, bolstering its resilience,” Mr Penk says.

“Defence is a major contributor to the economy, spending hundreds of millions of dollars locally on engineering and commercial services, maintenance, repair and training support.”
