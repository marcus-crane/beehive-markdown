The Government is tackling the spread of wilding pines and backing rural resilience with a 20 per cent increase in funding this year – taking the total direct investment this coming year to $12 million.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister Todd McClay, and Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says the Government is focused on protecting the productive heart of New Zealand’s economy.

“Wilding pines cost the rural community significantly and are often the bane of farmers lives, we have an obligation to work with them to control their spread, and reduce on farm burden,” Mr McClay says.

“This additional $2 million funding ensures those working to contain wildings over the next year can stay ahead of the spread. It’s a smart investment in rural productivity, land management, and our long-term rural resilience.”

More than two million hectares are affected by wilding infestations, with untreated areas expanding by an estimated five per cent each year. Left unchecked, the economic impact could reach $3.6 billion over 50 years.

Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says wilding pines threaten our farmland, water catchments, native biodiversity, and increase the risk of wildfires. They take over productive land, drain vital groundwater, and choke out native species.

“Since 2016, the Government has invested more than $150 million into the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme, alongside more than $33 million contributed by partners and communities,” Mr Hoggard says.

“This year’s investment continues to support the people doing the work – regional councils, iwi, farmers, researchers, and volunteers – who are making a real difference across ten priority regions.

“We’ve pushed back some of the worst infestations and protected key landscapes. This funding keeps that momentum going and gives landowners the tools to protect and restore productive land.”

The programme is led by Biosecurity New Zealand and delivered in partnership with councils, landowners, iwi, industry, and community groups.
