The Minister for Infrastructure has referred the first two non-listed projects into the Fast-track approval process under the Fast-track Approvals Act 2024.

“The Fast-track Approvals Act contains two pathways for projects to enter the Government’s new one-stop shop approvals process. 

“The first pathway, Schedule 2 of the Act – commonly referred to as the Fast-track list – contains 149 projects which can apply directly to the Environmental Protection Authority to have an expert panel assess the project, decide whether to consent it, and apply any relevant conditions. The first three expert panels are already underway and more are expected soon.

“The second pathway is for project owners to apply to the Minister for Infrastructure for referral into the Fast-track process. For this pathway, the Minister for Infrastructure must consult the Minister for the Environment and any other Ministers with relevant portfolios, along with iwi and the relevant local authority, before deciding whether to refer the project.

“I have today referred the first two projects into the Fast-track process. 

“One of these projects is the Ayrburn Screen Hub. This application is for the construction and operation of a film and television production facility on about 26 hectares of land between Arrowtown and Lake Hayes, Otago.

“The other project is Ashbourne in Matamata, Waikato. This application is for a residential and retirement development project of 530 new homes and 250 retirement units, along with associated commercial development and infrastructure and two solar farms with the capacity to power 8000 homes.

“These two projects may now move to the next stage in the Fast-track process by lodging substantive applications with the EPA to be considered by expert panels.”
