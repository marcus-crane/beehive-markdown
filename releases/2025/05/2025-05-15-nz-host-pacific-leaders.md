New Zealand will host leaders from across the Pacific next week, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti have announced.

“New Zealand is a Pacific country, and regular face-to-face dialogue is a crucial underpinning for our relationships throughout our region,” Mr Peters says. 

The Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Baron Waqa will visit New Zealand, engaging with Mr Peters and Dr Reti, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Climate Change Minister Simon Watts and a range of MPs from across Parliament.

“New Zealand’s membership of the Forum underpins much of our engagement in the region,” Mr Peters says. 

“Secretary-General Waqa’s visit will be an opportunity to discuss the Forum’s work on regional priorities, including health, education, security, and the environment.”

Ulu o Tokelau Esera Tuisano will make his first official visit to New Zealand, ahead of New Zealand and Tokelau marking a centenary of their constitutional relationship next year.

“New Zealand and Tokelau have enjoyed close ties for nearly a century. We are united by our shared New Zealand citizenship and mutual obligations and responsibilities,” Mr Peters says.

New Zealand will also host the Council of the University of the South Pacific in Auckland on 19-21 May. The meeting brings together 12 Pacific countries to guide the direction of the leading tertiary provider in the Pacific. 

“Our role as host reflects our steadfast commitment to advancing tertiary education and research through Pacific regionalism,” Dr Reti says.

Mr Peters will also meet with Tuvalu Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Panapasi Nelesone. He will reaffirm New Zealand’s commitment to supporting Tuvalu’s development priorities, including economic resilience.
