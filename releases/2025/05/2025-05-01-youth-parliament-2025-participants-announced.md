The 123 Youth Members of Parliament and 20 Youth Press Gallery members officially announced for 2025 represent the best of New Zealand, Youth Minister James Meager says.

“Our Youth MPs come from a wide range of backgrounds, and each have their own unique story, bringing diverse points of view to Parliament and a fresh way of looking at the biggest challenges we face,” Mr Meager says.

“Youth MPs will now engage with other young people in their community to gather their ideas and bring those views to Parliament, while Youth Press Gallery members will be drawing attention to the issues the Youth MPs are working on and helping generate interest around what happens.

“They will then take part in the Youth Parliament on 1 – 2 July in the Parliamentary precinct in Wellington, experiencing first-hand what it’s like to be at the highest decision-making table in the country.”

Among the 123 Youth MPs selected by MPs to participate this year are Maevi Fleming (17) from Roncalli College in Timaru who has been nominated by Mr Meager as his own Rangitata Youth MP.

Mr Meager says Maevi was someone who grew up in a similar background as he did, and who is now an advocate for a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

Other talented young people taking part include Abby Plom (17) from Auckland, selected by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and representing Botany.

Through her roles as School Student Representative and Chairperson of the Howick Youth Council, Abby says she’s realised how important it is for youth to be represented and heard, and how much work still needs to be done to create a fairer, more inclusive community.

Labour leader Chris Hipkins has chosen Ryan Grant-Derepa (17) from Upper Hutt as his Remutaka Youth MP.

Ryan wants to advocate for better pathways into employment so every young person, no matter their background, has the chance to build a future they can be proud of.

Youth Parliament also has its own Youth Press Gallery. Korus MacDonald (16) from Havelock North is the youngest Youth Press Gallery member selected for 2025.

Korus says the role of the Press Gallery within our democratic Parliament is a key interest of his, and he’s excited for the insights and learning experiences this opportunity will bring.

“Young people are our future, and it is fantastic we have youth who are passionate about causes that affect us all, both in and out of politics – and who have an interest in working to help make a difference. I encourage them to give their absolute best in every area,” Mr Meager says.

“I also want to acknowledge the members of the Multi-Party Reference Group in Parliament who’ve supported me in guiding Youth Parliament 2025, as well as the work of the previous Minister for Youth Matt Doocey for his advocacy in continuing Youth Parliament this year. I can't wait to see what our young people deliver at Youth Parliament 2025.”
