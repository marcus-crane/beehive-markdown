Cabinet has approved regulations that will give fuel companies until 1 November 2026 to increase the jet fuel they hold at or near Auckland Airport to protect New Zealand against unexpected fuel supply disruptions, Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones says.

“As an island nation far from the rest of the world it is essential New Zealand has uninterrupted access to air travel,” Mr Jones says.

“In 2019, an inquiry into the 2017 pipeline rupture recommended fuel companies invest in additional storage at or near the Airport ‘without delay’.

“Since 2019, fuel companies have allowed jet fuel cover to fall below the inquiry’s recommended resilience target of 10 days’ cover at 80 per cent operations, leaving New Zealand susceptible to the impacts of an unexpected fuel supply disruption.

“The regulations provide the extra impetus fuel companies need to avoid any further delay for investing in additional fuel storage.

“The 2017 fuel disruption saw almost 300 flights impacted. As our largest and busiest airport, is it essential we have enough jet fuel storage in place near Auckland Airport to help prevent future impacts to air travel in case of unexpected disruptions,” Mr Jones says.

“Fuel companies have told me they will invest in a new storage tank near Auckland Airport to meet the new requirement. Cabinet’s decision also updates existing rules to ensure fuel companies give government visibility on the amount of readily available jet fuel held near Auckland Airport.

“Fuel security is a top priority for this Government. This new rule along with our work to develop a fuel security plan will help keep the New Zealand economy moving and connected to the world,” Mr Jones says.
