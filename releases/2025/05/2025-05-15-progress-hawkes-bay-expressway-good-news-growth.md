Minister of Transport Chris Bishop has welcomed funding to proceed with groundwork and geotechnical investigations for the next section of the State Highway 2 Hawke’s Bay Expressway Road of National Significance project.

“The expressway is a vital link for the whole region and for road users from neighbouring regions. Progress on the next section of the project – which will better connect Napier to Hastings and increase growth and productivity – is good news for a region with massive economic potential but which is still recovering from Cyclone Gabrielle.

“NZ Transport Agency’s board has confirmed $7.65 million for the work, which will enable the project team to begin early ground improvements alongside Ngaruroro River Bridge and geotechnical investigations in section 2 of the project,” Mr Bishop says.

“This funding will make more efficient and reliable travel another step closer.

“When that work begins, crews will repurpose safe, tested silt from the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle, provided free by Hastings District Council to raise the level of the land and create a wide, flat surface – just like the work already completed alongside Tutaekuri River Bridge and the Kennedy Road overpass.

“That silt will then be left to settle for 12 months prior to additional construction work starting, subject to further approvals, consents and funding.

“The latest funding will also allow geotechnical investigations at Ngaruroro River Bridge and other locations. Geotechnical investigations are really important for this project – they help to determine the detailed design.

“Work is well underway onsite within the first section of the project, and on the detailed design work needed for that first section. Section 1 of the project focusses on Taradale Road to Pākōwhai Road, which has been identified as the most congested section of the expressway.

“I’m confident that by starting early groundwork and investigations for the next part of the project soon, we can get section 2 shovel-ready for main works construction, pending further approvals and funding by the NZTA board.

“I know how important this project is to get commuters and freight moving through the region more quickly and more safely.”

While this funding allows NZTA to get on with section 2 investigations and ground conditions, an investment case is in development for the remainder of the project (including section 2 improvements), which will determine decisions on next steps.

**Notes to Editor:**

- Section 1 of the project spans from the Taradale Road to Pākōwhai Road roundabouts.
- Section 2 of the project stretches from Pākōwhai Road to York Road roundabouts in the south and Taradale Road to Prebensen Drive roundabouts in the north.
- Prebensen Drive to York Road is the busiest stretch of the expressway, with the most problematic intersections, and it connects the main urban areas of Napier and Hastings.
- Construction of the main works on section 1 are expected to start in late 2025, subject to consents and funding, and be completed in late 2027.
- An investment case is in development for the remainder of the project (including section 2 improvements). This Corridor Investment Case will be completed later this year, and a decision will be made on whether to proceed to detailed design.
