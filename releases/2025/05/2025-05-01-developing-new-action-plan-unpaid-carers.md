The Government is taking action to better support unpaid and informal carers, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Penny Simmonds says.

Every morning across New Zealand, unpaid carers are helping loved ones get ready for the day — preparing meals, arranging medication, assisting with transport, and offering vital support, all while juggling jobs, study, and family life.

“Each day, around 500,000 unpaid carers provide essential support for New Zealanders with disabilities, illnesses, injuries, or addictions,” Ms Simmonds says.

“It’s critical work that often leads to better outcomes than clinical or residential care — and it eases the burden on our health and social services.

“But it’s tough work. Many carers are balancing these responsibilities with little formal recognition or support. They deserve better, and that’s exactly what this new Action Plan aims to deliver.”

Government agencies already provide targeted assistance for carers, including financial support, respite subsidies, and practical help. The Action Plan will build on this foundation and ensure carers’ needs are better understood and addressed.

The Ministry of Social Development is leading development of the Plan, working closely with the Carers Alliance, relevant government agencies, and a new Carers Advisory Group.

“The Advisory Group will include around 10 experienced members who reflect the breadth of the carer community — from young carers to those supporting disabled or older people,” Ms Simmonds says.

“There will also be opportunities for unpaid carers themselves to share their experiences and shape the plan.”

An interagency working group will oversee the development, with the final Action Plan expected by the end of the year.

“A lot has changed since the last Action Plan expired at the end of 2023. It’s time to listen again and deliver a plan that genuinely supports the people who care for our communities every day,” Ms Simmonds says.
