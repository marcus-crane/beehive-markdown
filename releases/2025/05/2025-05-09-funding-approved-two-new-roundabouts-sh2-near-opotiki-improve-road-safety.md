Two intersections on either side of the Waiotahe River Bridge on State Highway 2 (SH2) near Ōpōtiki will be made safer, with funding approved by the NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) to deliver new tear-drop roundabouts and complete the SH2 Wainui Road to Ōpōtiki safety improvements project, Minister of Transport Chris Bishop says.

“Located on a sweeping curve, the intersections of SH2 with Ōhiwa Beach Road and Waiotahe Valley Back Road, either side of the Waiotahe River Bridge, are considered high-risk. With two fatalities, one serious injury, and three minor injuries occurring between 2014 and 2023, upgrades to these two intersections are critical to improving safety for local road users,” Mr Bishop says.

“Delivering safe roading infrastructure that supports economic growth and productivity is a priority. SH2 between Ōpōtiki and Whakatāne is a main route for locals, tourists, and freight between Tauranga and Gisborne. Around 5,000 per day vehicles use SH2 between Ōpōtiki and Wainui Road, with 15 percent of those being heavy vehicles.

“With poor forward visibility and constrained shoulders, the current alignment of the intersections either side of the Waiotahe River Bridge makes it difficult for drivers approaching the area on SH2 to see vehicles wanting to turn right onto the state highway and vice versa. NZTA has now confirmed funding to replace these high-risk intersections with two new tear-drop roundabouts. 

“NZTA will now move to complete the detailed design, finalise land acquisition requirements, complete resource consent applications, and procure a contractor to deliver the works. Construction is expected to begin in mid-late 2026 and take approximately 12 months to complete. This follows and complements work already underway to construct a roundabout at the intersection of SH2 and Wainui Road.

“Construction of the two new tear-drop roundabouts, minor re-alignment of the road, and other associated work, is expected to cost around $10 million. Final costs will be known once a contractor is confirmed.

“I want to thank the local community in advance for their patience as this important work to make SH2 safer is carried out and I look forward to this work beginning as soon as NZTA it is able to get underway.”

**Notes to Editor:**

- The 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme prioritises investment in road safety and efficiency by encouraging safer driving behaviour, vehicles and infrastructure. Funding is available for improvements at the highest-risk locations, which includes these two intersections either side of the Waiotahe River Bridge.
- Once complete, these two new tear-drop roundabouts will complement each other in a ‘dog bone’ arrangement, either side of the Waiotahe River Bridge, with road users no longer able to turn right over lanes of active traffic in a high speed 100kmph environment on the state highway.
- Instead, vehicles joining SH2 from Ōhiwa Beach Road or Waiotahe Valley Back Road will have a left turn only and be able to drive over the bridge to safely turn around at the other roundabout and head in the opposite direction.
- The SH2 Wainui Road to Ōpōtiki safety improvements project is being delivered by NZTA in three sections:
- **Section 1 (Complete)** - Safety improvements included wider shoulders, side barriers, edgeline and centreline rumble strips, signs and road markings. Improvements along SH2 were made between Wainui Road and Waiōtahe Valley Back Road and Appleton Road to Woodlands Road. This work was completed in 2023/2024.
- **Section 2** **(Construction to begin mid-late 2026)** – Upgrades to intersections of SH2 with Waiōtahe Valley Back Road and Ōhiwa Beach Road. A tear-drop roundabout either side of Waiōtahe Bridge. To complete final design late 2025, construction expected to begin mid/late 2026 and completed in approximately 12 months.
- **Section 3 (In construction now)** - SH2 / Wainui Road intersection upgrade (Matekerepu).  A new roundabout is being constructed at this location. Work began in April 2025 and expected to take 12 months to complete.
- The total funding budgeted for the SH2 Wainui Road to Ōpōtiki safety improvements project  (Sections 1, 2, and 3) is $37.5M. Each section costs circa $10 million, with the remaining funding covering the business case, concept designs, investigations, land acquisition, resource consents and consent requirements to deliver the works.
