Record global sales and strong grower returns from Zespri confirm that New Zealand’s horticulture sector is back on track and growing fast—driven by hardworking growers and a Government focused on lifting productivity and cutting red tape.

“This week’s announcement by Zespri of more than $5 billion in global sales for the 2024/25 season marks a 31 per cent increase on the previous year, with a record 220.9 million trays sold. Direct grower returns have topped $3 billion for the first time, highlighting both strong demand and growing confidence in the sector,” Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says.

“The horticulture industry is going from strength to strength as export revenue is set to reach $8.0 billion this year, up 12 per cent on last year and kiwifruit is leading the way,” Associate Agriculture Minister Nicola Grigg says.

“This Government is backing growers with practical policy, better market access, and fewer bureaucratic obstacles to increase returns at the farm gate,” Mr McClay says.

“Last year, we moved at pace to bring the EU Free Trade Agreement into force many months ahead of schedule, saving New Zealand kiwifruit exporters $43 million in tariffs in the first year alone. Since then, kiwifruit exports have increased by 69 per cent, contributing a further $316 million.”

Key actions the Government has taken to free up horticulture and drive farmgate returns include:

- Removing barriers to vegetable growing
- Improving the Freshwater Farm Plan system
- Passing an RMA amendment bill focused on primary sector needs
- Rebalancing the hierarchy of obligations for Te Mana o te Wai
- Introducing a replacement National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management
- Introducing pragmatic rules for on-farm water storage
- Investing more in catchment groups – empowering local decision-making
- Providing further funding for East Coast debris clean-up
- Ceasing the implementation of new Significant Natural Areas (SNAs)
- Increasing investment into Rural Support Trusts
- Committing over $400 million to accelerate emissions-reduction tools for farmers
- Expanding market access through new and existing trade agreements in the EU, UK, UAE, GCC and launching negotiations with India.
- Removing $733 million in non-tariff trade barriers

“We’re focused on farmgate profitability and cutting the red tape that’s been holding growers back,” Mr McClay says.

“Our primary sector is firing again, and this Government is going to keep backing it every step of the way,” Ms Grigg says.
