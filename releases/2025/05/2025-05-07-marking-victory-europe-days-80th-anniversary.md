The Government is encouraging New Zealanders to mark Victory in Europe Day’s 80th anniversary today by paying tribute to those who fought for freedom and peace.

“On the 8th of May 1945, the Second World War in Europe came to an end, bringing relief and hope to millions after six years of devastating conflict,” Heritage Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Today marks a significant milestone in world history, and a poignant moment for New Zealand.

“I encourage all New Zealanders to commemorate this day in their own way. Whether that is by laying a tribute at a local war memorial, pausing to take a moment of quiet reflection, or simply learning more about New Zealand’s effort in this global fight for peace,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“New Zealand played a crucial role in the Second World War, with about 140,000 New Zealanders serving in military forces overseas,” Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“By the end of the war, nearly 12,000 New Zealanders had lost their lives, and 9,000 had been taken as prisoners of war. Many more served on the home front, supporting the war effort in numerous ways.”

“The nation’s contributions spanned various theatres of war, from Egypt, Italy, and Greece to Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and our people lie in cemeteries around the world.

“We must never forget their service and their sacrifice,” Ms Collins says.

“VE day is a time to remember the immense sacrifice of all who contributed to the Second World War effort, in particular our veterans, of whom fewer than 100 remain with us,” Veterans Minister Chris Penk says.

“As we honour this significant anniversary, we reflect on the courage of those who fought for peace and acknowledge that the most meaningful way to uphold their legacy is by striving for a world free from conflict.”

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage has detailed a variety of ways people can commemorate this significant moment on [its website.](https://www.mch.govt.nz/news/80th-anniversary-end-second-world-war)

The Second World War ended for New Zealand on 15 August 1945, when conflict ceased in the Asia-Pacific region with Japan’s surrender.
