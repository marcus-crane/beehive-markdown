The Government is ensuring all Year 0 to 8 students have access to high quality, hands-on science kits through Budget 2025, helping pave the way for New Zealand’s future scientists, problem-solvers, and innovators.

“We want students to love learning about science. Hands-on learning improves critical thinking and science understanding, which are essential for student success in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics). This investment will help lift science engagement and achievement in classrooms across the country and inspire our future meteorologists, marine biologists and software engineers,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

Budget 2025 is investing $39.9 million over four years into developing and delivering science kits for schools nationwide. The kits will be designed to support teachers to confidently deliver practical science learning, aligned with the new science curriculum. Teachers using the kits will also have access to professional development modules to support the use of the new resources in their classrooms.

“These practical resources, include hands on experiments and engaging equipment for each year level of the Year 0-8 curriculum.  The kits will help students build their foundational knowledge and skills early and help bring science to life.

The kits will undergo development and begin to be available from the start of the 2026 school year. They will also be available in te reo Maori, with dedicated pūtaiao kits and bilingual resources available to meet the needs of all learners.

“This initiative directly supports the Government’s economic growth agenda by investing in the future talent pipeline that will drive productivity, boost wages and power a more competitive and resilient economy. These benefits will positively impact sectors like agritech, clean energy, biotech and advanced manufacturing, where kiwi innovation already leads the world.

“We want our children to be excited by science, to be captured by hands on learning so that we are inspiring the next generation of creators, inventors and great problem solvers,” Ms Stanford says.
