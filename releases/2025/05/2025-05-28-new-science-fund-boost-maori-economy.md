Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti and Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka have today announced He Ara Whakahihiko – a new, consolidated fund designed to unlock the economic potential of Māori-led research and innovation.

This forward-focused initiative brings together and streamlines previous funding mechanisms to deliver more targeted, impactful investment in science and technology that supports Māori success and drives national prosperity.

“This Government is committed to backing Māori participation in science and innovation, not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it strengthens New Zealand’s overall economic performance,” says Dr Reti.

“He Ara Whakahihiko will help break down the barriers that Māori researchers and entrepreneurs face and ensure stronger representation in our science and technology workforce.”

Dr Reti says the new fund supports the Government’s broader agenda to reform and refocus the science, innovation and technology system.

“We are delivering the most significant transformation of our science and innovation system in decades. By clarifying our priorities, streamlining processes, and focusing on commercial outcomes, we’re laying the foundations for a more prosperous, tech-driven New Zealand,” says Dr Reti.

The Ministers say He Ara Whakahihiko merges two previously separate funding streams to enhance efficiency and maximise returns on public investment.

“If the Māori economy is to continue its positive trajectory, we need to actively support innovation and science today to create tomorrow’s commercial products and technologies,” says Mr Potaka.

“This smarter, sharper fund supports our Government’s economic growth agenda, particularly the Going for Growth with Māori I Tōnui Māori approach, by helping Māori innovators take good ideas to market and build high-value enterprises.”

**He Ara Whakahihiko** includes two targeted investment pathways:

- **Ara Whaihua – Impact Pathways for Research**: Focuses on near-term implementation and commercialisation of science-led initiatives. It backs 12-month work programmes led by Māori-facing organisations, delivering real economic impact.
- **Rangapū Rangahau – Research Partnerships**: Supports two-year collaborative projects that strengthen science capability and build durable partnerships between Māori-facing entities and New Zealand’s wider innovation ecosystem.

Approximately $2 million is devolved to the Health Research Council to help develop people and support organisations in health research, with a focus on turning research into products or services that benefit the economy.

“We’re focused on outcomes. That means getting innovation off the whiteboard and into the world—creating jobs, lifting productivity, and enhancing wellbeing for Māori and all New Zealanders,” says Mr Potaka.

He Ara Whakahihiko reflects the Government’s commitment to smarter public investment, a high-performing science sector, and a more productive, inclusive economy.

The fund will open for proposals on 20 August 2025.
