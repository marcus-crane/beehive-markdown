Trade, Investment and Agriculture Minister Todd McClay has wrapped up a successful programme hosting Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, His Excellency Eng Abdulrahman A. AlFadley, in Auckland this week for the 9th New Zealand–Saudi Arabia Joint Ministerial Commission.

“This visit builds on growing momentum in our trade relationship with Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf region following the conclusion of the New Zealand-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement,” Mr McClay said.

“With Saudi Arabia being our largest export market in the Gulf and the GCC trade deal soon to be signed, we’re opening new doors for Kiwi exporters —particularly in agriculture, agri-tech, food innovation and fintech.”

The delegation of 37 Saudi officials and business leaders engaged in a packed programme, highlighting New Zealand’s strengths across food security, innovation, and primary production.

**Businesses and organisations visited included:**

- Auckland Business Chamber
- Vessev (Electric hydrofoil vessel)
- Westbury Stud Farm
- University of Auckland (Space Institute and satellite testing)
- Moana Seafood
- Fonterra
- The FoodBowl-NZ Food Innovation Auckland

“From dairy and seafood to clean tech and research partnerships, the opportunities for collaboration are real and growing. The GCC trade agreement will deliver duty-free access for 99% of our exports over time and ensure New Zealand businesses are well-positioned in one of the world’s most dynamic regions,” Mr McClay says.

“The Government is focused on unlocking export growth and backing New Zealand’s exporters to succeed globally.”
