A combination of new talent and proven experience will leave the Transpower New Zealand Ltd Board well equipped to lead the company during a critical period of growth and development, State Owned Enterprises Minister Simeon Brown says.

Mr Brown has announced the elevation of director Michele Embling from 1 June 2025 to Transpower Board Chair to succeed outgoing Chair Dr Keith Turner.

“Ms Embling’s elevation reflects her exceptional leadership expertise, and deep understanding of critical issues,” Mr Brown says.

“Ms Embling brings extensive financial expertise as a Chartered Accountant, Chair of Transpower’s Audit and Risk Committee, and former PwC Board Chair. Her strengths include sustainability knowledge, relationship-building, and holding management to account, alongside a commitment to ethical standards and stability during change.

“The reappointment of director Parekawhia McLean from 1 June 2025 ensures stability and continuity for the Board. Her governance experience, public sector expertise, and knowledge of New Zealand’s energy sector, Te Ao Māori, and major infrastructure projects bring significant value.”

Mr Brown also welcomed the range of strengths and experience that three new directors will bring to the Transpower Board.

“Leon Grice’s appointment effective from 28 May 2025, enhances Transpower’s innovation and adaptability through expertise in real-time data, complex systems, and asset management. His focus on cost efficiency, resource utilisation, and financial oversight complements his proven and approachable governance style,” Mr Brown says.

“Kevin Palmer’s appointment effective from 28 May 2025, strengthens the Transpower Board with his expertise in finance, strategy, and performance management.

“As the new Audit and Risk Committee Chair, he will bring a focus on financial rigour, operational efficiency, and delivering for shareholding Ministers.

“Bruce Parkes brings extensive leadership experience in telecommunications, energy, and resource management. His skills in stakeholder relations, advocacy, and political and sector knowledge will support Transpower’s capital expansion and strengthen its strategic leadership during this period of growth.”

Mr Parkes will commence his term from 1 August 2025 following his retirement from his role at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“I would like to thank outgoing board Chair and director Dr Keith Turner for his contributions to the Transpower Board over the past three and a half years. Dr Turner has developed and maintained a culture that has made the Board more focussed on performance and strategy.

“I also want to extend my best wishes to departing Board member Vanessa Oakley. Her extensive background in corporate and public sector organisations in both New Zealand and the UK, as well as her considerable experience in infrastructure and utilities, have been a great asset to the Transpower Board.

“Transpower plays a critical role in the electricity sector as both New Zealand’s national grid owner and electricity system operator. Their market updates and infrastructure programme help ensure electricity is supplied across New Zealand, now and into the future.”
