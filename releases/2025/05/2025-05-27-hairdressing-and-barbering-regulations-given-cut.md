Regulation Minister David Seymour says that from the end of July, barbers and hairdressers will be freed from costly, annoying, and pointless regulations. The Government is scrapping 80s-era rules so hairdressers can focus on cuts, instead of compliance.

“This review and the changes announced today show the power of a sector review,” Mr Seymour says. 

“Much like the perm, hairdressing regulations from the 80s are outdated and costly. Freedom is back in style though, by the end of July this year existing regulations will be revoked.” 

Cabinet accepted all of the changes recommended by the Ministry for Regulation. 

“Existing regulations aren’t making a practical difference to safety, but the compliance is frustrating and costly. We anticipate that revoking all existing regulations will save the industry a minimum of about $1 million per year.” Mr Seymour says.

“The review found that existing regulations are either unnecessary, already managed by other rules, or applied inconsistently between local authorities. 

“Local government is responsible for setting annual registration fees. These can range from anywhere between $140 to $495 depending on location. 

“Examples of absurd rules include how far apart salon seats should be, how bright the lights in the business are, whether you can have a ‘cuppa’ with your cut, and whether dogs are allowed in salons. From the end of July now these decisions will be up to the business owner. 

“Compliance with health and safety, building regulations, and general public health requirements is required already. There is no reason to also require compliance with hairdressing regulations from the 80s which aim to achieve the same thing – manage health risks. 

“The Ministry for Regulation will work with the Ministry of Health on guidance for industry related to hygiene, disinfection and sanitation practices in salons and shops to manage public health risks. This will be given when existing regulations are revoked and will accompany Worksafe’s existing guidance for the industry. 

“The Ministry for Regulation will then monitor the new regulatory system and report back to me on its effectiveness in two years. Work is also underway with the Ministry of Justice to respond to the issues with alcohol licensing raised by submitters.

“In a high-cost economy, regulation isn’t neutral. It’s a tax on growth. Every completed review makes it easier to do business, access services, and innovate in New Zealand. The Hairdressers and Barbers Sector Review is another example of what smarter regulation looks like in action.”
