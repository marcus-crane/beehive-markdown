Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced Hamish Cooper as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.

“New Zealand’s relationship with the UK is one of our most important.

“Mr Cooper is one of New Zealand’s most senior and experienced diplomats and is eminently well-qualified to take on this significant role,” Mr Peters says.

Over his 40-year career at the Ministry, Mr Cooper has held several important roles including as New Zealand’s Ambassador to Japan, Russia, and Türkiye.

He will take up the role in September.
