The Government is backing farmers to lift on-farm productivity and improve land management through investment in catchment groups that support practical, locally-led solutions.

Agriculture Minister Todd McClay and Associate Environment and Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard says Budget 2025 commits $36 million over four years through MPI’s On Farm Support team—including $4.3 million for long-standing groups and new regional projects.

“This funding supports farmer-led groups that are already delivering real results on the ground—improving water quality and land management, and helping farmers adapt to changing conditions,” Mr McClay says.

“It includes $2.8 million in 2025/26 to extend funding for six established groups and the New Zealand Landcare Trust, giving them certainty to keep delivering trusted programmes in their communities.”

The groups receiving continued support include Thriving Southland, Rangitīkei Rivers Catchment Collective, Wai Wānaka, Hurunui District Landcare Group, Eastern Plains, and King Country River Care.

Associate Agriculture Minister Andrew Hoggard says the Government is also investing in two new regional projects to expand reach and impact.

“We’re putting $900,000 into the Karamu River Catchment Collective to support sub-catchment groups across the Heretaunga Plains, and $670,000 into the Piako Waihou Catchment Trust, which will deliver five demonstration sites focused on wetland restoration, waterway management, and the retirement of unproductive land,” Mr Hoggard says.

“Catchment groups are a practical way to empower farmers to collaborate, innovate, and share knowledge. Farmers know their land best—this investment gives them the tools and support to manage it in a way that boosts productivity and delivers long-term environmental gains.”
