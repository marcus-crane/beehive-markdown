Māori Development Minister Tama Potaka today confirmed the appointment of Gerrard Albert of Whanganui, Ngā Paerangi, to the Waitangi Tribunal for a three-year term to fill a vacancy.

Mr. Albert is the former Chair of Ngā Tāngata Tiaki o Whanganui, the post-settlement governance body for Te Awa Tupua. He has over 20 years of experience in Treaty settlement negotiations and more than 30 years in natural resource management, including his pivotal role in the Whanganui River Settlement. His expertise in these areas will make him a valuable addition to the Tribunal.

“With his extensive experience in Treaty matters, Gerrard will bring invaluable knowledge and leadership to the Tribunal,” Mr. Potaka says. “His appointment will ensure the Tribunal continues its important work in hearing and reporting Treaty claims in a timely manner.”

Mr. Potaka also expressed confidence that Mr. Albert’s appointment will support the progress of Treaty based Māori-Crown relationships.

“Having a diverse range of expertise on the Tribunal is key to ensuring we continue to deliver effective and timely outcomes for Māori and the Crown.”

I whakamanatia e te Minita Whanaketanga Māori Tama Potaka i te rangi nei te kopounga o Gerrard Albert nō Whanganui, Ngā Paerangi, ki Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi mō te toru tau hei whakakī i tētahi tūranga wātea.

Ko Matua Albert te Heamana tawhito o Ngā Tāngata Tiaki o Whanganui, te rōpū mana poari i muri i te whakataunga mō Te Awa Tupua. Kua 20 tau te roa e mahi ana ia i ngā whakaritenga whakataunga Tiriti, ā, kua 30 tau ia e mahi ana i ngā mahi whakahaere rawa māori, tae atu ki tōna tūranga nui i te Whakataunga mō te Awa o Whanganui. Nā tōna tohungatanga ki aua wāhi ka noho puiaki tana tāpiringa ki te Taraipiunara.

“Nā te nui o tōna wheako i ngā take Tiriti, ka mauria mai e Gerrard te mātauranga kāmehameha me te ārahitanga ki te Taraipiunara,” te kī a Minita Potaka. “Nā tana kopounga e mātua whakarite ka haere tonu ngā mahi nui a te Taraipiunara i te rongo me te whakatakoto pūrongo e pā ana ki ngā kerēme Tiriti i roto i te wā e tika ana.”

E māia ana hoki a Minita Potaka mā te kopounga o Matua Albert e tautoko i te kauneke o ngā hononga Māori-Karauna e ahu mai ana i te Tiriti.

“Mā te whai tohungatanga whānui e pā ana ki te Tiriti he mea nui ki te mātua whakarite he kaha tonu mātou ki te tuku i ngā putanga whai hua, arotau hoki mā te Māori me te Karauna.”
