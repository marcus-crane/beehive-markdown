The Defence Force’s ageing maritime helicopters will be replaced to increase the defensive and offensive capability and surveillance range of New Zealand’s frigates, Defence Minister Judith Collins announced today.

“The replacement of the Seasprite helicopters will also extend the Navy’s ability to support non-combat tasks such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” Ms Collins says.

“Together with a $957 million investment in Defence Force activities, personnel and estate, the $2 billion plus budgeted to replace the helicopters represents the first tranche of the Government’s $12 billion of planned commitments to upgrade the Defence Force over the next four years. I will have more to say about investments in the coming year at the Budget.

“There is no economic security without national security. Global tensions are increasing rapidly, and Defence personnel need the right equipment and conditions to do their jobs.

“As a maritime nation we are prioritising naval capability. The new helicopters will be able to go further and carry larger loads, including weapons, personnel and equipment – all of which is critical for Defence to protect New Zealand and New Zealanders.

“A business case for these helicopters will be considered by Cabinet this year but today we are confirming the money to pay for them has been put aside.

“The $957m investment in Defence equates to $239m a year over four years.

“Our personnel are being called upon to go more places, more often and for longer to play New Zealand’s part in contributing to global security. This funding will enable them to do that.

“Activities that will be funded include:

- $150m for the Defence Force to sail, fly, patrol and train more often;
- $39m for personnel allowances for such things as deployments;
- $20m for international deployments;
- $3m to increase essential engagement with international partners;
- $26m for critical estate maintenance to improve accommodation, and working and training conditions for personnel.

“It is very clear that New Zealand is not immune from the increasing tensions being felt throughout the world,” Ms Collins says.

“Today’s announcement sets us on our path for defence spending to reach 2 percent of GDP by 2032/33.

“This is just the beginning as we work with our coalition partners New Zealand First and ACT to give our Defence Force the tools to enable New Zealand to increasingly step up both domestically and internationally

“We will pull our weight.”

- $150m each year ($600m for four years) for our Navy, Air Force and Army personnel to fly, sail, patrol and train more often.
