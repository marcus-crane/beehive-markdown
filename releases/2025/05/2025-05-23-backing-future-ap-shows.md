The Government is securing the backbone of rural New Zealand by supporting the volunteers and communities that bring A&P shows to life, Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says.

Budget 2025 delivers $400,000 over four years to support more than 90 A&P shows across the country, providing each with a direct grant of $1,000 a year to help keep these iconic events running.

“A&P shows are a cornerstone of rural life — they help bridge the urban rural divide, celebrate farming success, showcase our world best food and fibre, and are powered almost entirely by local volunteers,” Mr McClay says.

“This is about backing the people behind the scenes who put in the hours to make these shows happen. Their work keeps communities connected and our rural culture alive.

“When rural communities thrive, our whole country benefits. This is a practical investment in regional pride, rural resilience, and the communities that make our most productive sector stronger year after year,” Mr McClay says.
