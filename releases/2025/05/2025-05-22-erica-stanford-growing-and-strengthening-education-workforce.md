The Government is ensuring more Kiwi kids benefit from quality teaching and leadership in the classroom by growing the number of teachers and backing school leaders through Budget 2025.

“We know the most important part of a child’s education is the quality of the teacher in front of them. Developing the workforce of the future is one of my priorities for the education system. 

“We want to grow, promote and support the education workforce by backing and strengthening our educators who every day deliver real change in the classroom,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

To do this we are creating over 1,600 Full Time Equivalent teaching and learning support roles by 2028.

Key Budget 2025 investments include:

- $33 million to expand the School Onsite Training Programme (SOTP) by 530 places over four years and powering up marketing to reach more potential teachers in New Zealand and overseas.
- $30 million to support up to 800 teachers over four years to access an Aspiring Principal Programme and doubling the Leadership Advisory Service from 16 to 32 Leadership Advisors.
- $53 million to fund approximately 115,000 teacher registrations and practicing certificates over three years.
- $3 million to deliver targeted professional learning and development to teacher aides.
- $5 million into Professional Learning and Development for Literacy, Maths and Assessment, for 450-500 teachers working across Years 0-10.
- $14.7 million into professional learning and development for up to 51,000 teachers and kaiako to develop their skills and proficiency in te reo Māori and tikanga to levels where they can confidently use it in the classroom.

“This Government is implementing an ambitious education reform programme that is defined by pace, clarity and outcomes. It is crucial we support the teaching workforce who is leading this reform.  

“This builds on our continued commitment to support our fantastic teachers. We want to grow the skills and knowledge in our workforce. This not only benefits our educators, but gives our tamariki the very best chance to thrive at school and beyond,” Ms Stanford says.
