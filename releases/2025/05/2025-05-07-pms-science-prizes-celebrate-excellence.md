Some of New Zealand’s most outstanding scientific minds have been recognised at the 2024 Prime Minister’s Science Prizes Award Ceremony, held this evening in Wellington.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon praised the winners, acknowledging the crucial role that science plays in building a more productive, innovative, and sustainable New Zealand.

“This year’s top honour, the Prime Minister’s Science Prize, has been awarded to Dr Linda Johnson and the Endophyte Discovery Team at AgResearch,” Christopher Luxon says. 

“Their groundbreaking work to improve the health and productivity of ryegrass is making a tangible difference for New Zealand farmers, boosting yields while reducing reliance on pesticides.”

Ryegrass is the most commonly used pasture grass in New Zealand agriculture. The team’s research has led to the development of beneficial microorganisms that protect grass from pests and disease, while also enhancing drought resistance.

“This is an excellent example of science delivering real-world solutions.

“By improving the quality of pasture on our farms, we’re not only increasing our capacity to produce high-quality food, but we’re also supporting the growth of our economy and ensuring a more resilient future for our agricultural sector.”

The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes comprise five prestigious awards, with a total prize pool of $975,000. The 2024 recipients include:

 

- **Dr Olivia Harrison**, University of Otago – awarded the *MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize* for her multidisciplinary work in understanding and managing anxiety.
- **Dr Aiden Kiely**, Aorere College, Auckland – awarded the *Science Teacher Prize* for his dedication to equity and excellence in science education.
- **Professor Jemma Geoghegan**, University of Otago – awarded the *Science Communication Prize* for advancing public understanding of infectious diseases and guiding policy responses to pandemic threats in New Zealand and the Pacific.
- **Rena Misra**, Epsom Girls’ Grammar School – awarded the *Future Scientist Prize* for her innovative research into using fungi to improve stormwater filtration systems.

“Congratulations to all this year’s winners. Your achievements are a testament to the power of Kiwi ingenuity and scientific excellence,” Mr Luxon says. 

“Your work is not only advancing knowledge—it’s improving lives and building a better New Zealand for future generations.”
