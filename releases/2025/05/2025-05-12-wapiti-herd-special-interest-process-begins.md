Hunting and Fishing Minister James Meager will consider formally designating wapiti deer as a Herd of Special Interest (HOSI) in Fiordland National Park, which could cover more than 190,000 hectares. It is the second HOSI to be considered this year, following launch of the sika deer HOSI process in April.

“The wapiti HOSI represent an opportunity for economic growth in regional New Zealand. Better, healthier deer herds provide opportunities for domestic and international visitors to hunt the only free-range wapiti herd outside of North America,” Mr Meager says.

“The wapiti HOSI builds on existing community efforts of the hunter-led Fiordland Wapiti Foundation to manage the deer population for hunting and conservation purposes. The Foundation have been successfully managing populations in the Fiordland National Park for years, and this HOSI will give certainty and support to continue their work for years to come. 

“Not only do they undertake regular culling and manage the popular wapiti ballot, they maintain tracks and huts, and carry out thousands of hours of trapping to better protect vulnerable native species like whio/blue duck. A successful HOSI will improve herd and trophy health, better manage the impact of valued and other introduced species and continue to improve conservation outcomes such as improved biodiversity and protection for native flora and fauna.”

The next phase will involve targeted engagement with iwi/hapū and stakeholders – including Forest and Bird, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Game Animal Council, the Conservation Authority, relevant regional councils, and conservation boards.

The Department of Conservation will publicly notify a draft herd management plan after engagement with key parties is complete. This is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2025.

To support the wapiti HOSI, the Government will also introduce a bill to Parliament to clarify the designation of HOSI in national parks, through a small amendment to the Game Animal Council Act 2013. The bill will clarify that HOSI can be established in national parks as was originally intended and clarify the existing legislation.

“The legislation for HOSI needs to be clear and unambiguous,” Mr Meager says.

“The National Parks Act’s requirement to ‘exterminate’ introduced animals as far as possible is clearly at odds with the purpose of designating a HOSI, which is to manage game animals for hunting and conservation outcomes.

“The GAC Act always intended for HOSI to be allowed in national parks, and by introducing this bill, we aim to provide clarity for all involved. The legislation will retain the requirements for HOSI to be consistent with New Zealand’s wider conservation framework, including the preservation of indigenous habitats and natural features.”

“The public will have the opportunity to submit on the bill at the select committee stage and I look forward to hearing more about how we can improve conservation outcomes through hunting.”
