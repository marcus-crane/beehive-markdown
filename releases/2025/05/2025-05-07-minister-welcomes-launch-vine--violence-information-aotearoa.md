The Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence Karen Chhour has welcomed the launch of Vine (Violence Information Aotearoa) – the nation’s leading source of knowledge about sexual violence and family violence in Aotearoa New Zealand.

“This resource will be hugely useful for frontline services and everyone who cares for, and supports, victim survivors.

“Previously known at the NZ Family Violence Clearinghouse, Vine has been the national resource for family violence and sexual violence information for 20 years and is now launching a website that brings together best practice guidance for people working to prevent and respond to violence.

“It will equip everyone from the frontline, to researchers, to policy makers and even news media with good quality information and understanding of what is proven to work in eliminating violence,” said Karen Chhour.

This work is a fundamental part of Te Aorerekura, and its second Action Plan, which is currently being implemented to break the cycle of violence through evidence-informed investment and collective action.

The library carries over 7,000 records online, with 2,000 resources in the physical library. The knowledge hub provides key statistics, frameworks and guidelines, and Vine promotes events and news to keep people up-to-date with latest developments.

“I would like to congratulate Dr Charlotte Moore and the team at Vine for the work they have done to create a space that is easy to navigate and enables workforces to easily access information about violence prevention and effective practice.

“I encourage people to visit Vine and engage with the information there,” said Karen Chhour.
