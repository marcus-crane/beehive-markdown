The Government is backing the grassroots work of Rural Women New Zealand – the people who support and connect rural families, communities, and businesses across the country.

Budget 2025 includes a $250,000 investment for the 2025/26 financial year to help the organisation expand its reach during its centenary year and continue its vital role supporting rural families and communities.

“If agriculture is the backbone of the New Zealand economy, then rural women are its beating heart,” Associate Agriculture Minister Nicola Grigg says.

“Rural women are at the heart of our rural economy – they lead businesses, care for families, and hold communities together.

“By backing Rural Women New Zealand, we’re investing in the strength and resilience of the rural sector itself. This is about ensuring women have the resources and support they need to lead their communities into the next century.”

Founded in 1925, the organisation has stood the test of time by adapting to the evolving needs of rural women and their communities.

“Rural Women New Zealand has been a backbone of rural life for 100 years,” Minister for Rural Communities Mark Patterson says.

“This funding will support the important work they do every day – helping connect people to services, building strong local networks, and advocating for rural voices to be heard.”
