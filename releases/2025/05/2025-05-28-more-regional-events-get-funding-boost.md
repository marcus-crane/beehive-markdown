The Government is driving economic growth in the regions by investing $2.6 million in 152 regional events, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“I’m thrilled with the variety of exciting events on offer, encouraging more New Zealanders to enjoy and explore our beautiful country beyond the main centres,” Louise Upston says. 

“Events include the National Waka Ama Sprint Championships in Waikato, the National Jazz Festival in the Bay of Plenty, the 2026 Hokitika Wildfoods Festival, and NZ Premier Motorsport Summer Series events around the country.

“Some of the new events coming to the regions include the Whakapapa Festival, a non-skiing event occurring over June 2026, and Summernats NZ, a car festival in the Waikato.”

“I’m particularly pleased to support events in regions which traditionally don’t see as many domestic tourists,” Louise Upston says. 

“Investing in these events has a direct impact, with visitors spending money in local cafes, businesses and accommodation providers, driving economic activity in our communities.

“By growing regional tourism, our remote and rural communities can benefit from the economic opportunities it brings.

“Events are excellent drawcards to get more visitors into our regions, particularly in quieter parts of the year for the tourism and hospitality sector. 

“New Zealand is open for business, and we encourage both Kiwis and international visitors alike to explore and enjoy what New Zealand has to offer.”

Funding comes from the $5 million Regional Events Promotion Fund. Over its two rounds, the Fund has invested in 284 regional events.

The full list of funding recipients is available on the [MBIE website](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/immigration-and-tourism/tourism/tourism-funding/regional-events-promotion-fund/round-2-funding-recipients).
