Public reporting on key performance indicators for Oranga Tamariki show the Ministry is making strong progress on its most important goals.

In its second public reporting on key performance indicators, Oranga Tamariki has made progress across all four key priority areas emphasised by Minister for Children, Karen Chhour.

“In 2024, I identified four key priority areas that would make immediate improvements to the wellbeing and safety of children. I then directed the chief executive of Oranga Tamariki and his leadership team to provide regular updates on their progress, ensuring they are focussed and achieving their core purpose,” says Mrs Chhour.

The four key priorities for Oranga Tamariki are: 

- Ensuring the safety of children and young people
- Supporting caregivers
- Addressing youth offending
- Improving complaint management and practice.

“While there is always more we can aspire to provide for these young people, I am pleased by the clear improvements being made. 

“The percentage of children in care who have been visited by their social worker within the target time to ensure their ongoing safety and wellbeing has hit 96% compliance, putting Oranga Tamariki well on track to hit 100% in the near future.

The amount of young people in Oranga Tamariki care with a current caregiver support plan that sets out the actions that will be taken to meet caregiver needs, to enable them to provide quality care, has improved by 13% since I put these targets in place and is nearing our target already,” says Mrs Chhour.

Improving complaint management and practice ensures that both young people and their families are able to raise their concerns, and that these concerns will be addressed meaningfully.

“According to our latest report, the proportion of complaints audited that were handled in a way that fully met our high standards has made an 11% improvement and has already achieved its target.

“I am particularly pleased with the dramatic improvement against the reduction in youth offending target.

“Our goal is to ensure a 15% reduction in the total number of children and young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour by 2030. As of this month we’ve already achieved a 12% reduction in less than a year.

“There is still work to be done, not all targets are being achieved just yet, but the hard work of everyone from social workers and caregivers to Ministers across multiple portfolios is clearly getting results.

“I feel confident that Oranga Tamariki is focussed on its core purpose – the safety of children and young people in its care,” says Mrs Chhour.
