New investment in prison capacity and frontline staff will help reduce reoffending and keep the public safe, Corrections Minister Mark Mitchell says. 

"Our Government has restored proper consequences for crime. Because of that, there has been an increase in the prison population and fewer victims of crime.

“Budget 2025 invests more than $472 million over four years to ensure Corrections can continue to safely and securely manage the growing prison population. This includes funding for 580 new frontline staff, including 368 Corrections Officers. This is additional to the 685 new frontline staff funded through last year’s Budget.

“Corrections is ready to recruit these staff through an excellent recruitment campaign that has driven more than 110,000 applications since being launched in February 2024,” Mr Mitchell says. 

“We’re also investing in safe, fit for purpose prisons including redeveloping Christchurch Men’s Prison.

“Funding through Budget 2025 will help deliver 240 new high security beds at Christchurch Men’s Prison, along with a new Health Centre and Intervention and Support Unit containing 52 beds. 

“Phase 1 of the redevelopment will be designed, built, financed, and maintained for 25 years under a public private partnership. Corrections will retain responsibility for operations and custodial management of the facility.

“The new Intervention and Support Unit will provide dedicated specialist mental health support to prisoners who are at risk of harming themselves or others. This unit will be safer for staff and help prisoners with their mental health needs, preparing them to successfully take part in rehabilitation programmes.

“Our investment will ensure Corrections can meet other cost pressures due to the increase in prisoners and inflation.

“We’re investing in the frontline because we are serious about bringing back law and order and creating a safer New Zealand.”
