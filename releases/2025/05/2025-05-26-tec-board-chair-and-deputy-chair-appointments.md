Vocational Education Minister Penny Simmonds has announced the appointment of Dr Alan Bollard CNZM as Chair and Mr Robin Hapi CNZM as Deputy Chair of the Board of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

“I am pleased to confirm the appointment of Dr Bollard and Mr Hapi to these roles. They will provide strong leadership drawing on their considerable skills and experience,” Ms Simmonds says.

“Dr Bollard has been acting Chair since 26 March 2025. He is an experienced public sector leader and Chair, with exemplary governance and machinery of government knowledge, financial acumen and economic expertise.

“He was appointed to the TEC Board in November 2024 and brings extensive leadership experience, including as Governor of the Reserve Bank, Secretary to the Treasury, and Executive Director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat.”

Mr Hapi was appointed to the TEC Board in February 2025 and now takes on the role of Deputy Chair.

“Mr Hapi is a highly respected director and leader, with a strong record across multiple boards under successive governments,” Ms Simmonds says.

“His extensive knowledge of the education system, including wānanga and university leadership, commercial experience, and deep understanding of te ao Māori, is invaluable.

“These appointments support continuity on the Board and will ensure that the Board can utilise Dr Bollard’s and Mr Hapi’s extensive skills and experience in these leadership roles.

“This is critical as the TEC leads significant changes to the tertiary education and training system.”

The appointments are effective immediately and run through to 31 October 2027.
