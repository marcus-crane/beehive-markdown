The latest quarterly update from the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission shows that the value of infrastructure initiatives in the National Infrastructure Pipeline now totals $206.9 billion in the March 2025 quarter, an increase of nearly $3 billion since December, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop says.

The Pipeline is managed by the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission and provides a national view of current and future infrastructure projects and programmes, from roads, to water infrastructure, to schools, and more.

“The March 2025 Pipeline update also shows that the overall value of initiatives in the Pipeline with a confirmed funding source has increased, up $3.7 billion to $111.6 billion,” says Mr Bishop.

“A strong pipeline of infrastructure projects means a growing economy with more jobs and more opportunities for Kiwis.

“The Commission’s projections indicate at least $16.6 billion of total spend across all infrastructure sectors in 2025, which equates to nearly 4 per cent of our GDP – up from December’s projected 3.6 per cent of GDP spend across 2025.

“Three quarters of projected spend from initiatives with a confirmed funding source occur within five and a half years, providing important planning certainty for the sector.

“The Commission continues to work with infrastructure providers to improve the transparency and quality of information that is available. A more complete Pipeline improves the effectiveness and value that we can gain from this tool.

“It’s encouraging that the number of infrastructure providers who contribute to the Pipeline has grown with every quarter under this Government. There are now 114 organisations contributing, including central government, local government, and the private sector. This includes 64 councils, but leaves 14 councils that are yet to contribute, which I urge them to do as soon as possible.

“The Pipeline now includes information on more than 8,100 infrastructure projects that are underway or being planned. This stronger and more transparent pipeline will help New Zealand’s infrastructure construction sector plan ahead for major upcoming projects, ensuring they can hire and retain key staff in the right locations.

“The estimated value of projects in the Pipeline shifts over time as infrastructure providers finish projects, update their plans, improve the detail and accuracy of their submissions, and as more organisations share their project data.

“The March Pipeline update was the last opportunity for contributors to have their investment activity and intentions inform the draft National Infrastructure Plan, which is expected to be published in June ahead of public consultation.

“The June and September quarters will inform the final version of the Plan, which will be published in December.

“I encourage the remaining councils and any infrastructure provider who is not yet contributing to reach out to the Commission.”
