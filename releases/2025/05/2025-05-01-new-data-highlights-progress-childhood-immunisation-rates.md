New data released today shows steady improvements in childhood immunisation rates across the country, highlighting the Government’s commitment to ensuring every child gets the best start in life, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Improving childhood immunisation rates is a priority for our Government. The latest quarterly figures show immunisation coverage has improved across nearly all age milestones, with particularly strong gains at six, 12, and 24 months,” Mr Brown says.

“Overall, 24-month coverage for the second quarter of 2024/25 is up 2.1 per cent compared to the previous quarter. It’s encouraging to see our targeted approach, made possible by our Government’s record $16.68 billion health investment over three Budgets, is delivering real results.

“We’re seeing some standout improvements across the country. In Tairāwhiti, coverage at 24 months is up 12.7 per cent. The West Coast also saw a 12.7 per cent increase, with Taranaki up 5.4 per cent and Auckland up 4.5 per cent.”

The improvements reflect the Government’s health targets in action, which is focussing the health system on improving outcomes for Kiwis.

“Our Government is focused on delivering access to timely, quality healthcare for all New Zealanders. By investing in community-based services and growing our frontline workforce, we are enabling our health system to protect our most vulnerable.

“These results are a step in the right direction, and our focus remains on meeting our target of 95 per cent of children being fully vaccinated by 24 months of age.”
