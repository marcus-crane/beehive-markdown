While the punishments recommended by the Privileges Committee will remain as they are, the House’s vote on the report will take place following the Budget, says Leader of the House Chris Bishop.

“The actions that led to these punishments were unprecedented in their disrespect for Parliament and the taxpayers to whom we are accountable,” says Mr Bishop.

“Our position on the recommended punishments remains unchanged.

“It is critical that there are consequences for wrongdoing in Parliament. Te Pati Māori’s co-leaders have never accepted what they did was wrong. They have never apologised despite many opportunities, and it is not clear they even accept the jurisdiction of the Privileges Committee. They have never turned up to explain themselves despite numerous opportunities.

“The Budget is the central Parliamentary event of the year, which gives the House the chance to debate and then either endorse or reject the Government’s spending plans. Constitutionally, there is nothing more important than the Budget process which gives the House the opportunity to express confidence in the Government.

“Deferring consideration of the debate means all members will have the opportunity to debate and vote on the Budget. 

“If the Leader of the Opposition wants to waste taxpayers’ time by dragging out the debate on the Privileges Committee’s report and advocating for Te Pati Māori and its breaches of Parliament’s rules, he is welcome to. But New Zealanders will see that for what it is.”
