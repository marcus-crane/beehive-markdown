Now is the time for Kiwis to give New Zealand Sign Language a go as we take a week to celebrate the language, Disability Issues Minister Louise Upston says.

This week is New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) week. The theme is that “anyone can sign anywhere”.

“NZSL is an official language of this country, used by almost 25,000 people and the primary language for many Deaf New Zealanders.

“The Government, through the NZSL Board, invests $1.25 million each year to support initiatives promoting and maintaining NZSL. Included in that investment is the [NZSL dictionary](https://www.nzsl.nz/) which is a great resource for learning new words,” Louise Upston says.

“This Government is committed to better public services, delivering services and support that meet the needs of the Deaf community.

“The NZSL Board is now consulting on a draft NZSL strategy which will drive its work for the next five years and I am encouraging all New Zealanders with an interest to submit on the strategy and have their say.

“I encourage New Zealanders to learn some everyday signs this week, such as ‘good morning’ or ‘good evening’ or ‘thank you’.”

There are resources and activities on the [New Zealand Sign Week](https://nzsignlanguage.nz/nzsl-week/nzsl-week-resources/) website to inspire everyone to learn the language.
