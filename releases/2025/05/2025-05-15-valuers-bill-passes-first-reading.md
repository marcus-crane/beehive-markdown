A Bill that modernises and re-enacts the Valuers Act 1948 passed its first reading in Parliament today, Attorney-General Judith Collins and Minister for Land Information Chris Penk announced.   

“The Valuers Bill is on the Government’s revision programme for 2024-2026 as part of our ongoing work to keep legislation current and accessible,” Ms Collins says. 

“The Bill rewrites the 1948 Act in modern plain language and drafting style so the rules will be easier to understand and use.” 

The 1948 Act created the current scheme for the registration and discipline of land valuers and established the Valuers Registration Board and New Zealand Institute of Valuers.  

“We have also released an Amendment Paper to fix small issues in the 1948 Act that cannot be addressed in the Bill as introduced under the statutory revision powers,” Mr Penk says. 

“The changes include operational improvements consistent with other occupational regulation Acts, and amendments to promote consistency with legislation such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the [Legislation Guidelines](https://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/legislation-guidelines-2021-edition).” 

Releasing the Amendment Paper at the same time as introducing the Valuers Bill means the Primary Production Select Committee can call for public submissions on both the bill and the amendment paper, and consider them together.
