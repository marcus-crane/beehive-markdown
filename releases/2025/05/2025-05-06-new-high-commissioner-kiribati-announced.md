Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced Pati Gagau as New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Kiribati.

“Our diplomats play a critical role in advancing New Zealand’s interests overseas,” Mr Peters says.

“Nowhere is this truer than in the Pacific, where we strive to work with our Pacific partners to forge a more secure, more prosperous and more resilient future for our region.”

Mr Gagau has held a number of senior roles at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, managing development programmes and working across many of New Zealand’s important bilateral relationships in the Pacific. 

Mr Gagau has previously served as New Zealand’s Deputy Head of Mission in Samoa.
