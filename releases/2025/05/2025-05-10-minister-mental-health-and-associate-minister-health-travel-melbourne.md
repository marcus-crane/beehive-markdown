Minister for Mental Health and Associate Minister of Health Matt Doocey will travel to Australia on 12 May to attend Digital Health Festival 2025 in Melbourne. He will head a delegation of 23 New Zealand companies and organisations, to highlight the leading role New Zealand is playing in the digital transformation of healthcare.

“New Zealand has a proud history of innovation in healthcare. I am delighted to support the innovative, forward-thinking Kiwi companies at this year’s Digital Health Festival and showcase some of New Zealand's world-class healthtech solutions,” Mr Doocey says.

While at the event, Mr Doocey will deliver a keynote speech on New Zealand’s innovative approach to healthcare and take part in a panel discussion on 'Enhancing the Future of Patient Care – Innovation from the Edge'. He will also work directly with New Zealand companies to open doors to more opportunities for New Zealand businesses in Australia and globally. 

“Healthtech is one of New Zealand’s largest and fastest-growing tech subsectors, employing over 10,500 people globally. International collaboration is key to driving much-needed innovation in the industry and events such as this provide an excellent platform for fostering partnerships,” Mr Doocey says.

Digital Health Festival 2025 will run from 13-14 May, bringing together over 8,000 influential leaders and innovators to connect and share the latest developments in healthcare. A New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) hosted pavilion will be the focal point of New Zealand’s presence at the event.

Mr Doocey leaves for Melbourne on Monday 12th May and will conclude his visit on Thursday 15 May.
