Access to urgent and after-hours healthcare is being expanded across the central and lower North Island as part of Budget 2025 to deliver faster, more accessible urgent care, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“We’re investing in new and extended urgent care services across the Central region to ensure people can get the right care, at the right time, closer to home,” Mr Brown says.

“These improvements will make it easier for New Zealanders to get help when they need it – whether late at night, on weekends, or in more remote communities, while also reducing pressure on emergency departments.

“In Palmerston North, a new 24/7 service has been identified to provide the community with consistent access to timely, quality urgent care around the clock.

“A new daytime urgent care service has been identified for Lower Hutt, adding to the existing after-hours service and expanding access to urgent care seven days a week. This means people living in the Hutt will be able to access care during the day, without needing to wait or travel further for non-emergency support.”

These new and improved urgent care services will be introduced over the next two years, alongside continued support for existing providers and improvements to rural access.

“This investment will make a real difference for patients – with shorter travel times, better local options, and faster access to essential treatments like diagnostics and urgent medicines.”

Key Budget 2025 initiatives for the Central region include: 

- A new 24/7 urgent care service identified for Palmerston North by mid 2027.
- A new daytime urgent care service identified for Lower Hutt, building on the existing after-hours service in late 2025.
- Maintaining all existing urgent and after-hours healthcare services in the region, with capability to extend hours in central Wellington.
- Extended after-hour services identified for Dannevirke, Masterton, Levin, and Wairoa.
- Improved services for rural and remote communities, including better access to diagnostics, urgent medicines, and 24/7 on-call clinical support.

“This Government is investing more in health than ever before, with a record $16.68 billion over three Budgets to improve health outcomes for Kiwis.

“Our investment means people living in cities, towns and rural areas across the Central region will have better access to the care they need, when they need it,” Mr Brown says.
