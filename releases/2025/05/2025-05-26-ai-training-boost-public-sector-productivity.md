New artificial intelligence (AI) training will increase the uptake of AI and boost productivity in the public service, Digitising Government and Public Service Minister Judith Collins says.

“Across the public sector, AI offers a real opportunity to improve decision-making and deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders,” says Ms Collins.

“I want public service leaders to embrace AI and support their teams to use it safely and effectively.

“That’s why the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) and the Public Service Commission’s Leadership Development Centre have partnered to develop two new AI training programmes. 

A three-part AI Masterclass series is now available to senior leaders to improve the understanding of and use of AI within agencies. These sessions will cover core AI concepts and key decision-making considerations. 

The all-of-government AI Foundational Development Programme starts this month for general public service users. 

Around 50 participants from 10 agencies will be upskilled in basic AI concepts and present their own ideas for the use of AI. This will create a pipeline of agency-specific AI applications to improve productivity, cost efficiency and customer experience.

The five-week online course will be piloted from 26 May to 30 June and be repeated throughout the year. Material from these sessions will be published on the [LDC: Public Service Core Learning Hub](https://www.ldc.govt.nz/public-service-core-learning-hub).

“This initiative will enable greater use of AI in the public service, enhancing both the speed and quality of service delivery for Kiwis,” Ms Collins says.

“Government agencies are already seeing promising results and this training will build on them to transform the way our government serves New Zealanders.”
