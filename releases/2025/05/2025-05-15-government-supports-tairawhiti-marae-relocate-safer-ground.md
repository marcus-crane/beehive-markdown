Five Tairāwhiti marae impacted by the North Island weather events of early 2023, are moving to safer locations with support from the Crown,” said Mark Mitchell, Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery and Tama Potaka, Minister for Māori Development.

“The Marae Trustees of Puketawai, Hinemaurea ki Mangatuna, Okuri, Takipū, and Rangatira Marae – supported by their whānau and hapū – have made the difficult decision to relocate and re-establish their respective marae in new locations.

“The local council designated these marae, as Category 3 – High Risk, and not safe to occupy because of unacceptable risk to life from future extreme weather.

“Each of the marae have accepted the Crown’s support package and have acquired new sites to relocate to. The new sites are in close proximity within, or close to, their respective tribal boundaries,” says Mark Mitchell.

“The impact of the severe weather on the marae was devastating for the many whānau and hapū connected to these marae and their wider community.

“The decision to relocate is not an easy one and has come from the desire of the Marae Trustees to keep their marae, and their respective whānau, safe and secure, protecting the lives of those who might otherwise be at real risk from any future severe weather events.”

Minister for Māori Development, Tama Potaka says relocating the individual marae will take time.

“We expect the relocation works, including the rebuild of wharenui and whare kai where required due to the damage, will take place over the next two or so years. For some of the marae, the project is a complete rebuild.

“Reaching this point is a significant milestone. Most importantly, it will provide affected whanau and hapu peace of mind, and will have the added benefit of creating opportunities for SMEs and jobs. This augments the growing construction capability on the East Coast as a result of the mahi at Toitū Tairāwhiti and others,” says Mr Potaka.

Of the five marae three are located in the Uawa - Tolaga Bay area and the other two are in Te Karaka.

“The Crown is also working with two Kahungunu Marae, Tangoio and Petāne in Hawke’s Bay with support packages available to both marae so they too can reestablish in safer locations. These marae were also designated, by their local council, as having an unacceptable risk to life.”

A total of $136.215m, allocated from Budgets 23 and 24 will fund the entire Whenua Māori and Marae relocation Programme after North Island weather events. It includes the costs to relocate owners of 24 whenua Māori properties to safety as well as demolition of residential structures and covers some assistance to support affected sites of cultural significance, principally urūpa.

“The Crown recognises moving a marae requires careful navigation. This is not an easy journey, and we would like to thank the Marae Trustees for working with us to ensure the safety of people on marae,” Mr Potaka says.

**Note for Editors:**

In all cases ownership of the whenua remains with the existing owners.

The cost for each Marae relocation is commercially sensitive due to procurement undertakings.
