Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones have welcomed the formation of the first two Fast-track expert panels.

“At this year’s Infrastructure Investment Summit we announced that the first project applications had been accepted by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA),” Mr Bishop says.

“Judge Borthwick, the Panel Convener, and Helen Atkins, Associate Panel Convener, have now appointed expert panels to assess the Maitahi Village project and Delmore project applications respectively. These panels will commence their work on Monday 12th of May.

“Maitahi Village is a retirement village development in Nelson of around 180 residential dwellings (50 being Iwi-led housing), a commercial centre, and a retirement village with approximately 194 townhouses and 36 in-care facility units, and Delmore is an Auckland project of approximately 1,250 residential units, including features such as parks.

“Each expert panel will assess the project, decide whether to consent it, and apply any relevant conditions. Final decisions are expected for these applications by the 12th of September.

“The expert panels include members with technical expertise relevant to the project and expertise in environmental matters.

“This Government is serious about growing our economy, and doing its part to make infrastructure and housing quicker, easier, and cheaper to build in New Zealand. I am pleased to see the formation of these panels and look forward to watching the process move forward.”
