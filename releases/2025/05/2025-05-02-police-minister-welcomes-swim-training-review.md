Today’s announcement by the Commissioner of Police that Police will review the 2017 swimming training policy change in light of some recruits not receiving training while at the Police College is welcome and overdue, says Police Minister Mark Mitchell.

“When this policy was changed under the previous Government in 2017, I questioned this decision at select committee as I felt it was wrong for a coastal nation like ours, where Police Officers are often the first to provide assistance to people in the water, to relax the swimming requirements.

“The Labour Government at the time was adamant there would be no problem lowering the standard and that water competence would still be met.  

“Recent reporting has highlighted and unearthed the fact that the previous government’s approach has taken the focus off a swim standard.  It has become clear that the relaxation of the policy has had the effect of Police graduating the College in some cases having not been tested,” says Mr Mitchell.

“Since the Coalition Government was formed, Police have been working extremely hard to recruit against our target of 500 new officers by 27 November 2025. 

“Myself and Minister Costello have been clear that that was not to come at the expense of standards.  What has become obvious is that decisions made under the previous government around standards need to be revisited, and I welcome this decision by the Commissioner.  

“As a government we feel strongly that a swimming standard is important for both Police and public safety, and in coming into Government we supported a return to a 20-week recruit training course, rather than the 16-week in place when we came into government.  

“I am extremely proud of our police officers who do outstanding work and deserve to be supported through a comprehensive training programme that includes water safety.”
