The Government has today released an app to verify international digital credentials, Digitising Government Minister Judith Collins and Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston say.

“NZ Verify/Whakatūturu App will initially be used to verify select international mobile drivers’ licences, meaning visitors can rent a car or check in to a hotel with just their phone,” Ms Collins says.

From today, it will be able to verify mobile drivers’ licenses from Queensland, Australia, and the US states of California, New York, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, Utah, Puerto Rico, Iowa, New Mexico, Hawai’i, Alaska

“The NZ Verify app can be tailored to suit different needs, such as showing only confirmation of age and a photo when proof of age is required, ensuring that other personal details remain private. This marks a significant step forward for the privacy of digital credential holders, and improves trust and user safety.”

“Anything that makes it easier for tourists to visit New Zealand is always welcome,” Ms Upston says.

“Visitors with a mobile driver licence will now be able to use it here just as easily as they do at home, without the hassle of bringing a physical copy.

“Encouraging more tourists means more people staying in our hotels, eating in our cafés, spending in our shops and visiting our attractions, creating jobs and driving economic growth.

“I encourage every business who needs to verify visitors’ identities to download this app.”

Ms Collins says international mobile drivers’ licences are just the beginning, and additional credentials will be supported by NZ Verify in the future.

NZ Verify is now available for download via the New Zealand Apple Store and will be coming soon on the Google Play Store.
