Exceptional Kiwi businesses and outstanding individuals who are driving industry productivity, innovation and job creation have been honoured at New Zealand’s inaugural Minister for Manufacturing Awards.

“Manufacturing fuels the economy by contributing over 8.4 percent to New Zealand’s GDP, generating more than 250,000 jobs and reinforcing our position as a global competitor,” Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing Chris Penk says.

“The 2025 Minister for Manufacturing Awards celebrated the prosperity this industry drives and most importantly, the outstanding people behind it.”

Held yesterday evening at Christchurch’s premier industry showcase, SouthMACH, the event was hosted by Mr Penk in collaboration with Advancing Manufacturing Aotearoa.

“The calibre of finalists and winners reflects the strength and diversity of New Zealand’s manufacturing sector - from suppliers of sustainably harvested timber, to developers of ground-breaking recycling technologies and producers of life-saving medical equipment,” Mr Penk says.

“These businesses are led by innovative thinkers and powered by skilled, hard-working Kiwis. Their success is something we can all take pride in and shows that manufacturing will continue to play a significant role in shaping New Zealand into a world-class economy.”

The awards recognise excellence across four key categories. The winners are:

- **Manufacturing Apprentice of the Year** *supported by Enztec:*  
  **Michael Vitale – Pacific Steel**  
  Michael is working towards his Mechanical Engineering apprenticeship through Competenz at Pacific Steel.

Douglas Pharmaceuticals sets the benchmark for New Zealand manufacturing and is a worthy recipient of this award.

“I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the outstanding businesses and individuals honoured at the awards ceremony, and a sincere thanks to everyone who entered and attended,” Mr Penk says.

“Your dedication to building a thriving industry inspires the future generations of Kiwi makers and creators. I look forward to celebrating your achievements again at future Minister for Manufacturing Awards.”
