More than 80 per cent of New Zealand children are now fully immunised by 24 months of age – the highest rate since early 2022, recent Health New Zealand data provided to Health Minister Simeon Brown shows.

“This is a welcome step forward. Just seven months ago, 75.7 per cent of two-year-olds were up to date with their immunisations. Now, that figure has risen to 80.2 per cent – a 4.5 percentage point increase toward our goal of 95 per cent coverage by 2030. This is the highest rate in three years,” Mr Brown says.

This achievement comes as New Zealand confirmed a new case of measles in Auckland this week, underscoring the urgent need to protect both children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases.

“This case is a timely reminder: measles spreads quickly and can be dangerous, especially for young children. Every child deserves protection from serious illnesses, and that protection starts with immunisation.

“Immunisation not only protects you, but also helps protect those around you, including loved ones and vulnerable community members, from becoming seriously ill or spreading disease.

“That’s why improving childhood immunisation rates is a key priority for our Government. It’s encouraging to see that our targeted approach – backed by a record $16.68 billion health investment across three budgets – is delivering tangible results.

“This result shows our health targets in action, focusing the health system on improving outcomes for New Zealanders. By investing in community-based services and growing our frontline workforce, we are enabling our health system to better protect our most vulnerable.

“We still have work to do, but reaching 80.2 per cent of Kiwi children being vaccinated by 24 months of age is a big step forward. After years of decline, we are now seeing the positive impact of dedicated efforts in general practice, alongside co-ordinated and targeted community-led outreach and support. This result is encouraging, and our focus remains firmly on reaching 95 per cent coverage.

“If your child has missed any vaccines, now is the time to catch up. Don’t wait for an outbreak to take action,” Mr Brown says.
