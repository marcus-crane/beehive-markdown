Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has today announced the new Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, and the members of the Prime Minister’s Science and Technology Advisory Council.

“We have world-class scientists in our universities and research institutes, but they’re working in a system held back by outdated settings. To unlock the full potential of science and technology, we need a sharper focus on commercialisation, better access to global investment, and clearer priorities at home,” Mr Luxon says. 

“This Council is a new initiative to get clear, independent advice to ensure our investments in science and technology are delivering real outcomes for New Zealanders.

“The Council will provide advice on long-term priorities for government-funded science and innovation. They will help identify areas of focus that will have the greatest benefit for Kiwis and our economy. 

“I also expect them to provide bold and courageous advice about those areas that aren’t delivering value for New Zealanders and may need to be deprioritised. It’s about making sure we are investing in what will have the greatest impact for New Zealanders.”

Members of the Council bring a strong mix of scientific, commercial and strategic expertise. They include:

- Sir Peter Gluckman
- Craig Piggott
- Professor Merryn Tawhai
- Komal Mistry-Mehta
- Malcolm Johns
- Dr John Roche

“I am also pleased to announce that Dr John Roche has been appointed as the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor. In this role, John will support robust decision making by providing high quality, independent scientific advice. John, in his capacity as my science advisor, will also be a member of the council.”

Minister for Science, Innovation and Technology, Hon Dr Shane Reti, will chair the Council, with Dr John Roche as deputy chair.

“These are highly capable individuals who understand both the science and the economic imperatives. They are prepared to make the bold calls needed to ensure the system is future-focused, outcome-driven and aligned with our economic goals,” Mr Luxon says.

“A strong, well-directed science and innovation sector is critical to lifting productivity, creating high-value jobs and supporting a more resilient and competitive economy.”

The Council will provide its first formal advice to the Prime Minister and Minister Reti later this year.
