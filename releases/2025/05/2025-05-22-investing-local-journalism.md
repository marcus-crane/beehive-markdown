New funding will ensure New Zealanders have access to independent local journalism that keeps them informed about what’s happening in their communities, Media Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Regional journalism helps keep communities informed and holds decision-makers to account. 

“Budget 2025 will invest $6.4 million over four years in council, community and court reporting across New Zealand. The funding will be distributed through NZ on Air.

“Open Justice and Local Democracy Reporting have been successful programmes with an emphasis on reporting, rather than opinion. This funding expands them. 

“It will get funding into regional newsrooms so that more local frontline journalists can report on the things that matter to their audiences. 

“Budget 2025 also adjusts Radio New Zealand’s funding. 

“RNZ has had funding increases in recent years, most notably a boost of $26 million a year in 2023, on top of a previous increase of $7.3 million per year in 2020.

Budget 2025 reduces RNZ funding by approximately $18 million over four years, or $4.6 million a year, equivalent to approximately 7 per cent of its annual Crown operating Budget of $67 million. 

“This savings initiative recognises that government-funded media must deliver the same efficiency and value-for-money as the rest of the public sector. 

“I expect RNZ to improve audience reach, trust and transparency. I am confident the organisation can do so while operating in a period of tightened fiscal constraint.

“This comes as the Government considers how it can modernise media legislation through its Media Reform package. 

“New Zealand media, like media around the world, continue to face significant challenges. We need modern legislation, so the media sector is financially sustainable in the years to come. 

“I am considering submissions from the recent consultation on media reform. I will have more information on next steps for media modernisation in the coming months,” Minister Goldsmith says.
