New Zealand and Australia are redoubling our efforts to navigate an increasingly challenging strategic environment together, Foreign Minister Winston Peters says.

“It’s been an honour to be hosted in Adelaide today by Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong,” Mr Peters says. 

“We wanted to get across the Tasman as soon as possible after the Australian general election because there is so much for us to tackle together.

“New Zealand and Australia face an unpredictable, contested and disordered region and world. We are strongest when we meet these challenges together.”   

Ministers Peters and Wong meet formally for Australia–New Zealand Foreign Minister Consultations twice a year. Today’s FMCs in Adelaide follow those held in Melbourne and Auckland in 2024 and covered bilateral cooperation, priorities in the Pacific, regional security in the Indo-Pacific and global tensions and developments. 

“Australia is New Zealand’s closest, most important and most likeminded partner, and it has been invaluable to discuss in detail with Minister Wong today how we will work together in the period ahead on the issues that matter most to our countries and our peoples,” Mr Peters says.

“The global environment is such that New Zealand and Australia face more concerted threats to our interests and values than we have for generations. In that context, we have been able today to update each another on our respective government priorities at an important moment in our countries’ political cycles, while focusing on how and where we can cooperate for mutual benefit.

“Our relationship is as strong as ever, and we are committed to maintaining this close bond now that Prime Minister Albanese, Foreign Minister Wong and their colleagues have secured a second term.

“These consultations highlight not just the value New Zealand places in our relationship with Australia, but also our enduring commitment to work together to promote our shared international goals, such as Pacific development and security,” Mr Peters says. 

Minister Peters will depart Australia for Sri Lanka tomorrow, where he will begin a tour of South Asia
