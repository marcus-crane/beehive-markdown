The Government is moving swiftly to implement the most significant science reforms in three decades, with three new public research organisations to be formed by 1 July, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti announced today.

“These reforms are about unlocking the full potential of science to deliver stronger economic growth and greater resilience for New Zealand. We’re not wasting a moment,” says Dr Reti.

“Earlier this year, the Prime Minister unveiled a major overhaul of the science system, including the move from seven Crown Research Institutes to three new, future-focused entities. These new organisations will concentrate on key areas of national importance.”

The new institutes will be:

- **New Zealand Institute for Bioeconomy Science** – advancing innovation in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, biotechnology and manufacturing; protecting ecosystems from biosecurity threats and climate risks; and developing new bio-based technologies and products.
- **New Zealand Institute for Earth Science** – supporting energy security and sustainability; developing land, marine and mineral resources; and improving resilience to natural hazards and climate-related risks.
- **New Zealand Institute for Public Health and Forensic Science** – strengthening public health through disease detection and response; and supporting public safety through forensic science services.

“These institutes will ensure our world-class researchers are focused on delivering science that drives innovation, supports our industries, and improves the lives of everyday New Zealanders,” says Dr Reti.

“Critically, the new research organisations will have a strong commercial focus, with a mandate to translate science into real-world outcomes and commercial success.

“It’s not enough to have great science — we need that science to power start-ups, lift productivity, and create jobs. This is about turning research into results for New Zealand’s economy.”

To lead this transformation, Dr Reti today announced the appointment of Barry Harris as Chair of the Bioeconomy Science Institute, and David Smol as Chair of the Earth Science Institute.

“Both Mr Harris and Mr Smol bring outstanding leadership and deep sector experience. They are well placed to guide these new organisations as they take shape and begin delivering on our vision for a stronger, more productive science system,” says Dr Reti.

The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) will retain its current governance as it transitions to become the New Zealand Institute for Public Health and Forensic Sciences.

“These changes are about focus, outcomes, and value. We are investing in science that delivers for New Zealand — science that strengthens our economy, supports our environment, and builds resilience for the future,” Dr Reti says.

“I’m confident these new leaders will help us deliver a science system that is more connected, more commercially focused, and better aligned with the needs of our nation.”
