Endoscopy services at Hawke’s Bay Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital are set to expand, with the addition of a third procedure room, Health Minister Simeon Brown announced today.

“Improving New Zealand’s health infrastructure is a top priority for the Government, to ensure all Kiwis can access timely, high-quality healthcare,” Mr Brown says.

“The hospital’s endoscopy unit currently has two procedure rooms and is operating at full capacity seven days a week. However, increasing demand means patients are waiting longer for essential procedures.

“A $1.3 million investment will fund a third procedure room, significantly increasing capacity for procedures such as colonoscopies, gastroscopies, and other vital diagnostic tests.

“Endoscopy is critical for the early detection and treatment of conditions such as bowel cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Earlier diagnosis for patients leads to better health outcomes and can be lifesaving.

“This investment supports two of our key health targets: faster cancer treatment and shorter wait times for elective care. Once operational, the expanded unit will enable the hospital to meet current and future demand, as well as clear the existing backlog of patients.”

Recruitment is already underway to support the expanded service and increase the number of procedures delivered.

Today’s announcement builds on a series of recent investments in Hawke’s Bay’s healthcare infrastructure, including:

- $28.3 million for a new temporary inpatient unit
- $29.3 million to expand radiology services
- $37.2 million for the district’s first Linear Accelerator to enhance cancer care.

“These projects reflect our commitment to delivering better, faster, and more accessible healthcare. The expansion of endoscopy services is another important step in ensuring the people of Hawke’s Bay receive the care they need, when they need it,” Mr Brown says.

The new procedure room is expected to be completed by late 2025, with the expanded service fully operational by February 2026.
