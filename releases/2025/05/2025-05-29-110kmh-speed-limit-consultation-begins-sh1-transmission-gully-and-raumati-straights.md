Transport Minister Chris Bishop is encouraging New Zealanders to have their say in public consultation that begins today on increasing speed limits for SH1 Transmission Gully and Raumati Straights to 110km/h.

“Boosting economic growth and productivity is a key part of the Government’s plan to rebuild the economy and this proposal supports that outcome by reducing travel times and increasing efficiency on this vital route between Wellington and the lower and central North Island,” Mr Bishop says.  

“With around 22,000 vehicles using the road daily, it provides important regional resilience and a safe, modern, reliable route for all road users. Transmission Gully is one of the first Roads of National Significance (RoNS) announced by the former National Government in 2009 and is the main gateway to Wellington. 

“Transmission Gully was designed and constructed to a high safety standard. This is reflected in the low crash numbers on the road since opening in 2022. It has safety features that greatly reduce the risk of death or serious injury in a crash, like two lanes in each direction, and flexible median barrier between opposing lanes. Since opening, there have been over 150 barrier strikes but no deaths

“Along with Transmission Gully, the NZ Transport Agency will also be consulting on Raumati Straights, which connects Transmission Gully with Kāpiti Expressway.  By consulting on this section now, we can finalise a decision on appropriate speed limits quicker, ahead of possible safety improvements on the section. 

“This is all part of the Coalition Government’s agenda to deliver the infrastructure needed to grow the economy, reduce travel times and increase the productivity of our transport network. We’re committed to providing state highways that help people get where they need to go quickly and safely.”  

Consultation on raising the speed limit for SH1 Transmission Gully and Raumati Straights to 110km/h begins on Friday 30 May and will last six weeks.  You can find more on the NZTA website here: [www.nzta.govt.nz/tgspeed](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/tgspeed).
