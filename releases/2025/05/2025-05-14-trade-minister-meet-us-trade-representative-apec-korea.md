Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay travels to Korea today for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Trade Ministers meeting where he will meet with APEC and CPTPP trading partners including a first in person meeting with United Stated Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

“These meetings are an opportunity to advocate for New Zealand exporters, discuss our strong and mutually beneficial trade relationships, and restate New Zealand’s opposition to high tariff regimes," Mr McClay says.

While in Jeju, Minister McClay will meet with Ministers from: Australia, China, Chile, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Peru, Singapore and the United States where he will talk about the need for certainty for consumers and exporters.

APEC’s 21 economies receive over 75 per cent of New Zealand’s exports and represent nearly 60 per cent of global GDP.

"Open and fair market access remains a priority for our Government as we look to double the value of exports in 10 years and grow the economy," Mr McClay says.

“This meeting is an opportunity to deepen our connections with these major economic partners and support New Zealand exporters.”
