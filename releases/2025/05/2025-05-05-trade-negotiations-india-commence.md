Following significant engagement over the last month, the first in-person round of negotiations towards a comprehensive India New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will take place in India this week.

This follows the highly successful visit to India last year by Deputy Prime Minister, Winston Peters and the formal launch of negotiations by Minster for Trade and Investment, Todd McClay and Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal during the Prime Minister’s large trade mission to New Delhi in April.

“This is an important step in our trade relationship with India and signals the two Governments’ intent to deliver a high quality outcome that benefits both countries,” Mr McClay says.

“With a population of 1.4 billion and a GDP estimated to grow to USD $5.2 trillion by 2030, India offers significant opportunity for New Zealand exporters,” Mr McClay says.

“Strengthening ties with India across the board is a key part of the Government’s broader strategy to diversify and grow New Zealand’s export markets and double trade by value in 10 years.
