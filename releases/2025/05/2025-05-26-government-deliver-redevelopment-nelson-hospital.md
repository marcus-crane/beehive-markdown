Nelson Hospital will get a major redevelopment as part of the Government’s $1 billion boost to hospital infrastructure and will be the first hospital in the country to receive a new temporary inpatient unit while construction is underway, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This is a significant investment in the future of healthcare for Nelson. It includes the construction of a new inpatient building by 2029, two years earlier than planned,” Mr Brown says.

“Nelson Hospital is under increasing pressure from a growing and ageing population. It has a shortage of beds, putting pressure on elective treatment. Surgeries are being cancelled, and operating theatres are not being fully utilised due to a lack of inpatient beds.”

To help address this while construction on the new building is underway, Nelson Hospital will be the first site to receive one of the Government’s new modular, transportable 28 to 32-bed inpatient units, designed to provide extra capacity quickly and support ongoing care during major infrastructure projects.

“These modular units are part of a broader Budget 2025 initiative to ensure hospitals can continue delivering for patients during redevelopment. They can be moved where needed, making them a flexible and fast solution to bed shortages. It is expected the unit for Nelson will be delivered within the next 12 months.”

The new inpatient building at Nelson Hospital will include 128 beds, adding 41 more beds to the current capacity, along with an acute assessment unit, a transit lounge, a pharmacy, a blood bank, and dedicated areas for assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation services.

The hospital’s two main buildings – the George Manson and Percy Brunette buildings – will be refurbished and seismically strengthened. A new Energy Centre will house critical hospital infrastructure, and there will be digital upgrades to support modern models of care.

“The Nelson Hospital redevelopment is moving at pace following Cabinet’s approval of the detailed business case.

“The Government’s staged approach to delivering major hospital projects is ensuring a well-planned and efficient build programme, with the $73 million in design and enabling works well underway, laying strong foundations for the next stage of construction.

“The $11 million emergency department expansion, part of the redevelopment to meet growing demand, is expected to be completed in early 2026.”

Health New Zealand is also planning for future workforce requirements, ensuring the right clinical teams are in place to deliver more healthcare for the Nelson community.

“Improving health infrastructure is a priority for the Government to ensure patients have access to timely, quality healthcare.

“Our Government is providing certainty to the people of Nelson by getting on with the project, which has been delayed for many years. In August 2023, decisions were made to rescope the project’s delivery. Since then, Health New Zealand has completed a Business Case, which was approved by Cabinet earlier this year – and has now been funded in Budget 2025.

“This investment – alongside the delivery of new inpatient capacity – will ensure that as the Nelson community grows, the health system’s infrastructure grows with it. It’s an investment in better care, better access, and better outcomes for patients,” Mr Brown says.
