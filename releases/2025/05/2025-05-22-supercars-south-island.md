A second round of the hugely successful Supercars events will be held in Christchurch from next year with support from the Government’s Major Events Fund.  

“For more than 20 years Supercars Championship events have played an important role showcasing our beautiful country to an international audience and I’m thrilled the South Island will now be part of this from next year,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.  

“The Government is investing $5.9 million from the Major Events Fund to support Supercars events in both Taupō and Christchurch for the next three years. 

“This means international – and domestic – visitors can attend back-to-back rounds across consecutive weekends in Taupō and Christchurch, allowing them to extend their stay and enjoy more of what New Zealand has to offer. 

“It was fantastic to be part of the estimated 50,000 strong crowd at the recent ITM Supercars440 event in Taupō. The place was buzzing with people in town to enjoy one of the most popular Trans-Tasman motorsport events.

“We know the 2024 event generated significant economic and tourism benefits for the Taupō region and New Zealand with more than 3,300 international visitors attending and spending more than $5.2 million while here. Not to mention the invaluable exposure in key tourism markets with a total broadcast reach of 246 million, including 3.9 million in Australia. 

“I’m pleased that with this investment New Zealand’s strong relationship with Supercars will continue in Taupō and extend to include Christchurch, with all the benefits that brings.” 

Supercars Ltd has selected Ruapuna Motorsport Park, Christchurch as the host venue for the South Island round.
