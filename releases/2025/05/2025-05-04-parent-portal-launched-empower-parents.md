Every parent wants to see their child thrive at school — to feel confident, supported, and capable. Today, the Government is taking a major step toward making that aspiration a reality with the launch of a new Parent Portal: an online resource designed to enable families to play their part in their child’s learning.

“This is about giving parents clarity, confidence, and practical tools to support their child’s learning journey,” says Erica Stanford.

Launching today, the Parent Portal will provide a clear, easy-to-understand year by year guide to what children will be learning in English and maths under New Zealand’s refreshed, knowledge-rich curriculum.

“This is about making the curriculum accessible to parents and caregivers, so they can be strong partners in their children’s education,” says Minister Stanford. “Until now, parents haven’t always had consistent access to this information - this new tool will change that.

The Parent Portal will include:

- A parent-friendly breakdown of what children will learn in English and maths at each year level with other learning areas added as the curriculum refresh rolls out,
- Activities and resources to support learning at home that are aligned to the curriculum,
- Information and videos about what to expect when their child starts school, including the Phonics Checks at 20 and 40 weeks,
- Guidance on supporting structured literacy approaches, including access to decodable books and the sequence of sounds that are taught so parents can help with reading at home,
- Practical tips for parent-teacher interviews so parents can feel confident asking questions about their child’s progress,
- Online tools to practice maths will be added in the near future.

“This is the first time parents will have access to such a comprehensive and practical resource,” says Minister Stanford. “It’s not just about information — it’s about helping your child succeed. Whether a child needs support to catch up or is ready to be extended, parents will now have the tools to help.”

More resources will be added to the platform over time, building a rich library of information and resources to help raise achievement and close the equity gap.

“Parents are a crucial part of their child’s education journey. Available on any device, the portal is about restoring their place at the heart of learning and giving them the confidence to make a real difference.”

The Parent Portal is part of the Government’s broader commitment to raising educational achievement and ensuring every child reaches their full potential.
