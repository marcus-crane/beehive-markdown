Improvements to the Wildlife Act passed through Parliament today ensure important development projects, such as building new solar and wind farms, continue supporting our growing economy while protecting precious wildlife, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

The High Court recently decided it was unlawful for the Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai to authorise the killing of wildlife unless there was a direct link between killing and protecting wildlife. Incidental harm to wildlife, while not desired, sometimes happens when carrying out a lawful activity, such as consented construction works.  

“This decision placed multiple projects, which previously received DOC authorisations, in a state of uncertainty,” Mr Potaka says.  “Projects include activities for building new solar and wind farms, plantation forests, and powerline maintenance that are essential for supporting our growing economy.

“Today’s improvements give certainty to authority holders that their projects can continue lawfully, whether it’s for important conservation work like pest control or development and infrastructure projects. 

“Today’s changes clarify how authorisations can be consistent with protecting wildlife, and that the Director-General of the Department of Conservation – Te Papa Atawhai can make authorisations. We are restoring the approach that DOC was taking for authorising activities before the Court’s decision and provide legal clarity. 

“These changes keep safeguards to protect wildlife. It’s important Aotearoa New Zealand’s wildlife continues to be protected, and that species can thrive as we support a strong and growing economy. 

“Under the amended Wildlife Act, authority holders are still expected to avoid and minimise harm to protected species. Examples include relocating animals before doing any construction work – to protect populations and support the ongoing viability of species,” says Mr Potaka.

“Now the amendments have been enacted, we can turn to accelerating a comprehensive review of the Wildlife Act.”
