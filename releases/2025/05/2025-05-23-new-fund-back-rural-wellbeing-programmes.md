The Government is investing in the wellbeing of rural communities through a new fund that backs practical, on-the-ground programmes designed to build resilience and support the 360,000 hard working men and women who power our primary sector.

Agriculture Minister Todd McClay says Budget 2025 provides $2 million over four years for a new contestable Rural Wellbeing Fund to back farmers to back themselves.

“When rural communities thrive, all of New Zealand benefits. The food and fibre sector is the engine of our economy, and that means backing both production and the hardworking people who drive it,” Mr McClay says.

Rural Communities Minister Mark Patterson says the fund builds on the Government’s Budget 2025 investment of an extra $1 million over four years to boost the work of Rural Support Trusts and other providers that support farmers and growers.

“This is about giving rural people the tools and connections they need to stay supported.

“Initiatives that bring people together through events, advice, or peer networks, are a key part of building long-term resilience across the sector,” Mr Patterson says.

The fund will be administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries, with successful applicants selected by a governance group including industry representatives.
