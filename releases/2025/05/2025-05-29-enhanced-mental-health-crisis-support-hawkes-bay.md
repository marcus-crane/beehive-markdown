Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey today attended the official opening of a new mental health service, Waiorua. 

“It is fantastic to be in the Hawke’s Bay today to open this new service that will offer an alternative safe space to go for adults while they are in their time of need seeking support for mental health and addiction challenges,” Mr Doocey says. 

The service will operate in a repurposed building close to the hospital campus and will be connected to the wider acute care model across the region. 

“I am pleased to see this service was co-designed across agencies to better serve the people in the Hawke’s Bay who are needing to access support by moving to a cross agency, more joined up approach.” 

The service is a collaborative approach between agencies including Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga, Health New Zealand, the New Zealand Police, and the Ministry of Social Development. 

“As a result of this new Crisis Respite Service, there will be six new unplanned crisis respite beds opened as an alternative to an admission to an Emergency Department or a mental health inpatient unit,” Mr Doocey says. 

“Respite beds offer a welcoming place where people experiencing mental health difficulties can rest and recover in a home-like environment with clinical oversight and short-term residential support. 

“This is a powerful example of what can be achieved when agencies work together with a shared purpose of improving the lives of New Zealanders. 

“More people in the region will now have access to timely mental health and addiction support. At the end of the day, no matter where you are located, we want you to have access to the care you need and deserve.”
