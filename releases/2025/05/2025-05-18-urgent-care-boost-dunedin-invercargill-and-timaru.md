South Island communities will have better access to urgent and after-hours healthcare as part of a nationwide investment, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Improving access to urgent and after-hours services is a key part of our plan to ensure all New Zealanders – whether they live in cities, towns, or rural areas – can get timely, quality care when they need it,” Mr Brown says.

“Budget 2025 delivers new and enhanced urgent care services across the South Island, making it easier for people to get the care they need closer to home.

“In Dunedin, a new 24/7 service has been identified to ensure the community has round-the-clock access to care every day of the week, easing pressure on the city’s hospital. This means people in Dunedin will be able to get urgent care any time of the day and night, while our Government continues to prioritise delivering the New Dunedin Hospital.

“New daytime services have been identified for Invercargill and Timaru, building on existing after-hours services to offer more consistent, reliable care.

“Rural and remote communities will also benefit from improved urgent care access, including better access to diagnostic services, urgent medicines, and on-call clinicians.

“This investment means South Islanders will have faster access to care, with shorter trips and more treatment available locally – especially outside of normal hours – while reducing pressure on emergency departments.

Key Budget 2025 initiatives for the South Island include: 

- A new 24/7 urgent care service identified for Dunedin by late 2025.
- A new daytime urgent care service identified for Invercargill and Timaru, building on the existing after-hours services.
- Maintaining all existing urgent and after-hours healthcare services in the region.
- Improved after-hour services identified for Alexandra, Ashburton, Balclutha, Golden Bay, Gore, and Oamaru.
- Around 30 rural and remote communities to benefit from improved services, including better access to diagnostics, urgent medicines, and 24/7 on-call clinical support.

“This Government is investing more in health than ever before, with a record $16.68 billion over three Budgets to improve health outcomes for Kiwis.

“Alongside new and improved urgent care services, our investment will better support rural clinicians with tools, diagnostics, and more connected care – helping deliver timely, quality services across the South Island,” Mr Brown says.
