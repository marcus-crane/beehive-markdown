Defence and Digitising Government Minister Judith Collins will this week attend a range of defence and digital government events in Singapore.

“Experience has taught me well that meeting face-to-face is the best way to deepen existing relationships, share perspectives and learn from one another,” Ms Collins says.

“While in Singapore I will attend the annual Asia Tech X Singapore Summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue for Defence Ministers, and meet with counterparts.

“I am looking forward to progressing conversations with my Defence counterparts from around the globe, including a number who have been recently appointed.

“In times of increasing international tension, diplomacy is more important than ever, and the Government is committed to playing our part and stepping up on the world stage.”

During the Shangri-La Dialogue, Ms Collins will also join a panel discussion on Cyber, Undersea and Outer-Space Defence Challenges

While attending the Asia Tech X Singapore Summit, she will participate in an engagement hosted by Singapore Minister of Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo and meet with GovTech Singapore. These engagements are opportunities to discuss topics of shared interest to New Zealand and Singapore.

“I’m looking forward to engaging with other nations on digital government and technology,” Ms Collins says.

“These engagements help New Zealand stay at the forefront of technological innovation, and foster international relationships that are crucial to knowledge and information sharing.”

Ms Collins will return to New Zealand on 2 June.
