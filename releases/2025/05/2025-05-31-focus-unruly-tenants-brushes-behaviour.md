A Government directive to take firmer action against abusive Kāinga Ora tenants has led to consequences for threatening and abusive behaviour, and improved tenant behaviour as a result, Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka says.

In March 2024, Ministers instructed Kāinga Ora to end its Sustaining Tenancies Framework, which had allowed tenants to stay living in a Kāinga Ora home no matter how abusive or disruptive their behaviour.

“Living in a taxpayer-funded social house is a privilege. The vast majority of social housing tenants are respectful of their home and courteous to their neighbours, but unfortunately they are let down by a small minority who threaten and abuse their neighbours or wilfully damage their home. Our Government campaigned on focussing in on these unruly tenants, and new data shows our approach is leading to improved behaviour,” Mr Potaka says.

“Over the past 10 months, 63 tenancies have been terminated for abusive, threatening, or persistent disruptive behaviour. This compares to 11 tenancies being ended for disruptive behaviour in the previous financial year, and only two in the financial year before that under the previous Government.

“Formal warnings for tenants whose behaviour is putting their tenancy at risk have increased by more than 600 per cent compared to the previous financial year, with 1,463 being issued in 2024/25 so far. 

“Around 80 per cent of warnings – known as section 55a notices – have been first notices and 18 per cent were second notices. Third notices, which can trigger the end of a tenancy, made up just two per cent of warnings.

“I’m also pleased to see that the time taken to address complaints to Kāinga Ora about tenant behaviour has reduced significantly. In January 2024 it took an average of 60 days to take action in response to a complaint. In April 2025 it had reduced to less than 12 days.

“This data shows that the vast majority of disruptive tenants are taking the notices seriously and changing their behaviour to prevent receiving a second or third notice. And where they don’t change their behaviour, we’re no longer putting up with it.

“There are whānau who have been living in angst from their neighbours abusing the privilege of a taxpayer funded home, so we’ve taken swift action to get on top of it.

“The Government is taking an approach that ultimately benefits everyone involved, by reducing negative behaviour through formal warnings and following through with real consequences in the rare circumstances that behaviour doesn’t improve.

“I thank Kāinga Ora staff for their work to improve tenant behaviour, particularly noting that in doing so they have to navigate some very challenging situations. We look forward to further improvements in this space.”
