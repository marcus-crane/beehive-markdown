New investment in advanced technology research will boost high-tech exports, strengthen connections between research and industry and generate high value jobs, Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti announced today. 

“Advanced technology research leads to life-changing innovation,” says Dr Reti. 

“The breakthroughs that can be achieved through areas like cryogenic and quantum science are hugely significant. 

“From developing portable MRI machines, to building smaller and faster engines, this investment will enable innovation that has the potential to improve our daily lives, while boosting economic growth in sectors like health, transport, energy and our space industry.” 

The Government is investing $71 million over seven years into a new advanced technology science platform hosted by the Robinson Research Institute, who are based out of Victoria University of Wellington. 

Dr Reti says this funding will not only support innovation that can be turned into economic gains but also maintain critical staff and develop young scientists into world-class innovators.

“Through this new science platform, the Government is investing in the materials and engineering expertise needed to achieve technological breakthroughs and turn innovative ideas into real-world products and services right here in New Zealand,” says Dr Reti. 

“This research platform aims to grow New Zealand’s hi-tech exports based on cryogenics, superconductors, magnets and processed materials.

“Robinson Research Institute are known for world-leading expertise in superconductors, magnets and materials technologies and proven experience in commercialisation.

“The team will develop workforce capability through internships and postgraduate study and encourage early career researchers to take their ideas beyond the laboratory. 

“Projects from the platform will also enhance local and international research and commercial partnerships and encourage international investment into the New Zealand research and development sector.

“I look forward to the contribution this platform will make to growing and diversifying our economy, supporting the development of world-class scientists and innovators and the creation of high-quality jobs for people in New Zealand.”  

This investment is part of the Government's work to drive economic growth by reforming and refocusing New Zealand's science, innovation and technology system for the future. It is the first step in establishing the new Advanced Technology Public Research Organisation.
