Pacific Wardens willcontinue to support safer, stronger communities with a funding boost through Budget 2025, announced Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti.

“Pacific Wardens are a trusted and vital presence in our communities — helping to keep our streets safer, our young people supported, and our neighbourhoods connected,” says Dr Reti.

“This Government is committed to strengthening their impact by providing the resources, structure, and certainty they need to grow and thrive in the years ahead.”

Pacific Warden Groups have been a trusted presence for over a decade across Auckland and South Waikato. They provide a calm, reassuring influence on the ground — from patrolling streets and community spaces to being a visible, approachable presence at large-scale events like the Pasifika Festival and Polyfest.

“Wardens are often the bridge between communities and support services. They speak the language, understand the culture, and are well placed to de-escalate conflict, deter crime, and guide young people towards safer choices,” says Dr Reti.

Through Budget 2025, the Government is investing $1 million over four years — $250,000 per year — to support the Auckland Pacific Wardens Trust.

“This is a practical investment that will go directly toward volunteer training, uniforms, and transport. It also allows the Trust to establish a paid coordinator role and build stronger national governance – providing the stability and structure these groups need to grow,” Dr Reti says.

The funding delivers on a key commitment in the National Party and New Zealand First coalition agreement, recognising the value Pacific Wardens add to New Zealand’s social fabric.

“Our Government backs community-led initiatives that work. This funding helps Pacific Wardens do what they do best — supporting communities, reducing harm, and strengthening social cohesion. I commend the Trust and all its volunteers for the vital work they do, and I look forward to seeing their impact grow,” says Dr Reti.
