Initiatives to help serious and persistent young offenders turn their lives around, and improvements to facilities for them, have been given a significant financial boost in Budget 2025. 

Building on the successes that have already led to a 13 per cent reduction in young people with serious and persistent offending behaviour (a key Government target), more than $103 million is being invested over four years in upgrading facilities and funding ways to address recidivism amongst young people.

“This investment will have a real impact on these young people and their whānau. It will also ensure our communities are safer, both immediately and in the future”, Minister for Children Karen Chhour says.

“This Government’s efforts to keep the public safe and reform young offenders is already bearing fruit. The Budget ensures we can continue this important work.”

The funded initiatives over four years include: 

- $22 million for repairs and upgrades to Oranga Tamariki residences
- $16 million to implement the new legislative regime for Young Serious Offenders, as proposed by the Oranga Tamariki (Responding to Serious Youth Offending) Amendment Bill
- $33 million in safety and quality improvements to the facilities at youth justice residences
- $33 million for the operation of military style academies and transitional support for young serious offenders.

“Sometimes all it takes to improve the lives of an entire whānau is supporting one young person to make better choices.

“We continue to want better for, and from, these young people. This is not just an investment in facilities, it is an investment in them,” Mrs Chhour says.
