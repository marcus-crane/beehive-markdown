Farmers and growers will have faster access to new agriculture and horticulture products because innovation drives success, says Regulation Minister David Seymour, Environment Minister Penny Simmonds and Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard.

“The changes announced today show the power of a sector review,” Mr Seymour says.

“Agriculture and horticulture products are integral to the largest sector of New Zealand’s tradeable economy, the primary sector. It’s important to ensure regulatory settings give the sector the best chance at success.

Cabinet accepted all of the Ministry for Regulation’s 16 recommendations to improve the new agriculture and horticulture product approval pathway.

“The changes will speed up the application process, make it clearer and more transparent, and ensure existing international research is utilised. It is estimated that reducing the current approval times for new products by half could generate benefits of about $272 million over 20 years,” Mr Seymour says. 

“The seeds of innovation are sown and it’s officially the season for growth. The Minister for Food Safety and the Minister for the Environment will action these changes to streamline the product approval pathway. This means farmers and growers can utilise newer and better products faster.

Joint Ministers will be responsible for progressing an Omnibus Bill to provide legislative support and accelerate improvements.

Minister for the Environment Penny Simmonds says the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has been and will continue to work on improving the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) system.

“I have set a 10% reduction target for the HSNO queue in 2025/2026 and will set a more ambitious target in the next three months now that additional staff have been appointed for this work through reprioritisation of funding,” Ms Simmonds says.

“I have directed the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to improve Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) assessment processes”, Mr Hoggard says.

“I want a 20% queue reduction for ACVM products compared to the queues in October 2024, by the end of June 2025. By the end of June 2026 I want to see queues reduce by a further 30%.”

“In a high-cost economy, regulation isn’t neutral. It’s a tax on growth. Every completed review makes it easier to do business, access services, and innovate in New Zealand. The Hairdressers and Barbers Sector Review is another example of what smarter regulation looks like in action,” Mr Seymour says.
