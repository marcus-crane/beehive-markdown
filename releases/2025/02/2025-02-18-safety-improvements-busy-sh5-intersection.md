A busy intersection on SH5 will be made safer with the construction of a new roundabout at the intersection of SH28/Harwoods Road, as we deliver on our commitment to help improve road safety through building safer infrastructure, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Safety is one of the Government’s strategic priorities in transport investment, alongside economic growth and productivity, and funding is available for safety improvements to be made at the highest-risk locations, like this one between Tīrau and Tārukenga,” Mr Bishop says.

“SH5 between Tīrau and Tārukenga is an important route for locals and tourists, freight and agricultural vehicles travelling between Waikato and Bay of Plenty. Planned safety improvements will complement work already completed between Ngongotahā on SH5 and locations along SH1 between Cambridge and Taupō.

“The Harwoods Road roundabout will start construction this year in September and take about 8 months to build. It is one of several safety improvements planned for the stretch of SH5 between Tīrau and Tārukenga Marae Road.

“The Waimakariri Road right-turn bay construction includes some road widening near the intersection and will be built as part of resealing work next month.

“Funding has also been allocated to complete design work for a roundabout at SH28/Whites Road and general widening between Whites and Harwoods Roads to allow for wide centrelines. Completing this design work means they will be ready to go as further funding becomes available.

“The Government is focused on improving road safety through better maintenance and resilience of the state highway network, fixing potholes, strong enforcement by Police on the leading causes of deaths and serious injuries, and building new and safer roads.

“Around 8,500 vehicles use the SH28/Harwoods Road intersection every day, and up to 20% of them are heavy vehicles. Building new and safer infrastructure is all part of our plan to help Kiwis get to where they need to go quickly and safely, and I look forward to this work getting underway later this year.”
