Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey has officially marked the start of a new peer support service at Auckland City Hospital’s Adult Emergency Department today.

Minister Doocey says the service will not only help better support people presenting in mental distress, but potentially improve wait times.

“Sitting in an ED in times of mental distress can be a very challenging place for people. Having someone who has lived experience in the area and can understand what you are going through can be a huge comfort,” Mr Doocey says.

“This is one of New Zealand’s busiest EDs and we know this initiative can have a big and positive impact on better patient outcomes.

“Early feedback from people presenting at Middlemore Hospital’s ED, where the first trial of this initiative started more than four months ago, has been positive.

In total, eight EDs across New Zealand will trial this initiative over two years, with Waikato, Wellington and Christchurch hospitals due to start their new services in coming months.

“Since I’ve become New Zealand’s first Minister for Mental Health, I have heard from many in the sector who want to see Peer Support Specialists playing a greater role in helping to address some of the challenges faced by our mental health services.

“One of my top priorities is addressing the significant mental health workforce shortages. Peer Support Specialists play a vital role within this workforce, and I believe the expertise and empathy Peers can bring to the workforce has been previously undervalued and underutilised.

“This new workforce has people who have lived experience of mental distress or addiction, have experienced recovery and have been trained how to support others going through similar experiences on their journey to wellness.

“This initiative aligns with the Government’s priorities of increasing access to mental health and addiction support for New Zealanders and growing the workforce.”

A $1 million workforce fund over two years has also been set up to provide Level 4 NZ Certificate in Health and Wellbeing (Peer Support) training and specific training for working in emergency departments.
