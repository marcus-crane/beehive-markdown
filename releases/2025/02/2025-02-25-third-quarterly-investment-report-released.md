The Government has released its third Quarterly Investment Report as part of the drive to deliver better value for money from government expenditure and restore fiscal discipline, Associate Minister of Finance and Minister for Infrastructure Chris Bishop says.

“This is the third quarter where we are publishing the Government’s Quarterly Investment Report in our effort to provide the public better visibility of the government’s investment pipeline and portfolio, and to improve investment discipline and better performance from agencies.

“This report, prepared by the Treasury for the July to September 2024 period, shows incremental progress in terms of planning and delivery behaviours by agencies. Cabinet has made it very clear to agency Chief Executives that they need to drive improvements in their agencies regarding full and accurate data, robust business cases, and improved asset management.

“Getting this right is critical to ensuring the successful delivery of our strategic priorities such as the 30-year National Infrastructure Plan. Ministers will continue to closely monitor the progress and performance of major investments and take any steps required to put a project back on the right course.”

The next Quarterly Investment Report covering the October to December 2024 quarter will be released in May.

**Note to Editors:**

Quarterly Investment Reports are published to ensure that the status of investments is open and transparent. They are developed based on investment information that government agencies submit to the Treasury following the end of a quarter. 

Agencies are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of investment information they submit to the Treasury. The Treasury does not edit or update agency information, save for correcting minor data formatting issues.
