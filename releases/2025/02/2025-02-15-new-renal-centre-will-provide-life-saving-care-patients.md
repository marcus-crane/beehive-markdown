Hundreds of patients from the central North Island will be supported at Waikato’s new renal facility, which officially opened today, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Delivering improved health infrastructure is a priority for the Government. I am pleased for those patients who will be able to access life-saving care at the new Waikato Regional Renal Centre.

“This is an essential service for those on dialysis and kidney transplant patients living in the central North Island. Having a purpose-built, high-tech building is a positive step in enhancing patient outcomes for the local community.

“Combining all outpatient renal services into a single site will make a real difference for patients who can now access comprehensive, coordinated care in one place.

“The facility, which is 70 per cent larger than the previous centre, provides a welcoming environment for renal patients receiving care and their families, many of whom will be with the service for years.

“It has been designed to allow for future growth, offering a long-term solution that meets both the needs of the community and international standards for dialysis care.

“Infrastructure like this makes a significant difference in improving access to timely healthcare and bringing services closer to home for Kiwis.

“The Government has invested a record $16.68 billion to ensure access to timely, quality healthcare, including renal care. I look forward to many more patients being able to access this local, life-saving service in the future,” Mr Brown says.
