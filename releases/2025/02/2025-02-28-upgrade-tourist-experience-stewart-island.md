Upgraded tourism ventures on Rakiura Stewart Island promise a world-class experience for visitors, with enhanced guided nature walks and improved facilities, says Associate Regional Development Minister Mark Patterson.

Mr Patterson is on Stewart Island today, joining locals to celebrate the completion of the Rakiura Oneke Southern Wilderness Experience.

“The realisation of this project on Stewart Island is monumental. The people here have been holding this project in their hearts for many years, and it's incredible to see the work finally completed. It’s a testament to the dedication this close-knit community has to their home,” says Mr Patterson.

Rakiura Māori Lands Trust (RMLT) was approved for grant and loan funding from the Provincial Growth Fund, totalling $2.18 million in 2020, to support the development of tourism infrastructure. The Trust provided funding to upgrade conservation efforts at Oneke (also known as ‘The Neck’), a remote area on Stewart Island that hosts an abundance of native wildlife and incredible coastal landscapes. 

“Thanks to the new walking track at Oneke, visitors can take guided walks to discover the area’s early history and natural wonders. There’s also a new wharf, whare and shelter facilities. This infrastructure will support tourism on Oneke well into the future.

“Stewart Island has long been a habitat for native flora and fauna, and restoring the biodiversity of the land back to its natural state has been a priority for RMLT for many years. The new developments contribute to the continued work being done to restore the biodiversity at Oneke, with upgraded predator-proof fencing and biosecurity measures,” says Mr Patterson.
