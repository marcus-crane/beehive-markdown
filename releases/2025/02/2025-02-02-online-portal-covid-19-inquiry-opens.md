Minister of Internal Affairs Brooke van Velden is welcoming the opening of an online portal for the public to submit to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into COVID-19 Lessons Learned.

“The portal is an easy way for members of the public to have their say to the Inquiry about how the response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected them, their families, and their businesses. The terms or reference covered by Phase 2 of the Inquiry includes the use of vaccines, lockdowns, testing, and public health materials,” says Ms van Velden.

Last year the Government announced that there would be a second phase of the Inquiry into COVID-19 covering outstanding matters of public concern. Both the ACT-National and New Zealand First-National coalition agreements include commitments to expand the Inquiry into COVID-19. Phase 2 of the Inquiry began on 29 November and will deliver the final report in February 2026. 

Any member of the public can submit to the Inquiry using the portal at [www.covid19inquiry.nz](http://www.covid19inquiry.nz). Submissions close at midnight on 27 April 2025.

“I would strongly encourage New Zealanders to have their say by making a submission to the Inquiry. I look forward to seeing the final report delivered to me in February 2026.”

The full terms of reference for Phase 2 of the Inquiry is available here: [https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0323/latest/LMS792965.html](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0323/latest/LMS792965.html)
