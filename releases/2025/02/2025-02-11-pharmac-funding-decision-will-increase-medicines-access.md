Associate Health Minister with responsibility for Pharmac David Seymour, and Health Minister Simeon Brown welcome Pharmac’s decision to fund medicines for a further five health conditions, including cancers, from 1 March 2025.

“Pharmac operates independently, but it must work within the budget constraints set by the government,” Mr Seymour says.

“Today represents another step forward for cancer patients as the $604 million uplift from the government continues to facilitate access to new treatments.

“Pharmac continues to show what it is capable of when given the support it needs.

Pharmac has today announced their decision to fund medicines for a further five health conditions, including cancers, from 1 March 2025.

The funding will:

- Widen access to atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and bevacizumab (Vegzelma) for liver cancer that can’t be removed by surgery
- Widen access to bevacizumab (Vegzelma) for advanced ovarian cancer
- Fund a new brand of bevacizumab (Vegzelma)
- Fund lanreotide for neuroendocrine cancers, bowel blockages caused by cancer, and for a growth disorder called acromegaly.

“The early signs of Pharmac’s redirection remain positive, as expanding opportunities and access for patients and their families continue to be prioritised,” Mr Seymour says.

“I’m pleased to see Pharmac’s responsiveness to the voices of patients and their families by expanding access to more medicines for more groups. This decision reflects our commitment to a more adaptable and patient-centered approach.”

Mr Brown says delivering better and faster access to cancer care in New Zealand has been a focus of this Government, which is why it is one of our five key health targets, and is able to deliver because of the Government’s $604 million investment in new cancer medicines.

“As Minister of Health, I am focused on ensuring all New Zealanders have access to timely, quality healthcare. That means ensuring better access to more cancer medicines, better cancer management driven by our faster cancer treatment target, and earlier detection of cancers through screening programmes,” Mr Brown says.

“It is encouraging to see improvement in our efforts to provide faster cancer treatment, with more patients receiving their first treatment within 31 days in the first financial quarter than in the previous quarter and more cancer treatments available.”

“We want to build a world-class health system, and that requires world-class medicines,” Mr Seymour says.
