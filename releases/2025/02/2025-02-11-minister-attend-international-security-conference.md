Defence Minister Judith Collins leaves today for Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference and hold a range of bilateral meetings.

“In these times of rising geopolitical tension, open dialogue and defence diplomacy are more important than ever,” Ms Collins says.

“I am looking forward to attending this annual conference, to meet face-to-face with my counterparts and to share New Zealand’s views on important security issues when I speak at it.”

During the three-day conference Ms Collins will take part in a panel discussion on *Connected Theatres: Europe and Asia Security Spheres*&lt;, and hold a number of bilateral meetings with some key counterparts.

“We are an island nation that relies on a safe and interconnected world in order to prosper. The ongoing war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific are all matters which impact New Zealand,” Ms Collins says.

“We are committed to reinvigorating our security relationships, to playing our part, and working with like-minded partners to uphold the international rules-based system and democratic values that are fundamental to our security and prosperity.”

Ms Collins returns to New Zealand on 18 February.
