A new funding arrangement to support the management and maintenance of New Zealand’s 23 iconic Great Rides will enable Kiwis and international visitors to get out to the regions, now and into the future, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“The Government is committing $7.5 million over three years from the New Zealand Cycle Trail Fund to ensure our world-class trails continue to deliver economic, recreational, and environmental benefits to communities,” Louise Upston says.

“Each year more than 2 million people use the Great Rides of Ngā Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trails, and earlier this week, we saw new data that shows our Great Rides pump $1.28 billion a year into our local economies. This funding will only support this growth.”

“Preserving our Great Rides for the future is important. They create jobs, support businesses such as bike hire and tour companies, and attract hospitality and accommodation services to set up shop nearby.”

The new Trail Management funding has two key components:

- Maintenance: Funding to improve and maintain trail quality and address any trail audit findings as they arise.
- Management: Each Great Ride will receive funding for a dedicated trail manager.

“The Great Rides were set up by Sir John Key’s National-led Government in 2009 and have been an effective partnership between central and local government and the communities that host the trails for more than a decade,” Louise Upston says.

“The three years of funding provides certainty for our trail partners and enables better long-term planning.”

In addition to this new funding arrangement, our Government recently announced investments in cycle trail infrastructure in both [Ruapehu](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cycling-regional-resilience-ruapehu) and [Dunedin](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/green-light-dunedin-tunnels-trail), with more to come.

“We are committed to ensuring all our Great Rides remain well-maintained and managed for the future, continuing to attract visitors and deliver economic benefits,” Louise Upston says.
