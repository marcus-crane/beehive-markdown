Consultation has started on a new action plan to recognise unpaid or informal carers and to provide a long-term roadmap for making progress on the issues they face, says Associate Social Development Minister, Penny Simmonds.

“The Government is seeking feedback on a draft action plan to recognise the hundreds of thousands of Kiwis providing care for someone who needs help with everyday living due to age, a disability, illness, injury or a health condition,” Ms Simmonds says.

Ms Simmonds says the new draft ‘rolling’ action plan, which has been developed by the Ministry for Social Development (MSD) in partnership with the Carers Alliance and an advisory group of organisations representing carers, will make a difference across three core areas over time – recognition and appreciation; health and wellbeing; and financial security.

“The discussions so far have been extremely useful in helping to identify where support is needed and shape up the initial plan – we now want to hear from carers themselves,” says Ms Simmonds.

“We will be making it as easy as possible to give feedback, with stakeholder workshops, community-led workshops across the country, quick online surveys and written submissions on MSD’s website.”
