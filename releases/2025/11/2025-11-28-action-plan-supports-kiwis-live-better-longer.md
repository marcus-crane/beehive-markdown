The new Better Later Life Action Plan is designed to provide practical support to help older New Zealanders live well and maintain their connections and independence, Minister for Seniors Casey Costello announced today.

“The Action Plan consists of a range of practical improvements and is built around a simple goal - helping every New Zealander to live well for longer,” Ms Costello says.

“It focuses on three key areas that matter to older people. We want people to stay well and independent for as long as possible and to support social connection. We need to increase access to the right types of housing in the places people want to live. And we need to help older people remain financially secure and keep control over their lives.

“The plan builds on the wide range of existing government services for our over-65s. Before the plan was developed, we did a stocktake of what was currently provided by government agencies.

“The stocktake found there are more than 50 services targeted for older people delivered by 23 agencies, and apart from NZ Superannuation, the most used service is the SuperGold card. In the last financial year the Government spent over $28 billion on these services, with around 80 per cent of this on NZ Super.

“The Action Plan supplements these core services with specific new initiatives that respond directly to what older New Zealanders have told us matters most, including:

- working to increase the range of suitable housing options
- reviewing driver licensing and medical assessment rules to support people to stay driving safely for as long as possible
- supporting existing local networks to expand their services, with digital training through libraries
- providing tools and guidance to allow people to plan for later life
- strengthening protections against elder abuse, and
- modernising the SuperGold Card and exploring whether it can be used as a primary form of identification so that it remains as useful as possible.”

The Action Plan takes a cross-government approach, bringing Ministers and key agencies together to drive coordinated, practical action, Ms Costello says.

“Across government, we want to improve access to information about government services so people can more easily find the help that’s available and the support that they need.

“This plan drives practical change to make life easier for older New Zealanders.”
