The Government welcomes new data showing New Zealand’s 23 Great Rides are pumping $1.28 billion a year into our local economies, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

The 2025 evaluation report for the Great Rides of New Zealand - Ngā Haerenga shows visitor spending attributed to the Great Rides jumped 35 percent for the year ending June 2025, compared to the same period in 2021.

“This is a significant boost for our local tourism market. Riders are spending more on accommodation, food and hospitality, which is great news for local businesses and jobs,” Louise Upston says.

Visitor nights in nearby accommodation tallied 4.5 million in the year ending June 2025, up 25 percent from 2021 statistics.

“Since being set up by Sir John Key’s National-led Government in 2009, these figures show the appeal of our cycle trails continuing to grow and the real economic benefits they bring to regional communities.

“Higher spending on accommodation and hospitality goes hand in hand with more people using the trails. We’ve seen over 2.5 million trips recorded for the year ending June 2025, up 18 percent on 2021 figures.”

The Government puts $8 million a year from the International Visitor Levy towards the 23 Great Rides, which showcase New Zealand’s landscapes, history and culture.

In addition to this funding, the Government has also made a number of recent investments in cycle trail infrastructure in both [Ruapehu](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cycling-regional-resilience-ruapehu__;!!Asq5-8xVch3Reg!urzJ_fA2pcLZq_gdf35AVGwdYVnIA4Dqc3Dnh_KYb531x3HT_tkVnvDeT6cDzosPjnJB2iV0o4IxqO3exujg41JU5N39Og3wZNCv72k$) and [Dunedin](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.beehive.govt.nz/release/green-light-dunedin-tunnels-trail__;!!Asq5-8xVch3Reg!urzJ_fA2pcLZq_gdf35AVGwdYVnIA4Dqc3Dnh_KYb531x3HT_tkVnvDeT6cDzosPjnJB2iV0o4IxqO3exujg41JU5N39Og3w3lhWfFY$), with more to come.

“This data shows our Great Rides are growing in popularity with both international visitors and Kiwis, and we’re committed to ensuring they continue to attract visitors and deliver significant economic benefits,” Louise Upston says.
