The Government is tracking well ahead of its violent crime reduction target as it today marks one year since its tough gang laws came into effect, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith and Police Minister Mark Mitchell say.

“The latest New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey shows there were 147,000 victims of serious violent crime in the 12 months to August. That’s 38,000 fewer victims than when we came into government, and 9,000 fewer than our last update,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“We announced nine targets in March last year, which included 20,000 fewer victims of serious violent crime by 2029, equating to 165,000 victims. We are tracking well ahead of that, although, we know there is still more work to do.

“Our tough gangs laws which came into effect a year ago, as committed to in the National, Act and NZ First coalition agreements, have contributed to that reduction and restoration of law and order. This Government is committed to ensuring criminals face real consequences for their actions, and prioritising victims.”

“One year ago, gangs were confronted with a new harsh reality - one where they can no longer behave as if they’re above the law by taking over our streets, intimidating the public, and making a mockery of our criminal justice system,” Mr Mitchell says.

“This is tough legislation. That is the point. Gang members make up less than one quarter of one per cent of the New Zealand adult population, yet are linked to about 18 per cent of serious violent crime. We make no apologies for getting tough on law and order.

“The few examples where patches have been returned to gang members is not at all representative of just how successful these laws have been. The numbers speak for themselves.”

Since the Gangs Act (2024) came into effect, Ministry of Justice and Police data shows there have been:

- **182 patches seized**
- **643 insignia items seized**
- **178 firearms** seized
- **856 charges** for Prohibited Display of Gang Insignia in Public Place
- **255 finalised charges,** 188 convictions

“I want to acknowledge and thank our Police who are working hard to hold gang members to account for their behaviour and criminal activities. I am very proud of the work they are doing every day to make our country safer,” Mr Mitchell says
