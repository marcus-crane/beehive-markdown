More than 10,000 additional MRI and CT scans will be delivered each year for Hawke’s Bay patients, enabling faster diagnoses, following the completion of Stage 1 of the radiology upgrade at Hawke’s Bay Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“These significant upgrades, announced in January this year, will help Hawke’s Bay patients get the answers and treatment they need sooner,” Mr Brown says.

“Previous radiology facilities were outdated and unable to meet current or future demand. This refurbishment doubles the MRI and CT imaging capacity, ensuring faster, more reliable diagnostic services for patients.”

The first stage of the $35.8 million upgrade has delivered:

- An additional 808m² of floor space to accommodate new equipment and patient areas
- A second MRI, providing 4000 - 6000 extra scans per year
- A second CT scanner, doubling CT capacity with 6000 - 10,000 extra scans annually

The new MRI has a more spacious opening, making scans more comfortable and accessible for all patients, while the second CT scanner allows emergency imaging to continue without delay for patients needing planned scans, enhancing the hospital’s resilience.

The facility has also been designed to maximise efficiency.

“Radiology staff can now prepare patients and provide post-scan care in dedicated spaces. This streamlined workflow allows more scans to be completed each day, meaning shorter wait times for diagnosis, urgent care, and elective treatment.”

These upgrades directly support the Government’s health targets:

- **Cancer treatment:** CT wait times, currently 2-3 weeks, will now consistently meet the two-week target. MRI services are already performing within target and will continue to support timely diagnosis.
- **Shorter emergency department stays:** Increased CT capacity means faster access to urgent imaging and quicker clinical decision-making.
- **Specialist assessments**: Expanded imaging will streamline diagnostic pathways and reduce reliance on outsourced services.
- **Elective treatment:** Enhanced imaging supports faster assessments and treatment planning.

The $1.3 million third endoscopy room is also set to open later this month, further strengthening the hospital’s diagnostic capacity. With two rooms currently delivering around 4,200 procedures a year, the addition of a third will increase capacity to nearly 6,800 procedures – an additional 2600 - including colonoscopies, gastroscopies, and other essential diagnostic tests.

“These investments are about future-proofing our health services for a growing population and ensuring Hawke’s Bay has the capacity and capability it needs for years to come.

“This upgraded radiology facility will help patients get the care they need faster, while giving clinicians the modern tools and technology to provide world-class care in Hawke’s Bay.”
