Vocational Education Minister, Penny Simmonds, has announced four new member appointments to the Board of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). 

“I am pleased to appoint and welcome Emeritus Professor Sally Davenport MNZM, Dr Uluomato'otua (Ulu) Saulaulu Aiono ONZM, Mr Simon Flood and Mr Michael (Mike) Chapman as new members of the TEC Board,” Ms Simmonds says.

“These appointments will strengthen the TEC Board and ensure it has the skills and focus to drive the implementation of the Government’s priorities for the tertiary education and training system. 

“The new members will help ensure the Board provides the expert oversight needed to guide the TEC through re-establishing regional polytechnics, focusing investment on the skills employers need, and ensuring New Zealand’s universities remain at the forefront of research and innovation.”

Dr Alan Bollard CNZM will continue as Chair of the TEC Board, with Robin Hapi CNZM continuing as Deputy Chair. 

“I would like to acknowledge and thank the four departing TEC Board members for their service: Emeritus Professor Alastair MacCormick CNZM, Deidre Shea MNZM, Kirk Hope, and Samuela (Sam) Sefuiva.

“Each has contributed meaningfully to the tertiary education system during their tenure. I especially wish to recognise the longstanding service of Emeritus Professor MacCormick, who has been a member of the Board since May 2017.”

The new Board members have been appointed for a three-year term.

“I look forward to working with the refreshed Board as we head into 2026 with a clear focus on the TEC’s delivery and investment priorities,” Ms Simmonds says.
