Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says the Government is using the latest drone and thermal imaging technology to boost the fight against bovine tuberculosis (TB).

Disease eradication agency OSPRI is trialling the use of thermal imaging drones to monitor and assess the location and density of possum populations, the main spreaders of the disease.

“I have challenged OSPRI to constantly seek out new and innovative ways to step up the fight against bovine TB.

“Many farmers today may not remember the terrible situation that existed back in the late 70’s through to the early 90’s where thousands of herds had TB infections, I remember as a child the anguish and cost this caused my parents whenever an infected cow was found in our herd.

“We only need to look across to the UK and Ireland nowadays to see how much this matters, particularly the mental strain this disease can cause on farmers. That’s why it’s so important that we finish the job.”

OSPRI is working on a selected trial site in the rugged tussock-covered hills of Central Otago where the massive landscapes make traditional possum control challenging.

“New Zealand farmers and taxpayers have invested millions of dollars in the control, and eventual eradication of this disease, but we must finish the job, it all comes down to controlling and monitoring possum numbers. This new technology is expected to give a major boost to this work.”

"This drone technology represents a real step-change in how we approach possum control in some of New Zealand's most challenging terrain.

In rugged terrain, traditional methods such as trapping, shooting, and helicopter operations are not only difficult but extraordinarily expensive.

These drones allow us to work smarter, not harder—they can access remote areas, detect possum populations, and pinpoint exactly where we need to deploy ground teams. It's a targeted approach that makes TB control more efficient and cost-effective.”

The Central Otago trial site was selected because it’s considered a hot spot for TB eradication. It’s also known to have a higher-than-average possum population.

“To eradicate bovine TB, we have to eradicate enough of the possums for the disease to be unable to exist in a possum population.

This technology could well be the kicker we need to achieve, sustainable, and enduring eradication of TB,” says Mr Hoggard.
