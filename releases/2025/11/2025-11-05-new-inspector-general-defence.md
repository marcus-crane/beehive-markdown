The House has today agreed to High Court Judge Hon Justice Timothy Brewer ONZM ED being appointed as the next Inspector-General of Defence and barrister Natalie Pierce being appointed as the inaugural Deputy, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Justice Brewer has served on the High Court bench since 2010 and is a former Brigadier in the Territorial Force of the New Zealand Army.  He has also served as a Judge of the Court Martial of New Zealand and the Court Martial Appeal Court.  I am delighted to have someone with Justice Brewer’s acumen and experience take on this important role.

“Ms Pierce is a barrister practising in domestic and international criminal law, human rights, and national defence and security. She has specialist experience in Royal Commissions and public inquiries, and has worked for the Crown Law Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Independent Police Conduct Authority.

“I would also like to acknowledge the services of Brendan Horsley who has held the IGD role concurrently with his role as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security until these longer-term appointments could be confirmed.

“Mr Horsley has provided expert oversight for the role of IGD and invaluable assistance in establishing the office.”

Justice Brewer will retire from the Bench on 15 November and will start the IGD role on 1 December.

Ms Pierce will take up her appointment on 10 November.

The functions of the Inspector-General are to investigate incidents that occur in the course of activities of the Defence Force, and to assess and identify potential improvements to Defence Force policies and procedures.
