We must join together to prevent violence against women, an issue that is tragically still too prevalent and under discussed in our communities.

Today is White Ribbon Day, the national day when people wear a white ribbon to show that they do not condone violence against women.

White Ribbon Day also celebrates the many men willing to show leadership and commitment to promoting safe, healthy relationships within families and encourages men to challenge each other on attitudes and behaviour that are abusive. 

“We all have a part to play in calling out bad behaviour when we see it,” says Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence Minister Karen Chhour. 

“We must join together to create a country where victims of family and sexual violence feel safe to speak up and get help – and where people who use violence access resources to change their behaviour or face the consequences if they continue to victimise others.” 

Today also marks the first of ‘16 Days of Activism’ – an international campaign to raise awareness about gender-based violence, challenge discriminatory attitudes, and call for an end to violence against women. 

The campaign runs from 25 November (International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) to 10 December (World Human Rights Day).

The Centre for Family Violence and Sexual Violence Prevention is collaborating with UN Women Aotearoa to post a series of videos with high-profile women on each day of the campaign, answering questions about what can be done, and what a world without gender-based violence would look like. 

These women include Minister Chhour, Minister for Women Nicola Grigg, Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, journalist Alison Mau, and others. 

“This campaign is not about saying men cannot suffer from violence – this is just a recognition of the statistics that show women and girls are more likely to be the victims of violence, as well as recognising that we all play a part in reducing violence in our communities,” says Minister Chhour.
