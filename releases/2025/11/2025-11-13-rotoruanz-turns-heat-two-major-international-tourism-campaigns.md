RotoruaNZ will receive more than $4.5 million to launch two campaigns inviting international visitors to soak up everything Rotorua and the wider North Island have to offer, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston announced today.

“I’m delighted to see RotoruaNZ leading the way with two innovative campaigns showcasing the region’s geothermal wonders, rich Māori culture, and renowned hospitality,” Louise Upston says.

“This investment will help Rotorua and its North Island partners reach new audiences, from independent travellers across Asia to Australians looking for fresh adventures. It’s been great to see strong collaboration and creative thinking encouraging visitors to go beyond the usual hotspots and discover the unique experiences that make this part of New Zealand truly unforgettable.”

The $2,025,000 “North Island x Ctrip” campaign to attract travellers from China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, in partnership with Ctrip and North Island regional tourism organisations.

The $2,500,000 “Kiwi North” campaign will focus on attracting people from Australia’s eastern seaboard in partnership with 14 North Island regional tourism organisations and major airlines.

“From bubbling mud pools and worldclass mountain biking in Rotorua, to beaches, vineyards, and vibrant cities across the North Island, there is something for every traveller to discover,” Louise Upston says.;

“Together, these campaigns aim to bring a fresh wave of international visitors, support local businesses, and reinforce Rotorua’s and the North Island’s reputation as must-visit destinations.”

Funding comes from the Regional Tourism Boost (Round 2), part of the Government’s $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package. It builds on a similar initiative earlier this year to now include hospitality offerings as part of the campaigns.

“By backing these campaigns, we are not just promoting destinations, we are inviting visitors to experience the warmth, adventure, and spirit of the North Island.”
