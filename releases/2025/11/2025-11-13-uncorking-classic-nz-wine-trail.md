WellingtonNZ and partner regions have received a major tourism and hospitality boost, putting the Classic New Zealand Wine Trail firmly in the international spotlight.

“I’m delighted to see WellingtonNZ and its regional partners championing the Classic NZ Wine Trail, weaving together some of our country’s most celebrated wine regions,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“The investment we’re announcing today will help Wellington, Wairarapa, Hawke’s Bay, and Marlborough reach new audiences and invite more visitors to savour their world-class wine, food, and stargazing. Wairarapa’s recent spotlight in Lonely Planet’s ‘Best in Travel’ list for its Dark Sky Reserve shows the region is already turning heads globally.

“It’s fantastic to see a campaign encouraging travellers to slow down, explore beyond the usual hotspots, and discover the rich flavours and experiences which make this trail so special.”

The $991,000 campaign, led by WellingtonNZ with regional partners, will promote Wellington, Wairarapa, Hawke’s Bay, and Marlborough to Australian visitors.

“By backing this campaign, we’re not just promoting great wine, we’re inviting visitors to experience the heart and soul of our regions,” Louise Upston says.

Funding comes from the Regional Tourism Boost (Round 2), part of the Government’s $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package. It builds on a similar initiative earlier this year to now include hospitality offerings as part of the campaigns.
