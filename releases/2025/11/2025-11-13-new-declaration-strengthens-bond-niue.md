Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Niue Prime Minister Dalton Tagelagi met in Auckland today to agree a foundational Political Declaration, encapsulating the partnership between the two countries.

“Niue is part of the Realm of New Zealand and one of our closest partners in the Pacific,” Mr Luxon says.

“By establishing the first enduring political declaration with Niue today, we are celebrating our relationship of free association and setting out our responsibilities to each other, as well as our shared goals.”

Prime Minister Tagelagi hosted Mr Luxon in Niue in June last year to celebrate 50 years of self-government in free association with New Zealand.

“This declaration reflects the journey of Niue and New Zealand since 1974 in free association. It affirms our mutual respect, and we look ahead to deeper cooperation in fundamental interests that matter most to our people.”

The signing today kicks off the first of what is to become an annual New Zealand and Niue Leaders’ meeting.

The discussions included Pacific regionalism, national security and defence, climate and economic priorities, and social and governance issues.

Reflecting the breadth of our bilateral relationship, Prime Minister Tagelagi also met with Her Excellency Governor General Cindy Kiro and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters, and will meet with Health Minister Simeon Brown, Police Minister Mark Mitchell, Climate Change Minister Simon Watts, and Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk.
