Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop has welcomed the Fast-track approval of a major metropolitan development project in Auckland.

Kiwi Property Holdings lodged an application in April 2025 for the 53-hectare Drury Metropolitan Centre development in South Auckland, which has now been approved by an expert panel.

The Drury Metropolitan Centre project includes developing land for future residential use and a mixed-use centre, including approximately 10,000 m² of commercial space, 56,000 m² of retail, and 2,000 m² for community activities.

“The development is projected to inject over $1.45 billion into Auckland’s economy over the next 11 years and is expected to deliver around 3,420 full-time direct employment roles in construction and related services,” Mr Bishop says.

“This is great news for jobs and growth in this fast-growing part of Auckland. The government is investing heavily into Drury and the surrounding area through new train stations at Drury, Ngākoroa, Paerātā, and electrification of the rail line to Pukekohe.

“Major roading projects in the area include the Papakura to Drury project, including additional lanes on SH1, wide shoulders for future bus services, and extensive interchange improvements at Drury. We are also delivering upgrades to Waihoehoe Road and the SH22 Drury Corridor to enable better access to the new train stations and support long-term growth and housing in the area.

“The government welcomes this investment into this important part of the Golden Triangle’s future prosperity.”

“The Drury Metropolitan Centre is the fifth project to receive Fast Track approval this year, following the Maitahi Village development in Nelson, the Milldale Development in Auckland, the Port of Auckland expansion and the reconsenting of the Tekapo A and B hydro scheme announced earlier this week.

“Fast track is delivering – it’s helping address our infrastructure deficit, it’s boosting housing supply, and it will create jobs and growth into the future.”

“The Fast-track Approvals Amendment Bill, which has its first reading in Parliament yesterday, will further speed up projects going through the approvals system and improve the efficiency of the Act.”
