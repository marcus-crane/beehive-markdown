The new Photon Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) scanner at Kenepuru Hospital, which opened last month, is already delivering significant benefits for patients in Porirua and the surrounding communities, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This modern technology is providing faster, more accurate, and far more detailed diagnostic imaging – helping patients get timely, quality care closer to home.

“In just four weeks, 245 patients have already been scanned, and CT outpatient activity across Wellington and Kenepuru has increased by 37 percent,” Mr Brown says.

Since the scanner became operational on 14 October, the benefits have been clear:

- Advanced PCCT imaging is detecting abnormalities that were previously undetectable.
- Patients are avoiding invasive procedures that would previously have been required.
- Inpatients are leaving hospital up to a week earlier thanks to improved vascular imaging.
- On-site imaging is reducing the need for ambulance transfers and transit nursing between Wellington and Kenepuru hospitals, improving hospital workflows and freeing up capacity.

“Since opening, the new PCCT scanner has already clarified the diagnosis for 20 patients, meaning they no longer need further tests. In addition, 18 cardiac patients who would previously have required an invasive angiography were able to receive a faster, non-invasive, fully diagnostic CT coronary angiogram instead – a 90 percent increase in non-invasive cardiac scans.

“The improvement in imaging is like moving from black-and-white television to Ultra-HD. With extremely detailed, fully diagnostic imaging, patients are being diagnosed and treated earlier, reducing hospital stays and allowing clinicians to focus on those with more complex needs.

“The next focus is to extend these benefits even further by expanding diagnostic services beyond the hospital. Plans are underway for a community-based service at Kenepuru, including a trial in partnership with local general practices.”

Mr Brown says these early results show just how transformative this technology can be for patients and the wider health system.

“By bringing world-class diagnostic imaging closer to home, we are improving patient outcomes, reducing pressure on hospitals, and making healthcare more accessible for the people of Porirua and the surrounding communities.”
