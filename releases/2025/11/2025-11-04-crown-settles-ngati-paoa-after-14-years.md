The Crown has settled 14 years of negotiations with Ngāti Paoa following legislation passing its final reading in Parliament today, Treaty for Waitangi Negotiations Paul Goldsmith says. 

“This is a historic day for which Ngāti Pāoa has waited far too long. The Crown has acknowledged the cumulative effect of its actions and omissions, including raupatu, the operation and impact of the native land laws and continued Crown purchasing.

“These left Ngāti Pāoa virtually landless and undermined the economic, social and cultural development of the iwi, breaching the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. 

“The Crown also acknowledged it breached the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles when it invaded the Waikato, attacked Ngāti Pāoa and shelled the unfortified village of Pūkorokoro in 1863 causing the death of iwi members.  

“Ngāti Pāoa have been very engaged in the legislative process for this Bill. Over 350 submissions were received by the Committee, the majority of which were from Ngāti Pāoa iwi members. Iwi representatives have also attended both the first and second readings. It was my pleasure to welcome Ngāti Pāoa back into the House today for the final reading.

“My hope is this settlement provides a platform to create a thriving future for Ngāti Pāoa and their generations to come, helping to renew and strengthen the relationship between Ngāti Paoa and the Crown.”

The Treaty settlement legislation provides:

- A Crown apology, including an agreed historical account.
- Crown acknowledgements of its historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi / Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
- Breaches of war and raupatu and promoting laws and policies that left Ngāti Pāoa virtually landless.
- Financial and commercial redress of $23.5 million.
- Cultural redress including 12 sites of traditional, historical and cultural significance to them.
- Agreements with a range of Crown agencies.
