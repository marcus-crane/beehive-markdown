The latest quarterly update from the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission show the National Infrastructure Pipeline now includes nearly 12,000 infrastructure projects worth a total of $275 billion, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop says.

“The Pipeline provides an independent view of current and future infrastructure projects and programmes across the country, from roads, to water infrastructure, to schools, and more, and includes central government, local government and private sector projects,” Mr Bishop says.

“Good infrastructure planning relies on good information. The more comprehensive the Pipeline becomes, the more value it delivers - helping to grow the economy, support jobs, and lift productivity across New Zealand.

“The Infrastructure Commission’s newly released snapshot report is based on September submissions to the Pipeline from 129 infrastructure providers, which now includes nearly 12,000 infrastructure projects, shows real momentum.

“We’re seeing projects advancing, information improving, and the total value of infrastructure initiatives in the Pipeline climbing to $275 billion, up from $237 billion in June this year.

“We’re also now seeing $181 billion worth of initiatives with full or partial funding commitments, or a confirmed funding source. This is up $56 billion from June.

“This lift is great news for the construction sector and the wider economy. A stronger, clearer picture of funded work gives the sector the confidence to plan ahead, retain staff, and invest in capability.”

The Pipeline records current and future infrastructure projects from central government, local government, and the private sector, covering transport, water, education, health, housing, and more. It provides a national view of investment activity underway or being planned, supporting better decisions across the system.

“At the end of September this year there were $61 billion of infrastructure projects under construction, and another $20 billion progressing through planning and scheduled to start construction in the next 12 months,” Mr Bishop says.

“In addition to funded projects, the Pipeline includes early-stage initiatives that have not yet secured a funding source.

“These early-stage initiatives matter too. They help signal future demand, highlight market constraints and opportunities, and support workforce planning. A more complete Pipeline is better for everyone - from councils and contractors to central government agencies.

“This growth reflects better reporting, more initiatives being captured, and improved information quality. A clear view of both committed investments and the large set of options that may seek funding is vital for good decision-making,” Mr Bishop says.

“The September update will also inform the final stages of the National Infrastructure Plan, which will provide forward guidance on a sustainable investment path for infrastructure, highlight large unfunded Pipeline initiatives, and set out recommendations to improve system performance.

“The Pipeline is steadily moving toward a more complete picture of regional and sectoral infrastructure activity, although there is still room for improvement.”
