The New Dunedin Hospital project has reached a significant construction milestone, with pile capping for the new inpatient building now successfully completed, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Completing the pile capping is a major achievement for this project. It demonstrates real, tangible progress on the ground and marks a crucial step toward delivering the world-class hospital that Dunedin and the surrounding Otago and Southland region deserve,” Mr Brown says.

Construction on the inpatient building resumed on the former Cadbury site in July, which is transforming quickly.

A total of 154 pile caps have now been installed, connecting 324 deep foundation piles. Pile capping involves securing the tops of the piles with steel-reinforced concrete to create a stable base for the building’s substructure. 

With this foundational phase complete, the project is now progressing to the next stage of construction,

“Substructure work is now underway, including forming the basement and ground-floor concrete slabs. Preparations are also advancing for the arrival and installation of the structural steel framework, with mechanical, electrical, and plumbing coordination progressing in tandem.

“From mid-2026, the steel structure will begin to rise from the site, giving the community a clear sense of the scale and ambition of this new hospital.

“It’s also encouraging to see several Dunedin-based companies working alongside lead contractor CPB Contractors. Around 40 workers are on site each day, and the transformation is becoming more visible every week. At peak construction, the project will support more than 900 full-time-equivalent jobs and inject around $100 million into the local economy annually.

“This is an exciting moment for Dunedin and the wider region. As momentum builds, the project is not only delivering a modern, fit-for-purpose hospital but also supporting local employment, strengthening businesses, and boosting long-term confidence in the region’s future.

“The completion of pile capping marks another significant step toward delivering the world-class hospital this community has been waiting for.”
