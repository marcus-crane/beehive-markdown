Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced appointments to the Public Health Advisory Committee, which provides independent advice on public health issues and the promotion of public health.

Existing committee member Dr Caroline McElnay has been appointed Chair, with Professor Peter Crampton appointed Deputy Chair. They are joined by newly appointed members Professor Paula Lorgelly, Associate Professor Kaaren Mathias, and Professor Matire Harwood.

The Committee advises the Government on a wide range of public health matters, including the factors that influence the health and wellbeing of people, families, and communities.

“These members bring a wealth of public health expertise and will play a vital role in guiding work to improve health outcomes for all New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.

“This Government is committed to ensuring people can access timely, quality public health services. Strengthening prevention and focusing on what keeps people well is critical to a resilient health system.”

“I look forward to working with the Committee to improve the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders and help communities stay well.”

Members have been appointed for two or three years, beginning 1 December 2025.
