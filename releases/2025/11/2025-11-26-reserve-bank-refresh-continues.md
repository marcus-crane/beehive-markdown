Former investment banker Rodger Finlay has been appointed Chair of the Reserve Bank and businesswoman Rhiannon McKinnon has been appointed to the Bank’s Board. 

“The appointments are the latest milestones in the refresh of the Reserve Bank, Finance Minister Nicola Willis says.

“The Bank now has a new Chair, a new Governor who starts next week, new members of the Board and Monetary Policy Committee, a new Financial Policy Committee, and a new, more modest, funding agreement. In addition, it is operating under a fresh set of expectations from the Government that require it to place greater emphasis on banking competition.”

Nicola Willis says Rodger Finlay has been Deputy Chair of the Bank since February 2023 and has been exercising the functions of the Chair since August.

“I have confidence in him to lead the work to deliver on the Government’s expectations for increased accountability, transparency and fiscal discipline and to focus on the Bank’s statutory responsibilities. 

“He has experience governing large, complex organisations in both the private and public sectors. Past governance roles include chairing NZ Post, Kiwi Group Holdings, NZ Oil and Gas and PGG Wrightson.

Rhiannon McKinnon is a Chartered Financial Analyst and former chief executive of Kiwi Wealth where she managed $10 billion in funds. She coaches and advises CEOs and has had board roles with the NZ Film Commission, CFA Society of NZ and Dress for Success Wellington. 

Rodger Finlay’s appointment is for the remainder of his current term which is to 30 June 2027. Rhiannon McKinnon’s appointment is for five years to 30 November 2030.
