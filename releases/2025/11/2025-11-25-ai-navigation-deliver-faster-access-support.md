New Zealanders seeking mental health support will soon have a better understanding of what services are available to them, thanks to government funding for Whakarongorau to develop a mental health AI navigation platform, Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey says.

“Not knowing where to go or who to talk to has been reported as the reason for unmet mental health needs in one third of children and more than a quarter of adults. This new platform will help remove those barriers and guide people to the right support,” Mr Doocey says.

“People will be able to see what support is available in their area and in some instances, even book with them directly. Online tools will also be available to those reaching out on the platform, allowing us to intervene early and prevent problems from escalating.

“The platform will enhance visibility of the current range of telehealth services as well as in-person options, such as mental health practitioners in GP practices or Gumboot Friday councillors making it clear that support is available no matter where you are in New Zealand.

"Often, the first step in seeking support is the hardest. Many people don’t know where to start, and it can feel overwhelming. With a digital front door, Kiwis can access a tool that helps triage and guide them where to go and what to do.

“As I’ve said previously, the mental health system is too fragmented and needs to be more joined up. Most people would be surprised by how much support exists. Which is why this platform aims to increase New Zealanders knowledge of what support is available.

“This initiative is a good example of the answers to the issues we have in mental health are already in the sector but just need the opportunity to be backed.

“We are clear that access to support should never be a barrier. Digital tools provide faster, 24/7 access, when and where people need it.

“We are focused on delivering faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response, digital tools can help make this happen.”
