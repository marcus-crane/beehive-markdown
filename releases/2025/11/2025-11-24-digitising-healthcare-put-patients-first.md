Repeating your medical history at every appointment will soon be a thing of the past, with Kiwis set to get faster access to care as part of a 10-year plan to bring New Zealand's health system into the digital age, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

"Our health system is being held back by outdated, disconnected technology. Right now, 65 per cent of hospitals still use paper-based notes, and critical information doesn't flow between your GP and hospital in many parts of the country," Mr Brown says.

"This means patients often have to repeat their story multiple times, and clinicians waste valuable time on paperwork instead of treating patients.

"Currently, Health New Zealand has over 6000 digital systems – one different computer system for every 15 staff members. That's the result of years of underinvestment and quick fixes instead of proper planning.

"To address this, we're releasing New Zealand's first Health Digital Investment Plan – a 10-year roadmap to modernise healthcare, with investments in technologies that will make a real difference for patients right now."

The plan’s five core objectives are to improve outcomes for patients and families, support clinicians, stabilise critical infrastructure, build foundations for innovation, and enable data-driven decision-making.

Investments will be made in a single Electronic Medical Record system across the health sector, enabling medical information to flow seamlessly and securely between GPs, specialists, and hospitals. The plan will also fund remote patient monitoring to support earlier discharge, a national radiology system to prioritise urgent cases, and stronger cybersecurity to protect patient information.

"Imagine getting your cancer diagnosis and having your entire treatment journey coordinated through connected systems – no repeated tests, no lost referrals, no wondering what happens next. That's what modern digital healthcare looks like.

"Modernising a system this complex takes time. The 10-year plan will be delivered in three phases – stabilising critical systems, modernising platforms, and enabling innovative healthcare models that put patients first. Each phase builds the foundation for the next, and Health New Zealand is already taking action Kiwis will see in the next few years.”

The Government is establishing the Centre for Digital Modernisation of Health – a collaboration between Health New Zealand and delivery partners that brings together global innovation capabilities, artificial intelligence expertise, and world-class process engineering to coordinate critical investments.

"This is a completely new approach for Health New Zealand, tackling the kind of large, complex programmes that have failed in the past when governments have tried to do them alone.

“But we aren’t waiting to move. The Accelerate programme is digitising patient notes in hospitals that rely on paper and upgrading Wi-Fi and device availability to support clinicians across hospital settings. Health New Zealand has also established HealthX to accelerate innovation and the use of AI."

Sponsored by the Chief Executive, HealthX will roll out one innovation initiative each month to bring digital tools to the frontline, including:

- AI scribes in emergency departments to reduce time spent writing notes and speed up flow.
- Remote patient monitoring for safe home recovery.
- Augmenting x-ray processes to speed diagnosis.

"Our Government is focused on fixing the basics while building the future so that all patients have access to timely, quality healthcare. Smarter digital investment means shorter wait times, safer care, and a health system that works for all New Zealanders."
