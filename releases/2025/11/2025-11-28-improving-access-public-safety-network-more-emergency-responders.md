The Government is strengthening New Zealand’s Emergency Responder capability by creating a new entity, and expanding the mandate of Next Generation Critical Communications, announced Emergency Management and Recovery Minster Mark Mitchell.

“Around 25,000 frontline responders already use the Public Safety Network cellular services, improving coverage and reliability during emergencies. Cabinet has now given Next Generation Critical Communications (NGCC) the mandate to expand these services to the wider emergency management sector.” says Mr. Mitchell.

“Our first responders and those who work in public safety, are simply outstanding. They go willingly into situations and places that most New Zealanders do not have to go. This change will support them in operational situations, and enable them to keep themselves and the public safe.”

Since 2020 NGCC been working on behalf of Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, Hato Hone St John, and Wellington Free Ambulance to deliver the $1.4b Public Safety Network. NGCC will now support a larger eligible customer group of central and local government entities, not-for-profit organisations and infrastructure and lifelines companies.

“With top-tier emergency communications in place, New Zealand will be better prepared to respond to the variety of disasters we have seen over the past few years, such as Cyclones Gabrielle or Tam”.

The new limited liability company will be listed in Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989.

Shareholding Ministers of the new company will be the Minister for Emergency Management and Recovery and the Minister of Finance.

**Note to editors:**

NGCC will offer the Public Safety Network’s Cellular Services on a user-pays basis to eligible organisations from mid-2026.
