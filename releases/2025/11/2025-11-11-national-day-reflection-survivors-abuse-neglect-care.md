The Government’s marking one year on from the public apology to survivors of abuse and neglect in care by acknowledging and remembering those who suffered while in the care of the State or faith-based institutions.

“A year ago, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and seven public sector leaders apologised for the abuse and neglect suffered by children, young people and vulnerable adults in care and for the torture of children and young people at the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit,” Lead Coordination Minister Erica Stanford says.

“While it was meaningful for many, it can never undo the harm inflicted on people who should have been protected and cared for. Instead, they were utterly failed. The experiences of thousands of brave survivors will forever be etched in our history. It is on all New Zealanders to do all we can to ensure abuse that should never have been tolerated, no longer occurs.

Around New Zealand, 65 public and private events led by survivor communities and their supporters received support from the National Day of Reflection Fund announced by the Government in July. Events include whānau days, performances, cultural and remembrance ceremonies, film screenings, and exhibitions.

“To further support survivors, the Government is allocating an additional $2.7 million for a second round of the Survivor Support and Recognition Fund which will open on 13 November. The contestable fund is for non-government organisations and community groups to deliver support and services to survivors of abuse in care and local authorities to identify and memorialise unmarked graves.

“A year on from the apology there continues to be significant work to be done to prevent, identify, and respond to abuse in care. The Government remains committed to continuing this work with care to ensure the wrongs of the past are not repeated,” Ms Stanford says.
