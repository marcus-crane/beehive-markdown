A key milestone has been reached in the redevelopment of Whangārei Hospital, with the sod turning for a major on-grade car parking extension to enable construction of the new acute services building, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Car parks are a vital part of hospital infrastructure and are essential for patients, staff, and visitors as we continue the transformation of Whangārei Hospital,” Mr Brown says.

Construction of Car Park 14 will deliver 583 new spaces, supporting and enabling progress on the wider hospital redevelopment, including the new acute services building and child health centre.

“Importantly, the new car park will be completed and operational by the end of May 2026, before more than 480 existing spaces become temporarily unavailable due to construction. This will ensure uninterrupted access to hospital services for patients, visitors, and staff.

“Further, it is critical to commencing construction of the new acute services building while maintaining, and ultimately increasing, the number of car parks available on site.

“Once the child health centre is completed, total hospital parking capacity will increase from 1,415 to 1,977, delivering a significant long-term improvement for the Whangārei community.

“The new car park will include clear wayfinding and user-friendly infrastructure to ensure a smooth experience for patients and visitors.”

Mr Brown acknowledged the advocacy and support of Whangārei MP Hon Dr Shane Reti, who joined the sod-turning ceremony.

“We know parking is a real issue for the community. This project not only offsets the temporary loss of spaces but also increases overall capacity. It’s another practical step forward in ensuring people can get the care they need, when they need it.”

“The redevelopment of Whangārei Hospital is about delivering a modern, accessible hospital that Northlanders can rely on. I look forward to seeing continued progress across the campus in the months ahead.”
