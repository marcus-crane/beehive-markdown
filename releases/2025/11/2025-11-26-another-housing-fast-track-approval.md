Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop has welcomed the Fast-track approval of a residential and retirement development in Riverhead, Auckland. 

Rangitoopuni Developments Limited lodged an application in May 2025 to subdivide land and develop approximately 208 residential allotments and a 296-unit retirement village, which has now been approved by an independent expert panel. 

“Rangitoopuni Developments Limited’s application also included plans for public amenities, walking tracks, landscaping and the protection of wetland areas” says Mr Bishop.

“This is another housing development approved through Fast-track that will help increase housing supply and address Auckland’s housing needs. 

“The Rangitoopuni development will deliver significant economic benefits to Auckland, with the project projected to inject $708 million and more than 7,000 jobs over the nine-year development period. This will provide a major boost for the region and for local communities.

“This is now the sixth project to be approved through the Fast-track system.”
