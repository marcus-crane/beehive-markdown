Health New Zealand is launching a major nationwide Measles Immunisation Week from 3–7 November, and the Government is urging all New Zealanders to check their immunisation status and make sure their families are protected, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Associate Education Minister David Seymour says.

“Cases of measles continue to rise, and there’s never been a better time to act,” Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Measles is one of the most infectious viruses in the world – a single case can infect 12 to 18 unvaccinated people. If you’re not immunised and you’re exposed, there’s a 90 per cent chance you’ll get it. That’s why we’re encouraging people to use Measles Immunisation Week to get their MMR vaccine.”

The nationwide campaign is designed to:

- Raise public awareness about the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine
- Encourage timely immunisation for people of all ages
- Support the efforts of the health sector to stop the spread of measles.

“Extra clinics are running throughout the week. If your child is 12 months or older and hasn’t yet had the MMR vaccine – don’t delay.

“And if you were born between 1969 and 2004, check if you’re fully immunised. We need 95 per cent of the population immune to prevent outbreaks.”

Everyone in New Zealand aged 12 months or over is currently able to receive free MMR immunisations.

Associate Education Minister David Seymour reinforced the importance of keeping children in school, following updated advice from the Director-General of Health.

“If there hasn’t been a confirmed case of measles at a school, all students should continue attending – regardless of their vaccination status,” Mr Seymour says.

Where a case is confirmed, Health New Zealand’s National Public Health Service (NPHS) will match school rolls with the Aotearoa Immunisation Register. Students who have not received two doses of MMR may be asked to stay home only if they are identified as close contacts.

“Covid had a major impact on attendance rates, attendance culture, and what’s considered acceptable. We’re taking a balanced and rational approach. While measles is dangerous and we’re taking it seriously, school closures or blanket exclusions are not justified where there is no direct risk.

“An education crisis today becomes a crime crisis, a vulnerable children crisis, an inequality crisis tomorrow. That’s why we are restoring a culture that values attendance, responsibility, and long-term success.”

Measles cases have been confirmed across multiple regions, including Northland, Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, and Nelson. Health New Zealand has confirmed signs of community transmission – not just imported cases.
