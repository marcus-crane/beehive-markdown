The Christchurch City Council has been selected to serve as a one-stop consenting authority for large-scale supermarket developments.

Finance Minister Nicola Willis says the new service is the latest step in the Government’s plans to make New Zealand a more attractive destination for new supermarkets.

“More supermarkets equals more competition equals lower prices. 

“Until now, new supermarket developers have faced having to deal with up to 66 different councils, 66 different processes and 66 different responses. That’s a disincentive to setting up shop here. 

“The establishment of a one-stop shop means a developer looking to build in multiple locations now only has to deal with one authority.

“The purpose of the new service is to encourage competition in a sector which is dominated by the Foodstuffs and Woolworths chains. Between them, they effectively control 82 per cent of the market.

“Therefore, the new service is primarily for grocery businesses that are not a part of those chains. However, it also covers any supermarket developments that have been referred via the fast-track process for supermarkets that increase competition on a regional or national scale. 

“Christchurch is a leader in commercial builds and the council has well-established working relationships with other councils that will be used to ensure smooth processes on the ground. 

“The appointment of a single building authority complements the changes being made to better enable replication of approved designs through MultiProof – a process that halves consent timeframes.

“Kiwi shoppers deserve choice at the checkout. A single consenting authority makes it easier and faster for new supermarkets to enter the market and build at scale,” Nicola Willis says.

**Notes to editors:** 

The service covers new standalone buildings (minimum 500m²) for grocery businesses that are not Regulated Grocery Retailers (RGRs) (i.e. not Foodstuffs North Island, Foodstuffs South Island, and Woolworths NZ). It also covers any supermarket developments (new competitors or RGRs) that have been referred via the Fast-track Approvals Act 2024.

Mixed-use or mall developments, fitouts or conversions of existing buildings, and substantial renovations (unless previously consented under this service) are out of scope.

There are 68 building consent authorities (BCAs) responsible for delivering building control functions in New Zealand. This includes 66 territorial or regional authorities (councils), one private BCA, and Consentium, an independent division of Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities.
