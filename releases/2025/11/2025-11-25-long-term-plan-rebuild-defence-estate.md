The Government has unveiled a long-term plan to modernise Defence Force infrastructure that will strengthen military resilience and create building and construction jobs across New Zealand.

“The national security of New Zealand depends on a strong Defence estate that empowers the Force to perform at its best,” Associate Minister Chris Penk says.

“Modern facilities support personnel to train, deploy and operate equipment at their peak, while safe and healthy workplaces and homes are essential for their wellbeing.

“Sadly, our infrastructure is not equipped to realise this vision. Much of it is aged, fragile and prone to failure, with more than 70 percent of New Zealand Defence Force infrastructure now having less than 20 years of useful life remaining.

“Failure to act will result in facility closures, degraded training that undermines operational capability, and increased risks to personnel. Regenerating the estate is essential to maintain a high level of operational readiness.

“The Defence Estate Portfolio Plan (DEPP) sets out a long-term vision to deliver major regeneration by 2040, ensuring our camps, bases and training areas are fit for purpose and equipped to meet the needs of a modern Defence Force.

“The DEPP sets out the investment priorities for the $2.5 billion identified in the Defence Capability Plan 2025 to modernise and strengthen Defence infrastructure over the next four years, subject to annual budget processes.

“It replaces earlier regeneration plans and takes a more holistic portfolio approach by bringing together service-critical assets, training infrastructure, and housing across the Defence estate.”

As part of the DEPP, Cabinet has given the green light to the Future Naval Base Programme.

“Devonport Naval Base is vital to the Defence Force as New Zealand’s only naval port, yet the current infrastructure cannot fully meet the Navy’s operational, training and support requirements,” Mr Penk says.

“The Programme addresses historic underinvestment with significant new projects to provide fit-for-purpose accommodation, training facilities, wharf improvements and horizontal infrastructure.

“Investment also extends to associated sites such as Narrow Neck, Kauri Point, and the Tamaki Leadership Centre at Whangaparāoa.

“These upgrades will be rolled out in tranches, enhancing the Royal New Zealand Navy’s ability to operate safely and effectively. The first tranche is already underway, with $25 million in capital funding provided through Budget 2025.”

Alongside the Future Naval Base Programme, the DEPP supports the continuation of five other programmes that back Defence capability and renew infrastructure.

These include:

- **Defence Estate Regeneration Programme (DERP)** – Renewing ageing, service-critical infrastructure using depreciation reserves across camps and bases, training areas and regional facilities.
- **Horizontal Infrastructure Workstream** – Upgrading essential services like water, power, ICT, and roads across Defence sites.
- **Homes for Families Programme** – Delivering modern housing for Defence families at multiple locations.
- **Ōhakea Infrastructure Programme** – Supporting Air Force capability through targeted infrastructure upgrades at RNZAF Base Ōhakea.
- **Accommodation Messing and Dining Modernisation Programme** – Upgrading barracks, messing and dining facilities to improve living standards and support retention.

“Altogether, this is a generational investment in Defence infrastructure that strengthens strategic objectives, bolsters preparedness, and ensures our people have the facilities to excel at work and recharge while off duty,” Mr Penk says.

“The DEPP also delivers a boost for New Zealand’s building and construction industry. Renovations and new projects across bases and camps nationwide will create jobs and economic opportunities in local communities for years to come.

“This Government is investing in the foundations of our Defence Force. We are building the infrastructure that enables capability, supports our hard-working servicemen and women, and safeguards our country.”
