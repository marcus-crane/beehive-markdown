New research from the Education Review Office (ERO) shows the Government’s decision to ban cell phones in schools is working and is delivering better student outcomes.

“Our Government is relentlessly focused on raising student achievement and closing the equity gap at school. That’s why in our first 100 days, we removed cell phones from classrooms so our young people could focus more on their learning. This report confirms our bold move hasn’t just done that, it’s also improved student behaviour and reduced bullying,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

In secondary schools, ERO found:

- 79 per cent of teachers report removing phones from the classroom has improved students’ ability to focus on work.
- 61 per cent report student achievement has improved.
- 77 per cent say removing cell phones have improved student behaviour.
- 69 per cent report bullying in their schools has reduced.

“These results are clear evidence that removing the distraction of cell phone use has a positive impact on student achievement and wellbeing. Not only do they have greater focus in the classroom, but students are also developing stronger connections and building more effective learning habits. Parents can be confident when their children are at school, we’re giving them the best chance to reach their full potential.

“Despite these results, there is more work to do. The report found about a third of Year 12 and 13 students don’t follow the rules, the most common reason is to message parents during the day. Parents have an important part to play in helping their children understand the benefits of staying off cell phones during school.

ERO made several recommendations including increasing visibility of the benefits of removing digital distractions and what good practice in school compliance looks like. Advice and guidelines for schools will be updated to align with the findings. ERO also suggests expanding the policy to include banning smartwatches at school.

“We know access to technology is changing rapidly, the first step was banning cell phones. We are thinking carefully about future policy considerations and will seek further advice on this. Regardless, individual schools can make their own choices about what’s appropriate for their community,” Ms Stanford says

“We remain committed raising achievement and delivering better outcomes for our young people. This report is yet more evidence our reforms are achieving that.”
