Stalking will become a criminal offence punishable by up to five years in prison, following legislation passing its final reading in Parliament today, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“This legislation, which creates a new offence of stalking and harassment, is long overdue.

“For far too long, stalkers have been able to harm their victims through unwanted, persistent and repetitive intrusions into their lives, causing serious emotional, psychological and economic harm, without facing legal consequences.

“Our government is committed to ensuring there are real consequences for crime and that the needs of victims are always prioritised. It underpins all our work to restore law and order.

“Today is a victory for a wide range of New Zealanders. Anybody can be a victim of stalking and harassment. However, women are greatly overrepresented as victims by the deluded, the sexist, and the abusive. Even worse, their children are frequently exploited to surveil victims, pass on threats, or even be threatened themselves. 

“This victory would not be possible without the tireless advocacy and help of many people. I want to thank the over 600 submitters to the Justice Committee. Many of them bravely shared their own stories, experiences and the impact stalking and harassment had on their lives.

“Stalking and harassment is vicious, sinister and can be deadly. Today, Parliament has sent a clear message – this insidious behaviour has to stop.”

The new offence of stalking and harassment is defined as a pattern of behaviour which the offender knew was likely to cause the victim fear or distress.

A pattern of behaviour is defined as two specified acts within a 2-year period. These specified acts are listed in the Bill. A Police notice system and relevant defences are also built into the new offence.

The Crimes Legislation (Stalking and Harassment) Amendment Bill outlines a range of stalking behaviours, including:

- Watching and following another person.
- Unwanted communication.
- Damaging another’s reputation and relationships.

The Bill will come into force in May 2026, six months after the legislation receives Royal assent, to allow for training for Police, court staff and the judiciary, and the development of information for the public.
