Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced appointments to the Health Workforce Committee, which provides advice to ensure New Zealand has a health workforce that can meet the needs of communities now and into the future.

Dr David Gow has been appointed Chair, and is joined by new members Dr Jeremy Dryden, Dr Ruth Large, and Dr Allan Moffitt. Dr Gary Hopgood will continue as a member.

The Committee provides long-term advice and recommendations on health workforce matters, including strategic direction, and emerging issues and risks.

“These members bring strong clinical experience and a clear understanding of the workforce opportunities and challenges across our health system,” Mr Brown says.

“This Government is focused on ensuring all New Zealanders can access timely, quality care, and our health professionals are central to achieving that. The Committee’s advice will support our ongoing investment in strengthening the frontline.

“I look forward to working with the Committee to help build the capability and capacity our health system needs.

“I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Dr Bryan Betty and Dr Andrew Connolly to the Committee. They will continue this important work in their new roles, with Dr Betty serving as Chair of the Primary Care Advisory Group and Dr Connolly as Deputy Chair of the Health New Zealand Board.”

Members have been appointed for three years, beginning 1 December 2025.
