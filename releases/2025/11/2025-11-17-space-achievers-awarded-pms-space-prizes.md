Co-founder and CEO of Dawn Aerospace Stefan Powell and Southland schoolgirl Sophie Ineson are this year’s recipients of the Prime Minister’s Space Prizes.

“These prizes highlight the extraordinary talent and vision driving our space industry forward today and celebrate the next generation,” Mr Luxon says.

“Stefan and Dawn Aerospace have made a remarkable impact on our space industry. Stefan’s leadership shows how innovation and excellence in this sector are fuelling economic growth, creating high-value jobs and attracting global investment to New Zealand.

“Year 12 student Sophie’s innovative research exploring how Southland’s natural materials could enhance wound care for astronauts is highly impressive.  

“This kind of forward-thinking not only holds promise for space exploration but also for the future of healthcare on Earth.” 

Ms Collins says this year’s winners exemplify the vision, innovation and dedication of people and businesses in the rapidly growing industry.

“An [economic report](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/innovation-for-growth-charting-the-space-and-advanced-aviation-sectors.pdf) released earlier this year confirms just how significant the space and advanced aviation sectors are to New Zealand’s economy, with space sector revenue growing 53 percent to $2.68 billion in the five years to 2024. The advanced aviation sector, which overlaps with the space sector, generated an estimated $530 million in revenue in 2024. 

“Our space sector supports approximately 17,000 skilled jobs – up from 12,000 in 2019 - while our advanced aviation sector supports 3700 jobs,” Ms Collins says.   

“This growth is a testament to people like Stefan and Sophie, and these prizes shine a spotlight on the incredible talent and ingenuity driving these sectors. I am proud to celebrate their achievements as we continue to position New Zealand as a leader in the global space industry.”

As winners of the 2025 Prime Minister’s Space Prizes, Stefan Powell will receive $100,000 and Sophie Ineson will receive $50,000 which is intended to support tertiary education.
