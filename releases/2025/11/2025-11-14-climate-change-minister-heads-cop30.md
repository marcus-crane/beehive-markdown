Climate Change Minister Simon Watts will attend the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, next week.

“New Zealand needs all countries to take meaningful climate action, in line with rules we all agree to. This is critical for our economy and the Pacific region,” Mr Watts says.

COP30 brings governments together, alongside the private sector and civil society, to make decisions about how the Paris Agreement – the international treaty on climate change – continues to be implemented.

“The Government is committed to its climate change obligations, including the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is our best shot at limiting the impacts of climate change and New Zealand is at the COP to help make it work effectively,” Mr Watts says.

“The global shift to a low-emissions economy offers opportunities for growth. At the Summit, I will be focused on deepening cooperation to support New Zealand’s own transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient economy through innovation, technology and investment.”

As well as taking part in the Summit’s formal agenda, Mr Watts will meet with key Ministerial counterparts from around the globe, and with New Zealanders who are travelling to Belém.

“I will also be talking closely with my counterparts from Australia and the Pacific, hopefully to lock in Australia’s bid to host a Pacific-focused COP next year,” Mr Watts says.

En route to COP, Mr Watts will also visit São Paulo, where he will be promoting New Zealand companies selling clean-tech and sustainability focused products into the Latin America market.

Mr Watts departs New Zealand on Sunday 16 November and returns on Friday 21 November. He will be travelling with Labour's spokesperson for Climate Change Deborah Russell.
