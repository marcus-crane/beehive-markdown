The Government has released an investigative report showing Eden Park planning restrictions could be costing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue with hundreds of fewer jobs and is inviting public feedback on proposed changes, RMA Reform Minister Chris Bishop says.

“Eden Park is a vital asset for Auckland and for New Zealand, hosting major sporting and entertainment events that inject millions into the local economy,” Mr Bishop says.

“Restrictive local planning rules, however, are stifling Eden Park’s ability to drive economic growth and create jobs, according to the investigative report.

“The report looks at whether local planning rules - such as strict limits on the number and timing of concerts and sporting events - are restricting Eden Park’s capacity to contribute further to Auckland’s economic growth.

“The investigation found that restrictions on Eden Park’s operations will cost the region at least $432 million in lost income with 751 fewer jobs over the next 10 years, unless changes are made.

“On Monday I wrote to the Council with a copy of the report. They have 20 working days (until 28 November) to come back with their feedback.

“Today, as well as releasing the report, we invite the public to give feedback on the recommended changes to the planning rules relating to events at Eden Park.”

Recommendations in the Eden Park report include:

- Enabling a broader range of uses such as markets, fairs, trade fairs, cultural, and community events
- Permitting 12 large concerts (30,000+ people) and 20 medium concerts (10-30,000) each calendar year
- More flexibility on timing for concerts, including permitting concerts of up to eight hours duration
- More flexibility for sports games
- Three levels of noise standards with different noise limits for everyday activities, sports games, and concerts
- Removal of size limits for conferences and large functions

Currently, Eden Park’s event restrictions include:

- A limit of six artists for a total of 12 concerts per year, with strict conditions on days, times, and event duration
- A cap on the number of night-time sporting fixtures with controls on scheduling, particularly on Sunday evenings
- Limiting conferences and functions to a maximum of 2,000 attendees

“These rules were originally put in place in an attempt to balance use of Eden Park as a venue with the local community’s preferences around noise and traffic levels. However it’s important to ensure the rules remain fit for purpose and do not unnecessarily hold back Auckland’s event and tourism sectors,” Mr Bishop says.

“We know that big concerts deliver big economic benefits. For instance, over three years, 14 Auckland shows including Coldplay and Pearl Jam generated $33.7 million for the local economy.

“Tourism is already our second-largest export earner and contributes $17 billion to GDP as well as providing nearly 200,000 jobs. We want to see the sector continue to grow.

“The conferences and convention sector is also growing. Last year it grew 10 per cent and delivered over $280 million to the New Zealand economy, creating jobs and opportunities for New Zealanders.

“The Government is committed to making sure our planning system supports economic growth and vibrant communities.

"A public consultation process on the proposed Eden Park rule changes begins today and will run until 19 November 2025 via the Ministry for the Environment’s online consultation hub.

“I encourage people – particularly local residents and business owners – to give feedback through this process.

“Following the consultation, I will consider what changes are warranted to create local jobs and boost economic growth for the region and hope to make further announcements by the end of this year.”

Details on how to participate in the consultation and access the full investigation report are available on the Have Your Say section area of the Ministry’s website.
