The upgraded Auckland public transport network with City Rail Link (CRL) at its heart will open to passengers in the second half of 2026.

Transport Minister Chris Bishop, Auckland Minister Simeon Brown, Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown and Auckland Deputy Mayor Desley Simpson confirmed the project is on track to open in 2026, but that significant important work still needs to happen to ensure a safe, reliable service at opening.

“The finish line for the City Rail Link is getting closer,” Minister Bishop says.

“CRL is a massive multi-billion-dollar investment for the Government and Auckland Council. New Zealand can look forward to the benefits this project will deliver next year.

“World-class new stations have taken shape, while streets and public spaces affected by construction are now reopening to Aucklanders. Work is moving from construction to systems testing and commissioning.

“Aucklanders continue to show patience and understanding as this massive construction project begins to see light at the end of the tunnel, and we want to thank them for that. It won’t be too much longer.

“Opening an underground rail line is complex. There is a thorough programme of tests to make sure the CRL is safe, and that the new train timetable is reliable from day one.”

“This announcement gives Aucklanders confidence that the City Rail Link is firmly on track to open in 2026. This is the largest transport infrastructure project in New Zealand’s history,” Minister Brown says.

“City Rail Link will transform the way Aucklanders move around their city. It will reduce travel times, increase train frequency and unlock the potential of our CBD.

“CRL is going to bring thousands more people into the city every day – supporting businesses, growing the economy, and ensuring Auckland is a world-class city.”

“The good news is Aucklanders and visitors will finally be able to use the CRL in the second half of 2026. We know this is by far the most complex project undertaken in New Zealand and it takes time to get things right,” says Mayor Brown.

“As an engineer, I appreciate there are more than 16,000 tests across every part of the project to prepare for handover and gain the safety approvals needed to open to the public.

“Every part of the station buildings and each piece of technology in them need to work as planned. This is crucial to deliver a good experience for passengers and for safety in the event of emergencies.

“What’s positive is the streets are more open with less cones, Albert St is reopening over the weekend and works around the stations will be completed early next year, bringing people back into the city.”

“The City Rail Link completion is in sight and our city centre is being rejuvenated into a greener, more vibrant and better-connected place. With other projects being finished, and new businesses and residents moving into town, the city is getting its sparkle back” says Deputy Mayor Desley Simpson.

Being ready to open involves a significant, integrated programme of work across City Rail Link Ltd, Auckland Transport and KiwiRail. City Rail Link Ltd, created to oversee building of the CRL tunnels and new and upgraded stations, expects to complete construction and testing by the end of June 2026. This will enable Auckland Transport and KiwiRail to complete preparations to open in the second half of the year.

The organisations involved are working closely together up to handover. After City Rail Link Ltd completes its work, Auckland Transport, KiwiRail and operators will need some time for the final steps to be ready for passengers, including final notifications to crews and staff whose rosters will change.

**Rail Network Rebuild update**

Getting the track infrastructure on the Auckland rail network ready is integral to the opening of CRL. Projects like the Henderson Station upgrade are underway now and the Rail Network Rebuild programme to renew priority areas of track, is in the final stretch ahead of CRL.

“The Rail Network Rebuild programme is making good progress, replacing foundations and upgrading drainage on the Auckland network. Once complete, this will reduce delays and allow more frequent trains in the future. There is more to do before CRL can open, including significant work during a four-week closure after Christmas,” Mr Bishop says.

**Auckland Transport readiness**

Auckland Transport is responsible for operating the CRL as part of the Auckland train network and is getting ready alongside its rail operator, maintenance providers and suppliers. Delivery of 23 new trains, and training of new drivers, crews, customer service staff and maintenance staff are well underway.

With new stations and routes, we need AT to update customer information along our network – timetables, ticketing and digital displays. This is a mammoth undertaking to make sure people can find their way on the new network.
