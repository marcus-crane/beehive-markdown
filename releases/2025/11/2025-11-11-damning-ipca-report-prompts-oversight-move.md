The Government is taking steps to establish the strongest possible oversight of the New Zealand Police following a damning report into the Police handling of complaints against former Deputy Commissioner Jevon McSkimming.

“The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) has conducted a wide-ranging and comprehensive review, and its findings are extremely concerning and disappointing,” Public Service Minister Judith Collins says.

“It has found serious issues within the former Police executive, which is why the Government is acting decisively to install the strongest statutory oversight mechanism available to it – an Inspector-General of Police.”

Police Minister Mark Mitchell says he expects Police to uphold the highest levels of integrity, transparency and accountability.

“The report highlights significant flaws in the decision making, judgement and actions of a group of individuals, including those at the top of the previous Police executive. Their actions have raised serious concerns about integrity and culture within the then executive,” he says.

“At the centre of this is a woman who has been let down by the former Police executive and the system. I cannot express how frustrated and disappointed I have been since becoming aware of the situation.”

The report raises questions around whether there is sufficient independent oversight of the Police to prevent these issues happening again.

It also raises questions about probity checking of McSkimming by the Public Service Commission (PSC) when he was appointed Deputy Police Commissioner in 2023. Ultimately the matter was picked up during the Police Commissioner recruitment process in 2024, and McSkimming was suspended and then resigned.

“New Zealanders will understandably have questions around how McSkimming was able to be considered for roles at the highest level of Police given what has come to light. The PSC is taking these concerns very seriously,” Ms Collins says.

The IPCA makes 13 recommendations for Police and a further two for the Government regarding Police oversight. All have been accepted.

“The report recommends strengthening the IPCA, but it is imperative New Zealanders have confidence in our Police. That is why we are choosing the most robust level of oversight available to the Government, which is to appoint an Inspector-General to give the highest level of independent oversight of Police,” Ms Collins says.

“As well, the Public Service Commission has moved to strengthen its recruiting processes by proactively conducting an independent review on the reference and probity checks undertaken on McSkimming in 2022-2023 prior to his appointment as Deputy Police Commissioner.

“The review found the PSC’s appointment processes overall were sound, well-considered and well-managed but recommended ways they could be improved, and these have now been implemented. This includes guidance on how to probe personal and sensitive matters.”

“Police have accepted all the recommendations in the report which includes strengthening integrity and conduct processes, amending the code of conduct to provide for mandatory reporting, and refreshing integrity training,” Mr Mitchell says.

“All those in the Executive who were involved in the case at the time have now left the Police.

Mr Mitchell says it is important to emphasise the report findings should not be seen as a reflection on our police service as a whole.

“I commend the staff highlighted in the review as having showed exceptional moral courage. They have done themselves, their colleagues and their organisation proud.

“There are more than 15,000 police officers nationwide who serve and protect our communities with distinction and bravery. It is imperative New Zealanders have trust and confidence in the Police. That’s why the Government is taking these findings extremely seriously.”
