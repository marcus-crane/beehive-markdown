Health New Zealand’s announcement that around 1800 graduate registered nurses will begin hospital-based roles represents a significant boost for the health system, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“A sustainable health system relies on a steady pipeline of skilled New Zealand-trained nurses entering the workforce,” Mr Brown says.

“I welcome Health New Zealand’s decision to offer around 1400 hospital-based roles to the 2025 end of year cohort of nursing graduates, which means more than 80 percent of those who pass their exams are expected to secure positions.”

“When combined with the more than 400 mid-year graduate roles it has already offered, Health New Zealand expects to support around 1800 graduate nurses into the workforce in the current financial year.

“This is a significant step in strengthening our workforce and ensuring locally trained nurses are supported into frontline roles. These positions will help hospitals across the country maintain the staff needed to deliver timely, quality care.”

Graduate nurses will start receiving offers from Health New Zealand from 1 December.

The remaining graduates will be supported into roles outside of Health New Zealand, including in primary care.

“Alongside hospital-based positions, the Government is investing in supporting graduate nurses into primary care. Funding is available for primary care employers to take on up to 400 graduate nurses each year, with $20,000 provided for each graduate employed by rural primary and community providers, and $15,000 for those employed by urban providers.”

Mr Brown says expanding graduate opportunities is essential to building a sustainable, long-term workforce.

“Importantly, these roles provide new graduates with structured support, professional development, and a clear pathway into clinical practice. That is how we build a workforce that is resilient, well supported, and prepared for the future.

“Since coming to Government, around 2000 additional nurses have joined the health system. We remain focused on continuing to grow the workforce so New Zealanders can access timely, quality care – and supporting locally trained nurses is key to delivering on that commitment,”

“I want to congratulate all nurses on completing their studies and look forward to welcoming them to the health workforce in the coming months as they begin their careers caring for New Zealanders,” Mr Brown says.
