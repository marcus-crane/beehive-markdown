Mental Health and Associate Health Minister Matt Doocey today hosted a World AIDS Day event at Parliament, announcing new funding to help more New Zealanders have faster access to mental health support.

“Today, as we reflect on New Zealand’s progress in reducing locally acquired HIV infections and tackling the stigma surrounding HIV, I am pleased to announce funding that will get more people the support they need, when they need it,” Mr Doocey says.

“The Burnett Foundation has received funding to launch a new wraparound counselling service, giving more people and their families access to trained mental health professionals.

“This new and improved access to support is possible thanks to matched funding via the Mental Health and Addiction Community Sector Innovation Fund.

“The Innovation Fund is designed to scale up community organisations for initiatives that will make a real difference. This project is a great example, ensuring hundreds more people have access to counselling support, who wouldn’t have otherwise.”

In addition to more face-to-face counselling, services will expand nationwide via online sessions. It will also mean, for example, that the families of those who received a new HIV diagnosis can also access support.

“The Government’s mental health plan focuses on faster access to support, more frontline workers, and a better crisis response. This counselling service gives Kiwis faster access to support at a time they really need it.

“I want to thank the many community organisations who whether it’s through counselling, testing, treatment, advocacy, or education, are making a real difference.

“Today’s announcement coincides with the release of New Zealand’s first HIV Monitoring Report, which tracks the implementation of the HIV Action Plan and ensures progress is being made toward the goal of eliminating local transmission of HIV by 2030.”
