The Government will invest $75 million to boost New Zealand’s resilience to infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness, says Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology, Dr Shane Reti.

“We’re funding new research over seven and a half years in the Infectious Diseases Research Platform, which will be hosted by the newly established New Zealand Institute for Public Health and Forensic Science (PHF Science),” Dr Reti says.

“We’re currently seeing an outbreak of measles in New Zealand – a vaccine preventable disease – which has reinforced the need for robust infectious disease research and response systems.

“The new platform builds on the previous infectious diseases research programme Te Niwha. It marks a step-change in how we prepare for and respond to pandemics, with a nationally coordinated system that delivers world-class science and impact with longer-term investment.”

The platform will:

- Deepen pandemic preparedness and response, including surge science capacity
- Reduce New Zealand’s exposure to the harm and cost of future pandemics, protecting the economy, workforce, healthcare systems, and communities
- Build a strategic, agile, and integrated research and response system that can adapt to new priorities and deliver impactful science.

The platform will also support research breakthroughs that can reduce the burden of existing diseases such as rheumatic fever, tuberculosis, and meningococcal disease.

“PHF Science is well placed to lead a national approach to infectious disease research that will ensure New Zealand is better prepared to prevent and manage such devastating illnesses in the future," says Dr Reti.

“PHF Science plays an important part in the health sector and has well-established relationships with the Ministry of Health, Public Health Agency, and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They also play a key role in government’s pandemic preparedness efforts.

“This investment reflects the Government’s commitment to science system reform by supporting long-term, mission-led research that delivers impact where it matters most.”
