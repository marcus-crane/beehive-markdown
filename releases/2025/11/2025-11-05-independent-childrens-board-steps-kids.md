Rev. Murray Edridge and Hon Jo Goodhew have been appointed to join Chair Dr Ang Jury on the Board of the Independent Children’s Monitor.

The Monitor is one of three statutory bodies having oversight of the Oranga Tamariki system, along with the Children’s Commissioner and the Ombudsman.

“Together, the three Board members have a breadth and depth of expertise to provide strong governance for an agency tasked with independently monitoring the Oranga Tamariki system, helping ensure the safety of children,” Social Development and Employment Minister Louise Upston says.

“Rev. Edridge is Wellington City Missioner. He is an experienced senior leader in both the public and NGO sectors, including eight years as Chief Executive of Barnardos New Zealand, with a wealth of accountability and assurance expertise.

“Ms Goodhew has held a range of health and community sector governance roles, including a current role as Chair of Presbyterian Support South Canterbury. She is an experienced senior leader, including five years as a Minister holding diverse portfolios.

“The legislative changes I took through Parliament earlier this year have enabled these appointments, reflecting commitments in the National-ACT coalition agreement to create a truly independent monitoring and oversight agency for Oranga Tamariki.”

“These appointments mark a significant step in our Government’s commitment to protect and support vulnerable children,” Louise Upston says.

The Monitor Board’s Chair, Dr Ang Jury, ONZM was appointed from 1 August 2025.

Murray Edridge and Jo Goodhew take up their positions from 10 November 2025.
