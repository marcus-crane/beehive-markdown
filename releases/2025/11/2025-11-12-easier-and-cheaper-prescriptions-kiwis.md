From 1 February 2026, New Zealanders will be able to receive 12-month prescriptions for their medicines, delivering savings and greater convenience for people on long-term treatments, Health Minister Simeon Brown and Associate Health Minister David Seymour say.

“We are focused on reducing costs and making it simpler and more convenient for patients to access the medicines they need,” Mr Brown says.

“This common-sense change, announced in Budget 2025, will allow people with long-term, stable conditions to receive prescriptions of up to 12 months from their prescriber. It gives patients greater certainty and frees up GPs’ time by reducing the number of appointments needed to renew routine prescriptions.”

Patients will continue to collect their repeats from the pharmacy as usual but will no longer need to return to their doctor each time for a new script. This could save patients up to $105 per year in reduced GP fees.

“This will make a real difference for people managing long-term conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and high blood pressure. It will also free up valuable time for GPs, pharmacists, and other health professionals to focus on patients with more complex needs.”

Health New Zealand is working with the primary care and community pharmacy sectors to support implementation.

The Government is also progressing practical changes to strengthen the pharmacy workforce by removing ownership restrictions that may limit pharmacists from becoming prescribers.

“Current legislation prevents any prescriber from owning or holding an interest in a pharmacy without an exemption. This is an unnecessary barrier for pharmacists who want to take on prescribing responsibilities.

“The Medicines Amendment Bill, which passed today, will remove this restriction so pharmacists can become prescribers while continuing to invest in or own pharmacies. This will support more flexible models of care, encourage innovation, and make better use of skilled professionals.”

Around 100 pharmacist prescribers currently work in GP clinics, hospices, and hospitals, but none in community pharmacies due to these limits.

“Pharmacists are a highly skilled and accessible workforce, and we want to enable them to do more for their communities. Allowing pharmacist prescribers to work in community pharmacies will mean patients have more access to some prescription medicines.”

Mr Seymour says the changes are about cutting red tape so New Zealanders can get timely access to the medicines they need.

“Extending prescription lengths and removing ownership barriers for pharmacists makes life easier for patients. It’s a common-sense approach that makes getting healthcare easier and more affordable,” Mr Seymour says.

“When people can access their medicines easily, they stay healthier for longer. This means they can live more fulfilling lives. It also reduces pressure on other parts of the health system.

“We’re making the system work better for the people it serves. This is another step in our plan to ensure can New Zealanders get the right care, in the right place, when they need it.”
