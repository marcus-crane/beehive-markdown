New Zealand and Australia have announced an additional package of support for PACER Plus - the Pacific region’s most modern framework for rules-based trade. 

"We have committed $10 million over the next five years to enable Pacific PACER Plus countries to boost their export capability, grow and diversify trade in goods and services, attract investment, and increase the benefits of labour mobility," Minister of State for Trade and Investment Nicola Grigg says.

“New Zealand is proud to be working with Pacific Island countries and Australia through PACER Plus to keep driving trade-based growth in our region.” 

The new investment comes five years after the trade and development agreement entered into force.

"In signing the PACER Plus Implementing Arrangement, we are demonstrating our ongoing commitment to trade growth, prosperity, and regional economic integration through trade.

“By ensuring all parties get the best out of PACER Plus we are better positioned as a region to respond to economic challenges as they arise,” Ms Grigg says.

PACER Plus’s Development and Economic Cooperation Work Programme helps members implement the trade agreement, harmonise regional trade infrastructure and regulations, and maximise opportunities for businesses to access export markets.

Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Scott Simpson yesterday confirmed the new investment at the 2025 PACER Plus Ministerial Meeting in Solomon Islands on behalf of the New Zealand Government.
