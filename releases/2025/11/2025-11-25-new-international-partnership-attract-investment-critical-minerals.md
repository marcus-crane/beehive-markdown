New Zealand has joined the international Minerals Security Partnership to attract investment in our critical mineral sector, Resources Minister Shane Jones and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters say.

“Joining the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) aligns with New Zealand’s ambitious [Minerals Strategy](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/minerals-strategy-for-new-zealand-and-critical-minerals-list-launched) which aims to double the value of minerals exports by 2035 and contribute to resilient and sustainable global minerals supply chains,” Mr Jones says. 

“Critical minerals are essential for technologies that power the modern world, from renewable energy systems to digital devices. 

“New Zealand is blessed with natural resources and talented firms creating cutting-edge technologies that are of great value to the world. Joining the MSP puts New Zealand alongside the world’s largest economies and will help to attract funding to realise the potential of our minerals sector,” Mr Jones says.  

“Joining the MSP is of significant importance for New Zealand’s international relationships,” Mr Peters says. 

“This partnership will leverage our natural resource potential and innovative technologies to create high-paying regional jobs which will have a global impact on secure and sustainable international supply chains.”

“New Zealand’s first [Critical Minerals List](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/building-and-energy/energy-and-natural-resources/minerals-and-petroleum/critical-minerals-list/critical-minerals-list-2025), released in January, identifies 37 minerals vital to the economy and susceptible to supply chain risks. Many of these minerals are in high demand globally for use in clean energy technologies and advanced manufacturing,” Mr Jones says. 

“Several countries have already seen significant benefits from MSP membership, including financing commitments for major projects. We expect similar opportunities for New Zealand as we continue to back our minerals sector.”
