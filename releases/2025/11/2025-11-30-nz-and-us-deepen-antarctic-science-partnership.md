New joint research initiatives focused on climate and ecosystem change expand on the long-standing collaboration between New Zealand and the United States on Antarctic science and logistics, says Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti.

New Zealand and the US will partner on three scientific projects with up to $5 million from the Catalyst Fund over five years.

“This marks the next phase of our joint Antarctic science programme, which I launched in February 2025, building on the important relationship between New Zealand and the US, with over 60 years of logistics cooperation between our two nations,” says Dr Reti.

“Our researchers will work alongside leading US scientists supported by the National Science Foundation’s Office of Polar Programs, tackling some of the most urgent environmental questions facing the planet.

“This is a significant step in our Antarctic science cooperation and will also help to unlock science-driven innovation and growth in New Zealand.”

The programme follows a recently signed the first Memorandum of Cooperation between the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Antarctica New Zealand, and the US National Science Foundation.

It advances three pilot projects that will contribute to Antarctica InSync, a global initiative to coordinate environmental observation across the region.

These projects are:

**Antarctic Groundwater–Ecosystem Connectivity (University of Otago and Earth Sciences NZ)**  
This project will provide the first integrated mapping and analysis of Antarctic groundwater flows to understand how subsurface water moves carbon, nutrients, and microbes between land, ice, and ocean, improving environmental management in the Ross Sea region.

**Spectra of Sentinels: Mapping Ecosystem Change from Ground, Air, and Space (University of Waikato)**  
This project will create New Zealand’s first combined UAV, helicopter, and satellite monitoring system to track changes in Antarctic moss and microbial communities, with tools that also benefit ecological and agricultural monitoring at home.

**Drivers and Implications of Rapid Sea Ice Decline in the Ross Sea (University of Otago)**  
This project will use innovative buoys, remote sensing, and modelling to uncover why Ross Sea sea ice is shrinking and what it means for ecosystems and management of the Marine Protected Area.

New Zealand and US research teams will embark on joint field research during the upcoming 2026/27 season, supported by Antarctica New Zealand.

“These research projects, collaborating closely with our US partners, reinforce New Zealand’s commitment to Antarctic science and strengthens our international standing in climate and ecosystem research,” Dr Reti says.
