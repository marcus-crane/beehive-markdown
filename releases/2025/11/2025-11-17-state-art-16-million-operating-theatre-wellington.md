Health New Zealand has approved $16.25 million in funding for the establishment of a new advanced hybrid operating theatre, which will allow patients at Wellington Regional Hospital to access faster, safer, and more advanced surgical care, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“It is a significant milestone for Wellington and a major step forward in our commitment to providing world-class healthcare closer to home.”

A hybrid operating theatre is a specialised surgical space that brings together advanced imaging technology and traditional surgical capability. This allows multi-disciplinary teams to complete highly complex procedures – including trauma, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology – all in one location, without moving patients between theatres and imaging suites.

“Currently, patients in Wellington are being transferred between operating theatres and interventional suites, which can create delays and extend recovery times for patients.

“The new $16.25 million hybrid theatre directly addresses those challenges, delivering the highest standard of care in a single, seamless environment.

“It will replace the current model where a single patient may need to be seen by two different teams in separate rooms. By consolidating care in one space, Wellington Regional Hospital will be able to increase its surgical output, allowing more patients to receive timely, quality treatment.

“Recovery times will also improve, as patients will no longer require multiple procedures across separate settings.

“Projects like this are essential for reducing pressure on our health system. By eliminating duplication, improving surgical workflows, and giving clinicians the tools they need to work efficiently, we are strengthening healthcare delivery across the region.

“We are committed to investing in modern, fit-for-purpose facilities so New Zealanders can access world-class surgical care right here in Wellington. This hybrid theatre is a clear example of how smart, targeted infrastructure investment delivers better outcomes for patients and builds a more resilient health system for the future.”
