The Government has agreed to a bold and comprehensive action plan to combat methamphetamine harm in New Zealand, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Meth is a scourge on our society. Consumption doubled last year and ultimately, increased meth use fuels organised crime, and destroys lives. This Government’s primary justice target is to reduce the number of victims of crime.

“The Prime Minister tasked the Ministerial team to find effective ways to address this growing issue. Today we’re delivering. I’d like to thank my colleagues Minister Mitchell, Minister Doocey, Minister Costello, Minister McKee and Minister Chhour for all their hard work.

“Significant action is already underway, including investment in Customs, reviewing maritime security powers, police recruitment, establishing the Ministerial Advisory Group on Organised Crime, and Border Security Bill amendments.

“However, there is more we can do to disrupt international supply, sharpen enforcement and reduce demand.

“The Government has agreed to a suite of actions it can promptly take, and has directed officials to begin working on them immediately.”

These include:

- A **hard-hitting nationwide media campaign** over four years, to deliver a consistent message and raise public awareness about meth-related harm, funded out of the proceeds of crime fund.
- Allocating $30 million over four years to **increase the services available to communities hardest hit by meth**, within the Vote Health mental health and addiction budget.
- Directing Customs, the Defence Force and GCSB to undertake a series of **maritime** **operations to disrupt organised crime networks** operating across the Pacific Ocean.
- **Increasing Police enforcement abilities**, including being able to intercept communications and search evidence stored electronically.
- **Enabling police to reclaim ill-gotten gains from organised crime groups** as quickly and effectively as possible.
- Consult the maritime sector on a suite of proposals to **strengthen border security and shut down opportunities for organised** *criminals to operate through our ports,*  such as strengthening background checks.

The Government has also agreed to an additional $23.1 million of funding to:

- **Establish new offshore liaison positions** and increase collaboration with international partners **focused on disrupting and preventing drug exports** to New Zealand and the Pacific at their source.
- **Establish an additional money laundering team** to increase Police’s ability to disrupt organised crime groups.
- Fundingthe **Resilience to Organised Crime in Communities work programme** until December next year, which combats the harms of meth and organised crime through community-led responses to the harms and drivers of organised crime.
