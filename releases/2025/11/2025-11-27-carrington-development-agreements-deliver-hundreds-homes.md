The Government and iwi of Waiohua-Tāmaki have signed development agreements for at least 628 homes in Auckland, Housing Minister Chris Bishop says.

“These homes will contribute to the Carrington Residential Development – also known as Te Kukūnga Waka – a 4,000+ home development in Mt Albert,” Mr Bishop says.

“This land was acquired by the Crown in 2018 as part of the Land for Housing Programme initiated under the previous National Government.

“The Land for Housing Programme’s main purpose was to increase housing supply by repurposing vacant or underutilised land that was no longer needed for public works or other government purposes. The land on which the Carrington Development is being built was previously part of Unitec’s Mt Albert campus.

“These additional homes will help address Auckland’s housing needs and build on the progress already being made. The first homes are completed, and next tranches now entering construction. Once completed, the development will include a number of facilities alongside new homes, including a supermarket, cafes and hospitality, a swim club, a daycare, and a commercial gym.

“Over time, the homes at this development will be a mix of market, affordable and social housing.

“I was delighted to attend the opening of the first apartment buildings in this development, Toi and Whetū, a couple of months ago.

“The Government continues to support this development in several ways – not only through the Land for Housing Programme, but also through the Residential Development Underwrite initiative which supported delivery of some of the first homes, and through a number of infrastructure investments.

“We want homes near jobs, public transport, services, and amenities and this development has it all. The development is also close to the Northwest Busway – a major Government investment in public transport that will enable even more housing growth in the future.”

**Notes to editor:**

The Government agreed overarching terms with Waiohua in December 2024, and development agreements have now been signed with Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, Ngāti Tamaoho, Te Kawerau ā Maki and Te Ākitai Waiohua.
