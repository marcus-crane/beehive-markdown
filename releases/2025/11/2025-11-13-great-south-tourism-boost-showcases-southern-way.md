Great South will receive $393,000 to launch a campaign putting the Southern Way and the region’s authentic hospitality firmly on the map for international visitors, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston announced today.

“I’m delighted to see Great South and its partners working together to highlight the unique experiences of the lower South Island and help build lasting connections with international travellers,” Louise Upston says.

“This investment will help the region reach new audiences and invite more visitors to discover the wild beauty, rich flavours, and warm hospitality that make the south so special.

“It’s fantastic to see a campaign that encourages travellers to look beyond the usual destinations and experience the true heart of southern New Zealand.”

The $393,000 campaign, led by Great South with regional partners, will encourage Australian travellers, especially from the Gold Coast, to explore the Southern Way with a focus on itineraries, regional events, and Southern hospitality.

This journey takes in highlights from the iconic Milford Sound in Fiordland, to the wild Catlins coastline and Dunedin’s vibrant city life, all renowned for their stunning scenery, local events, and genuine southern hospitality.

Funding comes from the Regional Tourism Boost (Round 2), part of the Government’s $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package. It builds on a similar initiative earlier this year to now include hospitality offerings as part of the campaigns.

“By backing the Southern Way, we’re not just promoting a destination, we’re inviting visitors to experience the spirit and stories of the south,” Louise Upston says.
