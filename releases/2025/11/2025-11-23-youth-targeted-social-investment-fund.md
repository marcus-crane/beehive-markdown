Children with parents in prison are among those who will benefit from early intervention through seven new projects funded by the Social Investment Fund.

In this first round of funding, a total of $50 million will go towards programmes reaching more than 1600 children, ranging from newborns through to eighteen-year-olds.

Ministers decided the priority cohorts for the first round of the Social Investment Fund were:

- Children with parents who are, or have recently been, in jail
- Children of parents who experienced the care system, and
- Children who have been stood down or suspended from school before age 13

Social Investment Minister Nicola Willis says the successful organisations demonstrated an ability to make the best overall impact for those groups, and to measure success.

“Each of the initiatives will be monitored to see how successful they are in improving measurable outcomes for the people they support.

“That includes progress on better health, greater safety, more stable and secure housing, improved knowledge and skills, growing income and wealth, and support for their families into work.”

The Government allocated $190 million in Budget 2025 for the Social Investment Fund. 

Another funding round for new initiatives will open early next year.
