Families, workers, visitors and businesses will benefit from a new action plan to ensure Auckland’s city centre is a safe, welcoming, and vibrant place, Auckland Minister Simeon Brown and Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown say.

“Auckland’s CBD is at the heart of our largest city and a key part of New Zealand’s economy, generating around 8 percent of the country’s GDP. It should be a place where businesses can thrive, tourists can enjoy and a place where people who work, live and visit should feel safe,” Minister Brown says.

“Our plan focuses on giving people the support they need, while restoring confidence and order in the city centre. That means support for those who need housing, safe and clean streets, and ensuring bylaws are enforced and fit for purpose.

The action plan brings together the Ministry for Housing and Urban Development, the Ministry for Social Development, Police, Health New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, Auckland Council, businesses, and social service providers to strengthen safety:

- Focus on the rollout of 207 additional social houses for Housing First, alongside making up to 100 more social houses available by more efficient use of existing Housing First contracts.
- Outreach teams connecting rough sleepers with mental health, addiction, and housing support.
- Building on the already increased Police visibility in the central city.
- Police and safety wardens focusing enforcement on locations linked to criminal activity and antisocial behaviours.
- Ensuring public spaces, like Pocket Park at Queen Street and Fort Street, are designed to be safe and welcoming, which reduces opportunities for criminal behaviour.
- Litter and Graffiti removal teams operating at pace, as well as rubbish collection to a regular and high standard.
- Continued targeted safety patrols.
- Review of bylaws to ensure they are fit for purpose.
- Regular taskforce meetings, chaired by the Minister for Auckland, to drive progress across all organisations.

Mayor Brown says the action plan shows what can be achieved when central government and Council work together on the issues that matter to Aucklanders.

“People want to feel safe walking, shopping, and working in the city centre, and this plan delivers more visible patrols and tidier streets, while also addressing disruptive behaviour,” says Mayor Brown.

“We’re working hard as a council to be responsive to issues as they are raised, but I have been very clear about roles and responsibilities; the government do people and providing the social services needed, we do places and spaces.

“As Mayor, my expectation is for government agencies to work with our council to actually deliver on this action plan, so it doesn’t just end up as another announcement and talkfest with little else to show for it.

“There is a lot to be proud of in our city centre, like Browny’s Pool and the Christmas tree I lit up on the weekend at Te Komititanga Britomart and it’s up to all of us including government, council, agencies and the private sector to work collaboratively to ensure these measures make a real difference for people using the city every day.”

Ensuring the city centre is safe and welcoming will be especially important as major projects come online.

“Next year the City Rail Link opens, bringing thousands more people into our city every day. The New Zealand International Convention Centre will also open, generating $90 million in additional tourism spending every year,” Minister Brown says.

"We are also entering the busy summer cruise ship season, which brings visitors who support local shops, cafes and attractions.

“We want everyone to feel safe and welcome in the city centre and using these world-class facilities. When people feel safe and welcome, more families come in, workers enjoy their environment, visitors spend more, and local businesses can thrive.”

The Minister of Justice is also seeking advice on additional measures to enhance safety in our CBDs, including the potential use of move-on orders.

Minister Brown says the action plan balances support with accountability.

“We are making help available for people struggling with homelessness, addiction, and mental health challenges, while taking firm action against behaviour that intimidates or harms others,” Minister Brown says.

“A safe, thriving central city means more foot traffic, stronger business confidence, more jobs, and more opportunities for everyone, including those currently experiencing hardship. Our Government is backing Auckland to succeed, because a strong, welcoming city centre is good for Aucklanders, good for visitors, and good for New Zealand.”
