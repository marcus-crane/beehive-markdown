Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has concluded his official visit to Malaysia and the Republic of Korea.  

On the final leg of the trip, Mr Luxon attended the APEC Leaders’ Meeting in Gyeongju where the regional economic situation was the focus. While in Korea, he attended an Indo-Pacific Leaders' dinner and held bilateral discussions with partners, including the United States and Indonesia, to advance New Zealand’s trade and economic interests.

APEC’s 21 economies receive more than 70 percent of New Zealand’s exports; account for over half of global trade; and have 40 percent of the world’s population.

“It’s critical for New Zealand to play an active part in forums like APEC and the East Asia Summit so we can be heard,” Mr Luxon says.

“The Indo-Pacific region is full of potential and critical to New Zealand’s future prosperity. Our Government is deepening ties to realise that potential. That’s why it’s important to be in the room with other leaders, engaging on what more we can do together, and advocating to advance our interests. 

"That is how we create jobs and opportunities, and lift incomes for Kiwis back at home. That’s what these visits are all about."

In Korea, the Prime Minister and President Lee Jae Myung launched the New Zealand-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), marking a new era for the bilateral relationship.

Days earlier in Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister concluded a CSP with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - a group of 11 nations with a collective population of 700 million people. 

“These agreements elevate New Zealand’s status, making it easier for Kiwis to do business in these parts of the world, and raise New Zealand’s profile as a partner for trade and investment,” Mr Luxon says. 

The Prime Minister arrives home on Sunday 2 November.
