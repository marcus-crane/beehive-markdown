Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced appointments to the new Primary Care Advisory Group, which will provide specialist advice to help shape the future of primary care.

Dr Bryan Betty has been appointed as Chair of the new advisory group. Dr Betty brings extensive experience as a general practitioner and is the chair of General Practice New Zealand. Dr Samantha Murton, who has significant clinical leadership and governance experience, has been appointed Deputy Chair.

The other appointed members of the advisory group are:

- Penny Clark
- Dr Jo Scott-Jones
- Dr Steven Young
- Dr Kate Baddock
- Dr Stephanie Taylor
- Darryl Jhinku

“These members bring a wide range of expertise, which will help strengthen the role of primary care and ensure it makes the greatest possible impact on New Zealanders’ health,” Mr Brown says.

“The Government is committed to making high-quality, timely healthcare accessible in every community. We have delivered record investment in primary care and launched initiatives to grow the GP and primary care workforce.

“The advisory group will provide expert guidance from primary care leaders, ensuring these investments translate into real improvements in health outcomes for New Zealanders.

“While the group will initially focus on general practice, its work may expand over time to include other healthcare delivered in community settings.”

All terms of office will commence on 3 November 2025.
