The Government will invest more than $80 million in research projects starting this year, for projects that have transformative potential for New Zealand’s economy, health, and environment, says Science, Innovation, and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti.

“107 Marsden Fund projects will be funded over the next three years, supporting both established research leaders and the next generation of emerging scientists,” Dr Reti says.

“The Marsden Fund invests in investigator-led, innovative research to foster breakthrough discoveries with the potential to deliver lasting benefits for our economy, environment, and wellbeing.

“The Government is committed to investing in blue skies research that sparks innovative thinking, drives the development of new skills, and generates transformative knowledge for New Zealand’s future.

“As we introduce a new science funding system to better support our scientists, industry, and economy, we will continue to champion a diverse portfolio of research activities – including blue skies, strategic, mission-led, applied, commercialisation, and industry-focused projects.”

The latest funding round includes 37 Fast-Start grants for emerging scientists, 68 Standard grants, and two Marsden Fund Council Awards supporting large interdisciplinary projects. 

Funded projects span from biomedical breakthroughs and climate resilience to mathematical innovation and advanced technology. Examples include:

- **Improving cancer treatment through advanced cell therapies** (Malaghan Institute of Medical Research)
- **Turning geothermal waste heat into electricity for cleaner, more efficient industry** (Earth Sciences New Zealand)
- **Tackling drug-resistant tuberculosis, especially in high risk Māori and Pasifika communities** (University of Otago)
- **Harnessing native plant microbiomes to boost crop resilience** (Bioeconomy Science Institute)

“These projects show the breadth and ambition of New Zealand’s research community, and the Government’s commitment to supporting ideas that will shape our future,” Dr Reti says.
