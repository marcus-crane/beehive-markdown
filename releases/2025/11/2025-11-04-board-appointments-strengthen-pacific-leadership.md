Pacific Peoples Minister Dr Shane Reti has announced new appointments to the Pacific Business Trust Board and the Centre for Pacific Languages Board.

Uluomato’otua Saulaulu Aiono has been appointed Chair of the Pacific Business Trust Board for a three-year term. Nora Swann and Lanuola Moe-Penn have also been appointed to the Board.

Eli Tagi and Dr Rae Si’ilata have been reappointed as Board members of the Centre for Pacific Language, while Dr Polu Apollo Taito has been appointed as a new member.

“The Pacific Business Trust and the Centre for Pacific Languages represent two pillars of Pacific progress, one driving economic growth and entrepreneurship, the other safeguarding language and cultural identity which in turn builds confidence and enhances employment,” says Dr Reti.

“Ulu is a Samoan-Kiwi and Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, bringing a unique blend of business acumen, community leadership, and Pacific regional insight. Nora Swann, a creative entrepreneur who established the Pacific Fusion Fashion Show, and Lanuola Moe-Penn, a governance leader in early childhood education also bring strong community connections and strategic capability to the Board. I also want to thank outgoing Chair Paul Retimanu, who’s helped strengthen the Trust’s strategic direction over the last few years.

“Eli is a Chartered Accountant and Co-founder of WE Mana, while Dr Rae is a leading expert in bilingual education and cultural responsiveness. Dr Polu Apollo Taito is a seasoned governance and community leader with over 20 years’ experience across health, education, and the New Zealand Army. I want to acknowledge outgoing board member Dr Jean Mitaera for her service and valuable contribution to the board.”
