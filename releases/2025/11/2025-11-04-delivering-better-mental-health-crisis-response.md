Minister for Mental Health Matt Doocey has today announced the government is delivering more frontline workers and establishing new services for people in need of a better crisis response.  

"When someone takes the brave step of reaching out, I want that support to be there,” Mr Doocey says.

“Today I’m announcing a $61.6 million funding boost to deliver a better crisis response:

- Crisis assessment teams – 40 additional frontline clinical staff for crisis assessment and treatment teams nationwide.
- Peer-led acute alternatives – two new 10-bed peer-led acute alternative services to reduce inpatient ward admissions.
- Peer support in emergency departments – three more EDs will receive peer support workers, on top of the eight already launched.
- Crisis Recovery Cafés – two new cafés, bringing the total to eight across the country.

“We don’t want people in distress waiting long periods of time for a crisis assessment. With 40 extra clinical staff, more New Zealanders will get faster access to crisis support.

“People in crisis shouldn’t be waiting too long for an inpatient bed. Peer-led acute alternative services provide more choice for people experiencing mental health issues, and get people seen quicker.

“We’re already hearing great feedback about peer support workers in emergency departments. Rolling out peer support workers in more EDs will result in a better crisis response and more people being better supported.

“I’m determined to grow the peer support workforce. Crisis Recovery Cafes offer a peer-led, non-clinical space where people in distress can go to get support.

“Today’s announcement builds on Budget 2025, which invests $28 million to roll out 10 mental health co-response teams across the country to respond to 111 mental distress calls and adds additional crisis helpline capacity.

“We’ve already implemented a 60-minute handover from the Police to emergency department workers for people arriving in distress to an ED.

“When someone takes the brave step to reach out, whether it’s you, your child, a friend, or a family member we’re committed to ensuring the right support is always there to answer that call. This package goes a long way in making sure that’s possible.”
