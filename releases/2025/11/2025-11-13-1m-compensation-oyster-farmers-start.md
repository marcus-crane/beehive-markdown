A $1 million payment from Watercare to oyster farmers impacted by sewage contamination of Mahurangi Harbour is a welcome first step but more is needed, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Oceans and Fisheries Jenny Marcroft says.

“[Yesterday Watercare chief executive Jamie Sinclair announced an immediate compensation payment](https://www.watercare.co.nz/home/about-us/latest-news-and-media/watercare-makes-payment-of-1-million-to-mahurangi-oyster-farmers-affected-by-wastewater-overflow) of $1m to Aquaculture New Zealand for distribution to 10 oyster farmers whose livelihoods were impacted by the latest overflow near Warkworth,” Ms Marcroft says.

“I applaud Mr Sinclair and Watercare for this speedy response to the problem of sewage overflow into the harbour, which followed a power surge tripping pumps. However, this latest incident came at a time when the farmers are at the peak of harvest time, and already right on the edge due to multiple previous sewage overflow incidents over a number of years.

“More compensation is clearly needed. I urge Watercare to continue to work constructively with Aquaculture NZ to fully compensate these farmers for the financial hits they are repeatedly taking, and the personal toll it is taking on them and their families.

“This is devastating enough for the farmers and the local oyster industry, but the public should also be extremely concerned that their waterways are being polluted with wastewater. The sea is our food basket and our playground. No sewage should ever be flowing into it,” Ms Marcroft says.
