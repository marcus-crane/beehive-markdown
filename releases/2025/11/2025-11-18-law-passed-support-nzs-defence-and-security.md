Legislation ensuring national security is maintained during industrial action has passed its final reading in Parliament today, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“The security of New Zealand is a 24/7 issue, and our Defence Force works 365 days a year to preserve it. The Defence (Workforce) Amendment Bill allows the Chief of Defence Force to better manage their workforce to ensure New Zealand’s security,” says Ms Collins.

“The civilian staff in our Defence Force play an important role in keeping New Zealand safe – whether through providing security at military bases, testing capabilities and technology, or aircraft maintenance. 

“Under the previous legislation there were times when industrial action could put New Zealand’s national security at risk or impact the New Zealand Defence Force’s (NZDF) ability to deliver the tasks expected of it. For example, when NZDF civilian staff take industrial action, this could mean munitions and weapons stores are left unguarded.

“This issue was highlighted when civilian staff took industrial action last December. The Government moved quickly to ensure that settings are pragmatic and fit for purpose.”

This Bill broadens the Minister’s ability to authorise uniformed personnel to conduct the work of NZDF civilian staff when national security or the delivery of core defence outputs are at risk.

It also streamlines this process by removing the requirement for Parliament to debate how the NZDF manages redeployment within its own organisation. Instead, the Minister can set a time limit for an authorisation, which cannot extend beyond the period of strike action.

“These changes preserve the right for civilian staff to take industrial action, while ensuring the security and safety of New Zealanders,” says Ms Collins.  

“We’ve also made common-sense changes to the rare circumstance in which military personnel are used to backfill public servant roles outside the NZDF. These include increasing the duration of a Ministerial authorisation from 14 to 30 days and removing the requirement for Parliament to reconvene if an authorisation expires while the House is not sitting.

“In a deteriorating strategic environment, this Bill ensures that our Defence Force is ready and able to protect New Zealand and its interests.”
