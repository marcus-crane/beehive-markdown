Cabinet has agreed to introduce new safeguards on the prescribing of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, while ensuring patients with medical needs can continue to access appropriate care, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

"We are putting in place stronger safeguards so families can have confidence that any treatment is clinically sound and in the best interests of the young person or child.

"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues play an important role in treating a range of medical conditions. We are ensuring they remain available for patients who need them for conditions such as early-onset puberty, endometriosis, or prostate cancer, where there is strong clinical evidence of benefit."

The Ministry of Health’s evidence brief found that there is a lack of high-quality evidence that demonstrates the benefits or risks of the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for the treatment of gender dysphoria or incongruence. While this uncertainty persists, the Government is taking a precautionary approach.

Following public consultation, Cabinet has agreed to introduce new regulations under the Medicines Act to align New Zealand's approach with the United Kingdom:

- New patients seeking treatment for gender dysphoria or incongruence can no longer be prescribed gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, pending the completion of the United Kingdom's clinical trial on their use in this context.
- Ensure existing youth gender services are maintained for young people experiencing gender dysphoria or incongruence and bringing these services together through a central, accessible online resource.

"These changes will ensure a more consistent and carefully monitored approach. This mirrors steps taken in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, where additional safeguards have recently been implemented to ensure decisions are made in line with the best available evidence," Mr Brown says.

The new approach will not impact patients currently receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for the treatment of gender dysphoria or incongruence, with changes applying only to new cases going forward.

“The Government expects existing youth gender services to continue supporting young people and their families, connecting them with healthcare professionals who have specialised expertise and can provide evidence-based guidance.

"These changes are about ensuring treatments are safe and carefully managed, while maintaining access to care for those who need it."
