A global-first advanced aviation rule will slash red-tape and enable innovators to quickly bring new ideas to market, Space Minister Judith Collins and Associate Transport Minister James Meager say.

“As part of our world-class regulatory system, we’ve introduced a new rule allowing regulatory sandboxes – controlled environments where technology can be tested freely and safely,” Ms Collins says.

“Researchers and businesses can now rapidly develop products without needing approval for small changes from the Civil Aviation Authority. This will provide clearer pathways for the sector to test, trial, and grow, while ensuring strong safeguards remain in place.

“The change will directly benefit Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre, which was granted permanent Special Use Airspace earlier this year, alongside $5.85 million in operational funding.

“The advanced aviation sector is no longer emerging. It is here, and it is central to New Zealand’s economic and high-tech future. Our approach will attract global interest from those keen to take advantage of a safe and responsive regulatory environment.”

Associate Transport Minister James Meager has also confirmed updates to current drone rules, which also reflect New Zealand’s commitment to growth and innovation, while balancing safety with efficiency.

“These changes cut through red tape, reduce paperwork and make it much clearer when drones and other aviation technologies can be used and when they can’t.

“More specifically, they clarify that drones can be used for low-risk work like surveying and mapping without certification, and they provide clarity and certainty for technical and higher-risk activities like agricultural spraying and top dressing.

“This is about backing our farmers and rural communities by reducing unnecessary regulatory burden, being clear about what’s allowed, and making sure new technology can be put to work safely and quickly.”

The rules come into effect on 22 December 2025.

**Notes to Editor:**

**Summary of Rule Changes:**

**Parts 101 and 102 (Existing Rules):**

- Uncrewed aircraft are regulated through two rule parts: Part 101, which provides prescriptive rules that capture lower-risk operations in aircraft under 25kg, and Part 102, which is a risk-based certification framework that regulates complex and higher-risk operations.
- Most drone users in New Zealand operate under Part 101. A certificate is not required to operate under Part 101, and no approval from the CAA is needed.
- Some technical details have been transferred out of Part 101 and into a new Transport Instrument. This will make updates to regulation faster and more responsive to technology and sector growth.
- Some activities that previously required approval under Part 102 have now been transferred to Part 101, including some night operations and beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights in enclosed spaces.
- Part 101 now explicitly prohibits agricultural spraying, topdressing, and vertebrate toxic agent application. These have never been allowed under Part 101, but the rule change makes this clear. Surveying and mapping can still be conducted under Part 101.

**Part 107 (New Rule):**

- Allows approved research organisations to rapidly develop and test emerging aviation technologies within pre-defined areas.
- Removes regulatory burden on participants by no longer requiring regulatory approval every time an iteration is made, unless the operation changes substantially.
- Is technology agnostic, allowing for research and development on all aviation systems and ancillary systems.
