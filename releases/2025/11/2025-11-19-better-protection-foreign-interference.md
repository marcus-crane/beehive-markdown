New Zealand will be better protected from foreign interference with legislation passing in Parliament today, Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“Some foreign states engage in activities that are deceptive, corruptive, or coercive. These activities are intended to inappropriately manipulate our society or place undue pressure on individuals and our communities. We need to ensure our laws effectively combat those activities.

“Foreign interference from any country is unacceptable. This legislation will help to ensure that our criminal law is fit for purpose, and will better equip agencies to hold people to account.”

The Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill will:

- Create new offences to specifically criminalise foreign interference,
- Update existing offences related to espionage and the wrongful communication of government information for conduct that is likely to prejudice New Zealand’s security or defence.

“These changes are part of ongoing work across government to protect New Zealand and our communities from foreign interference. They also provide a clear message on how seriously we take this issue,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Normal diplomatic activity, transparent lobbying, and other forms of open and cooperative engagement with the New Zealand Government and members of the public are always welcome and will not be affected by this legislation. Foreign interference, however, will not be tolerated.”
