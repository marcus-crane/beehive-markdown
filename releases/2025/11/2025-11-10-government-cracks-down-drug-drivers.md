Drivers under the influence of drugs will soon face tougher enforcement on New Zealand roads, with the Government confirming which drugs will be screened under the new oral-fluid roadside testing regime, Transport Minister Chris Bishop and Police Minister Mark Mitchell say.

“Drug-impaired drivers are a menace on New Zealand roads,” Mr Bishop says.

“Around 30 per cent of all road deaths now involve an impairing drug. If you take drugs and drive, you’re putting innocent lives at risk - and we will not tolerate it.

“Our Government is committed to improving road safety, and that includes holding dangerous, drugged-up drivers to account. Rolling out roadside drug testing is a practical step towards safer roads and fewer tragedies.”

Police Minister Mark Mitchell says the new regime will strengthen Police’s ability to keep roads safe.

“This is another positive step in delivering our road-safety strategy and targeting the key factors behind fatal crashes. The ability for Police to screen for impairing drugs is a welcome addition to their enforcement toolbox,” Mr Mitchell says.

“Police will begin roadside screening for four key drugs - THC (cannabis), methamphetamine (meth), MDMA (ecstasy) and cocaine - using new oral-fluid testing devices.

“The rollout will begin in December in the Wellington District and scale up from April 2026, with nationwide coverage expected by mid-2026.”

**How roadside drug testing will work:**

Police will be able to stop any motor vehicle at any time to screen the driver for the presence of drugs. The first roadside screening test will be a quick tongue swipe taking just a few minutes. If the test is positive, officers will take a saliva sample for laboratory analysis. While the roadside device detects the four key drugs, the laboratory can test for up to 25 substances listed in the Act.

A second roadside screening test will then be conducted. If that test is positive, the driver will be prohibited from driving for 12 hours to address any immediate road-safety risk. An infringement notice will follow a positive laboratory result. Drivers who refuse or fail to comply with a roadside drug test will also be issued with an infringement notice. Most drivers will be free to go within about five minutes once they have a negative test result.
