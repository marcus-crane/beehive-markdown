More than $2.31 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund will go into an upgrade of the West Coast’s Jackson Bay Wharf, strengthening the region’s disaster resilience and supporting the local fishing industry, Associate Regional Development Minister Mark Patterson says.

“Jackson Bay Wharf is the only natural deep-water wharf on the West Coast. Unlike larger ports in the region, it is accessible in all weather conditions, making it a vital lifeline during natural disasters,” Mr Patterson says.

“This upgrade secures the wharf as a vital access point during disasters and supports the fishing industry by ensuring efficient seafood transport and supply chains.”

The project, led by Westland District Council, includes structural upgrades to extend the life of the wharf, and installation of digital surveillance and signage enabling the Council to enforce the launch fees that pay for ongoing wharf maintenance. The total project value is $3.3 million, including a $990,000 contribution from the Council.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries Jenny Marcroft, who spoke at today’s announcement, says the project reflects strong collaboration between local and central government.

“The wharf is in a severely deteriorated state, so this upgrade is critical to keep it safe and reliable for all users,” Ms Marcroft says.

“This grant is a practical example of how we’re investing in infrastructure that not only supports long-term economic growth by sustaining the current industry but also builds resilience in the event of future challenges,” she adds.

“I commend the fishers and industry leaders who worked tirelessly to secure this upgrade. This is a great example of partnership delivering for our regions.”

The upgrade of Jackson Bay Wharf is the final component of RIF West Coast Ports Infrastructure Upgrade Programme, which also delivered improvements at Westport and Greymouth ports to boost regional resilience and support the fishing industry.

This RIF $7.81 million investment across the West Coast will not only strengthen critical infrastructure but also create up to 17 full-time equivalent jobs during construction, delivering immediate economic benefits alongside long-term security for the region.
