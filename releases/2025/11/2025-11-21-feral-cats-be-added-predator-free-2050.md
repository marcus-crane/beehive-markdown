The Government is delivering on its campaign promise to add feral cats to the Predator Free 2050 target species list to protect our precious native wildlife, Conservation Minister Tama Potaka says.

“We know people want their local reserves, beaches and bush tracks to be full of birds, not predators. Including feral cats in the Predator Free 2050 goal means stronger protection for local wildlife, better tools for communities, and less impact on farmers, whānau and our economy.

“Feral cats are now found across Aotearoa New Zealand, from farms to forests, and they put huge pressure on native birds, bats, lizards and insects. They also spread toxoplasmosis, which harms dolphins, affects people, and costs farmers through lost stock,” Mr Potaka says.

The Department of Conservation’s consultation on the Predator Free Strategy received close to 3,400 submissions. Over 90 percent backed improved feral cat management.

“New Zealanders were clear. They want action,” Mr Potaka says.

Adding feral cats to the Predator Free 2050 target list will:

- Support national coordination of feral cat control
- Allow Predator Free groups access to funding for projects targeting feral cats
- Boost research into effective and humane tools and technology
- Strengthen efforts to protect threatened species across the country

Examples of the damage caused by feral cats include the loss of more than 100 short-tailed bats in a single week near Ohakune, and the near-extinction of pukunui/southern dotterel on Rakiura/Stewart Island.

“New Zealand is full of proud cat owners, and domestic pets are not part of this Predator Free target. Responsible ownership, desexing, microchipping, and keeping cats away from wildlife, remains an important part of the solution,” Mr Potaka says.

Further detail on priority work will be set out in the revised Predator Free 2050 Strategy, due to be released in March 2026.
