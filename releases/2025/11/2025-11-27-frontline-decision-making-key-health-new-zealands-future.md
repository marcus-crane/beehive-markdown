Health Minister Simeon Brown has today presented Health New Zealand’s Annual Report to Parliament and issued a new Letter of Expectations to the Chair of the Health New Zealand Board, setting out the Government’s priorities for the rest of this financial year and into 2025/26.

The Letter of Expectations makes it clear: Health New Zealand must shift decision-making closer to the frontline, while continuing to deliver against the Government’s key priorities and ensuring the health system delivers better outcomes for patients.

“The previous Government’s mega-merger of our health system removed local decision-making and centralised too many decisions into Health New Zealand,” Mr Brown says.

“We want a nationally and regionally planned system, but one that has strong clinical input and buy-in at the hospital level. That means devolving decisions to the people who are closest to patients and communities.”

The publicly released Letter of Expectations outlines the Minister’s priorities and direction for the coming year, including:

- Continued progress on achieving the Government’s health targets.
- Strengthening primary and community care.
- Devolving decision-making to local districts and regions to ensure a nationally planned and locally delivered health system.
- Continuing to grow the health workforce and prioritise recruitment to frontline clinical roles.
- Building modern health infrastructure to support future needs.

“I expect Health New Zealand to rapidly devolve decision-making to its four regions and 20 districts, so they can get on with what they do best – delivering healthcare to patients,” Mr Brown says.

“That includes removing unnecessary bureaucracy and improving recruitment timeframes for frontline clinical roles. People need a health system that is responsive, and this shift in decision-making will support faster, better outcomes for patients.”

The Letter also reinforces the need for strong governance and accountability, with clear delegations in place to support delivery across the health system. Decisions must be made as close to communities and the frontline as possible, while ensuring national consistency.

“Health New Zealand must deliver on the priorities outlined in my Letter of Expectations while ensuring its operations are efficient, transparent, and focused on patients. The Government is investing record funding in health, and New Zealanders expect results.

“Health New Zealand has made good progress in stabilising its financial position. But challenges remain, and I expect the Board to continue driving efficiencies while investing in frontline delivery.”

The Government’s health targets remain central to Health New Zealand’s work, alongside a renewed focus on strengthening frontline services, improving access to GPs, and reducing wait times and wait lists.

“New Zealanders deserve a health system that works for them. That means meeting targets, reducing wait times, and ensuring care is accessible close to home.

“Health New Zealand plays a critical role in delivering timely, high-quality healthcare. I have made my expectations clear – I will continue to hold them to account for delivering results,” Mr Brown says.
