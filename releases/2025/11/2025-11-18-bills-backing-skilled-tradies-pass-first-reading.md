Legislation that will allow skilled plumbers and drainlayers to sign off on their own work has passed its first reading in Parliament, alongside a second Bill aimed at raising standards and improving accountability for building professionals.

“The Government is cutting red tape in the building consent system to make it easier and more affordable to deliver the new homes and infrastructure we need to raise living standards and grow the economy,” Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk says.

“The system has long been slow and inefficient, with even straightforward plumbing and drainlaying jobs delayed by lengthy inspection wait times, leading to frustrated tradies and homeowners who end up bearing the cost of lost time.

“The Self Certification by Plumbers and Drainlayers Bill has today cleared its first hurdle in the House, and will speed up straightforward residential plumbing and drainage work by allowing approved plumbers and drainlayers with a proven track record to certify their own work.

“It will also ease pressure on the consent system by allowing Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to focus on processing paperwork and conducting inspections for more complex and higher-risk projects.

“Around 16,000 new standalone houses were consented in 2024, and most of these would likely have included plumbing and drainlaying work eligible for self-certification under the new regime.

“This approach has been long called for by Master Plumbers and aligns plumbers and drainlayers with electricians and gasfitters, who have been able to certify their own work for years.

“The scheme will be voluntary, and only practitioners who meet clear competency and compliance standards will be eligible. It will apply exclusively to straightforward plumbing and drainage work, while BCAs will continue to oversee complex or higher-risk projects to ensure public safety is protected.”

A second Bill has also passed its first reading in Parliament today, aimed at further strengthening accountability and standards across the building sector.

“The Building and Construction Strengthening Occupational Licensing Regimes Amendment Bill will support self-certification by increasing accountability and ensuring consumers have a clear path forward if building work goes wrong,” Mr Penk says. 

“New Zealand has a skilled building industry, but high-profile cases of poor workmanship can unfairly tarnish the sector’s reputation. It’s important to address this as more responsibility shifts from BCAs to building professionals.

“The Bill strengthens the disciplinary process by giving the Licensed Building Practitioners Registrar, who oversees the registration of LBPs, additional tools, and by publishing details of practitioners who have been suspended.

“Complaints processes for licensed electrical workers, plumbers, gasfitters, and drainlayers are being improved by allowing Registrars to initiate investigations more easily and by introducing Codes of Ethics to promote high standards of behaviour.”

“With these two Bills, we are backing tradies who take pride in their work, reducing unnecessary delays, easing pressure on the consent system, and giving Kiwis confidence that the people working on their homes are supported by clear checks and balances.”
