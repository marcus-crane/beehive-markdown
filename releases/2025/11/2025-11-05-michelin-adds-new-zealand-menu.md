New Zealand is welcoming the Michelin Guide for the first time, showcasing our country’s incredible food and wine to an international audience, as well as boosting visitor numbers and economic growth, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“The Michelin Guide’s arrival in New Zealand marks its first expansion into Oceania after 125 years and we are thrilled to welcome these culinary experts to our shores.

“With the first selections and potential ‘star ratings’ due out next year, Michelin Guide inspectors are already on the ground, dining anonymously in some of our very best restaurants.

“Receiving selection into the Michelin Guide is a prestigious accolade, with its strong international following.

“Tourism New Zealand data estimates Michelin’s arrival to bring in up to 36,000 more international visitors.

“That’s reinforced by TNZ research which rates ‘trying local cuisine’ as the #1 audience interest among people actively considering New Zealand for their next holiday (cited by 87 per cent of respondents).

“Michelin represents an incredible opportunity for the food and beverage industry in four of our key culinary centres, demonstrating excellence and showcasing New Zealand on a world stage.

“This announcement aligns with the hospitality industry’s recommendation that the Government explore the potential for the Michelin Guide to come to New Zealand in their 2024 Hospitality Summit report.

“Today’s announcement reinforces that we will champion the hospitality sector and support it to grow.

The inaugural New Zealand edition of the Michelin Guide will be revealed in mid-2026, covering four key destinations: Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Queenstown.

“We know our country has a rich and diverse culinary scene. It’s exciting to be able to share New Zealand’s unique flavours and talent with the rest of world,” Louise Upston says.

“Today’s announcement not only celebrates our talented hospitality teams, but marks New Zealand as a go-to destination for international visitors.

“Michelin describes New Zealand as an exciting gastronomic destination, with exceptional restaurants.

“Its presence here will mean more visitors dining in those restaurants and enjoying all New Zealand’s hospitality has to offer – supporting small businesses, supporting jobs and supporting local economies in the process.”
