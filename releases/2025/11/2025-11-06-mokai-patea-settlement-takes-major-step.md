The Crown has today signed an agreement in principle to settle the historical Treaty claims of Mōkai Pātea, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“This is a significant milestone in the settlement process for Mōkai Pātea, since they submitted their first claims over 30 years ago. Negotiations towards a comprehensive deed of settlement will follow shortly.

“The redress package aims to help Mōkai Pātea build a foundation for long-term economic and social development and to fulfil the aspirations of their people. 

“The agreement includes financial and commercial redress of $55 million, the return of 20 sites of cultural significance, and a range of other redress items. It outlines, in broad terms, the shape of a future settlement the detail of which is to be negotiated in the coming months. 

“The Crown acknowledges that as a result of its acts and omissions, the hapū and iwi of Mōkai Pātea are virtually landless with a very high proportion of the remaining land of Mōkai Pātea being landlocked and inaccessible. The sacrifices Mōkai Pātea have made have been for the nation’s benefit.”

Mōkai Pātea represents the confederated hapū and iwi of Ngāi Te Ohuake, Ngāti Hauiti, Ngāti Tamakōpiri and Ngāti Whitikaupeka. Mōkai Pātea’s area of interest extends from the south-eastern flanks of Mount Ruapehu towards the Ruahine Ranges and Marton.
