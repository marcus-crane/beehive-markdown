Five members have been appointed to the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women (NACEW) for a three-year term, Minister for Women Nicola Grigg says.

NACEW advises the Minister on employment issues for women, including identifying emerging labour market trends and commissioning research. More recently NACEW has provided advice to the Minister on economic empowerment for women, and the development of the Gender Pay Gap Toolkit.

Chair Traci Houpapa, and current members Lyn McMorran (BusinessNZ), and Melissa Ansell-Bridges (the National Council of Trade Unions) have been reappointed.

“I congratulate Traci, Lyn and Melissa on their reappointment and thank them for their continued service to support the economic empowerment of women in New Zealand.

“I also warmly welcome new members Zoe Lyon-Gifford and Michelle Huang, both of whom bring a mix of leadership and governance experience across the private, public and not-for-profit sectors. Zoe has proven strengths in strategic oversight, cross sector collaboration, driving gender equity and leading transformational change. Michelle has a track record of creative problem-solving, championing ethnic and intersectional diversity in leadership, and of driving inclusive systems change.”

The new members will begin their service next month.

“I look forward to continuing the strong relationship with NACEW to enhance employment opportunities for women in New Zealand,” Ms Grigg says.

Ms Grigg also thanked and acknowledged outgoing members Dame Theresa Gattung, who has served NACEW for nine years, Minnie Baragwanath, Bernadette Pereira, Theresa Rongonui, Naomi Hughes, and Nurain Janah for their dedication to improving women’s employment in New Zealand.
