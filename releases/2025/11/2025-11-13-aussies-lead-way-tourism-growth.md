Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has welcomed official stats out today showing continued growth in New Zealand’s overseas visitor numbers, with Australian tourists continuing to lead the way.

“Visitor arrivals from Australia reached 1.48 million in the September 2025 year, up from 1.33 million the year before,” Louise Upston says.

“That’s great news - an increase of 153,500, or 12 per cent, compared with the September 2024 year.

“For September years, 2025 was the second highest for the number of visitor arrivals from Australia after 2019, reflecting an increase in trans-Tasman flights, and the success of Tourism New Zealand’s Everyone Must Go campaign.

“Australians have well and truly grabbed that opportunity, and everyone has come.

“Overall, today’s data from Stats NZ shows New Zealand welcomed 248,600 international visitors in September 2025, an increase of 21,700 from September 2024. 

“This exciting increase reflects our Government’s efforts to attract more international visitors and get New Zealand’s tourism industry humming again.

The biggest changes were in arrivals for the year were:

- Australia (up 153,000 to 1.48 million)
- United States (up 21,000 to 381,000)
- United Kingdom (up 20,000 to 190,000)
- Japan (up 10,000 to 74,000)

Chinese numbers remained relatively steady at 246,100 for the period, compared to 245,800 previously.

“As well as today’s improved statistics, we’re seeing also international arrivals to Queenstown and Christchurch being the highest on record for this time of year,” Louise Upston says. 

“Accommodation in Auckland will be at full occupancy next week and Tātaki Auckland Unlimited has estimated that Auckland will be at 80-85 per cent occupancy over the summer period.

“These are all promising signs and reflect the hard work the Government and the sector have been putting in together.

“We started off the year with a Tourism Boost package, developed in partnership with industry to support an immediate growth in visitor numbers. 

“We’ve continued that teamwork through September’s $70 million events and tourism investment package, alongside last week’s announcement that we are welcoming the Michelin Guide to these shores. 

“This is all part of the Government’s plan to double the value of international tourism by 2034. A thriving tourism sector is key to our economic success, and one I’m fully committed to.”
