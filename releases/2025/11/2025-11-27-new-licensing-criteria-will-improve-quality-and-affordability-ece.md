Associate Education Minister David Seymour has today announced the completion of the ECE licensing criteria reform. 

“Families need access to affordable and quality early learning services. When families have access to good options, children build foundations for future learning and social interactions,” Mr Seymour says. 

“As an electorate MP I’ve had countless parents raise the issue of affordability of Early Childhood Education (ECE). Local ECE services told me that red tape puts unnecessary costs on parents and services, and takes the focus away from children. 

“That’s why I asked for this delegation. That’s why the Government conducted a Sector Review; to reduce compliance costs but keep children's safety at the forefront.

“Earlier this year, the ECE Sector Review instigated 15 changes to make it easier to open and run high-quality centres. This leads to more choice and better access for parents. 

“The Review included a recommendation to reform the 98 ECE licensing criteria. Most of which were outdated or unnecessary. We consulted the public on changing, merging, or removing approximately three-quarters of them. We are listening to the sector. For example, people said they wanted the frequency of checks for sleeping children to stay the same, so they are.  

“We have reduced the number of licensing criteria by almost 20 per cent, and simplified 58 of them. The changes reduce unnecessary compliance for services and give them greater flexibility. These changes also remove duplication and make the rules clearer. 

“For example, we have removed the requirement for services to document laundry, because it’s a waste of time. Centres will be able to provide parents with information digitally, because it’s 2025. We have also removed requirements for tempering valves, because it’s already dealt with in other health and safety requirements.

“The Ministry for Regulation went straight to the source and asked the sector what’s increasing costs and limiting competition. These changes are based on feedback from providers around the country who say they’ve been frustrated by unclear rules, conflicting advice from different agencies, and unnecessary red tape.

“This is just one part of our wider reform of the ECE sector. The new ECE licensing criteria will be administered by the newly established Director of Regulation. 

“The Director will be responsible for licensing, monitoring, and enforcing compliance in ECE, including investigating and prosecuting where necessary. They will handle complaints and incidents, while also providing support, information, and guidance to service providers, parents, and caregivers. This raises awareness of what quality early childhood education looks like.

“By mid next year, graduated enforcement tools will be used to respond to breaches of the new licensing criteria. The only enforcement tools previously available couldn’t manage minor breaches and didn’t facilitate early intervention. There will no longer be high-stakes open-or-shut rules that create anxiety, and strain relationships between regulators and centre operators. 

“Instead, the relationship will be collaborative, focused on the common goals of ensuring child safety and keeping costs down.”

The updated licensing criteria changes will be used from April 2026. More information and guidance for early learning services will be provided by the Ministry of Education in early 2026. 

“These reforms will make it easier to open and run high-quality centres, which means more choice and better access for parents. This is part of the Government’s wider commitment to smarter, more effective regulation that encourages growth,” says Mr Seymour.
