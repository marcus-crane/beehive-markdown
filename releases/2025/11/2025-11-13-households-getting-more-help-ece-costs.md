Thousands more households are now receiving FamilyBoost payments of $150 a fortnight or more thanks to the expansion of the scheme, Finance Minister Nicola Willis says.

“FamilyBoost changes announced in July have resulted in 11,584 households now receiving at least $150 a fortnight.

“Households can claim larger rebates on the early childhood education fees they pay, and more households are eligible.

“As a result, over 78,000 unique households have now received FamilyBoost payments, which is 10,000 more than at the end of the last quarter.

“And the average payment relating to the September quarter is just under $100 a fortnight, compared to $57 for the quarter before.

“This is good news for New Zealanders with young families.

“I encourage all households who think they could be eligible to go to [ird.govt.nz/familyboost](https://ird.govt.nz/familyboost).”
