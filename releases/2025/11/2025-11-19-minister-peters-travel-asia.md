Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister for Rail Winston Peters will travel to Viet Nam, Thailand and China next week.

“Southeast Asia has been a strong focus for New Zealand’s foreign policy over the past two years, as the Coalition Government has worked hard to ensure that our key relationships in the region reach their potential,” Mr Peters says. 

“Southeast Asia contributes significantly to New Zealanders’ prosperity and security, and we are doing all we can to maximise our mutually beneficial connections. We are pleased to be returning to Ha Noi and Bangkok next week.”

Mr Peters will meet with senior political leaders in both Southeast Asian capitals to exchange views on major regional challenges and explore opportunities to advance cooperation that benefits both New Zealand and its partners.

Mr Peters will also travel to Guangzhou, China, to attend an event marking New Zealand’s procurement of two new interisland ferries from Guangzhou Shipyard International.

This is Mr Peters’ seventh official visit to China and the eighth New Zealand Ministerial visit to China in 2025.

“The Coalition Government is committed to maintaining and building our strong, mature and mutually respectful relationship with China,” Mr Peters says.

“We have been pleased with the number and quality of high-level visits between China and New Zealand over the past two years, in which both sides have been able to share perspectives on important issues and underline the importance of mutually beneficial cooperation.

“This procurement of interisland ferries from Guangzhou Shipyard International builds upon our long-standing trade and economic relationship with China, which is one of New Zealand’s most important and valuable,” Mr Peters says.

Mr Peters departs New Zealand on Tuesday 25 November and returns on Saturday 29 November.
