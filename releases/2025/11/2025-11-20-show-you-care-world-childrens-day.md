This World Children's Day we should celebrate our nation's caregivers and encourage others to consider becoming a caregiver.

"Every child deserves to feel secure, to be nurtured, and to know they belong. Today, there are more than 2000 caregivers across New Zealand, including respite, emergency, transitional and family home caregivers,” says Minister for Children Karen Chhour.  

“These are people who have opened their homes and hearts to children and young people seeking care and stability. 

“We still have children and young people dreaming of that stability—a place where they can simply be kids, go to school, and thrive without fear. This is not just a government responsibility; it is a shared community obligation.

“There is no single type of person who can make a great caregiver. We need people from all walks of life—single, partnered, young, older, working, retired. 

“If you are patient, kind, and committed to making a difference, seriously consider becoming a caregiver.

“Oranga Tamariki provides comprehensive training, guidance, and ongoing support for all approved carers, ensuring they have the tools and resources necessary to meet the needs of the children placed with them.

“This year we have undertaken a survey of caregivers and implemented a number of improvements to the supports we provide.

“The need for caregivers is diverse, ranging from short-term respite care that offers essential breaks to existing carers, to transition care for older children, and permanent homes where a child can grow up feeling safe and loved,” says Minister Chhour.
