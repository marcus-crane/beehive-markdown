The Stratford community in Taranaki will benefit from improved access to diagnostic services with the installation of a new state-of-the-art digital X-ray system at the Stratford Health Centre, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This means patients no longer need to travel to Taranaki Base Hospital for a wide range of imaging services,” Mr Brown says.

“The ceiling-mounted unit will deliver faster image processing and greater accuracy, improving the quality and efficiency of radiology services for Stratford patients.

“Its advanced automatic positioning technology and lightweight design make it easier for clinicians to use around patients and their injuries, supporting a safer and more comfortable experience.”

This major upgrade completes the rollout of new digital X-ray machines across Taranaki’s satellite health centres, following earlier installations in Hāwera and Waitara.

“This is another important step in strengthening local health services and ensuring people can get the care they need closer to home.”

Radiology capability in the region will be further expanded when the New East Wing Building (NEWB) radiology department opens at Taranaki Base Hospital in 2026.

“When the department moves into the NEWB, it will shift into a purpose-built suite equipped with some of the most advanced imaging technology in the country.

“The new department will include a second CT machine, a fluoroscopy machine, a new MRI, SPECT CT, cone beam CT, ultrasound, and enhanced X-ray capabilities – significantly boosting diagnostic capacity.

“We’re focused on making sure all New Zealanders, including those Stratford and the wider Taranaki region, can access timely, quality healthcare when they need it.

“Upgrades like this new digital X-ray system are essential to achieving that goal, improving outcomes for patients and ensuring more people receive diagnostic services they need, closer to home.”
