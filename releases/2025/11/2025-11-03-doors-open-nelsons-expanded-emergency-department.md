Nelson families will benefit from faster, more modern emergency care with the opening of the expanded Nelson Hospital’s emergency department, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This marks a major milestone in the emergency department expansion project. With treatment spaces increasing from 23 to 29, Nelsonians will be seen more quickly, and staff will have a safer, better-equipped environment to work in,” Mr Brown says.

The new wing is the largest and most significant stage of the expansion, adding more clinical space to treat patients, including:

- Four new observation bays and one observation room
- Two new isolation rooms
- A dedicated triage room and expanded medication area
- Improved staff facilities including write-up spaces, bathrooms, and utility rooms

“The expanded emergency department has been designed to deliver a modern, efficient, and patient-centred environment. The layout supports faster treatment and improved safety, while new isolation facilities and a state-of-the-art negative pressure pod significantly strengthen infection control.

“These upgrades will make a real difference for patients and support our frontline teams to reduce wait times and deliver timely, quality care.”

Mr Brown says the expanded emergency department will play a key role in achieving the Government’s shorter stays in ED target.

“Between April and June, patients in Nelson spent less time in the emergency department compared to the same period last year. With these additional treatment spaces now in place, we expect to see even greater improvements.”

The $10.6 million emergency department expansion builds on the Government’s $1 billion nationwide investment in hospital infrastructure announced in Budget 2025, which includes the redevelopment of Nelson Hospital.

“For too long, Nelson has had outdated facilities and too few beds. Our Government is delivering the modern hospital this region needs to meet the demands of a growing and ageing population, with enabling works now well under way on the full redevelopment.

“Nelson will also be one of five hospitals to receive a new temporary inpatient ward under the Government’s rapid-build hospital capacity programme. The ward will allow services to move while seismic strengthening work is carried out and provide extra beds to improve patient flow until the new inpatient tower is built. 

“Nelson’s new ward will be built locally in Nelson off-site, creating work for local contractors and supporting the regional economy, while contributing to the wider redevelopment of Nelson Hospital. Construction remains on track to meet the timeframe announced earlier this year.

“With the new emergency department wing now open, and the full expansion due for completion in April 2026, patients, families, and staff will benefit from faster, safer, and more modern emergency care – and this is just the start of delivering a hospital that meets Nelson’s future needs.”
