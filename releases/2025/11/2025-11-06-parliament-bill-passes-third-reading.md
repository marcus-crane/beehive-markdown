The unanimous passing of the Parliament Bill is an important constitutional moment, says Leader of the House Chris Bishop.

“Parliament occupies a central place in our constitution but legislation governing its operations is scattered across the statute book and some of it is out of date.

“The Parliament Bill consolidates and modernises the Clerk of the House of Representatives Act 1988, the Parliamentary Service Act 2000, the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, and the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014.   
Important changes in the Bill include:

- Establishing a new funding model for the Office of the Clerk and the Parliamentary Service, so their budgets are recommended by the House instead of being determined by the executive,
- Providing Parliamentary Security Officers with statutory powers similar to those of court security officers,
- Transferring from the Clerk of the House to the Electoral Commission the role of determining whether a petition carries the required number of signatures to trigger a Citizens’ Initiated Referendum
- Updating the functions of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to clarify when the functions and duties of the Speaker are carried out by the Deputy;
- Modernising the statutory functions of the Clerk of the House.

“The development and passage of the Bill has seen Parliament work at its best. The Bill started its gestation in 2015 and was developed under the previous government. I have been proud to carry it forward in this Parliament.

“Parliament established a special select committee, chaired by the respected former Speaker of the House, Rt Hon Adrian Rurawhe, to consider the Bill. I thank the committee and Mr Rurawhe for their work on this important piece of legislation.

“As we approach the end of the year, I would also like to thank all those who work at or for Parliament who provide service to Members of Parliament in their many different ways. New Zealand’s democracy is very well served and New Zealanders should be proud of it.”
