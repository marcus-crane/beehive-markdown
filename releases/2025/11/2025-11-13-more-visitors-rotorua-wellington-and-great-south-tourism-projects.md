More international visitors will be exploring regional New Zealand next year, thanks to a $5.9 million investment from stage one of the second round of the Government’s Regional Tourism Boost, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston has announced.

“We want visitors to experience more of what New Zealand has to offer, support our regions to grow their visitor economies and build lasting connections with international travellers,” Louise Upston says.

“Whether it’s stargazing under Wairarapa’s dark skies, soaking up Rotorua’s geothermal wonders, sipping wine in Hawke’s Bay, or discovering the wild south, there’s so much for visitors to enjoy. This funding means regions can highlight special deals on travel and accommodation and promote the hospitality making each one stand out.

“Three Regional Tourism Organisations will launch four campaigns to inspire travellers from Australia and East Asia to explore, stay, and dine in their regions from January 2026.

“The regions will be connecting directly with travellers. RotoruaNZ’s partnership with Ctrip, for example, puts tailored offers in front of Asian travellers, while Australians will see fresh itineraries and limited-time deals encouraging them to go beyond the expected.”

The successful campaigns are:

- **RotoruaNZ’s “North Island x Ctrip” campaign ($2,025,000):**  
  to attract travellers from China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, in partnership with Ctrip and North Island regional tourism organisations.
- **RotoruaNZ’s “Kiwi North” campaign ($2,500,000):**  
  to target people travelling from Australia’s eastern seaboard, in partnership with 14 North Island regional tourism organisations and major airlines.
- **WellingtonNZ’s “Classic NZ Wine Trail” campaign ($991,000):**  
  to promote wine, food, and stargazing across Wellington, Wairarapa, Hawke’s Bay, and Marlborough to Australian visitors.
- **Great South’s “Southern Way” campaign ($393,000):**  
  to encourage Australians from the Gold Coast to explore the lower South Island, with a focus on itineraries, regional events, and Southern hospitality.

The second round of the Regional Tourism Boost is part of the Government’s $70 million Major Events and Tourism Package and builds on a similar initiative earlier this year to include hospitality offerings as part of the campaigns.

Louise Upston says there will be more to come.

"Our Government will proudly keep backing both hospitality and tourism, promoting New Zealand experiences to overseas visitors, and building on the buzz around the Michelin Guide due to arrive next year.

“But these campaigns are about more than promotion – they’re about helping visitors feel welcome, stay longer, and explore further.”
