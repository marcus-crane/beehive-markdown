Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones have welcomed the approval of the first renewable energy project under the Fast-track Approvals Act. 

Genesis Energy Limited lodged an application in April 2025 to continue operating and maintaining the Tekapo power scheme, which includes Tekapo A and B power stations and substations, and the canal system.  

“Genesis Energy initially applied for a standard RMA resource consent in July 2023. A year into the process, Genesis indicated that further delays were likely due to the council hearing process and the potential for appeals. Genesis then applied for fast-track on April 2025, with the process taking just 80 days once a panel was appointed,” Mr Bishop says. 

“Today’s approval follows the approval of the Port of Auckland expansion, Maitahi Village development in Nelson, and the Milldale development in Auckland. I’m pleased to see the system delivering approvals in key areas and giving the large infrastructure projects New Zealand needs certainty.” 

Mr Jones said the Tekapo project was a great example of the Act doing exactly as it should, speeding up consenting for vital infrastructure.

“The Tekapo power scheme generates enough clean electricity to power more than 228,000 Canterbury households, and it plays a vital role in keeping our grid reliable.

“There is absolutely no reason why such important projects should stay tangled up in red tape and economic progress should be constricted by bureaucratic nonsense.

“I’m looking forward to more applications going through the fast-track process to create jobs, regional prosperity and much-needed economic growth for New Zealand.”

The Ministers are currently working on legislative changes to speed up the fast-track process, iron out problematic areas and get projects under way even faster.
