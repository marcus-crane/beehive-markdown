Associate Transport Minister James Meager has confirmed a significant Government investment into new container-handling equipment for Gisborne’s Eastland Port, which will unlock fresh economic opportunities for the Tairāwhiti region.

Mr Meager announced the $5 million investment while visiting the Port, as part of his two-day visit to the region.

“This funding will directly benefit local businesses, exporters, and industries, by enabling the ability to ship containers out of Gisborne,” Mr Meager says.

“In addition to supporting regional prosperity, the investment will secure Tairāwhiti’s connectivity, as it creates an avenue for essential supplies to be brought in by sea if the region is cut off by road, as we saw in Cyclone Gabrielle.”

Eastland Port is the first confirmed recipient of funding from the Coastal Shipping Resilience Fund, which was established through the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2024. The $30 million fund invests in projects which enhance the sector’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from events that could disrupt New Zealand’s freight system.

“Supporting freight movements in and out of Gisborne is vital for the region’s economic growth and supports our Government’s plan to double the value of exports in the next 10 years,” Mr Meager says.

“By providing efficient container handling capabilities, Gisborne can attract new trade, stimulate investment, and support job creation in the region. This investment will help local producers access wider markets, strengthen supply chains, and increase the region’s competitiveness.

“I would like to acknowledge local MP Dana Kirkpatrick for her advocacy for the Gisborne community and investment in Eastland Port.”
