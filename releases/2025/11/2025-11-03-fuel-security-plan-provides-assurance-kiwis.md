New Zealand’s Fuel Security Plan has been released, a comprehensive strategy to ensure Kiwis have reliable access to fuel in case of global and domestic disruptions, Associate Energy Minister Shane Jones says.

“Fuel security is a cornerstone of New Zealand’s economic resilience and national wellbeing. As an island nation reliant on imported fuels, we must be prepared for global supply chain shocks and domestic disruptions.”

“The plan published today builds on actions the Coalition Government has already started, such as increasing onshore fuel stocks and the production of a National Fuel Plan for emergency responses.

“The Fuel Security Plan sets out a clear pathway to further strengthen our resilience to ensure people and businesses can continue to access fuel, no matter what challenges the future brings,” Mr Jones says.

The plan focuses on four key areas:

- Resilience against global supply shocks: The Government is already requiring fuel importers to hold minimum stock levels, participating in international emergency exercises and improving transparency across the supply chain. Major importers will be required to hold additional diesel stocks from July 2028, with a review in 2026 to consider expanding this requirement to all importers.
- Domestic resilience: The Government works closely with the private sector to prepare for and respond to domestic fuel disruptions. From November 2026, fuel importers will need to hold 10 days’ of jet fuel at 80 per cent of normal capacity at Auckland Airport.
- Supporting domestic fuel alternatives: The Government is supporting the deployment of EV charging infrastructure, introducing a new standard for renewable diesel, and providing an enabling regulatory environment for domestic production of low-carbon fuels. Looking forward, the Government will investigate whether there are regulatory barriers to alternative fuels for aviation and shipping.
- Resilience in a transitioning market: Ongoing monitoring of fuel supply and demand patterns will ensure continued investment in critical infrastructure and prevent regional vulnerabilities as the market transitions to alternative fuels.

“The Fuel Security Plan is not just about managing risk; it is also about supporting economic growth and building greater self-reliance. That means investing in domestically produced energy, including alternative fuels and renewable energy, to reduce our dependence on global markets and creating new opportunities for regional development and innovation,” Mr Jones says.

“By harnessing our own resources, we can strengthen our energy security and ensure New Zealand is better prepared for the future.”

The Fuel Security Plan is a key part of the New Zealand First-National Coalition Agreement to safeguard transport and logistics systems and emergency services from any international or domestic disruption.
