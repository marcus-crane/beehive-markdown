Biosecurity Minister Andrew Hoggard says the Government and a range of experts have come up with a new strategy to take on the harmful exotic Caulerpa seaweed.

“Caulerpa seaweed is a pest. The new strategy focusses on five things: prevention, detection, removal, research, and coordination of resources. Getting this right is key to protecting our coastlines.

“In developing the strategy, we worked closely with a national advisory group, made up of affected iwi, regional councils, fishers, and local communities. This ensured all the relevant interests were considered.

“$31.7 million has been spent or allocated to combatting exotic Caulerpa. This includes the development of removal tools, research, and raising public awareness.

“We have already seen some success from that investment. For example, including irradiating Caulerpa with ultraviolet light, and the use of special enclosures which concentrate chlorine onto Caulerpa have been effective.

“The good news is that we’ve seen up to 90 per cent reductions in exotic Caulerpa biomass at key sites including Omakiwi Cove in the Bay of islands, and in Okupe Bay at Aotea/Great Barrier Island. We want to better understand why those reductions are happening and are conducting further research.

“Over the next year, we will further refine Caulerpa removal tools, undertake elimination trials at key sites, continue researching the impacts of Caulerpa, and strengthen national co-ordination and surveillance.

“The response to Caulerpa will require national buy in. The support of councils, local communities, and iwi, is vital in the response to Caulerpa.

“I want to acknowledge the work of everyone involved. It has been a mammoth effort against this challenging pest.

“Our coastlines are some of, if not, the best in the world. They need protecting.”
