The deployment of a New Zealand Defence Force liaison officer to Israel has been extended, Defence Minister Judith Collins says.

“This deployment is about improving our understanding of coordination efforts on the ground, so we can better assess potential future options in support of sustained peace in Gaza,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government has agreed the deployment should be extended for a further eight weeks so we can continue to gather information as the situation evolves.

“The liaison officer has been doing excellent work in a dynamic environment in recent weeks. Their role will continue to be based in the US-led Civil Military Coordination Centre.

“No decisions have been made beyond this deployment.”
