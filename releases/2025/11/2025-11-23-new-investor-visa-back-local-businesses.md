Applications are now open for the Business Investor Visa, a new immigration pathway designed to attract experienced businesspeople who want to invest in and grow established businesses in New Zealand.

“This visa is about bringing practical skills and capital into the economy. We want investors who will roll up their sleeves and help New Zealand businesses thrive. This visa keeps businesses strong, creates jobs for Kiwis, and brings valuable skills and experience into our communities,” Immigration Minister Erica Stanford says. 

The Business Investor Visa offers two investment options:

- Invest $1 million in an existing business for a three-year work-to-residence pathway
- Invest $2 million in an existing business for a 12-month fast-track to residence

“We want to help keep businesses going where New Zealand business owners are looking to retire. Opening the door for overseas buyers means we can protect local jobs, while also attracting investors who can inject fresh energy and investment into small businesses that are vital to local economies,” Ms Stanford says.

“This is part of a wider refresh of the Government’s business visa settings to support growth. Since introducing the Active Investor Plus visa in April, we’ve already attracted more than 440 applications and a potential $2.63 billion investment into the New Zealand economy.

“Attracting investment is crucial to boosting economic growth and creating more opportunities for New Zealanders.”
