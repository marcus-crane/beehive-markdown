People in Marlborough no longer need to make the long journey to Nelson for dialysis, with the opening of the region’s new dialysis unit in Blenheim, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“The opening of this unit is the result of years of dedication and advocacy from the Marlborough community,” Mr Brown says.

“This new dialysis unit in Blenheim is a great example of what can be achieved when local voices, iwi, and health providers work together to deliver patient-centred care. It’s about designing services with communities, not just for them, ensuring local perspectives are embedded in how care is delivered.”

Marlborough Primary Health has led the development of the unit in collaboration with Health New Zealand.

“Until now, Marlborough patients needing dialysis have had to travel to Nelson Hospital three times a week – a two-hour journey each way.

“This new four-chair facility will operate three days per week initially, with capacity to expand as demand grows. It’s designed for clinically stable patients and brings together wraparound services such as podiatry and social work.

“This will be life-changing for many people. It brings care closer to home, supports families, and ensures people can receive treatment in an environment that reflects their needs and their community.”

The facility also reflects outstanding community generosity, with funding support from the Care Foundation, the Marlborough Hospital Equipment Trust, and contributions from the Rātā Foundation, Churchill Trust, Lotteries, and the Marlborough District Council.

Mr Brown also acknowledged the strong advocacy of Kaikōura MP Stuart Smith in championing the project.

“With an ageing population and rising rates of chronic kidney disease, locally led, collaborative models like this are vital to ensuring services remain accessible and close to home.

“This is a great day for Marlborough – one that celebrates community determination and ensures patients can receive the care they need, right here at home in Blenheim.”
