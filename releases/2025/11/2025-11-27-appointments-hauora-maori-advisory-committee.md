Health Minister Simeon Brown has today announced a series of appointments to the Hauora Māori Advisory Committee.

Tā Mark Solomon has been appointed permanent Chair, with Mr Tereki Stewart, Mr Te Ururoa Flavell, and Dr Jamie-Lee Rahiri appointed as members for three-year terms.

“These members are respected leaders with extensive experience advocating for the needs and aspirations of Māori whānau and communities,” Mr Brown says.

“The Committee provides Māori with a voice at the highest level of decision-making in the health system. It plays a vital role in improving Māori health outcomes and supporting the Government’s commitment to ensuring all New Zealanders, including Māori, have access to timely, quality healthcare.

“I look forward to working with the new members to drive results and deliver on the Government’s priorities and key focus areas.

“I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Parekawhia McLean, the outgoing Chair, who will continue to support improvements in Māori health outcomes through her role on the Health New Zealand Board.”

All terms of office will commence on 1 December 2025.

The Hauora Māori Advisory Committee (HMAC) was established under the Healthy Futures Act. Its role is to advise the Minister on any matter related to Māori health that the Minister requests. Members are appointed by the Minister of Health after consulting with the Minister for Māori Development.
