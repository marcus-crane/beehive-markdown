Construction has begun on the State Highway 2 Hawke’s Bay Expressway – one of the first new Roads of National Significance to reach the main works stage, Transport Minister Chris Bishop says. 

“This project is a major milestone for Hawke’s Bay and for our Government’s transport investment programme. It will improve resilience and productivity across the region, and is expected to create hundreds of jobs while under construction,” Mr Bishop says.

“Along with the Waikare Gorge realignment project, the Expressway is part of more than a billion dollars’ worth of road infrastructure being delivered across the Hawke’s Bay region in the coming years.

“The Roads of National Significance programme is about improving connections, improving productivity, and making daily life easier and more efficient. The Hawke’s Bay Expressway is a perfect example – it’s a lifeline route linking people to the regional hospital and airport, and a key part of the national freight corridor connecting central North Island with Napier Port.”

The Hawke’s Bay Expressway corridor includes:

- 7km of four-laning between Links Road/Pākōwhai Road and Taradale Road
- a duplicate two-lane overpass at Meeanee Road
- a duplicate two-lane overpass at Kennedy Road
- a duplicate two-lane bridge over Tutaekuri River
- a four-lane grade separated interchange at Links Road/Pākōwhai Road

“Initial construction will focus on the section of road between Taradale Road and Tutaekuri River bridge, with four-laning expected to be completed in 2028,” Mr Bishop says.

“Work on the new Meeanee Road overpass is planned to start in January 2026, and work on the Kennedy Road overpass will follow in April 2026. Construction of the interchange at Links Road/Pākōwhai Road will follow in mid-2026 upon completion of detailed design.

“The Expressway is vital to Hawke’s Bay. It connects people between Napier and Hastings and is crucial for moving freight to and from the airport and the Napier Port.

“But we also know the Expressway is congested and won’t be able to cope with the future predicted growth of the region. Hawke’s Bay is expected to be home to more than 200,000 people by the year 2048.

“The start of construction today will unlock the Expressway’s future potential for the region, not only when the project is complete, but also during construction.”

The project is expected to be completed in December 2029.
