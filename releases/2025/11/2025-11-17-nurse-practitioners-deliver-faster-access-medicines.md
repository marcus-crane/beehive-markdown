Nurse practitioners can now prescribe a wider range of medicines, helping New Zealanders get faster access to the medicines they need and improving continuity of care, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This change will be transformative for patients. By enabling nurse practitioners to work at the top of their scope, we are providing faster, more effective care and improving health outcomes,” Mr Brown says.

The Medicines Amendment Bill, which passed last week, modernises New Zealand’s medicines legislation to make it easier for qualified health professionals to prescribe and supply medicines safely and efficiently.

“Previously, prescribers such as nurse practitioners faced unnecessary restrictions that created delays for patients. This Bill removes those barriers so people can get the right medicine, from the right clinician, at the right time.

“These changes mean that when a nurse practitioner identifies a suitable treatment, in their area of practice, they will be able to provide that care directly without needing to refer the patient elsewhere. It’s a common-sense update that recognises their advanced skills and experience.”

Nurse practitioners are highly qualified health professionals who assess, diagnose, and manage patients’ health conditions across a range of settings – including primary care, aged residential care, and rural communities. They often serve as the lead clinician for patients and families.

“I want to acknowledge the nurse practitioners who have been calling for this change for years. They are a vital part of our health system and play an increasingly important role in meeting patient needs, particularly in communities where access to doctors can be limited.

“This is a practical change that will make it easier for people to get the care they need, when they need it, while supporting nurse practitioners to do what they do best.”
