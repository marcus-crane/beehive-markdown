Feedback is being sought on new proposals to reduce risk from commercial fishing to hoiho (yellow eyed penguins), Oceans and Fisheries Minister Shane Jones says.

“In September, I put in place an emergency three-month closure to commercial set-net fishing around Otago Peninsula and directed officials to develop proposals for longer-term measures to reduce the impacts of set-net fishing on hoiho.

“It’s clear from the [new scientific risk assessment](https://fs.fish.govt.nz/Page.aspx?pk=113&dk=26146) that the northern population of hoiho, those found on the South Island and Stewart Island, face a range of threats including malnutrition, predators on land and at sea, fisheries bycatch and disease. 

“The recovery of the northern hoiho population depends on reductions of mortality from all these causes. The options included in this consultation focus on ways to reduce the risk from fishing and are informed by the most up to date scientific information.” 

The proposed protection measures include making the emergency set-net closure around Otago Peninsula a long-term closed area, prohibiting set-netting to around eight nautical miles between Karitāne and Hampden, and setting a Fishing-Related Mortality Limit supported by an escalating response framework to reduce bycatch risk outside of the closed areas.

“I share the concerns of many New Zealanders about the future of hoiho and, following the public consultation, will carefully consider what long-term protection measures may be necessary and appropriate to reduce the risk to northern hoiho from fishing,” Mr Jones says.

“I’m also mindful of the potential impact these proposals, if implemented, would have on commercial fishers in the area. They work hard to provide for their families, create jobs, and put food on our plates, as well as making an important contribution to New Zealand’s seafood exports. 

“I encourage everyone to read the proposals and provide feedback. It’s important I hear from people across a wide range of interests including commercial, recreational and customary fishers, tangata whenua, environmental groups and the local community.”

Consultation on the proposals starts today, and people can make a submission until 5pm on 12 December 2025.
