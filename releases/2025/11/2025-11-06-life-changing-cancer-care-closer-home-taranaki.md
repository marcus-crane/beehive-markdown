Patients across Taranaki now have access to world-class cancer care closer to home with the official opening of the Taranaki Cancer Centre, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“This centre marks a major milestone for patients and families across Taranaki,” Mr Brown says. 

“It delivers modern, patient-focused cancer care in a purpose-built facility designed to meet the region’s needs, now and into the future.”

At the heart of the new centre is Taranaki’s first Linear Accelerator (LINAC), enabling local delivery of radiation therapy for the first time. This cutting-edge technology precisely targets cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue, improving both treatment outcomes and patient comfort. 

“Each year, around 300 Taranaki patients require radiation therapy. Until now, many had to travel to Palmerston North for multiple appointments, adding stress and disruption to already challenging circumstances.

“With this new facility, up to 80 percent of radiation treatments can now be delivered locally, with only one planning visit required outside the region.” 

The centre also increases access to chemotherapy, now available five days a week instead of four. This improvement will enhance access to cancer medications and streamline treatment schedules for patients.

The $56.1 million facility also includes:

- 10 chemotherapy chairs (up from eight)
- Eight outpatient family rooms with video-conferencing
- Two isolation rooms
- Dedicated family spaces to support patients and family throughout their care journey

The Taranaki Cancer Centre is in addition to the wider $462.6 million redevelopment of Taranaki Base Hospital, which is modernising and expanding healthcare infrastructure across the region. The new East Wing building is nearing completion, offering increased capacity and state-of-the-art facilities for both patients and clinicians. 

“We are focused on building a modern, resilient, and future-ready health system for New Zealanders.

“This new cancer centre will reduce long journeys for treatment, give patients more time with their loved ones, and support better health outcomes, while providing clinicians with the modern facilities and technology needed to deliver world-class care – right here in Taranaki.”
