A significant expansion of stem cell transplant services will help patients access critical, life-saving treatments without delay, Health Minister Simeon Brown says.

“Every New Zealander deserves access to timely treatment that can save their life,” Mr Brown said.

“Over the next three years, Health New Zealand will increase investment by $27.1 million to strengthen the workforce, expand hospital capacity, and upgrade infrastructure so more patients can receive timely stem cell transplant care.”

Stem cell transplants are a critical treatment for people with blood cancers and related conditions. However, demand for allogeneic transplants has outpaced capacity in recent years, leaving many patients waiting far too long.

“Too many Kiwis face distressing delays for these life-saving procedures. Health New Zealand has worked urgently with clinicians on a plan to boost transplant capacity and reduce waitlists. This investment delivers on that commitment.”

The funding will enable:

- 27 – 38 per cent more patients to receive allogeneic transplants when they need them, depending on case complexity.
- Recruitment of 79 new full-time staff across the three transplant centres in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.
- Increased inpatient bed capacity at Auckland City Hospital and Wellington Regional Hospital.
- Infrastructure upgrades at Wellington Regional Hospital to address current physical constraints.

"Health New Zealand is also introducing a digital tool that will support transplant scheduling and provide a nationwide overview of wait times and treatment requirements, helping to improve the delivery of stem cell transplants. The tool is expected to be in place in the first half of 2026."

This builds on a $6.11 million boost in 2024/25 for stem cell transplant services, which enabled Health New Zealand to begin improvements immediately.

“The additional $27.1 million investment will deliver a transformative change for patients and their families. By reducing wait times, expanding specialist capacity, and upgrading critical infrastructure, we’re ensuring that more New Zealanders receive life-saving stem cell transplants when they need them.”
