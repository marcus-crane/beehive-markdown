A $1.2 million Government–industry investment through AgriZeroNZ into a breakthrough technology to cut agricultural emissions, reduce farm costs, and boost productivity, has been welcomed by Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis today.

The investment supports the development of a wearable device for cows that could reduce nitrous oxide emissions by up to 95 per cent and nitrate leaching by 93 per cent.

“This is Kiwi innovation at its best: smart technology designed on the farm, for the farm, turning waste into a valuable fertiliser and maintaining New Zealand’s leadership in low emissions pasture-based farming,” Nicola Willis says.

It is the 16th project to be funded by AgriZeroNZ, a joint venture between the Government and leading agribusiness partners, and its first equity investment into nitrous oxide mitigation.

“A total of $191 million has been committed over its first four years to accelerate development of emissions reduction tools for farmers that support the Government’s goal of doubling export value in 10 years.”

Developed by Canterbury start-up Āmua, the small, lightweight device spreads a cow’s urine so it can be used as a fertiliser - allowing nitrogen to be better absorbed by pasture, to lift grass growth and lower fertiliser use.

“Other AgriZeroNZ investments include methane vaccines, inhibitors, probiotics and pastures. The first commercial tools are expected to become available next year - and up to 11 from wider government investment by 2030.”

Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti says innovation, technology, and science are central to the Government’s Going For Growth agenda.

“Research and development drive productivity and high-value jobs. Our goal is a system that empowers world-class scientists, universities, and research organisations to turn ideas into market-ready solutions.

“Our ambition is to drive a relentless focus on commercialisation and economic impact to meet the needs of a future-ready economy.”

Nicola Willis and Shane Reti visited a Canterbury dairy farm today to learn more about Āmua’s project and see first-hand another emission mitigation technology - EcoPond, that is being piloted on 200 Fonterra dairy farms and 50 Synlait farms.

The Government also released an update on the ‘Innovation, Technology and Science’ pillar of its Going For Growth work programme.

Ministers also viewed:

- **EcoPond** – technology that reduces methane emissions from dairy effluent ponds. Studies have shown the treatment, which uses polyferric sulphate and sulphuric acid, can cut effluent pond emissions by over 90 per cent. It was developed by Ravensdown’s innovation and investment subsidiary, Agnition, and Lincoln University. The technology is being piloted on 200 Fonterra dairy farms and 50 Synlait farms in 2025/26.
