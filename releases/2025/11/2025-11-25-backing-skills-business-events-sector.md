The Government has today announced it is investing in the New Zealand Certificate in Business Events (Level 4) “Te Haeata”, a new industry-led qualification designed to build a skilled workforce for New Zealand’s business events sector, Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

Te Haeata has been developed by industry, for industry, and shaped by professionals with experience in delivering world-class events.

“This investment will help ensure our business events sector remains globally competitive, skilled and ready to meet future demand,” Louise Upston says.

“Business events play a critical role in our visitor economy, attracting people who tend to spend more and travel during the off-peak season.

“Te Haeata provides practical, industry-specific training to lift skills and standards in New Zealand’s business events sector. By investing in people and capability now, we’re supporting the development of a higher-wage sector and creating clear career pathways for tourism and hospitality workers.

“This qualification directly addresses workforce shortages in the tourism and business events sector, supporting our long-term goal of building a skilled domestic workforce.”

Te Haeata is expected to launch in Q1 2026. The qualification will be delivered online, making it accessible nationwide.

It will be part of employment-based training, enabling recognition of practical experience and career progression. The first paper will also be available to be delivered in high schools from 2027 as a ‘taster’ pathway into the sector.

“Attracting and retaining talent is critical, and Te Haeata represents a major step forward in building the capability of our workforce to support sustainable growth for New Zealand’s business events, hospitality and tourism sectors,” Louise Upston says.
