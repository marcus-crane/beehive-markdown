Labour market statistics released today highlight the importance of the Government’s ongoing work to rebuild the economy and deliver more job opportunities for Kiwis, Finance Minister Nicola Willis says.

The data released by Stats NZ shows unemployment increased from 5.2 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the September quarter and is broadly in line with pre-election and more recent forecasts.

“Our Government is determined that New Zealanders who are seeking work can find it. That‘s why we’re so focused on strengthening the foundations from which local businesses can grow and create new jobs.

“Since being elected we have worked hard to fix the damage done to our economy during a period of reckless government spending, sky-high inflation and rising interest rates. 

“We’ve successfully fixed the foundations. Taxes have been reduced. Inflation is back in band. Interest rates have fallen. Recovery is underway. 

“There is more to do to accelerate New Zealand’s economic recovery. We are working to ensure more Kiwi employers can be confident about starting, expanding and creating new jobs. That’s why we are driving our going for growth plan.  

“We’ve delivered the Investment Boost tax incentive for businesses, accelerated $7 billion of major public infrastructure projects pre-Christmas, fast-tracked consents for job-rich privately funded projects, opened new markets for our exporters, welcomed in new investment from around the world, reduced red tape for businesses and championed growth policies in sectors from agriculture through to our space industry and the film sector.

“New Zealanders have worked incredibly hard for economic recovery. Now is not the time for expansive new taxes, or a return to reckless fiscal management. Now is the time for our Government’s plan to back aspiration, effort and job-creation.”
