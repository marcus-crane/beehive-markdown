The Government’s ensuring schools have a sharpened focus on lifting student achievement and attendance, education workforce governance is fit-for-purpose, and freedom of expression is upheld in universities, with the Education and Training Amendment Bill (No 2) passing its third reading in Parliament.

“Student achievement is at the heart of the education reforms we are introducing that are grounded in evidence and ambitious for our young people. This legislation is about ensuring our education system is responsive, well-governed, and focused on delivering better outcomes for our young people,” Education Minister Erica Stanford says.

Key changes in the Act are:

- Focusing school boards on raising educational achievement by making it the highest priority objective and introducing new supporting objectives on student attendance and assessment.
- Requiring unions to give seven days’ notice of strike action (up from three days), giving schools and families more time to prepare.
- Requiring schools to have attendance management plans in place, by 25 January 2026.
- Strengthening initial teacher education requirements and the Teaching Council’s disciplinary and competence processes, alongside changes to the membership of the Teaching Council.
- Requiring universities to develop a freedom of expression statement, maintain a complaints process, and report annually on academic freedom and free speech.

“Attendance management plans based on the Stepped Attendance Response (STAR) are mandatory from Term 1 next year,” Mr Seymour says.

“STAR means Stepped Attendance Response Scheme. It means there are escalating responses for declining school attendance, focused on getting kids back in school. There are stronger and stronger responses at 90 per cent, 80 per cent and 70 per cent attendance. 

“Each school will develop their own STAR system to suit their community and school, based on a standard framework. Every student, parent, teacher and school has a role to play at each step.”

Dr Reti says the legislation will make a positive difference to New Zealand universities by shining a light on the value of freedom of expression and academic freedom.

“Universities should be a place where diverse perspectives are welcomed, debate is encouraged, and students are empowered to think critically,” says Dr Reti. 

“These new requirements set up important processes to ensure that our universities remain vibrant spaces for learning, discovery, and democratic engagement.”
