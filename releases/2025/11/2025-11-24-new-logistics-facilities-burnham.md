Defence Minister Judith Collins today opened an Army maintenance support facility at Burnham Military Camp, and broke ground on the next project in the Army logistics upgrade.

“The Defence Force can only operate with the right equipment, in the right place, at the right time, and importantly supported by the right infrastructure,” Ms Collins says.

“These new facilities will form a Regional Logistics Centre for the South Island, improving the Defence Force’s ability to sustain operations, support personnel, and protect New Zealand’s interests.”

The $58 million Burnham Maintenance Support Facility is a modern, technology-enabled complex for maintenance and repair of defence equipment and offers improved capacity and safety for personnel. By following the same design and process as the Linton facility, it has been delivered ahead of time and $6.25 million under budget.

Construction has also begun on a multi-functional regional supply facility at Burnham Military Camp. The new $82.7 million project will deliver a single, modern logistics hub, enabling efficient access to equipment and supplies.

This facility will support the local economy by providing employment opportunities for approximately 600 people across the life of the project. Significant cost savings have already been achieved by replicating the design used at Linton Military Camp.

“This is another example of the Defence Force delivering with discipline to ensure we can protect New Zealanders and our way of life,” Ms Collins says.

“Improving defence logistics is part of the $12 billion in planned commitments over the next four years outlined in the Government's Defence Capability Plan.

“Logistics is often the quiet force behind success. It is the unseen engine that powers deployments and ensures our personnel have what they need, where and when they need it.”

**Note to editors:**

Both the Maintenance Support Facility and the Regional Supply Facility form part of the New Zealand Defence Force’s Consolidated Logistics Project (CLP) – a significant programme delivering five new logistics facilities across Linton and Burnham Military camps.

These are:

- Two Maintenance Support Facilities, one each at Linton and Burnham Military Camps. (Both complete)
- Two Regional Supply Facilities one each at Linton (under construction) and Burnham (groundbreaking event).
- One Regional Vehicle Storage Facility at Linton (in design stage).
