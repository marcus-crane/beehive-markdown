Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal will make his first official visit to New Zealand this week to strengthen the growing New Zealand-India trade and economic partnership.

Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay says it marks another milestone in the deepening relationship, which has seen an unprecedented level of engagement over the past two years and has been a priority for this Government.

“The Government has been clear about its commitment to building a broad, deep and enduring strategic relationship with India,” Mr McClay says.

This follows visits by Indian President Droupadi Murmu to New Zealand last year, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s trade mission to India this year, two successful visits to India by Foreign Minister Winston Peters and five visits by Minister McClay since the election.

“Minister Goyal’s visit reflects the strong momentum we’ve built together and our shared ambition to expand trade and investment. It is a pleasure to host him and his delegation.”

While in New Zealand, Minister Goyal will attend a business summit in Auckland, engage with the New Zealand-Indian community, visit businesses in Rotorua, and discuss Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Minister McClay. Minister Goyal will be accompanied by his wife and a business delegation.

India has the fastest-growing economy in the G20, and it is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy in coming years.

“India’s rise represents one of the most significant economic opportunities of our time,” Mr McClay says.

“A strong relationship means New Zealand will be well placed to find new opportunities leading to economic and business growth across key sectors.”

Minister Goyal will be in New Zealand from 5 to 8 November.
