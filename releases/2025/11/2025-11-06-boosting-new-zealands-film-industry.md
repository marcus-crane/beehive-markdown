The Government is making targeted updates to the International Screen Production Rebate to ensure New Zealand remains a competitive and attractive destination for global film, television, and streaming productions, Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis announced today.

The changes respond directly to industry feedback and are designed to maintain New Zealand’s edge in a fast-changing international market where other countries are aggressively increasing incentives to attract screen investment.

“Global competition for large-scale screen productions has intensified, and the settings we inherited were putting New Zealand at risk of missing out,” Nicola Willis says.

“These updates modernise the rebate to attract a broader range of productions, create more consistent work for local crews and businesses, and encourage greater foreign investment in our creative industries.”

From 1 January 2026, the changes will:

- Lower the minimum qualifying spend for feature films from $15 million to $4 million, enabling more productions — whether for cinema, TV, or streaming — to access the rebate.
- Reduce the threshold for the ‘5% uplift’ from $30 million to $20 million, allowing more mid-budget productions to qualify for the additional incentive.
- Expand eligibility for the 5% uplift to include post-production, digital and visual effects (PDV)-only projects, recognising New Zealand’s world-leading expertise in these areas.
- Remove the cap on above-the-line costs such as director, producer, principal cast, and screenwriter fees, aligning with international practice.

The updated settings will be funded through Budget 2025’s additional $577 million that brought total funding for the International Screen Production Rebate to $1.09 billion.

“These changes ensure New Zealand remains a serious contender in an increasingly competitive global screen industry,” Nicola Willis says.

“They will help diversify our screen economy, build stronger partnerships in growing markets across Asia and the Middle East, and keep Kiwi talent in steady work while attracting new investment, skills and technology.”

New Zealand’s screen sector supports around 24,000 jobs and contributes $3.5 billion a year to GDP. Every dollar invested through the rebate delivers around $2.40 in return to the wider economy — through wages, services and international exposure.

“Modern screen production is borderless and dynamic. By staying agile and globally connected, we can turn Kiwi creativity into competitive advantage — keeping New Zealand on the world stage and growing one of our most distinctive export industries.”

**Notes to editors:**

- Since 2020, 42 international live-action productions have received the rebate, employing over 21,000 New Zealand cast and crew (84% of the total workforce).
- Competitor rebate rates: Australia (up to 40%), Ireland (32%), UK (29%), Canada (up to 29%), New Zealand (currently 20%).
- The 5% uplift is an extra incentive that lifts the total rebate available from 20% to 25% for productions that bring wider benefits to New Zealand — like investing long-term in our screen industry, training local crews, promoting New Zealand on the world stage, or forming lasting partnerships with Kiwi studios and suppliers.
- Budget 2025 provided a $577 million funding uplift to support the International Screen Production Rebate, bringing total funding available for the scheme to $1.09 billion over the four years.
