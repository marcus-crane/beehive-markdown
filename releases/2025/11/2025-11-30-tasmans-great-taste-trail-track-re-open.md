Tasman’s popular Great Taste Cycle Trail is on track to reopen the iconic Spooners Tunnel section by the end of December, following significant progress on repairs to storm damage earlier this year. 

“Having Tasman’s Great Taste Trail ready for summer means more people can enjoy one of New Zealand’s most scenic rides. It’s great news for visitors and the local community,” Tourism and Hospitality Minister Louise Upston says.

“Since I announced $1.6 million from the New Zealand Cycle Trail Fund for repairs in September a huge amount of work has been completed. 

“Getting most of the trail back up and running for summer and accessible to a wide range of cyclists will be a big boost for local businesses, including bike hire and tour operators, cafes and accommodation providers.

“Since the storm damaged the track, a major on-road detour means the trail hasn’t really been suitable for families or beginner cyclists. 

“Now the Southern section from Kohatu to Spooners Tunnel is back open, restoring a popular stretch of the trail and the northern section from Spooners Tunnel to Belgrove is on target to re-open by the end of the year. 

“Bringing the trail back gives locals and visitors alike the chance to enjoy the outdoors and experience everything Nelson Tasman has to offer.” 

An on-road detour will remain between Wakefield and Belgrove while plans for future repairs are finalised. 

Tasman’s Great Taste Trail is one of 23 Great Rides that make up Ngā Haerenga, New Zealand Cycle Trails. More than 2 million people use these rides each year, contributing an estimated $1.28 billion to regional economies.
