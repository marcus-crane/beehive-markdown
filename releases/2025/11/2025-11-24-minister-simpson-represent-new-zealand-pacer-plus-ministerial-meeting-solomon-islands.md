Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Scott Simpson will today travel to the Solomon Islands to attend the 2025 Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus Ministerial Meeting. 

“PACER Plus plays a significant role, it strengthens economic growth and resilience in the Pacific and reaffirms our shared commitment to transparent, predictable, rules-based trade,” Mr Simpson says.

“Since entry into force, New Zealand’s trade with Pacific PACER Plus countries has increased by 47 percent - something we can be incredibly proud of. 

“Our support of PACER Plus demonstrates New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to working with Pacific Island countries and Australia for a more prosperous, integrated, and reliable Pacific economy.”

While in Solomon Islands, Mr Simpson will also engage with the Solomon Islands–New Zealand Business Community and meet with regional counterparts.

Mr Simpson returns to New Zealand on 28 November.
