New Zealand’s forestry and wood-processing sector has taken centre-stage during a highly successful trade mission to India, Forestry; Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay says.

Mr McClay joined a delegation of 13 New Zealand companies to India this week to pursue new growth opportunities, strengthen market insights, and cement New Zealand’s reputation as a reliable, long-term supplier of premium wood products.

“This mission delivered the first tangible results under the Letter of Intent on Forestry Cooperation signed earlier this year,” Mr McClay says.

“It also gave our sector valuable first-hand understanding of India’s forestry policies and its fast-growing domestic market.”

Wood and wood products are already New Zealand’s largest goods export to India, worth NZ$134 million in the year to June 2025 and growing.

“While logs and pulp remain the backbone of current trade, the real opportunity lies in higher-value processed timber products that match India’s rapid urbanisation and emphasis on sustainable construction,” Mr McClay says.

“This trip showcased our world-class premium timbers, cutting-edge processing technologies, and innovative value-added products.”

Mr McClay announced that New Zealand will host a return Indian forestry delegation in February 2026 to build on this week’s momentum and elevate the bilateral partnership.

The mission, which wrapped up on Monday evening, follows the recent visit to New Zealand by India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, and underlines the Government’s commitment to a deeper, broader strategic relationship with India.
