The Government has renewed its investment in the rural wellbeing programme Farmstrong, Associate Minister for ACC Nicola Grigg has announced.

The $2.7 million investment is the first phase of a five-year agreement between ACC and Farmstrong, totalling $6.8 million.

“Agriculture continues to be one of New Zealand’s highest-risk sectors when it comes to injuries. In 2024, ACC accepted over 17,000 new claims for work-related agriculture injuries, with recovery costs around $120 million.

“This investment will help reduce the frequency and severity of injuries in the agriculture and horticulture sectors by focusing on the link between wellbeing and injury risk,” Ms Grigg says.

ACC partnered with FMG and the Mental Health Foundation in 2016 to deliver Farmstrong, which was developed to address the need for improved psychosocial support in farming and horticulture.

Since then, it has delivered a return on investment of $7.85 for every dollar spent, equivalent to over 9,800 injury claims saved and $52 million claims cost savings.

“For agriculture to do well, we need our people to be well so this support is a no-brainer.

“Farmers are the backbone of our economy, and this is just another way our government continues to back New Zealand’s most productive sector,” Ms Grigg says.

Farmers can find a wide range of practical resources and guidance on the Farmstrong website [www.farmstrong.co.nz](https://www.farmstrong.co.nz).
