Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says the relationship between NZ Customs and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will be further strengthened by the exchange of officers based in New Zealand and Australia’s targeting centres.

“In June a senior Customs operations analyst will take up a liaison role based at Australia’s National Border Targeting Centre, and a similar Australian appointment will be based at our Integrated Targeting Operations Centre (ITOC) in Auckland later this year,” Ms Wagner says.

“The ITOC supports the coordination of border sector operations across New Zealand, enhancing our ability to protect the safety and security of New Zealanders through more effective border control.

“The exchange of staff is critical to maintaining a shared intelligence picture of potential risks to Australia’s and New Zealand’s borders.”

Ms Wagner today visited the Australian Border Protection Command Headquarters as well as the National Border Targeting Centre at Customs House in Canberra.

“Having staff based at each other’s targeting centres will strengthen the working relationship between the two agencies, and improve the capability to assess threats and target risks to the border, and respond to these more effectively and efficiently,” Ms Wagner says.
