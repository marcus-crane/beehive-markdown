The Māori Development Minister has confirmed that 41 Māori collectives will receive funding from Te Pūnaha Hiringa: Māori Innovation Fund’s Commercial Advisors Scheme.

“A total of $3.7 million will be invested over two years to support these Māori collectives with realising the economic potential of their assets,” says Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

The Commercial Advisors Scheme allows collectives to partner with a commercial advisor who will mentor and support the collective with identifying opportunities, developing business cases and obtaining professional advice.

“I’m pleased to see there was strong demand for the inaugural funding round. A large number of proposals came from collectives planning to develop their land and fisheries assets, or property and tourism initiatives,” says Mr Flavell.

Among the successful applicants is Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Takoto which has been approved for $75,000 over one year for a commercial advisor to help formalise a forestry collective for Te Tai Tokerau and seek expert advice on land use and forestry management technology.

Another successful applicant is the Miere Coalition which is a group of Māori landowners, honey producers and investors. The coalition has been approved for $60,000 over one year for a commercial advisor to help with strategic planning, financial modelling, refinement of their business model, and advice on structure.

Te Pūnaha Hiringa: Māori Innovation Fund is a Māori Party initiative that was announced as part of Budget 2014.

“The Commercial Advisors Scheme will enable Māori collectives to get new businesses up and running and help existing businesses become more productive,” says Mr Flavell.

The Fund supports the goals of *He kai kei aku ringa -* the Māori Economic Development Strategy, which provides a blueprint for a productive, innovative, and export-orientated Māori economy.
