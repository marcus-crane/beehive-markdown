Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new report shows the positive impact Kapiti Coast’s Youth One Stop Shop is having.

Today, Dr Coleman launched the report *How we know what we’re doing works* at Kapiti Youth Support’s (KYS) centre in Paraparaumu. The report uses the KYS youth outcomes model and measures developed in conjunction with Evaluation Works Ltd.

KYS is one of 11 Youth One Stop Shops supported under the Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project.

“We know the importance of making health services for young people accessible and relevant to their circumstances,” says Dr Coleman. “It is important young people have the right support at the earliest opportunity.”

Budget 2014 invested $8.4 million over four years into the Youth One Stop Shops. This funding comes on top of the $600,000 committed in Budget 2013.

KYS provides free physical and mental healthcare, and social services to around 4,700 young people aged between 10 and 24 across several locations on the Kapiti Coast.

The report tracks the health outcomes for over 300 young people seeking social and health assistance from the KYS service.

“The findings show that over a five month period, 90 per cent of young people using the KYS service maintained or improved their health and wellbeing,” says Dr Coleman.

“These are positive numbers which reflect the contribution KYS is making.”

The Prime Minister’s Youth Mental Health Project, launched in 2012, brings the health sector, communities, schools and the online world together providing a more integrated network of support for young people.

The Project’s 26 initiatives promote more accessible information and mental health awareness in youth services, including early intervention in schools, and innovative, integrated and improved services.
