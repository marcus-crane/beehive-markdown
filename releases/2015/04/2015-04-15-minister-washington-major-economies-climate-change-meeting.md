Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues Tim Groser departs for Washington tonight to participate in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change (MEF) at the invitation of US Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern. 

The MEF draws together Ministerial representatives of the world’s largest emitters and invited observers in a bid to accelerate progress in negotiation of the future climate change agreement due to conclude in Paris this December.

"The MEF is the most important forum to prepare the ground for deals on the tough issues needing resolution in the new agreement,” says Mr Groser.

“New Zealand’s ideas on “bounded flexibility” and our proposal for the legal form of commitments under the agreement have had a good airing there, laying the foundations for a politically feasible and environmentally effective outcome.”

“I am confident we are going to reach an agreement in Paris at the end of the year under the leadership of France,” says Mr Groser.

While in Washington, Mr Groser will also participate in the IMF/World Bank Spring meetings, in order to promote the launch of an international communique giving fresh momentum to global efforts to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.
