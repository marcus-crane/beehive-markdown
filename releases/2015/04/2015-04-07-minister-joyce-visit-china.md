Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce leaves for Shanghai, China, this evening to foster ties between the two countries’ marine, education and technology sectors.

Since the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) came into force in September 2008, New Zealand exports to China have more than tripled to reach $11.8 billion in 2014.

Mr Joyce will be attending the 20th annual China International Boat Show, where he will receive an award on behalf of the NZ marine industry for New Zealand’s commitment to developing business ties with the marine sector in China.

He will meet delegates of seven Kiwi companies exhibiting at the boat show and host a networking function between industry representatives and their Chinese partners and customers.

“New Zealand is recognised internationally for its expertise in the marine sector and it is a great honour for our country to be acknowledged with this award,” Mr Joyce says.

“The China International Boat Show is the largest marine industry showcase in China. It is a great opportunity for New Zealand companies to promote their cutting-edge products and technology and build relationships with like-minded companies and investors.”

Mr Joyce will attend the opening of a new Nuplex factory, which extends the New Zealand-listed chemical company’s presence in China, and open the Shanghai offices of Primary Collaboration New Zealand – a coalition of several New Zealand food and beverage companies.

“New Zealand companies are making major inroads in China across a range of industries and the opening of these two new facilities will further increase New Zealand’s footprint in one of the largest markets in the world,” Mr Joyce says.

He will also visit New York University Shanghai Vice-Chancellor Jeff Lehman, meet Kiwi students studying in Shanghai, and visit the Shanghai Technology Innovation Centre.

Mr Joyce returns to New Zealand on Saturday 11 April.
