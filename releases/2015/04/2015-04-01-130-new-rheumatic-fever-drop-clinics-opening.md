Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says 75 new free drop-in sore throat clinics are now up and running in Waikato and Northland, and a further 55 clinics will soon be opening.  

“The Government has invested more than $65 million to prevent rheumatic fever. A range of initiatives are making a difference, but there is more work to be done,” says Dr Coleman.

“Targeted drop-in clinics in general practices, secondary schools and pharmacies offer easy access to free effective care for high risk children and young adults.

“There are now 202 drop-in clinics in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Rotorua, Gisborne/East Coast, Porirua and the Hutt Valley. More drop-in clinics will also be opening in the coming months in Hawke’s Bay.

“This will mean that more than 200,000 young people in high-risk areas will have access to prompt assessment and treatment for sore throats.”

More than 14,800 children most at risk of developing rheumatic fever have had their sore throat checked at a drop-in clinic in the past year.

This is in addition to the children being assessed and treated through the school-based programme which operates in over 200 North Island schools.

The latest figures on rheumatic fever released in February show a 14 per cent decrease in first episode rheumatic fever hospitalisations since the target was introduced in 2012.
