The Government is continuing to back the recovery of central Christchurch, with about 350 public servants to relocate into a major new development, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and State Services Minister Paula Bennett have announced.

A new 8500 square metre office building to be constructed on the corner of Hereford Street and Cambridge Terrace – the site of the former central police station – will be tenanted by staff from the Ministry of Education, Housing New Zealand Corporation and the Ministry of Health.

The building will be a part of a wider development on the city block by Ngai Tahu Property.

“This is the fourth new central city building we have now confirmed with a lease to house public servants in central Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Last year we announced that 1100 staff from 13 Government agencies would move into three new central city buildings, in addition to 200 Inland Revenue staff already working in the Mid-City Building above Ballantynes.

“This latest development by Ngai Tahu Property is just another positive step forward for a central city rebuild that now has huge momentum.

“The new building on the former police station site will be just across the road from the new Avon River Precinct and Christchurch City Council offices, and a two minute walk from the new Retail Precinct.

“By introducing this large Government workforce into a CBD already experiencing strong private sector growth, we are going to see a lot of activity and spin-offs for business, and that means more opportunities for the people of Christchurch.”

Mrs Bennett says the building’s close proximity to the city council and other agencies based in and around the Retail Precinct reflects the Government’s commitment to providing better public services in Christchurch.

“Government agencies are moving beyond just collaboration, to actually looking at issues through New Zealanders’ eyes and providing services in the way they need,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Having multiple service providers under one roof not only reduces costs for taxpayers, but means service providers can more effectively respond to the people of Christchurch and deliver measurable results.”

All four buildings in which Government staff will be based will also include space for private sector tenants and car parking.

It is expected the new building on the former police station site will be complete and ready to be occupied in February 2017.  The 1100 staff from the other 13 agencies will be in the three other buildings – Grand Central and BNZ Centre stages I and II, by the end of 2016.
