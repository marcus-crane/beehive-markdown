Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Nick Hurley as New Zealand’s new High Commissioner to the Cook Islands.

“New Zealand and the Cook Islands have a unique relationship, based on historical ties and shared citizenship,” Mr McCully says.

“This year is the fiftieth anniversary of Cook Islands self-government in free association with New Zealand, and there are a range of events to celebrate this milestone taking place later this year.

“New Zealand also has a substantial aid programme in place with the Cook Islands, with a focus on sustainable economic development, and the education and health sectors,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Hurley has extensive experience in the Pacific, most recently as High Commissioner in Samoa and, before that, in Solomon Islands. He has also held previous posts in Australia, France, Fiji, Italy and the Cook Islands.
