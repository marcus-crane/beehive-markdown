Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says the 2014-2015 summer season saw record numbers of passengers and goods cross New Zealand’s border.

“The Government’s investment in border processing technology is paying off with Customs able to process record numbers of passengers over the busiest summer season so far,” Ms Wagner says.

“Over three million international passengers arrived to and departed from airports between December and February – an increase of over six per cent compared to the same time last year.

“Even with this increase, Customs processed over 94.5% per cent of passengers in 45 minutes or less by redeploying staff, and opening up SmartGate to United States and Canadian travellers and children over 12.

“SmartGate technology allows Customs officers to focus on high-risk travellers while making the border process smoother for everyone else.

“Trade volumes were also high over the summer months. More than 9.5 million international mail imports were cleared over summer, including more than half a million parcels and packages.

“Courier freight also topped the charts with 1.6 million imports recorded for the three months – almost a 14 per cent increase on the previous year.

“Customs worked actively in the lead up to summer to make sure that passengers’ holiday plans went smoothly while packages and freight were cleared with minimum delays,” Ms Wagner says.
