Customs Minister and Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner will travel tomorrow to Australia to visit her counterparts and foster trans-Tasman cooperation across both portfolios.

“New Zealand Customs and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service enjoy a strong relationship and work collaboratively to ensure effective border management in both countries,” Ms Wagner says.

“Meeting Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Hon Peter Dutton, in Canberra will be an excellent opportunity to discuss items of mutual interest and further develop the relationship between the two organisations.

“I also look forward to meeting Australian Customs and Border Protection staff who, like their New Zealand counterparts, work hard to protect their country’s border.

While in Melbourne Ms Wagner will meet with Senator the Hon Mitch Fifield, Assistant Minister for Social Services, with responsibility for disability.

“The visit will also provide a timely opportunity for trans-Tasman cooperation on disability issues. I look forward to sharing ideas with Senator Fifield about how we can improve the lives of disabled people and their families.

“I will be meeting with Disability Employment Australia and several companies who employ disabled people to see how they are enabling more disabled people into work,” Ms Wagner says.

Ms Wagner departs New Zealand on Sunday 12 April and returns Thursday 16 April.
