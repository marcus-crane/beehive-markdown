The Whānau Ora Minister is thrilled to see the South Island’s Whānau Ora commissioning agency support education and employment programmes.

Te Pūtahitanga ki Te Waipounamu has invested in the trades training apprenticeship initiative He Toki ki te Mahi and the iwi-led farming programme Whenua Kura. Hon Te Ururoa Flavell has attended both their launches in Canterbury over the last week.

“Whānau have a key role to play in supporting apprentices and students through these courses and whānau will benefit from their success,” says Mr Flavell.

Te Pūtahitanga announced $3.1 million investment in ten South Island initiatives earlier this year including He Toki ki te Mahi and Whenua Kura.

“Whānau Ora is much more than just providing an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. It’s about putting whānau at the centre of social change and increasing whānau well-being,” says Mr Flavell.

He Toki ki te Mahi estimates it will support 50 Māori trades apprentices through its programme per year. Whenua Kura estimates around 300 graduates will gain employment in the farming sector over the next five to eight years.

“What these programmes illustrate is the importance of collaboration at a local level between whānau, Te Tapuae o Rēhua, industry groups like Hawkins and Ngāi Tahu Farms, educational providers like CPIT and Lincoln University as well as Te Pūtahitanga. I look forward to watching the progress of these students and programmes in the years ahead.”
