Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the 2015 rheumatic fever awareness raising campaign gets underway from today.

“Rheumatic fever is a serious disease which starts with a sore throat and can lead to lifelong heart problems,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government is investing more than $65 million over six years to combat New Zealand’s rheumatic fever rates.

“More cases of rheumatic fever are now being identified and treated as a result of families having a better understanding of the disease. The latest figures show a 14 per cent decrease in first episode rheumatic fever hospitalisations since 2012.

“More than 16,600 children most at risk of developing rheumatic fever have had their sore throat checked at a drop-in clinic in the past year. This is in addition to the children being assessed and treated through the school-based programme which operates in over 200 North Island schools.”

The 2015 rheumatic fever awareness raising national campaign starts today with television and online advertising, followed by targeted regional radio advertising next week.

Other campaign components include animated banners on digital screen networks in targeted stores and venues throughout parts of the North Island, as well as a letterbox drop in targeted regions.
