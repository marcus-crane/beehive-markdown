Brian Dickey has been appointed Crown Solicitor for Auckland and Natalie Walker Crown Solicitor for Manukau, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Mr Dickey will be supported by the firm, Meredith Connell, and Ms Walker by the firm Kayes Fletcher Walker.

"Mr Dickey and Ms Walker were selected from a very competitive pool of applicants and I am confident they will do an excellent job," Mr Finlayson said.

The appointments follow the decision in October 2014 to reconfigure the Auckland region from one to two new Crown Solicitor warrants.

Meredith Connell has supported successive Auckland Crown Solicitors in delivering Crown prosecution services since 1922. Kayes Fletcher Walker will support Ms Walker as the inaugural holder of the Manukau Crown Solicitor warrant.

Applications were called for in late August 2014. Seven applications were received.

The warrants take effect on 11 May 2015 and the transition to the new arrangements will take place over the coming months.
