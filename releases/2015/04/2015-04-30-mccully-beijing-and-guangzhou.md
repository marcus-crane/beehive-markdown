Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to China this weekend for official engagements in Beijing and Guangzhou.

“In Beijing I will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for discussions covering regional cooperation, trade and economic matters, and the issues which are currently before the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

While in Guangzhou the Minister will open the new premises of the New Zealand Consulate General. The new office will house the Consulate and offices of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, MBIE Immigration, Tourism, Education, and Police.

“New Zealand has a growing trade and economic relationship with the province of Guangdong, and this new office reflects the New Zealand Government’s long term commitment to southern China,”  Mr McCully says.
