Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced that applications for the 2016 Churchill Fellowships are now open. 

“Churchill fellowships offer the opportunity for New Zealanders to travel abroad to enrich their personal and professional development.” Mrs Goodhew said. “Fellowships are open to New Zealanders at all stages of their career, in all professions, industries, occupations and trades.”

The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust was established 50 years ago following the death of Britain’s war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who believed overseas travel led to greater international understanding and world peace.

Recent fellows have contributed to research in areas such as Māori development, environmental protection, post-disaster recovery, and urban design.

“This is a time for us to spot emerging talent, and to encourage New Zealanders to take their work to another level,” Mrs Goodhew says. “We also want to encourage applicants to consider the research opportunities and experiences in the Pacific and Asia.” 

Alongside the traditional Fellowships, this year emerging writers can apply for The Winston Churchill McNeish Writer’s Fellowship, and designers can apply for The Winston Churchill Hawke’s Bay Design Trust Fellowship.  Two Anniversary Fellowships will also be offered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Trust.

  Applications must be submitted by 31 July 2015. For more information visit [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) or calling 0800 824 824.
