Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has officially opened the Shanghai office of Primary Collaboration New Zealand (PCNZ) – a coalition of New Zealand food and beverage companies pooling their expertise in China.

Mr Joyce, who is currently visiting Shanghai to foster business ties between New Zealand and China, says the new premises will provide a boost to the export ambitions of a number of New Zealand’s major primary sector brands.

“PCNZ is a trailblazing collaboration between New Zealand companies who are showing how innovative models can overcome size and scale challenges in large markets such as a China.

“By teaming up to provide a larger in-market presence they are able to cater to the growing demands of Chinese consumers looking for quality New Zealand products,” Mr Joyce says.

PCNZ member companies Sealord, Silver Fern Farms, Synlait Milk, Villa Maria Estate, Kono and Pacific Pace collectively represent about NZ$3 billion worth of New Zealand’s worldwide trade.

“The PCNZ partnership is an indication of the opportunities that can be realised when New Zealand companies team up to boost their international presence and provide a larger scale of business in foreign markets.”

Mr Joyce says officials from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise are also working with other like-minded companies to explore the potential for further collaborations to increase export growth.

“Our small size means we need to be innovative to succeed internationally, and I welcome this smart approach to increase competitiveness through collaboration.”
