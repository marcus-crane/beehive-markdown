Prime Minister John Key today officially opened the new premises of the New Zealand Consulate-General in Dubai.

The new office will house the Consulate, and offices of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Immigration NZ, and the Ministry of Primary Industries.

“This new office reflects our continued commitment to develop a closer relationship with the Gulf region,” Mr Key says.

“It is a signal of New Zealand’s increased investment our growing footprint  in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and the wider region.”

Finalising the GCC-New Zealand Free Trade is the next step in this story and working on completing that FTA is a priority of this trade mission.

“I appreciated the confirmation that the UAE supports the finalisation of the NZ GCC FTA, and  I will continue to press New Zealand’s case throughout the Gulf.”

“Discussing the FTA with leaders in this region has given me a lot of confidence that greater trade with New Zealand, recognising mutual benefits is welcome in the Gulf.

The Gulf Cooperation Council is New Zealand’s fifth largest export destination. Our exports to the region are worth $1.9 billion to New Zealand.
