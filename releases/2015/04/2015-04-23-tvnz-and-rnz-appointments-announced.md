Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of Sussan Turner as a Director of TVNZ and the elevation of Therese Walsh to Deputy Chair.

“As a former Group CEO of Mediaworks, Ms Turner has extensive television and media knowledge and experience and will bring real depth and substance to the role,” says Ms Adams.

“Ms Walsh has been a Director of TVNZ since 2012 and has made a considerable contribution since her appointment. She will provide strong leadership support to the board in her new position as Deputy Chair.

“Together these women bring a breadth of experience and talent to TVNZ and I wish them well as they settle into their new roles.”

Both women have been appointed three-year terms. The TVNZ Board will now have a majority of women members.

The Minister also announced the reappointment of Gary Monk to the Board of Radio New Zealand for a term of six months.
