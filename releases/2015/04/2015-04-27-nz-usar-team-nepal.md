Foreign Minister Murray McCully says that the New Zealand Government has approved the deployment of an Urban Search and Rescue team (USAR) to Nepal.

“Nepal has accepted our offer to send an USAR team to Kathmandu, and a 37 strong contingent will depart New Zealand this evening," Mr McCully says.

"The personnel going to Nepal have specific expertise in rubble pile rescue, and the technical rescue experts will be supported by paramedics, a doctor, a structural engineer, logistics personnel, a command and control element, and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade liaison officer.

"Our USAR team will deploy for up to 14 days initially, and will be fully self-sufficient while in Nepal.

"New Zealand is deeply moved by the devastation and human suffering these quakes have caused and our response reflects our close ties with the people of Nepal.

"Yesterday we announced a $1million contribution to the immediate relief effort and we will continue to assess how we can further assist," Mr McCully says.
