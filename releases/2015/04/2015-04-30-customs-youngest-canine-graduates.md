Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today congratulated Customs’ newest detector dog team, black Labrador Flame, and Customs Officer Andrew, after they graduated at the Police Dog Training Centre in Trentham.

“I enjoyed meeting Flame late last year. She is an energetic young detector who, with her handler Andrew, is a welcome addition to our enforcement taskforce at the border,” Ms Wagner says.

“Flame has been trained to detect drugs and is one of Customs’ youngest recruits, starting operational duty at only 15 months of age. Today’s graduation is a great opportunity to recognise the team’s hard work and the completion of their intensive training programme.

“Detector dogs and their handlers play a vital role at the border searching for illicit substances and keeping them away from our communities. Flame and Andrew will be based in Auckland, working in all areas including Auckland International Airport and the International Mail Centre.

“Today’s graduation marks the official beginning of Flame’s career and the opportunity for both Andrew and Flame to put their new skills into action,” Ms Wagner says.
