The growing need to internationalise the world’s universities to properly equip today’s students for our globalised world was highlighted by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce at the FAUBAI international education conference in Cuiabá, Brazil, today.

Mr Joyce provided a New Zealand perspective on the Brazilian Association for International Education conference themes of partnerships, equity and internationalisation.

Growing international linkages is one of six priorities in New Zealand’s Tertiary Education Strategy, Mr Joyce said.

“To equip our students with the skills to succeed in this Asia-Pacific century we have a responsibility to provide a more international learning experience.”

“That reflects the importance of international linkages to our success as a small trading nation, the ability of education to foster long-lasting links and the value of international collaborations to growing a strong research base.”

“Students need the skills to operate in an increasingly globalised world, and a deep understanding of regions important to our future.

“Student and academic exchanges, international research partnerships, internationally-focused curricula and technology are all internationalising education,” Mr Joyce said.

Mr Joyce also highlighted how education partnerships can benefit innovation.

“Innovation is fundamental to growing New Zealand’s economy, and to compete internationally we need to foster a science and innovation ecosystem that brings out the potential of our best and brightest. By collaborating together with countries like Brazil we can boost innovation and expand research frontiers,” Mr Joyce said.

“Tertiary education supports commercial innovation by connecting research, sector expertise and skilled graduates with business and communities.”

The FAUBAI conference was attended by more than 400 representatives of international relations offices from universities across Brazil.

“The conference was a great opportunity to illustrate New Zealand’s research strengths and our tertiary education system to potential new partners in this dynamic and developing country,” Mr Joyce said.

Mr Joyce was joined by a delegation of representatives from New Zealand universities and the Executive Director of Universities New Zealand.

He returns from the 10-day education and trade visit to Chile, Colombia and Brazil this Friday.
