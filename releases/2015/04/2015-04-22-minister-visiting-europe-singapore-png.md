Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for Belgium, where he will be New Zealand’s official representative at Anzac Day commemorations.

Mr Brownlee will attend a number of commemorative services at key Western Front sites in Flanders.

“A century on from the Gallipoli landings, it is important to continue to remember and reflect on the enormous sacrifices Australia and New Zealand made at Gallipoli and across other battlefields in the First World War,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It is also a time to remember all service men and women who have fought and lost their lives for their country.”

Mr Brownlee will also travel to the United Kingdom, Singapore and Papua New Guinea, returning to New Zealand on 3 May.

In London he will meet with Rt Hon Michael Fallon, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Defence, and in Brussels His Excellency Mr Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General.

“The United Kingdom is an important partner to New Zealand and defence links are a key part of this relationship.

“New Zealand also has a strong defence relationship with NATO, underpinned by our efforts in Afghanistan but also through our contributions to NATO counter piracy operations,” Mr Brownlee says.

While in Singapore Mr Brownlee will call on his counterpart Dr Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Defence.

“This will be my first meeting with Minister Ng and I will be interested in the perspective he can give on regional security issues.”

Mr Brownlee will then attend the second South Pacific Defence Ministers’ Meeting in Papua New Guinea.

“I am looking forward to the opportunity to engage with regional Defence Ministers as the South Pacific is a key area of focus for New Zealand.  The regional response to the devastation caused by Tropical Cyclone Pam on Vanuatu and Tuvalu is a great example of how we should be working together.

“This forum allows us to continue to look at ways we can improve coordination and cooperation on defence issues,” Mr Brownlee says.
