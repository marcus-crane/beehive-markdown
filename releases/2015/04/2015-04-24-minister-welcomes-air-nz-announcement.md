Transport Minister Simon Bridges is welcoming Air New Zealand’s news that the Christchurch Engine Centre will be one of the first facilities in the world capable of dealing with new generation aircraft engines.

The Christchurch Engine Centre, jointly owned by Air New Zealand and Pratt & Whitney, is a world class engine maintenance facility, able to maintain the V2500 one of the world’s most popular aircraft engines.

The centre will also repair and overhaul new generation aircraft engines, which Air New Zealand will use for its new aircraft models (A320neo and A321neo) due to join its fleet from 2017.

“New Zealand is known for its innovative and highly skilled aviation and air services sector. This Christchurch Engine Centre development is further evidence that our sector is excelling.

“I have made a few visits recently to Christchurch-based aviation organisations, to understand the sector’s potential and how the Government can help it thrive. I’ve been to meet the team at Global Aerial Platforms, who make Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) for a range of purposes, including search and rescue operations.

“I’ve also visited Martin Aircraft Company, the maker of the innovative Martin Jetpack, whose technology has evolved to include search and rescue, military, and commercial applications.

“Today’s announcement means the Christchurch Engine Centre will have maintenance work long into the future, and will continue to act as an innovative market-leader,” Mr Bridges says.
