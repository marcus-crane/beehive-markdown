Social Development Minister Anne Tolley and Revenue Minister Todd McClay say that taxpayers will soon be saving millions of dollars each year as a result of more efficient use of data from information sharing.

Improved automation of Ministry of Social Development systems from late 2015, away from a manual service, will allow it to identify overpayments of benefits much more quickly, so that they can be corrected sooner.

It is estimated that this more effective way of working will lead to Crown savings of around $100 million a year by 2018.

“The Ministry of Social Development administers benefit payments of around $7 billion a year, and by increasing the accuracy of this system we will ensure that those needing government assistance are getting their correct entitlement, while saving the taxpayer money,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Benefits will be able to be adjusted sooner, after information is received from Inland Revenue, leading to a reduction in overpayments and lessening the need for debt recovery. Fewer beneficiaries will inadvertently get into debt, and at the same time fraud will also be identified more quickly.”

Mr McClay says; “This is a great example of how agencies are working together to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealanders through information sharing.  This is one way government is delivering more efficient and effective services in line with our commitment to better public services.”

It is still the responsibility of clients to declare any changes to their income to Work and Income as soon as possible.
