The value of older people to New Zealand has been spelled out in a new report released today by Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry.

The 2014 Report on the Positive Ageing Strategy, from the Office for Senior Citizens, examines how New Zealand has progressed towards the goals from the original strategy, launched in 2001.

It also provides guidance for Government and local councils on planning for the issues facing older people now and in future.

Ms Barry says the strategy is important as our society ages. The number of people over 65 is predicted to double in the next 20 years to around 1.2 million, placing increased demands on our health system and services.

“An ageing population is not something New Zealand can ignore, but it is not something we should be afraid of either,” Ms Barry says.

“The report outlines some of the steps which need to be taken to make this country the best it can be for older people. It also shows how much progress we have already made.”

The growing economic importance of older people is detailed in the report. Spending by over-65s is expected to rise from $14 billion in 2011 to around $65 billion in 2051.

At the same time, the workforce is getting older. Currently, 22 per cent of over-65s have some form of paid work, just over five per cent of the total workforce. By 2033, it will have risen to 31 per cent of the age group.

Businesses will need to hold on to older workers. At present, the report shows many need to think about how best to do this.

“There remain negative perceptions about older people in the workplace despite the many skills they have. I would like to see a significant change in that ignorant attitude.”
