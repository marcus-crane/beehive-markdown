Education Minister Hekia Parata is returning to New Zealand after attending the International Summit on the Teaching Profession (ISTP) in Canada.

The fifth annual Summit in Banff saw ministers, teachers, leaders and experts from the world’s top-performing nations in education come together to discuss best teaching practice.

Ms Parata led New Zealand’s delegation comprising PPTA President Angela Roberts, NZEI President Louise Green, and NZPF President Denise Torrey.

“New Zealand’s teaching profession is one of the best in the world, but needs strengthening in some particular areas. We have high levels of achievement, but not yet for every student,” says Ms Parata.

“The discussions at this year’s Summit built on last year’s Wellington Summit focusing again on how collaboration and student-centred teaching are vital to achieving educational excellence, equity and inclusiveness for every student.

“Many delegations were impressed with New Zealand’s systematic focus on collaboration and the learning pathway of the student featured in our Investing in Educational Success initiative.”

She says they were also interested in the role of parents in helping set the achievement challenges of their communities of schools.

A number of the experts and researchers indicated that they are keeping a close eye on the initiative and are keen to be updated on progress.

“Our delegation agreed to take away from the Banff Summit further commitments to explore the digital platform to create more teaching quality time, and deeper collaboration to grow and develop teaching practice for measurably improved student outcomes,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Parata also joined Northwest Territories Minister of Education Jackson Lafferty, in presenting a seminar on indigenous education.

“Many participants were keen to come to New Zealand and see first-hand the Maori medium education pathway, and Minister Lafferty was hopeful that he would be able to take up my invitation to visit,” Ms Parata said.

Ms Parata also met with several education leaders including Chinese Vice Minister of Education Dr Hao Ping, Denmark Minister of Education Christine Antorini, and Finnish Permanent Secretary Anita Lehikoinen.

“It was also great to catch up with US Secretary for Education Arne Duncan, who hosted the first Summit in New York in 2011 and whose strong support has given great impetus to the Summit,” says Ms Parata.

“I’m confident our hosts, the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada, will be pleased with the successful Summit and we thank them for their hospitality.”

The 2016 Summit will be hosted in Berlin, and the German Minister of Education and Culture Stephen Dorgerloh, invited all participants to come together again in March next year.

Ms Parata also visited Norma Rose Point School in Vancouver with British Columbia Minister of Education Peter Fassbender.

“This school is built for 21st century teaching, much like our modern learning environments. It was great to see how the school is rising to the challenge of using different learning practices to engage students and raise achievement.”
