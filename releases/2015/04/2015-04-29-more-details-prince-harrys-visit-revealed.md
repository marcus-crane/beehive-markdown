Prime Minister John Key today released further details of Prince Harry’s visit to New Zealand from May 9 -16.

“I am delighted Prince Harry is visiting New Zealand. The Prince has asked to meet a wide range of New Zealanders so his programme has been designed with that in mind,” says Mr Key.

“I’m confident Prince Harry will have a fabulous time here and I encourage all New Zealanders to take the opportunity to go and see him.”

The Prince will arrive in Wellington on Saturday, May 9, where he will be officially welcomed at Government House before heading to the National War Memorial for a Wreath Laying Ceremony.

Later that evening he will attend the Hurricanes and Sharks game at Westpac Stadium.

On Sunday and Monday, Prince Harry will be in Stewart Island where he will meet with the community and visit Ulva Island, a Department of Conservation open island sanctuary.

On Tuesday, Prince Harry will head to Christchurch where he will visit Quake City and tour the Re:Start Mall.  He will also meet members of the Student Volunteer Army at the University of Canterbury.

On Wednesday he will visit the Linton Military Camp, where he will participate in a number of activities with the Army, including learning the Army’s own Haka.

The Prince will be in Whanganui on Thursday where he will visit Putiki Marae, join the crew of the Marae’s waka for a trip on the river, and visit the War Memorial Centre.

Prince Harry wraps up his visit in Auckland. On Friday he will visit Southern Cross Campus School, Middlemore Hospital’s Spinal Rehabilitation Unit and attend a reception with emergency services and disaster relief organisations at Government House.

On Saturday he will join young footballers at a FIFA Under-20 event at the Cloud before heading to the Millennium Institute of Sport. He will fly out later that evening.
