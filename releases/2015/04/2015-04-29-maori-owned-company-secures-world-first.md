Hon Te Ururoa Flavell congratulates Aotearoa Fisheries Limited (AFL) for being the first Māori-owned company to sign a business agreement with the Dubai Government.

“As the Minister for Māori Development and Associate Minister for Economic Development, I’m proud to see AFL’s subsidiary company Prepared Foods sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Awqaf and Minor Affairs Foundation, Government of Dubai – United Arab Emirates,” says Mr Flavell.

Prepared Foods will provide Halal-safe protein meals to disaster-torn regions around the world. Its food products will support the Salma humanitarian relief programme.

“This landmark business deal is an honour for AFL which is a 100 percent Māori-owned business and recognition of its hard work, values and reputation,” says Mr Flavell.
