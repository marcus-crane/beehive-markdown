The final event in the current New Zealand job fair series in Australia will take place in Melbourne this weekend, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Louise Upston announced today.

The Melbourne event is the fourth in the series, following the Perth and Sydney fairs in November 2014, and the Brisbane fair last month.

“The previous New Zealand job fairs have proven to be a success with almost 4500 job seekers meeting potential employers,” Mr Joyce says.

“The high level of interest in the job fair series suggests that many expat Kiwis and Australian workers are looking for new opportunities in the face of a slowing Australian economy. Meanwhile New Zealand is experiencing broad-based growth across a number of sectors.

“The latest short-term employment forecast figures show that 101,600 more skilled workers will be needed in New Zealand over the next three years. Though we are rapidly growing our domestic skills base, we will need some people from across the Tasman if New Zealand companies are going to be able to maintain their current growth rate.

"These job fairs are highlighting to Australians and expat Kiwis that the trans-Tasman labour market is not a one-way street."

This weekend, 31 employers will be recruiting for more than 1400 skilled jobs predominantly in the ICT, manufacturing, construction, engineering and health sectors at the Grand Hyatt in Melbourne.

“The Melbourne job fair is an excellent opportunity for Victorians to learn more about work opportunities and life in New Zealand, and for expats to update themselves on what's happening back home,” Ms Upston says.

“In NZ, our economy is growing well. Employment has outpaced population growth and the labour force participation rate is the highest since records began. In addition, salary and wage rates in NZ are increasing faster than inflation.

“Australians do not need a visa to work in New Zealand. Plus they can access a range of benefits such as healthcare, subsidised tertiary education, Working for Families tax credits, and national superannuation.”

The Melbourne job fair runs from 10am to 4pm tomorrow and Sunday at the Savoy Ballroom in the Grand Hyatt Hotel, 123 Collins Street, Melbourne CBD. Tickets can be purchased in advance at: [www.workingin-events.com/new-zealand](http://www.workingin-events.com/new-zealand)
