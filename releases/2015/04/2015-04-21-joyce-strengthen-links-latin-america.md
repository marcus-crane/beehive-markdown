Strengthening education and trade links will be the focus of Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce’s first visit to Latin America.

This afternoon Mr Joyce departs for a 10-day visit to Chile, Colombia and Brazil with a delegation of university representatives and the Executive Director of Universities New Zealand.

“New Zealand is an increasingly popular destination for Latin American students studying overseas. Within the region, plans to internationalise education systems is also an opportunity for New Zealand to expand its existing relationships into new areas,” Mr Joyce says.

New Zealand’s education relationship is focused on research collaboration and scholarships, particularly relating to agriculture, science and innovation. The visit will explore opportunities for co-operation in new areas including teaching training, curriculum development and qualification frameworks.

“International education fosters learning opportunities and links between New Zealand and the world, encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, and builds people-to-people connections,” Mr Joyce says.

“As a small trading nation our level of success in this Asia-Pacific century will be determined by our level of connectedness.

“With our reputation for delivering high-quality education and research, New Zealand has built a rich education history with Latin America over recent years and there is plenty of scope to further this through greater co-operation.”

During his visit, Mr Joyce will give a keynote address at a science, innovation and technology education conference at Bogotá’s Universidad del Rosario, and speak at an international education conference in Cuiabá, Brazil. 

He will also will attend innovation forums in Santiago, Chile, and Bogotá, Colombia, and meet New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Beachheads advisors. 

On ANZAC Day Mr Joyce will commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli landings during the First World War in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Australian and Turkish government representatives.

Mr Joyce returns to New Zealand on 1 May.
