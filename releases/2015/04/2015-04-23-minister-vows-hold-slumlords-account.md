Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell is outraged by the squalid state of some private rental properties in Christchurch.

“My first reaction was to name and shame those landlords, particularly those who have had tenants living in substandard conditions for a number of years”, says Mr Flavell.

Mr Flavell viewed some of the Christchurch properties earlier this week.

“There are gaping holes in the floors and walls, no doors to hold the heat in and rats in these houses.

“These buildings are a disgrace. Landlords are continuing to raise rental costs for whānau often without any improvements to these buildings after the earthquakes.”

Mr Flavell has asked Te Puni Kōkiri, fellow Ministers and the Christchurch City Council to look at what assistance they can provide whānau who are living in these appalling conditions.

The Māori Party called for a warrant of fitness on all State-owned houses which was trialled last year. It would also like to see a warrant of fitness required for all private rentals.
