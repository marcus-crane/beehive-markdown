New Zealand’s strengths in business, innovation and education were highlighted by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce yesterday in a speech to Chile’s private and public sector leaders.

“New Zealand has a long relationship with Chile. We have a steady trade in services and a growing, but still modest, goods trade at $145 million in 2014.”

“There’s great potential for further growth,” Mr Joyce says. “Economic activity in Latin America is forecast to increase, and New Zealand is well placed to meet demand particularly in the agribusiness, food and beverage, technology and education sectors.

“Agribusiness is clearly a natural fit for two farming nations. In the six years to 2013 New Zealand’s agri-tech exports to Chile nearly doubled to $US28 million.”

“But sectors such as food and beverage and ICT shouldn’t be overlooked. Our exporters are helping package Chile’s products, increase loading efficiencies in wharf infrastructure, and improve productivity in the mining industry with innovative 3D geological modelling software.”

Mr Joyce says the opportunities in education are two-fold: to build on the growing number of Chilean students studying in New Zealand, and to partner with educational and governmental institutions seeking to internationalise the education system.

“Smart, innovative exporters are the key to New Zealand’s long-term prosperity. I’m pleased to be sharing stories of their expertise and talent with national and regional leaders during this visit.”

The speech was delivered to local university and business representatives, New Zealand business partners and public officials.

Mr Joyce will address a second Innovation Forum in Colombia on Saturday 25 April (NZ time).
