Education Minister Hekia Parata today presented five Māori students with a prestigious tertiary scholarship in honour of the 28th (Māori) Battalion.

The students who were presented with the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship in a ceremony at Parliament are:

- Tahlia Kingi (Te Awara, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti)
- Te Rerekohu Tūterangiwhiu (Ngāpuhi, Taranaki, Ngāti Ranginui, Tainui)
- Hine Kawana (Rangitane, Raukawa, Te Arawa, Ngā Waiariki, Te Ati-hau-nui-a-Papārangi)
- Coralie Takuira Dargaville (Ngāpuhi, Te Rarawa)
- James Enright (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Ruanui).

The winners were chosen from 86 applicants in the 2014/15 round and are made up of aspiring psychologists, doctors and an environmental scientist at undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels.

Ms Parata says they all exemplify the traits that earned the Battalion an honoured place in our nation’s history.

“This year marks 100 years since the Anzac landings at Gallipoli. Last week we paid tribute to the men and women who fought at Gallipoli and honoured those who gave their lives serving our country in past and recent times.

“Since 1948, the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund Board has supported young Māori to succeed in education. These five students not only demonstrate education excellence, but also the same commitment, service and leadership displayed by the Battalion.

“They honour the spirit and sacrifice of the soldiers and are most deserving of the scholarship. What is particularly exciting is that they all have innovative plans to make a difference for Māori,” says Ms Parata.

Applications for the next round of the Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship opens on 1 July 2015 and close in September.
