Statistics Minister Craig Foss says a new online resource can help small businesses succeed by identifying their customers, markets and competition.

Statistics New Zealand has launched a new section on its website dedicated to small businesses.

“Statistics NZ and the data it provides is a valuable resource for the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in New Zealand,” Mr Foss says.

“Since becoming the Minister of Statistics and the Minister for Small Business, I’ve been very interested in finding out what information is available to assist small business, how easy it is to access and whether it’s presented in a useful way.

“Digging down into data is one of the easiest and most efficient ways for a business to identify customers and gain insights into what they really need or want.

“I encourage anyone looking to start a business or grow their existing one to visit the Statistics NZ website or contact the information centre.”
