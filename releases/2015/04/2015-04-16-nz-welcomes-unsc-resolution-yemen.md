Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the United Nations Security Council’s resolution on Yemen and called for the resumption of political dialogue between all parties involved in the conflict.

“We are deeply concerned by the situation in Yemen and the impact the conflict is having on civilians,” Mr McCully says.

“Without political dialogue, and the Houthis returning to the negotiating table, the crisis in Yemen will only continue to deepen.

“New Zealand recognises the legitimacy of President Hadi’s government and the interests of Yemen’s neighbours in maintaining regional security.

“Through our role on the United Nations Security Council we have supported a resolution put forward by the Gulf Cooperation Council which urges all parties to facilitate the delivery of aid, and calls for a return to talks.

“We commend the leadership shown by Jordan, as the current president of the Security Council, in passing this resolution.

“New Zealand will continue working with other Security Council members to find a political solution to the situation in Yemen and ensure the plight of civilians is addressed,” Mr McCully says.
