Transport Minister Simon Bridges joined the Prime Minister today in turning the first sod for Christchurch’s $112 million gateway roading project that will provide better, safer links throughout greater Christchurch.

The expansion of the Western Corridor (State Highway 1) to four lanes is one of the Government’s Roads of National Significance projects (RoNS) for Christchurch and is critical for the economic growth and prosperity of not only the city but also the South Island.

The Russley Road section, from Harewood Road to Avonhead Park, is the second to last section of the Western Corridor to be built. As well as the highway expansion, it will also include construction of a major interchange at the Russley Road/Memorial Avenue intersection (ranked the second highest high-risk intersection in the country), as well as the construction of a gateway bridge for the city.

“The Government is investing more than $900 million in building the Christchurch RoNS to help reduce congestion, improve safety, productivity and travel times and reduce vehicle operating costs. This programme is also supporting the Christchurch rebuild by helping to more effectively and efficiently move goods and services, as well as people.”

When completed in 2018, the Western Corridor will connect Belfast in the north and Hornby in the south, providing better access between the Christchurch International Airport and commercial and industrial hubs.

“Traffic volumes continue to increase along the Western Corridor, which are only expected to get worse with the increasing population and ongoing changes in post-earthquake travel patterns.

“The upgrade to four-lanes will not only improve travel times and reliability but will also improve cyclist and pedestrian facilities with the signalised Memorial Avenue intersection and a shared cyclist/pedestrian subway under the Harewood Road roundabout. Provision has been made in the design to accommodate any future public transport options through to the central city.”

Mr Bridges says the gateway bridge not only improves safety by separating highway and local road traffic, but also welcomes visitors to Christchurch and those returning home.
