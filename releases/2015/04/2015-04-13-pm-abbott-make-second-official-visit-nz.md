Prime Minister John Key today announced Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s second official visit to New Zealand.  

Prime Minister Abbott and his accompanying delegation will arrive in Wellington on Sunday night to take part in the Anzac centenary commemorations.

“It is great to be able to welcome Prime Minister Abbott back to New Zealand so soon after his first visit in February for the Australia-New Zealand leaders’ talks,” says Mr Key. 

“During this visit Prime Minister Abbott and I will participate in the dedication ceremony of the Australian Memorial in the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington. 

“The Park was designed and built to acknowledge the centenary of the First World War, and is a place where people can commemorate and reflect on our history and partnership with countries such as Australia.

“The Australian Memorial is positioned right in the heart of the park, befitting of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations,” says Mr Key.   

Veterans Affairs Minister, Senator Michael Ronaldson, is also scheduled to attend the dedication ceremony of the Australian Memorial on Monday 20 April, alongside other New Zealand Ministers and invited guests.

Following the dedication ceremony, the Prime Ministers will visit Te Papa to view the *Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War* exhibition, created by Sir Richard Taylor.
