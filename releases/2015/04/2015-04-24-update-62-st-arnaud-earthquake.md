GeoNet recorded a 6.2 earthquake located 35km south-east of St Arnaud, at a depth of 52km, just after 3.30pm today.

“The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM) is making contact with a number of local authorities, as the earthquake was felt in various parts of New Zealand, to determine if there have been any injuries or damage,” says Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye.

“At this stage, I am advised that MCDEM hasn’t received any reports of major injuries or damage.

“I’m also advised that there are difficulties making contact with some areas, because of communication network issues.

“MCDEM officials will continue to work to get information from local authorities and other agencies.

“We will advise if there is any significant change to the situation.

“There are already aftershocks occurring, so it’s important that people know the right actions to take during an earthquake, which is to drop, cover and hold.

“If you are driving, pull over to a clear place, stop and stay there with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.  Once the shaking stops, proceed with caution and avoid bridges or ramps that might have been damaged.”
