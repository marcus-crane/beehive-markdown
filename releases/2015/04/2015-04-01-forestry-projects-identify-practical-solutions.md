New Zealand’s forestry sector will benefit from five new projects in the latest round of the Sustainable Farming Fund (SFF), Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

“Around $1.2 million has been committed over four financial years towards five new SFF projects involving the forestry sector,” Ms Goodhew says.  “SFF continues to be a great example of government supporting foresters to ensure the sustainability of our primary industries.”

The forestry projects are part of the 29 new SFF projects announced today—following the 2015/16 SFF funding round held last year.

“One project will provide higher quality wood for the production of laminated veneer lumber by screening young Eucalyptus trees,” Mrs Goodhew says. “These sorts of engineered timber developments could open up additional export opportunities.

“Collaboration is vital for identifying opportunities and practical solutions to challenges the forestry industry faces. I encourage the forestry sector to keep bringing new ideas to the table.”

The Ministry for Primary Industries will be opening the next SFF funding round in mid-2015, inviting new ideas for future SFF projects.
