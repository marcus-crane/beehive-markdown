Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga will hold a nationwide series of evening community forums, beginning in Taupo tonight.

"The forums will give us opportunities to discuss the issues and challenges facing our ethnic communities," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"We will also focus on how we can help New Zealand move forward together economically, socially and culturally by working closely to inform government policy and practice.

"I want the forums to be a productive discussion on what we each want to achieve and any perceived barriers to us getting there," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand is seeing the benefits of ethnic diversity, not just economically but culturally as well. Our diversity continues to grow every year and ethnic communities are becoming more established and enriching our cultural landscape.

"I am looking forward to engaging with our growing ethnic groups of different cultures and faiths."

As well as the Taupo forum, over the next three months there will be forums in greater Auckland, Northland, Hamilton, greater Wellington, Christchurch, Invercargill, Palmerston North and New Plymouth.
