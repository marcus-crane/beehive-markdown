Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the latest benefit figures show a further year-on-year decline as the New Zealand economy improves and welfare reforms continue to support families.

There were 284,260 people on benefit at the end of the March 2015 quarter, a drop of 11,060, or 3.7 per cent, compared to a year ago. The figures are the lowest since March 2009.

“These numbers are extremely positive, and they continue the downward trend of the number of people on welfare,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The figures released today are especially heartening with the decline coming as the working age population has increased.

“Over 5,000 (4.1 per cent) fewer people are on Jobseeker Support than at the same time last year, with sizeable reductions in Canterbury (13.3 per cent) and Auckland (8.4 per cent).

“Meanwhile Sole Parent Support numbers are down 5,471 (7.2 per cent) nationally. Each region recorded a drop, with the strongest reductions in Canterbury (8.6 per cent), Auckland (8.1 per cent) and East Coast (7.3 per cent).  

“Getting off a benefit and into employment or study reduces long-term welfare dependency. It allows individuals and families to thrive, and is also good news for taxpayers.” 

Year-on-year benefit number comparisons give a truer overall picture of trends, as quarterly data is subject to seasonal influences such as people going on and off Jobseeker Support – Student Hardship. There were 24,885 fewer people on benefit compared to the December quarter.
