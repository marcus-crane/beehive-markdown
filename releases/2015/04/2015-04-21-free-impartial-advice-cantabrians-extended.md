Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says the continued funding of the Residential Advisory Service (RAS) means more Cantabrians will be able to access free, impartial advice on getting their home repaired or rebuilt.

RAS, funded by the Earthquake Commission, members of the Insurance Council of New Zealand and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, has received an additional $1.2 million to keep the service running for another year.

“The service has been extremely popular since its launch in May 2013 with more than 2200 cases logged of which 1600 have been successfully progressed or resolved,” Ms Wagner says.

“RAS links residents with the right people for their particular issue and ensures they are given specific guidance by independent advisors.

“New resources have also been added to the service such as the technical panel which can offer a second opinion on existing repair plans and documents. This means the service can either provide reassurance that repair plans are technically sound or highlight any concerns.

“Cases dealt with by the service can be complex, however satisfaction levels remain high with over 90 per cent of users reporting they felt listened to and understood, with 77 per cent of people saying they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the service.

“I encourage anyone who is still facing challenges with their rebuild or repairs to make use of the free and independent advice that is available,” Ms Wagner says.
