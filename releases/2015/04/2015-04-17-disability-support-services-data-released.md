Data released today about the use of Ministry of Health-funded disability support services will help ensure that disabled New Zealanders are receiving the best services, says Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

The demographic data, which has been made publically available for the first time, gives detailed information about the age, ethnicity, marital status, accommodation, deprivation levels and disability types of people using ministry-funded disability support services.

The data will put disabled people at the centre of decision-making, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The ministry’s strategic plan for disability support services highlights the importance of keeping disabled people at the forefront of everything the ministry does and ensuring the voices of disabled people are heard,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The release of this data is part of wider moves to make information more transparent and to enable more conversations within the disability sector. It will help the ministry when making decisions on disability support services. It will also help providers understand national and regional trends and inform their planning and service development.”

Disabilities Issues Minister Nicky Wagner says good data about disability is essential.

“The more we understand about disabled people and the support they need, the more we can do to enable them to live normal lives.

“This demographic report is a welcome addition to the information on disabled people collected in the 2013 Disability Survey,” Ms Wagner says.

The report is available on the Ministry of Health website [www.moh.govt.nz](http://www.moh.govt.nz).
