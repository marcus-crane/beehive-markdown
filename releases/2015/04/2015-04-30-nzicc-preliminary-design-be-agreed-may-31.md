The Crown and SkyCity have agreed to a May 31 deadline for a revised NZICC Preliminary Design, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

SkyCity submitted a Preliminary Design in October 2014 for approval by the Crown.  However the total construction cost exceeded those costs as set out in the NZICC Agreement.

“The Crown and SkyCity have been making good progress discussing a revised Preliminary Design,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is a large and complex project. There are some matters that need resolution before the revised proposal is submitted for approval by Ministers and the SkyCity Board.

“Both parties have agreed to work to reach agreement before May 31.”
