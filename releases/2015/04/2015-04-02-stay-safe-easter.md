No matter what you get up to over the Easter break, you can help keep yourself and your loved ones safe on the road, water and around trains by following a few simple steps, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“The Easter holiday is the last long weekend for a while.  Many people will be travelling on our roads and boaties may be heading out on the water one last time before winter settles in,” Mr Foss says.

“Taking the time to get the safety basics right will help ensure everyone has a safe and accident-free Easter break.”

On the road:

- Drive refreshed and sober
- Stick within the speed limit and be considerate to others
- Check your vehicle and tyres and drive to the conditions
- Wear a safety belt, and make sure children are appropriately buckled in

On the water:

- Autumn weather can be unpredictable, so make sure you check the weather forecast before you head out
- Take at least two forms of reliable, waterproof communication with you
- Make sure you have the right number of properly fitting lifejackets on board and encourage everyone, particularly children, to wear one

Around trains:

- Tracks are for trains — keep well away from the tracks and only cross at official level crossings
- Don’t walk along the tracks or take short cuts over them — trains can be quiet and often travel faster than you think
- On foot or in a vehicle, always obey the warning signs and look carefully in both directions for trains.  Don’t forget if there are two tracks there could be two trains

The official Easter holiday period begins at 4pm today and ends at 6am on Tuesday 7 April.
