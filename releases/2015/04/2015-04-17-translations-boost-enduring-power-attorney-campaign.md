Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry has launched a new range of multilingual resources to help New Zealanders protect their future with an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA).

Two pamphlets which explain how to set up an EPA have been translated into nine different languages and are now available for free online.

“An EPA is an important safeguard for all Kiwis to think about putting in place, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or where you live,” Ms Barry says. “It’s important to make information about EPAs accessible to as many people as possible.”

Ms Barry says everyone should consider setting up an EPA.

“Unfortunately any of us could lose the ability to make decisions for ourselves at any time through illness or injury. Having an EPA in place means someone we trust will be legally able to make decisions about our property, care or welfare.”

The translations are available in Māori, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Korean, Samoan, Tongan, simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese. They are part of the Office for Senior Citizens *Protect Your Future* campaign launched in June 2014.

“The year-long campaign has successfully created clear and straightforward information about the importance of EPAs, as well as advice for attorneys on their responsibilities,” Ms Barry says.

“I’m very pleased this information is now available to more communities through these translations.”

The pamphlets are available now at [www.msd.govt.nz/EPA](http://www.msd.govt.nz/EPA).
