ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today launched a new set of guidelines to reduce the risk of injuries to home carers.

Speaking at the Home and Community Health Association (HCHA) conference in Auckland, Ms Kaye said the aim of the guidelines, *Supporting people to move at home – Practical tips and techniques for carer and support workers*, is to reduce injuries that happen when moving and lifting people.

“Carers will often go the extra mile to assist their clients, who are often family members, but this can end up compromising their own health.

“Some of the injuries that ACC sees include lower back and shoulder injuries.

“We’re keen to help home carers work in a safer environment and have fewer injuries in their day-to-day work.”

ACC worked closely with the HCHA and Carers New Zealand to develop the guidelines.

“This is the result of a collaborative effort by carers and government agencies, to help educate people and reduce injuries.

“Around half a million people provide home care in New Zealand, and we recognise the important role they play.

“Having home care workers who are injury-free will help both them and the people they care for.”

ACC will promote the guidelines via various channels, including a series of roadshows beginning next month.
