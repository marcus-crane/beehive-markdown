Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says a meeting with Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Hon Peter Dutton, in Canberra has further strengthened the valuable relationship between New Zealand Customs and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS).

“Our two countries share the same desire to keep our borders safe while making legitimate travel and trade as easy as possible,” Ms Wagner says.

“We discussed items of mutual interest and the importance of trans-Tasman collaboration to effective border management.

“We share a desire to further develop the relationship between the two customs organisations and continue to work together in areas such as illicit drug smuggling and combating criminal activity.

“Today’s meeting reinforced our commitment to working together to enhance border security in both countries,” Ms Wagner says.
