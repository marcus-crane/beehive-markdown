Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Paul Goldsmith will travel to Paris tomorrow for meetings at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 

“Meeting experts at the OECD will be an excellent opportunity to share what the Government has been doing to help cut compliance costs and make it easier for businesses to increase productivity and innovate,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“I am eager to hear what other countries have put in place to ensure their economies are competitive and productive, and I will be looking to find out how other regulators are keeping pace with technological innovation.

“While in Europe I will visit counterparts in the Dutch government in The Hague where I will discuss their approach to regulatory reform.”

Minister Goldsmith will also attend and speak at the Global Cyberspace Conference in The Hague.

He will also visit Brussels where he will attend a number of European Union meetings focusing comparative examples of competition promotion, consumer choice and protection.

“My focus will be on developing a deeper understanding of international best practice with the New Zealand context in mind.

"I’m committed to making sure we have the best regulatory regime in place where consumers have confidence and choice, and businesses have ability compete without the handbrake of unnecessary regulation,” says Mr Goldsmith. 

Mr Goldsmith departs New Zealand on Saturday 11 April and returns on 22 April.
