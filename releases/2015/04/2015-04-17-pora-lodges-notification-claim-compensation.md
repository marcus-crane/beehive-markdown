Justice Minister Amy Adams has received a letter from the lawyers for Teina Pora formally notifying her of a claim for compensation for “wrongful conviction and imprisonment”.

Mr Pora spent over 21 years in prison for the rape and murder of Susan Burdett, before his conviction was quashed by the Privy Council in March 2015. The Privy Council did not order a retrial.

Ms Adams said that as no retrial was ordered by the Privy Council, Mr Pora's application will be treated as being within Cabinet Guidelines. 

"Now that Mr Pora’s application has been received, I will be seeking preliminary advice from my Justice officials on the next steps,” says Ms Adams.

“Officials will assess whether the claim merits further consideration and, if so, provide me with advice on appointing a QC or retired judge to determine whether the applicant can prove they are innocent on the balance of probabilities.

“With that process underway, it’s not appropriate for me to make further comment."
