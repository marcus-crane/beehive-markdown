Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye say a new trades centre at the Southern Cross Campus in Mangere opened today by Prime Minister John Key will provide further options for young New Zealanders.

Ms Parata says the $3.5 million investment in the Trades Academy will enable Southern Cross to provide courses on construction, plumbing, automotive engineering and robotics on site. 

“This is a hugely valuable centre that will provide high-tech practical learning opportunities for students at Southern Cross Campus through their Trades Academy programme.

“It means students will remain engaged and achieve at school, while gaining practical experience in work-related areas.

“The experiences Trades Academy students gain will help them make positive steps into further study or employment,” says Ms Parata.

Ms Kaye says the establishment of the Trades Academy is Stage One of the major redevelopment of the Southern Cross Campus and when Stage Two is complete, the campus will have a new library, multi-purpose centre and teaching spaces.

“Around $27m has been made available to the Southern Cross Campus for the Stage One and Stage Two projects. The Stage Two project will provide the campus with a positive learning environment fit for the 21st century, which will enable the Trades Academy students to learn in the most engaging and effective way,” she says.

The Southern Cross Trades Academy was established in 2011. In 2015, it involves around 100 students and receives funding of $1.020 million in support of this programme.

The Trades Academy has helped boost student achievement.  In 2013, 80 per cent of students completing the Southern Cross Campus Trades Academy programme had achieved NCEA Level 2.
