Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today that work has begun on a $6.3 million property upgrade at Mahurangi College in Warkworth, North Auckland.

“I visited Mahurangi College today to see the work that is now underway.

“The college has experienced weather-tightness issues with a number of buildings, and it’s pleasing to see this being addressed.

“The current project includes repairing the college’s water-damaged junior block and library, and rebuilding the arts block.

“Last year the science block was repaired and repairs to the student centre are also being looked at.

“As with any major property upgrade, the work at Mahurangi College will see fresh, modern spaces created where students can learn in comfort.

“This is not just about fixing leaky buildings, it’s also about providing students with an environment that excites and inspires them to learn and achieve.

“The upgrade will also help the college manage increased rolls.

“Auckland’s population is growing all the time, so it’s important that local schools have the capacity to meet this.”

The current work at Mahurangi College is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
