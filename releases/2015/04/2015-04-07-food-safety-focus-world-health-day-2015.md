Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed news that *food safety* is the focus of World Health Day today.

“April 7 is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) main annual advocacy event,” Mrs Goodhew says. “The choice of *food safety* as this year’s theme reflects the increasing consumer awareness globally of food safety. 

“New Zealand prides ourselves as a producer of safe, high quality food for those of us here at home and our international customers overseas. To maintain this reputation, and to keep ahead of the game, we need to continually evolve and adapt our food safety systems.

“The Food Safety Law Reform Bill which I hope to introduce this year, and the Food Act 2014 which will come into force next year, will ensure our food safety legislation is the best designed and most forward looking.

“Today is also a reminder of the equal importance of food safety systems and food safety culture. Systems can be in place, but people drive the culture. We need to know those working in the industry understand their role in protecting our food safety reputation.”

As well as ensuring our food safety systems are world leading, New Zealand is also placing greater emphasis on quick detection of emerging food safety risks. This involves working with agencies including the International Food Safety Authorities Network administered by WHO.
