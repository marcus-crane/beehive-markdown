Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed news that an agreement has been reached which lays out parameters for a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme.

“The announcement from the P5+1 (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) and Iran is a significant development, which opens the way for a comprehensive agreement,” Mr McCully says.

“A final agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme will have a positive impact on regional stability in the Middle East, and give scope for the further expansion of New Zealand’s relations with Iran.

“New Zealand fully supports the P5+1 process, and commends the leadership being shown by all parties at this latest round of talks.

“While the negotiations are complex, the agreement which has been reached in Lausanne provides a roadmap through and demonstrates the goodwill on all sides. We hope this momentum can now be converted into comprehensive agreement by the 30 June,” Mr McCully says.
