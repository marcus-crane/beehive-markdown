The Crown has signed a deed of settlement for all outstanding historical Treaty claims with Hineuru at Parliament, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Hineuru is an iwi based northwest of Napier in the Hawke’s Bay region. Hineuru’s historical claims relate primarily to war and raupatu, the operation of the native land laws, Crown land purchasing and virtual landlessness and its impacts.

“We can never fully compensate for these past wrongs,” Mr Finlayson said. “However, this settlement will enable the people of Hineuru to look forward to a stronger future.”

The settlement includes financial and commercial redress of $25 million as well as cultural redress to recognise the traditional, historical, cultural and spiritual associations of Hineuru. This will allow Hineuru and the Crown to protect and enhance the conservation values associated with culturally significant sites. 

“Signing this deed of settlement with Hineuru is an important step towards settling all historical grievances in the Bay of Plenty and New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement will be given effect through legislation.

A copy of the deed of settlement is available on the website of the Office of Treaty Settlements, [www.ots.govt.nz](http://www.ots.govt.nz).
