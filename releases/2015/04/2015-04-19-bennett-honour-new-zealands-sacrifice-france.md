State Services Minister Paula Bennett leaves today to represent the Government at World War One commemorations being held at sites significant to New Zealand on the Western Front in France.

“Our two nations share a special bond because of the immense sacrifice our troops made so far from their home and loved ones,” says Mrs Bennett.

“It’s an honour to make this journey and pay tribute to the memories of the brave men and women who gave their lives for their nation.”

Ceremonies are being held in France at Longueval, near to where New Zealand joined the Battle of the Somme, Caterpillar Valley, from where the remains of the Unknown Soldier were removed from in 2004 to be reburied at the National War Memorial in Wellington, and Le Quesnoy, marking the site of New Zealand’s last major action just a week before the end of World War One.

Mrs Bennett will also travel to London and Edinburgh to attend a number of state sector, housing, and local government meetings.
