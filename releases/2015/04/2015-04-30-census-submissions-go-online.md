Statistics Minister Craig Foss says a new online discussion forum is a great way for New Zealanders to help shape the 2018 census.

“This is the first time Statistics NZ has done this type of online consultation,” Mr Foss says.

“For about 150 years, the census was primarily about people going door to door delivering paper forms. We want to turn that around in 2018, with at least 70 per cent of New Zealanders completing their census online.

“The census is a valuable resource that, in order to stay relevant, needs to keep pace with the 21st century.

“The online discussion forum is part of a larger programme to modernise the census by making it easier to complete and utilising information that’s already available.

“Delivering better online services is a key focus of the Government’s Better Public Services programme.

“Statistics NZ needs to compare information over time so many of the census questions will stay the same; however, there is scope for change.”

Online consultation is open until 10 June at [www.stats.govt.nz](http://www.stats.govt.nz). Formal submissions can also be made at [www.stats.govt.nz](http://www.stats.govt.nz) from 18 May until 30 June.
