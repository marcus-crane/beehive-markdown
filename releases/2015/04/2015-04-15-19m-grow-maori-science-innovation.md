Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell today announced the third annual investment in the Vision Mātauranga Science Fund, which was established to grow skills and capacity in science and innovation and support outcomes that benefit Māori and New Zealand.

“A total of $1.9 million will be invested in 17 new programmes over the next two years,” Mr Joyce says. “This is in addition to the $2.4 million invested in 2013 and $1.8 million in 2014.

“The Fund aims to strengthen connections between Māori and the science and innovation system, and is one of the Government’s mechanisms to support Māori economic development.

“It is designed to help develop Māori researchers and the links between Māori and research institutions.”

The Fund invests in projects that contribute to the development of skilled people and organisations undertaking research that supports the four themes of the Vision Mātauranga policy:

- Indigenous innovation – contributing to economic growth through distinctive science and innovation;
- Taiao/environment – achieving environmental sustainability through iwi and hapu relationships with land and sea;
- Hauora/health – improving health and social wellbeing; and
- Mātauranga – exploring indigenous knowledge and science and innovation.

“This is an important initiative in ensuring strong linkages between iwi, Māori organisations, and the wider science community,” Mr Flavell says. “It lines up well with our Māori Economic Development Strategy *He kai kei aku ringa*, which provides a blueprint for a productive, innovative, and export-oriented Māori economy.

“Iwi play an increasingly active role in New Zealand’s economy and in the management of natural resources. Unlocking the science and innovation potential of Māori knowledge, resources and people will have major economic, social and environmental benefits for New Zealand.”

The contracts will run for up to two years. More information is available at: [http://www.msi.govt.nz/get-funded/research-organisations/vision-matauranga-capability-fund/](http://www.msi.govt.nz/get-funded/research-organisations/vision-matauranga-capability-fund/)
