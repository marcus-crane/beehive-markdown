Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened the new $24.9 million mental health inpatient unit, He Puna Wâiora, in Auckland.

“The Government is committed to investing in world-class mental health facilities,” says Dr Coleman. 

“The old Taharoto Mental Health Unit in the North Shore had 35 acute beds in a 1950's ex-maternity building which was not fit for purpose.

“He Puna Wâiora means the pool of wellness, and this new purpose-built facility will better support both patients and staff.

“It will initially provide 35 beds, and has the capacity to grow over time to meet the future needs of the local community. By 2031 the service could deliver up to 63 acute beds – with 46 inpatient beds and up to 12 additional community care acute beds on top of the five already open.

“Acute beds in the community can improve the experience of care – with services provided closer to home, and more options for family involvement.”

The Government has contributed $17.3 million to the $24.9 million project.

He Puna Wâiora has improved safety and security features, and its location close to North Shore Hospital supports the treatment of patients with a range of complex health conditions. Patients will move into the new facility in May.

The new unit complements Waitemata DHB’s inpatient unit at Waitakere Hospital. It is part of the DHB’s ongoing capital upgrade programme which includes a new secure forensic unit at the Mason Clinic, Point Chevalier. 

The Government has increased funding for mental health and addiction services from $1.1 billion in 2008/2009 to over $1.3 billion in 2013/14.
