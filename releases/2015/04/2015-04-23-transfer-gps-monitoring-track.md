Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today visited the centre from which offenders and defendants who are subject to electronic sentences and bail are monitored.

Some 1,960 offenders and defendants are now electronically monitored by new provider 3M, 1,299 via global positioning system (GPS) and 661 via radio frequency (RF). This is more than 50 per cent of those who need to be transitioned to the new system.

“Corrections, through its contract with 3M, is delivering a state of the art electronic monitoring system that is more reliable and less vulnerable to tampering than the previous system,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The monitoring centre is an impressive facility with dedicated New Zealand-based staff. It is their job to ensure all our GPS offenders and defendants across the country are monitored for compliance with release/bail conditions.”

This contract will save the department about $18 million over five years, bringing together for the first time all electronic monitoring under one provider.

GPS provides more information to assist with offender management than the previously used RF technology. RF will be used only where GPS cannot be or is not appropriate.

So far seven probation districts have transitioned to 3M monitoring and it is anticipated that by 1 June this year, all districts will have moved onto the new system. The transition is on track to be completed on time.

Corrections staff have been trained to use the system and are finding it an effective way of monitoring offenders.
