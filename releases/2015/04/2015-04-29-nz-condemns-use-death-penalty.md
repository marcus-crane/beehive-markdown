Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand is dismayed by Indonesia’s decision to carry out the execution of members of the ‘Bali 9’ and other prisoners.

“New Zealand is strongly opposed to the death penalty in all cases, and under all circumstances,” Mr McCully says.

“We have expressed our opposition to the death penalty to Indonesia and I made this clear when I met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister recently.

“While we respect Indonesia’s right to set and apply its own laws, and understand the immense harm the country suffers from drug trafficking, we are dismayed that these executions have proceeded in the face of continued appeals from some of Indonesia’s closest friends.

“In recent years Indonesia has won considerable respect for consolidating democratic institutions and improving human rights. The executions are a serious setback to that progress,” Mr McCully says.
