Education Minister Hekia Parata today participated in a ceremony to mark the next phase of construction at the new Marshland School in northeastern Christchurch.

The full primary school (Years 1-8) is presently located at 329 Prestons Road, Marshland, but is being relocated to 381 Prestons Road to enable it to better cater for current and projected roll growth in the semi-rural area.

Ms Parata says the project is another sign of the Government’s commitment to rebuilding greater Christchurch’s education network. 

“Christchurch has been through some incredibly tough times, but is on track to have one of the most up-to-date schooling networks in the world in a few years. Already I am hearing that teachers are excited by the new opportunities and challenges that are springing from the rebuild and kids, and their parents, are excited by the new, modern learning spaces that are being created.”

The $15.7 million being spent on Marshland is part of the $1.137 billion the Government has committed to spend rebuilding and repairing Christchurch’s schools over a 10 year period.

Marshland presently has a roll of about 240 students that is predicted to rise to 285 or higher by the end of the year due to the fast tracking of new subdivisions in the area.  The completed school will have a capacity for 400 students and be capable of expanding to accommodate 650.

The school is also going to be the host for a satellite unit for the Ferndale Special School.
