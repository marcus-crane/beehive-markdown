Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced the five providers appointed to a new All-of-Government (AoG) panel for risk financing and insurance intermediary (brokerage) services.

The providers selected following a competitive tender process late last year are Aon New Zealand Ltd, Crombie Lockwood (NZ) Limited (an Arthur J. Gallagher Company), Jardine Lloyd Thompson (JLT) Ltd, Marsh Limited and Willis New Zealand Ltd.

“These providers have demonstrated the necessary capacity, capability and expertise to deliver world-class brokerage and insurance intermediary services and solutions to government agencies,” Mr Joyce says.

“Government agencies spend a significant amount on risk financing and insurance each year. This new panel will ensure a more co-ordinated approach is taken to the way the Government purchases these services, and will help ensure resilience in the event of unanticipated, large-scale events such as natural disasters.”

“In the event of a natural disaster like an earthquake, for example, the new solutions delivered by these providers will enable government agencies to respond and recover more quickly, because agencies will be better prepared and co-ordinated in terms of the funding mechanisms that will apply.”

The panel will bring better oversight of risk, risk management and risk financing, and create consistent best-practice approach, Mr Joyce says. Contracts will commence this year.

AoG contracts have achieved significant benefits since their establishment, and participation by government agencies continues to grow with more than 750 agencies participating in at least one contract. 

By the end of 2014, $196 million of savings had been achieved.  Total forecast savings over the life of all AoG contracts is currently $415.1 million.
