Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today announced that applications are being sought for grants from the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Fund.

“New Zealand Sign Language is incredibly valuable for the more than 20,000 New Zealanders who use it to communicate with their loved ones,” Ms Wagner says.

“These include the deaf community, non-verbal people and their families and friends.

“The NZSL Fund has been established to support projects that enable the Deaf community and NZSL users to promote and maintain the Language.

“New Zealand Sign Language is one of our three official languages, along with English and Te Reo Māori, and I encourage New Zealanders to share their ideas about how to promote the Language for future generations,” Ms Wagner says.

Applications close on 26 May, and decisions will be notified to applicants in June. There is $900,000 available for projects this year.
