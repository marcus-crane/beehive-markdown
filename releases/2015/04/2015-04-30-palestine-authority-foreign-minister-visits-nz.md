Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian National Authority Dr Riyad al-Malki to New Zealand.

“New Zealand is committed to using our role on the United Nations Security Council to inject new momentum into negotiations on the Middle East Peace Process,” Mr McCully says.

“We have been clear in our view that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories is not sustainable, and our friendships with Israel and Palestine demand we play a part in helping to find a solution.

“Dr al-Malki’s visit is an opportunity to hear first-hand how New Zealand can help the Security Council engage more fully in the peace process and support the efforts already underway to stabilise the region,” Mr McCully says.

Foreign Minister al-Malki will arrive in New Zealand this evening and will depart on 2 May. This is his second visit to New Zealand.
