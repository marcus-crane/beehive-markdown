Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced New Zealand has been chosen as the preferred destination to host secondary school students from Chile on the Chilean Government’s scholarship scheme ‘Penguins Without Borders’.

In July approximately 80 students will be welcomed to at least 40 schools in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland.

The group will be the fourth to study in New Zealand through the scholarship programme, which aims to expand the international outlook of young Chilean students and improve their English language skills.

Known as ‘Penguins’ because of their distinctive black and white uniforms, 237 Chilean students have studied in New Zealand since the programme began in 2013.

“Being selected as the primary host country for these scholarship students is testament to New Zealand’s strengthening education relationship with Chile and the great experiences past international students have had in our country.”

“The Penguins Without Borders scheme has enabled some of Chile’s best and brightest students to experience New Zealand’s outstanding education system and the hospitality of our welcoming homestay families.

“I am delighted more students will experience Kiwi life, and that more New Zealanders will learn about Chile by hosting a student or studying alongside the Penguins,” Mr Joyce says.

“International students make a significant social, cultural and economic contribution to New Zealand while they’re here and remain connected as ambassadors for New Zealand when they return home.”

The announcement comes during Mr Joyce’s first visit to Chile and the Latin America region.

Mr Joyce is leading a delegation of university representatives to the region to deepen education and trade links.
