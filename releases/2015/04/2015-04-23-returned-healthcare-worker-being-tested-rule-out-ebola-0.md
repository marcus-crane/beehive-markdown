Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a second healthcare worker recently returned from the international response to Ebola in West Africa is to be tested to rule out the virus.

“The patient has recently been in Sierra Leone as part of New Zealand’s contribution to the international response to Ebola,” says Dr Coleman.

“Since returning home to New Zealand, the patient has developed minor symptoms that require the Ebola virus to be ruled out. Test results will be available in 24 to 48 hours.

“The only person who has been in contact with the patient during the potentially infectious period has been the patient’s partner. The partner is being monitored according to international protocols.

“New Zealand is well placed to respond to a patient who needs to be tested to rule out the Ebola virus. This was demonstrated last month when a separate returning healthcare worker was tested to rule out Ebola.

“While we wait for the test results I encourage the media to respect the patient’s privacy.”

Summary of events to date:

- The patient left Sierra Leone on 15 April where they began self-monitoring.
- After experiencing minor symptoms the patient reported to the local Public Health Officer yesterday - as part of their daily self-monitoring.
- The patient was monitored overnight at home and has been airlifted to Wellington Hospital where they are being cared for in one of New Zealand’s four speciality isolation facilities.
- Blood samples will be sent to a high security reference laboratory in Melbourne. It is expected to be 24-48 hours before a result is known.

<!--THE END-->

- The patient’s partner is now self-monitoring as a precaution.

**Notes to Editors**

Ebola is not easy to catch – transmission requires direct contact with an infected individual and only occurs through contact with blood and other body fluids.

People with Ebola are not infectious until they are displaying symptoms. If the healthcare worker does have Ebola, they will not have been infectious while travelling as the individual was not symptomatic at that time.

Further information on Ebola can be found on the Ministry of Health website: [www.health.govt.nz/ebola](http://www.health.govt.nz/ebola).
