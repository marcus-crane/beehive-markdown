The Prime Minister has kicked off the Gulf trade mission by meeting the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and leading business figures.

“These meetings gave me an opportunity to promote New Zealand business and talk about the benefits of our trade and investment relationship,” Mr Key says

"I also emphasised the potential we see for building even deeper trade and economic links with the Gulf States, including through finalising FTA negotiations and bringing the NZ - GCC FTA into force.”

New Zealand and UAE are committed trading partners and share a strong bilateral relationship which continues to grow.

“I took the opportunity to thank the UAE for supporting New Zealand’s United Nations Security Council Campaign, and reiterated our commitment to engage closely with the UAE on matters of importance to it,” says Mr Key.

The Prime Minister today also opened a New Zealand – Dubai business seminar, in conjunction with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce.

The seminar aims to build understanding of our respective business environments, and explore opportunities for growth and partnership between the two countries.

“The event was an excellent way to help raise the profile of New Zealand companies looking to grow and seek investment in the Gulf and to provide support to New Zealand business engagement.”

A visit to a local Dubai supermarket illustrated the demand for New Zealand goods in UAE, with 78 different products representing twenty Kiwi brands on the shelves.

“Clearly there is a strong and growing market for the high quality products we produce.”

The Prime Minister is leading an 18-strong delegation of New Zealand business people and is accompanied by Trade Minister Tim Groser in the Gulf.
