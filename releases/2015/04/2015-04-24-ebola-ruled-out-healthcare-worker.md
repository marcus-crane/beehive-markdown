Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the second healthcare worker who recently returned from Sierra Leone and required testing to rule out Ebola has tested negative for the virus.

“Laboratory testing and clinical assessment has confirmed that the patient does not have Ebola,” says Dr Coleman. “The patient does not meet the clinical criteria for a second test to be required.”

“The patient’s condition has since improved and they have been discharged from Wellington Hospital.

“The individual will continue to self-monitor for the remainder of the 21-day period, as required for healthcare workers returning from assisting in the Ebola response in West Africa.

“I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the patient and their family, who carefully followed the protocols for returning health workers. I would also like to recognise the collective efforts of the many health workers involved.

“New Zealand is well placed to respond to this situation, and this was demonstrated last month when a separate returning healthcare worker was tested to rule out Ebola. It is pleasing to see all the preparation paid off.”
