Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges will be promoting New Zealand’s world-leading renewable energy expertise at an international conference in Melbourne this week.

Along with Australia, New Zealand is co-hosting the 2015 World Geothermal Congress where Mr Bridges will deliver the keynote address.

“As the world transitions towards a lower carbon future, the increased demand for renewable energy, coupled with the ongoing interest in energy security, has focused attention on geothermal energy.

“Geothermal is undergoing something of a renaissance globally at the moment with worldwide installed capacity forecast to double this decade”, he says.

New Zealand has a long and successful history in the development of geothermal resources, with the first plant established still providing a reliable electricity source over 50 years later.

“We are now the fourth largest geothermal power generator in the world, after the United States, the Philippines and Indonesia.

“Our years of experience and our very significant recent expansion have resulted in world-class geothermal expertise.  

“Over $2 billion has been invested in geothermal capacity in the six years to 2014 in New Zealand, doubling what we had so that it’s now our second most important electricity source after hydro”, Mr Bridges says.

New Zealand scientists and engineers are already key contributors to many of the world’s major geothermal developments while, through the Auckland-based Geothermal Institute, New Zealand has trained more than 1500 geothermal professionals.

“Together with various New Zealand industry experts and leaders I will be working hard to promote New Zealand’s renewable advantage in geothermal development at the Congress.

“There are real economic opportunities we can leverage”, Mr Bridges says.

Held every five years, the World Geothermal Congress is a unique event that brings together members of the geothermal industry from around the world.
