For the first time trainee teachers are to be offered the opportunity to earn post-graduate qualifications in Māori medium and Early Childhood Education (ECE) teaching, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

From next year up to 85 post-graduate positions will be available for Māori medium teachers and 90 positions for ECE teachers in initial teacher education programmes.

“The extension of post-graduate qualification to Māori medium and ECE teachers is part of our broader strategy to raise student achievement,” says Ms Parata. “We have virtually doubled spending on quality early childhood education since 2008 because of the difference it makes to kids’ prospects. In addition we know that one of the biggest in-school influences on student learning is the quality of teaching.”

The post-graduate diplomas and master’s degrees will be for teachers intending to work in Māori medium schooling, or in early learning in either English, English/Māori medium or full immersion Maori medium settings.

The post-graduate Māori medium courses will be provided by Waikato University and Massey University and Te Wānanga o Raukawa and Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi. The new ECE courses will available at Canterbury University and the Waiariki Institute of Technology.

“These new qualifications will have a positive impact on the quality of new teachers entering the workforce and will raise achievement for our children and young people in early learning and Māori medium settings,” says Ms Parata.

Post-graduate ITE programmes were first offered for English medium teachers in January 2014. There have been 67 graduates to date and a further 265 students began English medium post-graduate ITE programmes this year.
