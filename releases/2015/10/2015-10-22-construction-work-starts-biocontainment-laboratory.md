Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the start of construction work on the new National Biocontainment Laboratory in Upper Hutt today.

“This is an $87 million investment which will play a major role in protecting both our economy and environment.

“The new laboratory will be high security and state of the art. It will continue the critical work of responding to disease outbreaks, protecting public health and providing international trade assurances about New Zealand’s animal disease status.

“Primary sector exports make up around three quarters of our merchandise exports, which is why biosecurity is my number one priority.

“The laboratory will provide diagnostic support for animal pest and disease investigations as well as scientifically credible information confirming New Zealand’s freedom from diseases. This is crucial for consumers and our trading partners, ensuring market access for our exports.

“It will be equipped to current international standards, and have better capacity to deal with a large-scale emergency, in the unlikely event one should occur. “Building the laboratory on this site continues more than 100 years of veterinary diagnostics at this location.”

There are no live animals held at Wallaceville, and no live animal testing is carried out there. This will continue to be the case when the new laboratories are built.

Two existing buildings at the National Centre for Biosecurity and Infectious Disease at Wallaceville have been demolished to clear the site for construction.

The total capital investment in the new laboratory has been revised from the original projected figure of $65 million following the tender process last year. It is expected to be in full operation in 2019.
