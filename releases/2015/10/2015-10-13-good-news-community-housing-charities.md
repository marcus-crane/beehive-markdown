Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is pleased that 99% of the 2,500 charities that provide housing or accommodation, have had their charitable status confirmed.

The He Korowai Trust and twelve Habitat for Humanity charities are the most recent to have their status confirmed by the independent Charities Registration Board. Charities Services has closed its reviews into these charities’ housing activities.

“The process of reviewing charitable housing providers has been rigorous, so charities can feel confident that the law is being applied properly, and that they can continue to access government and taxpayer support, and keep helping people into homes.”

“Charities Services has worked collaboratively with providers, and taken great care to consider relevant information about them to understand how each is working to fulfil its charitable work,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This is so providers can feel confident about either retaining their charitable status, or, if they no longer qualify for charitable status, continuing to access tax exemption and donee status through the other mechanisms that the Government will be putting in place.

The Department of Internal Affairs’ Charities Services is working to complete the remaining reviews as quickly as possible.
