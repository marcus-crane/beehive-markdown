Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says the Environment Aotearoa report released today has given New Zealand a measurable and robust benchmark for environmental performance and conservation goals.

“You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and this report provides us with statistics of ongoing usefulness which will underpin future decision-making,” Ms Barry says.

“Biodiversity is an integral part of the report, which has highlighted the threat introduced predators pose to our native wildlife, as well as the ongoing problem of wilding pines.” Ms Barry says.

“Rats, stoats and possums are present in 94 per cent of New Zealand’s land area, and remain the main cause of population decline in threatened species.”

“DOC works tirelessly alongside key partners to fight back against pests and we know that where native species are able to live in a predator-free environment they not only survive but increase their numbers significantly.”

“The successful Battle For Our Birds, which used aerial drops of 1080 across hard-to-access landscapes, stopped booming numbers of rats and stoats from wiping out whole populations of native bats, snails and birds during the 2014 beech mast and will be reflected in future reports.”

“Our commitment to pest control continues with $11.2 million of new funding to save the kiwi and support for community pest control initiatives, worth $2.13 million this year. The kiwi programme is specifically targeted at achieving a 2 per cent per year increase in wild populations.”

Ongoing work to encourage and support partnerships has also helped to increase the population of vulnerable species and extend pest control.

“The $25 million partnership with Project Janszoon in the Abel Tasman National Park is now in its fourth year and has established one of the largest stoat trapping networks in the country, covering 70 per cent of the park.”

“Another key area of concern confirmed by the report is the impact of introduced weeds and wilding pines. DOC spends around $10 million a year on weed control and we are giving a substantial lift to efforts through the War on Weeds programme.”

“DOC now manages more than 500 different types of ecosystems, more than ever before, and works with more than 400 threatened species, more than at any time previously. This Government remains committed to supporting its work and securing a future for New Zealand’s natural treasures.”
