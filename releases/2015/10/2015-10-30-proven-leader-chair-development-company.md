Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has announced Ross Butler as the establishment chair for a new Crown company that will take over development functions from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority.

Mr Butler’s appointment to the role of the as-yet unnamed company follows the introduction of the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill to Parliament last week, and the release of the Transition Recovery Plan laying out future arrangements for the city.

Christchurch born and educated, Mr Butler has a track record of taking on big challenges.  He is presently the chairman of Southern Response, the Crown company set up to manage the insurance claims of AMI policy holders in the wake of the Canterbury earthquakes.  He also took on the initial chair role for the Code Committee (Financial Advisers Act) in the wake of finance company failures.

Mr Butler is also chairman of Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, Rangitane Holdings Limited and Rangitane Investments Limited, Mercer New Zealand and Mercer Investments Australia Pty Ltd, the Australian arm of New York listed global services group Marsh & McLennan.

“Given Mr Butler’s experience across government and the private sector, I am confident he will successfully guide the next phase for the anchor projects in central Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

“There will be further announcements on the establishment of this new Crown company soon.”

Finance Minister Bill English says it is important, with the Crown contributing more than $16 billion to the greater Christchurch recovery, that the next phase for the city is well led.

“I have every confidence in Ross Butler to provide the best possible start for this new Crown company,” Mr English says.
