Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew is urging students to apply for their 2016 student loans and allowances by 16 December.

“We are expecting over 200,000 applications for the 2016 academic year,” says Mrs Goodhew. “The best way students can make their enrolment as smooth as possible is by applying by the 16 December target date.”

“By applying before 16 December, students will allow enough time for all the steps in the application process to be completed before courses start.”

Mrs Goodhew says current Year 13 students should apply now too.

“They don’t need to have their NCEA results or have locked down all their plans,’ says Mrs Goodhew.

“Their application can be updated as things are confirmed. It’s more important to allow enough time for all the steps in the application process to be completed.”

Students can find out more about applying for a student loan and allowance on the StudyLink website ([www.studylink.govt.nz](http://www.studylink.govt.nz)) and can also track the progress of their application online using their MyStudyLink account.
