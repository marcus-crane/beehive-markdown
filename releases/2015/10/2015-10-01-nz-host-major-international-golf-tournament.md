Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes today’s announcement that New Zealand will host the 2017 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship.

“Congratulations to the Royal Wellington Golf Club for being selected to host one of the major international amateur golf tournaments,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship is a great opportunity for New Zealand. We look forward to 2017 and welcoming the top 120 amateur players from the Asia-Pacific region, including ten New Zealanders. They will help to inspire future generations of amateur golfers.

“The championship, which is the most televised amateur golf tournament in the world, is broadcast to over 160 countries. It will provide fantastic exposure for golf tourism in New Zealand.

“This announcement comes on the back of this year’s FIFA U20 World Cup and the ICC Cricket World Cup which boosted New Zealand’s international reputation for hosting successful major sporting events.”

The annual Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship is one of the largest tournaments of its type in the world, with the winner rewarded with a place at the 2018 Masters Tournament held at the Augusta National Golf Club, and a chance to compete in the Open Championship.

Today’s announcement was made during this year’s championship at the Clearwater Bay Golf & Country Club in Hong Kong.

The Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship will be held in New Zealand from 23 to 27 October 2017 at the Royal Wellington Golf Club’s Heretaunga championship course.
