A study by the Government will look at how creative industries are using copyright and designs rules in a changing technological environment, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Paul Goldsmith says.

“Rapidly evolving technologies are generating new opportunities and challenges in the creative sector,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“The Creative Sector Study will help us deepen our understanding of how the industry currently uses the copyright and design regimes to protect their creative material.

“Our Creative industries generate some world class works. Whether its film and television, music, software or books, the industry contributes to New Zealand’s economic wealth by creating jobs, and making inroads in trade and markets.

“The study will focus on the role of copyright and designs in the creation, production, distribution and consumption of content and other creative works. There may be issues occurring in the market that we need to have a better understanding of before we consider whether our policies need updating.

“The study will result in a series of reports demonstrating how the sector currently uses our copyright and designs regime to create, produce and disseminate creative works. These reports will identify any potential issues that may need future consideration.

“Our Government’s ambitious Business Growth Agenda has set a goal of legislation that enables innovation and growth. We want to make sure that our system encourages new ideas and technologies that benefit our economy, not inadvertently stifle innovation.”

The study is part of the Government’s broader convergence work programme described in *Exploring Digital Convergence Green paper*. Many of the challenges and opportunities of a converged world, where the boundaries between previously separate industries become increasingly blurred, are highly relevant to the creative sector.

“Our creative sector is important to the New Zealand economy. We want to ensure that the sector continues to thrive and makes the most of the opportunities presented in a rapidly changing technological environment.”
