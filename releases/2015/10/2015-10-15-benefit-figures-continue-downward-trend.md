Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the latest benefit numbers across all main benefit groups are down on the same period last year and are the lowest September quarter since 2008.

“At the end of the quarter there were 287,167 people on a main benefit, a drop of 7,154, or 2.4 per cent, compared to last year,” Mrs Tolley says.

The largest drop compared to last year was for those receiving Sole Parent Support, which fell 4,700 or 6.5 per cent.

The number of people on main benefits has increased by 0.6 per cent compared to the previous quarter, as expected due to quietening seasonal work during the winter period.

Despite the slight overall rise there was a 2 per cent drop in the numbers receiving Sole Parent Support.

“It’s pleasing to see the number of sole parents moving off benefits and into employment continue to fall,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Sole Parent Support numbers fell in all regions across the country, with the Auckland, Central and Northland regions seeing drops of 9.3 per cent, 7.4 per cent and 6.8 per cent.

“Moving off a benefit and into work is good for the whole family – it puts more money in the pockets of parents, and breaks the cycle of intergenerational welfare dependence, allowing families to thrive.”
