Finance Minister Bill English leaves for Mexico City tomorrow before carrying on to Lima ahead of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group’s annual meetings in his capacity as a Governor of both institutions. 

The annual meetings bring together finance ministers, central bankers, private sector executives, civil society and academics to assess global economic and financial issues.

“The IMF and World Bank meetings are a valuable opportunity to meet with representatives of a wide range of overseas governments and policy specialists on issues of economic interest to New Zealand,” Mr English says.

“Mexico is a regional economic and political power with an active fiscal reform agenda. It is a key partner in the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group of economies and the Trans Pacific Partnership.

“In Lima I will meet with a number of Finance Ministers and officials – as well as a range of business commentators and investors - to get an update on global economic prospects and risks to New Zealand and its trading partners.”
