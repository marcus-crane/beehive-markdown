Prime Minister John Key today announced that Singapore President Tony Tan will visit New Zealand next week.

President Tan and his delegation arrive on Monday for a series of events including an official welcome at Government House in Wellington hosted by the Governor-General, as well as events in Christchurch.

“Next month marks 50 years of New Zealand and Singapore’s diplomatic relations and I am pleased we will mark this occasion with a visit from Singapore’s Head of State,” Mr Key says.

“We have a close relationship with Singapore, New Zealand’s 7th largest trading partner, buying over $1 billion worth of our goods annually and investing significantly in New Zealand.

“I was fortunate to travel to Singapore in August to celebrate its 50th birthday, and I am pleased that New Zealand will be able to return that hospitality.”

President Tan has been President of Singapore since 2011. This is his first state visit to New Zealand.

President Tan leaves the following Friday.
