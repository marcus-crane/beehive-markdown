The NZ Household Travel Survey is going digital, meaning more data can be collected faster, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Moving the survey online makes it easier and more convenient for participants. It also means it can be expanded — surveying seven days’ travel instead of two,” Mr Foss says.

“The NZ Household Travel Survey, running since 1989, gives transport planners important information about when, where and how Kiwis travel.  It will now be more accurate and more cost-effective.

“Delivering better online services is a key focus of the Government’s Better Public Services programme.”

The Ministry of Transport is using the move online to work more closely with regional councils, initially in Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury. The new survey method allows regional and local councils to buy extra surveying in their area to better understand local travel patterns and needs.

The Ministry will release a publication in late November summarising NZ Household Travel Survey results from the last 25 years.
