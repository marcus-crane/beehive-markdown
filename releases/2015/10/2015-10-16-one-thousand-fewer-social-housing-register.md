The latest Social Housing Register figures show the results of working closely with applicants and supporting their individual needs, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The September 2015 Social Housing Register quarterly figures, released today, has decreased by 1,132 from the September 2014 quarter to 4,467 – a 20% decrease.

“Every person who is on the Social Housing Register or applies to be has a different set of needs to the next, and by working with them as individuals we are ensuring people get the right assistance for their situation,” Mrs Bennett says.

“We have housed more people this quarter, up 152 from September 2014 to 5,028. People are also being housed quicker, with Housing New Zealand’s turnaround time between tenancies reducing by more than two working weeks.”

Close to 300 tenancies are now housed with registered Community Housing Providers, who have been eligible to be housed with the Government’s Income Related Rent Subsidy since April 2014.

“We are supporting more New Zealanders to move along the housing continuum, instead of simply placing them in a state-owned property and leaving them there,” says Mrs Bennett.

“257 tenants have moved into private rental accommodation as a result of the Ministry of Social Development working closely with them through the Tenancy Review process, freeing up more social housing properties for those most in need.

“26 tenants have even purchased their own homes, including a lovely couple on the East Coast who are delighted to be on the property ladder and are renovating the house to put their own stamp on it after renting from Housing New Zealand for seven years.”

The Ministry of Social Development has paid out $602,720 in Housing Support Products, helping 330 applicants with things like bond grants, letting fees, and moving costs.

“I’m thrilled with the uptake of the Housing Support Products because it means people who can afford to sustain a private rental aren’t taking a social housing property that is better suited to a more vulnerable New Zealander,” says Mrs Bennett.
