Prime Minister John Key today announced Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will make an official visit to New Zealand next week.  

Prime Minister Turnbull and delegation will arrive in Auckland on Friday afternoon ahead of his bilateral meeting with Mr Key on Saturday.

“I am delighted to host Prime Minister Turnbull in his first overseas visit as the new Prime Minister of Australia,” says Mr Key.   

“I was in contact with Mr Turnbull while in New York last week and look forward to broadening our discussions and cementing the relationship in New Zealand.”

Mr Turnbull and his wife Lucy Turnbull will join Mr and Mrs Key for a private dinner on Friday evening before the formal programme commences on Saturday.

“Australia is New Zealand’s closest bilateral partner and we look forward to continuing the tradition of close contact between Trans-Tasman Prime Ministers.”

Prime Minister John Key said he expects to discuss a range of political, economic, social and security issues of mutual interest with Mr Turnbull.

“Discussions will also include my concerns about New Zealanders being deported from Australia, advancing our single economic market and cooperation on global political and security issues,” says Mr Key.
