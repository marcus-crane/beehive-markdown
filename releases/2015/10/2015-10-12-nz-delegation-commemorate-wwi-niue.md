Foreign Minister Murray McCully will lead a delegation to Niue this week to attend World War One commemorations hosted by the Government of Niue.

“In October 1915, 150 men from Niue left to join the New Zealand expeditionary force to fight in World War One,” Mr McCully says.

“The Niuean soldiers served with the Māori Pioneer Battalion on the Western Front before returning home.

“This visit is an opportunity to commemorate their sacrifice, unveil a New Zealand Cenotaph in Alofi, and take part in other events to commemorate Niue’s contribution during the First World War,” Mr McCully says.

While in Niue Minister McCully will also visit a range of New Zealand Aid funded projects which focus on tourism and economic development. The Minister and delegation will travel to Niue by RNZAF 757.
