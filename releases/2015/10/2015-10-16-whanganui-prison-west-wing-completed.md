Whanganui Prison’s refurbished west wing has been officially opened today as part of a more than $19 million upgrade of prisoner accommodation at the site, says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

The prison’s east and west wings, with a total of 141 beds, have been earthquake-strengthened and enhancements made to meet security classification requirements, and improve staff bases and prisoner areas.  

The upgrades were done one wing at a time, starting with the east wing in April last year.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the investment shows the government’s commitment to Whanganui Prison.

“It also shows our commitment to public safety and reducing reoffending in our communities.”

The west wing refurbishment was opened by Whanganui MP Chester Borrows today.

The upgrades provided an opportunity for eligible prisoners to participate via the Release to Work programme.

A total of 25 prisoners were involved in the upgrade of the two wings on Release to Work. The majority worked with Whanganui-based construction firm W&W Construction, the main contractor for the upgrades.

“All 25 men have gained skills and developed a positive work ethic that will help with their reintegration and employment prospects when released,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The upgrades at Whanganui Prison are part of an $87 million development project for five prisons around the country.
