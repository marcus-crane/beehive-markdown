Plant a seed today, for the future generation. That is the theme for Tokelau Language Week which begins today.

Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the theme, which translated in Tokelauan is Totō hau tōkiga nei, aua na tupulaga e fāi mai, encourages Pacific communities in New Zealand to lay a strong cultural path for their children to follow.

Tokelau Language Week is the last of seven Pacific language weeks being celebrated this year.

“The themes of our Pacific language weeks have focused on enriching New Zealand with Pacific cultures, and treasuring and using our languages at home and in the community,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The future of Pacific languages and cultures lies with our younger generations. It is important they keep their ties to their heritage.”

At the last Census, 7176 people in New Zealand identified as Tokelauan. Only 32 per cent of them can speak the language and that number is declining.

Celebrating Pacific languages opens the door for people to help preserve those languages. Taking part helps educate our nation and advocate for Pacific languages.  

The 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May.
