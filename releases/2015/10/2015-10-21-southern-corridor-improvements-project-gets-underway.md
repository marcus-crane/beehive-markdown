Transport Minister Simon Bridges has turned the sod for the next of the Government's Accelerated Transport Infrastructure Improvements projects being built in Auckland, the Southern Corridor Improvements Project.

Mr Bridges says the $268 million improvements to State Highway 1 (from Manukau to Papakura), as well as an upgrade of the Takanini Interchange will support the rapid population growth that is expected in south Auckland over the next 30 years, as well as address the immediate need to keep traffic flowing in the area.

"As a key transport route for Auckland, the Southern Corridor forms a strategic link between the Western Ring Route - State Highway 20 and State Highway 16 - the airport and Greater Auckland area. This project will improve the movement of people and freight from Northland, through Auckland to the Waikato, Tauranga as well as further south to the rest of New Zealand.”

Mr Bridges says the existing bottlenecks along the southern motorway, as well as congestion and safety risks at the Takanini Interchange, will be alleviated.

"Around 11 kilometres of extra lanes will help to improve capacity and traffic flow. The re-configuration of the Interchange will include a freight lane to help service the nearby industrial area and replace the loop on-ramp with a direct northbound on-ramp to improve safety for motorists and commercial vehicles.”

Mr Bridges says the project’s walking and cycling improvements align with the Government’s vision to make cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice.

“A fully segregated 4.5 kilometre shared path will run from Papakura to Great South Road in Takanini running alongside the State Highway with connections to communities along the way.”

In 2013, the Prime Minister announced a $375 million package of funding to accelerate four key transport projects to address congestion and capitalise on the benefits of major roading projects already underway across the city.

"Accelerating this and the other three projects in Auckland – SH20A Kirkbride, Northern Corridor and East West Connections – will help ensure the key routes in the city that provide the backbone to national economic growth and productivity will better serve the community and improve journey times for commercial and private use."
