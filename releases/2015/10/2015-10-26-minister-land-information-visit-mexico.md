Land Information New Zealand Minister Louise Upston leaves today for an official visit to Mexico. Minister Upston will visit Mexico City, where she will give a keynote speech at the Open Government Partnership Summit.

“New Zealand has a strong and internationally recognised history of open data and transparent government. The Open Data Barometer Report shows New Zealand as a world leader in government data available to citizens.

“New Zealanders view data and information as key public assets – the release of which can play a significant role in driving innovation through better decision making, and the creation of new services, tools, and knowledge.

“Attending this summit will allow me to share New Zealand’s expertise and experience, and see what other countries are doing in this space.”

Minister Upston is due to return to New Zealand on 31 October.
