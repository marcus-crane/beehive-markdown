Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an extra 40 youth forensic community mental health workers are now helping to support vulnerable youth across the country over the last four years.

“We recognised the need to improve specialist youth forensic mental health and addiction services in New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government invested $33 million in 2011 for the development of a new national inpatient facility, and also dedicated staff to work in youth mental health services across the country.

“The additional 40 youth mental health positions take the total number of youth forensic community mental health workers up to 75.

“These expanded community based forensic services are improving the health system’s capacity to provide comprehensive assessments, clinical interventions, and transition support for youth offenders.

“Young offenders are successfully moving from Child Youth and Family youth justice residential services to alternative living arrangements in the community.

“By more effectively responding to the mental health and addiction needs of these young offenders, we can also help to address the underlying causes of offending.”

The increase in youth forensic community mental health workers was announced in 2011, and has been phased in over the last four years.

The country’s first dedicated youth mental health forensic service of ten secure inpatient beds at Kenepuru Hospital, Wellington is on track to open in April 2016.

“Currently youth offenders with severe mental health problems are treated in adult facilities or in the community. This new $15.3 million unit will play a valuable role in offering youth specific holistic care,” says Dr Coleman.
