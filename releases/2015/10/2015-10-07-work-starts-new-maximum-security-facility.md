Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially launched the construction of a new maximum-security facility at Auckland Prison.

The facility will provide a safer environment for staff, prisoners and visitors and help in the rehabilitation of offenders, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The existing maximum-security building dates back to 1968 and is New Zealand’s only such facility.  As well as accommodating all New Zealand’s maximum-security prisoners, it also houses all prisoners from the northern region with high needs and challenging behaviour.

“The existing facility has become outdated and lacks the capability to support the rehabilitation and reintegration programmes required for a modern prison,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The facility is being developed under a Public Private Partnership.  A contract with Next Step Partners (NSP) was signed on 11 September 2015 to design, build and maintain the facility.

It will be maintained by NSP for the next 25 years. The operation of the prison and custody of prisoners will continue to be the responsibility of the Department of Corrections.

Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and the facility operational by mid-2018.

The $300 million redevelopment will contain up to 260 maximum-security prisoners, the same capacity as the existing facility. The maximum number of prisoners at Auckland Prison is 681.
