Prime Minister John Key has tonight congratulated Justin Trudeau on his victory in the Canadian election.

“New Zealand and Canada have a longstanding and important friendship which has seen us work closely together over many years on a wide range of issues.

“Canada is a longstanding security partner, an important destination for New Zealand exports and an important source of direct investment into New Zealand.

"I look forward to speaking with Mr Trudeau soon to congratulate him personally. I am sure that the close relationship between our two countries will continue under his leadership.

“I would also like to acknowledge Stephen Harper whom I had the pleasure of working alongside for many years. He was a strong leader for Canada and I wish him all the best for the future.”
