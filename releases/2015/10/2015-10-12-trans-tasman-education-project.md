New Zealand will partner with Australia in a trans-Tasman education project exploring how innovative learning environments can enhance teaching, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

The Ministry of Education and at least six New Zealand schools will participate in the four-year *Innovative Learning Environments and Teacher Change* project, led by the University of Melbourne’s Learning Environments Applied Research Network.

The project leadership team includes Professor John Hattie, former Professor of Education at Auckland University and currently Director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute.

“Classrooms need to be equipped to enable 21st century teaching practice and inspire children and young people to succeed,” says Ms Parata

“That’s why this project is ground-breaking and timely. It will look at the potential for innovative learning environments to enhance teaching practice and improve student achievement.

“New Zealand has some of the most innovative teachers in the world. This project is a great opportunity for our education sector to work collaboratively with overseas experts to strengthen our education system,” says Ms Parata.

The Ministry of Education will invest $160,000 over four years into the project. Research will begin in 2016.
