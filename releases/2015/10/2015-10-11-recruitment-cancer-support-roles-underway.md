Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says support for cancer patients is being boosted with the recruitment of new psychological and social support roles.

“A diagnosis of cancer can be a very difficult time for patients and their families. An additional $4.5 million a year was provided in Budget 2014 for improved psychological and social support for cancer patients,” says Dr Coleman.

“Six regional lead psychologists and more than 36 psychologists and experienced social workers will be appointed across the country.

“These roles will build on existing services to deliver enhanced support to patients and their families.

“It is important to ensure that patients’ psychological and social needs are properly assessed, and they have access to the right support and counselling.”

To date, three regional lead roles have been appointed at MidCentral, Auckland, and Capital and Coast DHBs. The lead role is an important part of developing a regional psychological and social support service. Further appointments across the country will be made over the coming months.

“Delivering better cancer services is a priority for the Government. Almost $63 million has been invested in the faster cancer treatment programme,” says Dr Coleman. 

“Improved psychological and social support is one of a raft of initiatives underway as we work to ensure patients receive even better, faster cancer care.”
