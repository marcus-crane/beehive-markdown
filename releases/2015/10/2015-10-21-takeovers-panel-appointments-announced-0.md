Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith has acknowledged the appointment of Sacha Judd and the reappointment of Simon Horner and Roger Wallis to the Takeovers Panel.

The Takeovers Panel carries out enforcement functions under the Takeovers Act 1993 and administers the Takeovers Code.  As regulator of the corporate takeovers market, the Panel has an important role in helping to achieve the Government’s goals of ensuring transparent and equitable takeover processes.

The Governor-General has appointed Ms Judd as a member of the Panel for a five year term. Mr Horner and Mr Wallis have been appointed further terms of five years and 18 months, respectively.

“With her strong corporate background and wide-ranging legal expertise, Ms Judd is a natural fit for the role. She’s well practised in mergers and acquisitions, and corporate and securities law, and she’ll be an asset to the Panel,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Mr Horner and Mr Wallis have made important contributions to the Panel during their tenures and it’s great they will continue in their roles.”

Mr Goldsmith also acknowledged outgoing long-term Panel member Suzanne Suckling.

“I would like to recognise the valuable contribution Ms Suckling has made to the Panel since her appointment in 2002,” Mr Goldsmith says.

**Sacha Judd**

Ms Judd is a former partner at law firm Buddle Findlay and recently took up the role of Managing Director of the Hoku Group. Ms Judd has a comprehensive understanding of Takeovers Code compliance issues, having acted for a large number of private and listed companies that are subject to the Code. She also has a special interest in the impact of the Code on smaller companies through her work with early-stage and high-growth ventures.
