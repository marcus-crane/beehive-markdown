Education Minister Hekia Parata today launched an OECD report on innovative learning systems at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Paris headquarters. 

Ms Parata, who is in Europe to meet with international education experts, says the invitation to launch the report is recognition of the high-esteem in which the New Zealand education system is held internationally.

“In today’s world it is not what students know that is important, but what they can do with that knowledge. New Zealand’s broad curriculum which emphasises the development of thinking skills and the importance of learning to learn as well as the acquisition of knowledge, has long been admired internationally.

“This is reflected in the example of innovative practice highlighted in the report of the Learning and Change Networks established in this country to accelerate the learning of kids falling behind.

“*Schooling Redesigned: Towards Innovative Learning Systems* confirms the thinking behind the Government’s Communities of Learning strategy.

“The greatest educational advances are achieved by enabling all those involved in a child’s education to collaborate in a systematic fashion.”

 “I am delighted to launch this report and urge all those with an interest in education systems to take advantage of the useful advice it offers.”
