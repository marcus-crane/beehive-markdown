Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today released the finalised plan that sets out the path to the regeneration of Christchurch.

The Transition Recovery Plan details arrangements to be put in place when the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) ends in April next year, including the move to local leadership, ongoing co-operation between central and local government, where functions carried out by CERA will go, a new monitoring regime, and new legislation to ensure momentum is maintained.

“It’s an exciting phase we are entering now as we prepare to move from recovery to the regeneration of greater Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Everyone involved in the recovery should be proud of how far we have come in the last few years.

“Greater Christchurch is performing well and attracting interest from all over the world, but we can’t afford to take our eye off the ball now.”

Public comment on the draft version of the Transition Recovery Plan demonstrated strong support for leadership in the regeneration phase to rest with local institutions.

“This transition plan confirms that central government will progressively step back so local institutions are in the driving seat of Christchurch’s regeneration,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The advice of the Advisory Board on Transition and local institutions is clearly reflected in this plan.

“As the Government’s role winds down, a new joint entity with the Christchurch City Council called Regenerate Christchurch will keep the focus on progress in the central city, Christchurch’s residential red zones, New Brighton and potentially other areas that require attention.

“Regenerate Christchurch will have an independent board and, after five years, will become a Council Controlled Organisation fully owned and funded by the Council.

“A new Crown company will be established to carry on the work on major projects in the central city, and to manage and divest land owned by the Crown to get the best return for the taxpayers.

“This company will sit apart from Regenerate Christchurch and the Council’s Development Christchurch Ltd.

“As I announced earlier this week, new legislation to replace the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 has been introduced.  The Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill, which will receive its first reading in Parliament today, will provide the tools to ensure progress is maintained as we move from recovery to regeneration.

“The Transition Recovery Plan confirms the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) will take on the task of monitoring a number of progress measures in greater Christchurch to ensure Government is providing the right levels of support, in the right areas.

“In addition, a Christchurch leadership forum involving the relevant Ministers and the Christchurch Mayor and city councillors will meet at least once a year to consider issues important to the city.

“The Transition Recovery Plan also refers to the Government’s June decisions to hand over various functions led by CERA to agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, Land Information New Zealand and DPMC.”
