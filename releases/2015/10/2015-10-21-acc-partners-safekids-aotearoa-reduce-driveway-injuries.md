ACC Minister Nikki Kaye says a new Safekids Aotearoa campaign supported by ACC will help reduce New Zealand’s high rate of children’s driveway deaths and injuries.

“On average, five children are killed every year and every fortnight a child is hospitalised with a significant injury after being hit by a vehicle on a private driveway,” says Ms Kaye.

“In total, ACC receives around 120 claims a year for driveway injuries to children.

“My heart goes out to the mums whose children have died due to driveway injuries and have had the courage to be part of the new campaign, called Check For Me Before You Turn The Key.

“To lose a child or see them seriously injured is devastating for any family. It can be even more devastating if you know it was potentially preventable, or another family member was involved.

“This a multimedia campaign focused on reminding parents and family members to walk around their car and check that their children are in a safe place before they drive off.

“I attended the launch of the campaign in Onehunga, Auckland today, shortly after speaking to an ACC injury prevention conference.

“The partnership between ACC and Safekids is a good example of the partnerships ACC is forming with a range of organisations as it ramps up its injury prevention work.

“Now that the ACC scheme is fully funded and on a secure financial footing, it’s my expectation that ACC will give more focus to injury prevention, which is one of its key responsibilities.

“I’m pleased that the ACC Board has confirmed an increase in its injury prevention budget from $30 million to $50 million this year.

“By working with organisations such as Safekids, ACC can get safety messages to a wide audience and make a real impact.”

ACC will invest $300,000 in Safekids’ driveway safety campaign.

“Children don’t always understand risks and are less aware of hazards in their environment, which is why as adults we need to exercise more caution.

“We want our kids to be active and adventurous, but at the same we need to protect them from preventable harm.

“Most driveway incidents involve children aged under three. This is about making sure you know where your little one is before you or someone else drives off.

“The Safekids campaign is an important step towards turning around the unacceptable rate of child driveway deaths and injuries in our country.”

“Today I was pleased to speak at the ACC Injury Prevention Partner's conference about ACC’s priority prevention areas – Violence, Sport, Community (including reducing children injuries), Falls, Road, Treatment Injury and Workplace.

“Looking ahead, we will see an increased injury prevention spend, supported by an improved strategic focus, a better evidence base and the development of longer, stronger partnerships. I intend to work with ACC to ensure stronger linkages across government.”

**Tips to reduce the risk of driveway accidents**

- Use safety gates – to help prevent children sneaking outside unnoticed
- Actively supervise children, especially before meal times – most incidents happen during busy times of the day, eg when parents are preparing meals
- Build a fenced-off play area – toddlers can move faster than we think, so having a play area separated from the driveway can help when supervision fails
- Know your blind zones – reversing cameras on cars are useful, but there are ‘blind zones’ in front, behind and along the side of your car that you need to check
- Be aware of the risks – your driveway is risky if, for example, you live in a busy home with lots of cars, have a shared driveway, or the driveway is the only pedestrian pathway to the house
