A new agreement will encourage collaboration between the New Zealand and Polish screen industries, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“The Poland-New Zealand Film Co-Production Agreement was signed yesterday by Ambassador to Poland Wendy Hinton and the Polish Culture and National Heritage Minister, Malgorzata Omilanowska,” Ms Barry says.

“This is the 16th bilateral film and television co-production agreement signed by New Zealand. It will open the doors for our screen industry to access finance, expertise and distribution in Poland, and give the opportunity to share creative and technical resources.”

Producers in both countries will be able to deliver large-scale projects and access local and foreign incentives such as the New Zealand Screen Production Grant.

“I welcome this agreement and look forward to the benefits it will bring to our screen sector. There is potential for new ventures and the opportunity to develop creative partnerships that will enhance the industry in both countries.”

New Zealand has previously signed co-production agreements with Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Republic of Korea (film only), Singapore, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom.
