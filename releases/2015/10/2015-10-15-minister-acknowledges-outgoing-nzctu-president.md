Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse today acknowledged outgoing New Zealand Council of Trade Unions President Helen Kelly, who formally stepped down from the role yesterday. 

“Helen has made a significant contribution during her time as President of the NZCTU over the last eight years,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Her hard work and dedication to the NZCTU is a considerable service, not just to the NZCTU itself, but to all workers in New Zealand.

“Helen has been a tireless campaigner on behalf of workers’. I would like to acknowledge her for her passion and commitment over the years.

“I would also like to congratulate the new President of the NZCTU Richard Wagstaff. I look forward to continuing a good working relationship with the NZCTU under Richard’s leadership.”
