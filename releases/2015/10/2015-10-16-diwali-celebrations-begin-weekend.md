Minister for Ethnic Communities Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says he is looking forward to Diwali, the ancient Hindu festival celebrated in New Zealand each year.

Diwali festivities begin this weekend in Auckland, with events including live music, dance, food and art. Events around the country will be held over the next three weeks.

“Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important festivals on the Hindu calendar. It is a demonstration of our diverse and accepting culture that it is also a festival that many other New Zealanders of all ethnic groups eagerly await,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Diwali celebrates the conquest of light over darkness, truth over ignorance. It is a festival celebrated all over the world and is an official holiday in many countries.

“For New Zealand’s Indian community this is a significant time of year and I am looking forward to celebrating this time with them,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will be hosting a function at Parliament on November 10 to celebrate Diwali with the Indian community and to acknowledge the contribution it makes to New Zealand’s culture and economy.

At the 2013 Census there were about 155,200 Indian people in New Zealand, about 4 per cent of the population.

Official Diwali celebrations were first held in New Zealand in 2002. It is estimated that 150,000 people attended festivities in Auckland and Wellington last year.
