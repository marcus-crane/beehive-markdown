A Bill enabling local communities to decide whether retailers in their districts can open on Easter Sunday was introduced to Parliament today, says Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“The Shop Trading Hours Amendment Bill will enable communities, through councils, to choose whether or not to allow trading on Easter Sunday,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The historical Easter Sunday shop trading exemptions are out of date and create an unfair advantage for certain businesses and regions that can continue trading while others stay shut.

“We know there is a demand from communities across the country to allow for shop trading on Easter Sunday, particularly from those districts who rely on tourism.

“This Bill will give those districts the choice of how to respond to that demand though their local councils.

“However, we acknowledge that Easter Sunday continues to be a day of significance for many New Zealanders, which is why workers will be able to refuse work without having to provide a reason to their employer.”

The Bill provides change to Easter Sunday trading only. Good Friday, Anzac Day and Christmas Day shop trading restrictions will remain.
