A range of conservation projects, including coastal forests, wetland restoration and pest control across Otago, will benefit from the latest round of Community Conservation Partnership Fund (CCPF) grants, says Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The Landscape Connection Trust is receiving $120,000 to help continue conservation efforts for threatened species and indigenous forests across 55,000 hectares of Otago land,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Trust will create a low-predator environment in the areas surrounding the Orokonui ecosanctuary. The ‘Orokonui Halo’ will help provide a safer habitat for threatened birds which fly over the sanctuary’s fence, allowing the birds to nest in areas where people live.

“The Trust will also work to restore indigenous coastal forests on public and private land as well as dry forest ecosystems in the Waikouaiti River catchment.

“The Fund will provide $111,000 to the Otago Peninsula Biodiversity Group to help reduce introduced predators including possums, rats and ferrets on the Otago Peninsula. The project is unique in New Zealand in attempting multi-species pest control in a rural-urban environment close to a major city.

“More than $103,000 will go to Te Nohoaka o Tukiauau/Sinclair Wetlands Trust to train skilled volunteers to maintain the Wetland’s ecosystem. The Sinclair Wetland was established by conservationist Horace Sinclair in 1960 who was awarded an MBE for services to conservation in 1984.

“Over 60 species of bird live or regularly visit the wetland. The Wetland is now owned by Ngāi Tahu and is valued as a wāhi taonga.

“The Fund is about enabling community-led conservation growth and works hand in hand with funding from community and private organisations to achieve better conservation outcomes.

“The CCPF is enabling the Department of Conservation to work with conservationists at a local level to support some incredibly valuable projects. Many of these Otago projects are already making a real difference and this support will help to build on their success,” Ms Wagner says.
