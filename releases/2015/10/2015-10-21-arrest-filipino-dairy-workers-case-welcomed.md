Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse welcomes the arrest of a dual Filipino / New Zealand national on suspicion of facilitating fraud involving multiple work visa applications submitted by Filipino nationals in the dairy industry.

Mr Woodhouse says an investigation by Immigration New Zealand has uncovered more widespread concerns around the number of Filipino dairy workers currently in New Zealand who may have provided false information as part of their initial visa application.

“Any fraud of our immigration system is a very serious matter and I am extremely concerned about the potential scale of the alleged fraud in this case,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“It is absolutely imperative that the integrity of the immigration system is maintained and that visa applicants who have lied on their application forms are not rewarded.

“However, we recognise the potential impact this situation may have on the dairy industry and I’m currently working with officials to consider options to ensure the dairy industry is not materially affected.

“I am aware of concerns around delays for visa applications by Filipino workers. However as this investigation has progressed, extra verification has been required and this has resulted in delays in some cases.

“Immigration officials have acted decisively to deal with this situation by introducing extra safeguards to ensure that all documents submitted in support of new and existing visa applications for work in the dairy industry are genuine.

“I am confident that these additional measures will prevent the occurrence of any similar offending.

“In addition, the Labour Inspectorate is leading an operation to audit a number of farms in the Waikato, Canterbury and Southland to check compliance with labour and immigration laws.”
