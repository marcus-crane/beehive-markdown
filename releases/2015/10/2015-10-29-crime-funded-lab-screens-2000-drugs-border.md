Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says the proceeds of crime-funded screening laboratory at Auckland Airport has made it quicker and easier to identify and stop drugs at the border.

“In its first year, the joint Customs-Environmental Science and Research (ESR) lab has screened more than 2000 drug samples. Of the samples screened, 33 per cent were controlled drugs,” Ms Wagner says.

“About 700 shipments of illegal drugs, including Class A such as methamphetamine, and Class B such as ecstasy, plus about 1100 other forms of drugs, have been identified and stopped within the lab.

“More than half – 54 per cent – of the samples were other forms of drugs that are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, such as synthetic cannabinoids and psychoactive substances including N-BOMes.

“The lab was built using proceeds of crime funding. I am pleased that criminals’ ill-gotten gains are being used to help stop drugs at the border.

“Having this lab onsite allows Customs to identify drugs quicker and more cost-effectively. The lab’s real-time testing capabilities are also a real advantage in speeding up investigations against drug importers.

“In the world of synthetic drugs where chemical properties are ever-evolving, having scientific experts on hand means Customs is able to identify newer drugs and trends sooner, helping to build a stronger intelligence picture and better target drug imports.

“We know the harm some of these emerging synthetic drugs can have on our communities – users are risking their lives because criminals are constantly changing drug formulas to evade the law and make more money.

“The Government is funding multiple initiatives under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act, including frontline screening at the border, more organised crime investigators and support for drug treatment programmes.

“It’s still early days but in its first year this lab, and the partnership between Customs and ESR, has shown its value in the fight to prevent drugs from crossing the border and reaching our communities,” Ms Wagner says.
