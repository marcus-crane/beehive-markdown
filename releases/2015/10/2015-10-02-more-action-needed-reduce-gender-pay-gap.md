Minister for Women Louise Upston says she is disappointed by updated figures showing the gap between men’s and women’s median earnings has grown.

The New Zealand Income Survey released today by Statistics New Zealand shows the gender pay gap is now 11.8 per cent, up from 9.9 per cent in 2014.

“While it’s been encouraging to see a downwards trend in Gender Pay Gap figures over the past 17 years, it’s disappointing to see this increase.

“There shouldn’t be a difference in the average salaries of men and women in this country, and what this increase shows is we still have work to do to ensure women are paid fairly for their skills.

Ms Upston says reducing the Gender Pay Gap requires action by workers, employers, career advisors and business leaders.

“Women should be encouraged into fields where they have been traditionally underrepresented. Many of these areas, such as technology, construction and trades are experiencing high growth and high wages.

“Public sector leaders and industry organisations can also encourage employment diversity, and can recruit, retain and advance more women in their organisations.

“The Government has given all employees the right to request flexible working arrangements, which employers should actively encourage in their workplaces.

“We can all make a conscious effort to ensure women have equal choices and equal opportunities in the workplace, and most importantly that they are valued equally.”

**Notes:**

The Gender Pay Gap is calculated by measuring the median hourly earnings difference between males and females who are in full-time and part-time employment as at June 2015.
