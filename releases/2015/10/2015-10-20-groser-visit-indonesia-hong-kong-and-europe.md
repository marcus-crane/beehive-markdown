Trade and Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser departs today to Indonesia and Hong Kong for meetings with key ministerial counterparts.

“Indonesia is an important political, trade and economic partner for New Zealand,” says Mr Groser.

“My visit will be an opportunity to exchange views on a range of trade-related issues including regional economic developments, the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and ongoing Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiation.

“I will also have the opportunity to raise New Zealand’s market access concerns with the new Indonesian Trade Minister, Thomas Lembong.”

Mr Groser will also meet with Indonesian counterparts to discuss the international efforts to secure a new legally binding framework to address climate change, ahead of COP21 in Paris in December.

He will be the keynote speaker at an ASEAN-New Zealand Business breakfast focused on how enhancing regional economic integration benefits ASEAN and New Zealand businesses. He will also formally open New Zealand’s Mission to ASEAN.

Indonesia is our 13th-largest trading partner, with total goods trade exceeding NZD$1.7 billion annually.

In Hong Kong, Mr Groser will meet with Gregory So, the Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development to discuss the operation of the Hong Kong, China-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership, which has supported two-way trade since its entry into force on 1 January 2011.  He will also meet with business leaders in Hong Kong to discuss regional trade matters.

Hong Kong is New Zealand’s 14th-largest goods export market, with total goods and services trade at $1.5 billion, and is a major source of investment and tourism.

Mr Groser will travel from Hong Kong to Europe to join the Prime Minister in Brussels and London.
