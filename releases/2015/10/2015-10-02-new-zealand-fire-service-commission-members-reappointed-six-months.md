Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced the reappointment of four members of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission until 31 March 2016.

The Rt Hon Wyatt Creech will continue as Chair of the Commission for another six months and David McFarlane as Deputy Chair. Rangi Wills and Angela Hauk-Willis will also continue to serve until 31 March 2016.

Mr Dunne has been leading a public consultation on changes to New Zealand’s fire services and will seek a Cabinet decision later this year on how fire services would be managed, delivered and funded.

“I am pleased these four Commission members have agreed to be reappointed to provide continuity while Cabinet signals its preferred direction,” said Mr Dunne.

“Once the way forward is confirmed, we can begin planning what skills and expertise the Commission will need for what could be a period of quite significant change.”

The Fire Service Commission is a Crown entity that controls the New Zealand Fire Service and also acts as the National Rural Fire Authority.  Mr Creech and Mr McFarlane were appointed in 2009, and since 2012 have served as Chair and Deputy Chair respectively.  Angela Hauk-Willis was appointed in 2011, and Rangi Wills in 2012.

Vicki Caisley, of Auckland, also sits on the Commission and her term expires at the end of 2016.
