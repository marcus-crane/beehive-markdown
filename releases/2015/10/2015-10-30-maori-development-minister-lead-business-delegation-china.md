Successful businesses representing New Zealand’s $42 billion-plus Māori Taniwha economy’ will be represented in a trade delegation that leaves for China and Hong Kong today.

The delegation will be led by Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

“Māori enterprises want to be serious partners with China and Chinese businesses. Representatives from our Māori ‘Taniwha’ economy are heading to China to create and extend our trade relationships, to build a sustained presence in China and show the unique value that Māori businesses offer,” says Mr Flavell.

The delegates on this mission manage assets and businesses spanning tourism, dairying, fisheries, wine, horticulture, professional services and manufacturing.

“Some of our largest Māori fisheries companies are joining us, who will participate in the China Fisheries & Seafood Expo in Qingdao from 4 – 6 November 2015,” says Minister Flavell.

The business delegation will meet government and commercial leaders in Beijing, Qingdao, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.

“Our delegation represents assets with huge potential and countless generations of Māori people. Our strong tradition of kaitiakitanga (guardianship), whakapapa (relationships) and whānau (family), combined with our advanced technologies for processing and exporting – gives our companies their competitive advantage. Many of our companies joining us are already exporting to China with great success.”

The delegation is part of an ongoing strategy supported by Te Puni Kōkiri to strengthen trade relationships with China.

Mr Flavell says Māori trade business is part of New Zealand’s China strategy to grow exports and new markets.

Totalling around $42 billion and growing, the Māori economy has huge potential to contribute to New Zealand’s future prosperity.

Crucial to unlocking that latent potential will be maximising the Māori economy’s export and innovation potential.
