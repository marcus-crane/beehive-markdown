Police Minister Michael Woodhouse and Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss today announced stronger penalties for fleeing drivers and those who withhold information on fleeing drivers.

“Failure to stop when required by a police officer represents a calculated and deliberate attempt by offenders to evade punishment. They deliberately put the public at risk and too often their actions result in serious consequences,” Mr Woodhouse says.

There are around 2300 fleeing driver incidents every year and in 2014/15 this resulted in 460 crashes, which averages more than one a day.

“Stronger and more targeted penalties are needed for fleeing drivers and those who withhold information that would lead to the identification and apprehension of offenders,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that fleeing from Police is not an option. Those that do, and put the public at risk, will have their licence disqualified for at least six months and their vehicle may be confiscated and sold.”

Changes announced today to amend the Land Transport Act 1998 and Sentencing Act 2002 will increase existing mandatory driver licence disqualification periods for failure to stop offences to six months for the first offence, 12 months for the second, and 24 months for third and subsequent offences.

Mandatory vehicle confiscation for second and subsequent failure to stop offences within a four year period will also be introduced, and courts will be given the ability to confiscate an offender’s vehicle for any first offences.

“It is important to point out that these penalties will be on top of any prior offences they may have committed that brought them to Police’s attention in the first place,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Police often record the licence plate and details of a vehicle before being forced to abandon a chase, but there are currently few penalties for those that do not cooperate with Police to identify the driver after the fact.

“That’s why Police will be given the ability to impound vehicles used to flee for up to 28 days, if it is believed on reasonable grounds that the person in legal possession of the vehicle is withholding or providing false information about who was driving.”

Mr Foss says those who make the decision to flee Police and put themselves and others at risk must be held accountable for their actions.

“Currently, offenders bet on not getting caught because they know Police have to abandon pursuits once there are public safety concerns.

“Today’s announcement will put in place tougher penalties and send the clear message that this dangerous behaviour will not be tolerated.

“The tougher penalties will also make those who protect these drivers think twice about their actions and the consequences to their own lives,” Mr Foss says.
