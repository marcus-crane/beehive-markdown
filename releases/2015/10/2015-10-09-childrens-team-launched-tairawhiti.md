Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has today officially launched the Tairawhiti Children’s team in Gisborne, which will provide support for an estimated 430 at-risk children and their families over the next two years.

The Tairawhiti Children’s team, which is the sixth of ten teams to be rolled out across the country, will ensure that children with multiple and complex needs have access to the right services at the right time.

Vulnerable children will have a single point of contact and an individually-tailored and co-ordinated support plan, with agencies working together to provide the best outcomes for kids, so that they don’t go on to require state intervention.

“Children’s Teams represent a new way of working to intervene early in a co-ordinated way to keep at-risk kids safe from abuse and neglect, allowing them to thrive and succeed,” says Mrs Tolley.

“To do this we need government agencies, iwi services, NGOs and the community agreeing to work together to share information and co-ordinate the services which can change the lives of these children.

“It takes a huge amount of effort to set up a Children’s Team and I want to thank everyone who has contributed to today’s launch.

“The really difficult work is just beginning, and I know that everyone involved is committed to making a difference for vulnerable children and their families, so that they can go on to achieve everything they deserve in life.”

Children’s Teams are currently being established in Eastern Bay of Plenty, Whanganui, Christchurch and Clendon/ Manurewa/Papakura. Teams have already been launched and are accepting referrals in Whangarei, Rotorua, Horowhenua/Ōtaki, Marlborough and Hamilton.
