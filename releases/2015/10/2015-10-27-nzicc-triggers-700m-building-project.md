SkyCity’s announcement today of its commitment to a $700 million building works programme for the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC) together with a 300-room hotel, 1300 carparks and the accompanying laneway is a huge boost for the Auckland and New Zealand visitor economy, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says.

“Today’s announcement is the culmination of years of planning and collaboration between the Crown and SkyCity,” Mr Joyce says.

“SkyCity estimates that this important national facility will now bring 2140 new jobs - 1000 during the construction phase and about 1140 people in the NZICC, the new hotel, the new retail outlets and the additional gaming and hospitality areas that are being constructed. That’s 340 more jobs than originally estimated.

“The NZICC agreement covered the cost of land and construction for the NZICC only. That agreement was for a $402 million centre that would create 1000 jobs during construction and an additional 800 new jobs once the NZICC was operational.

“As part of today’s announcement, SkyCity has agreed to invest an additional $69 million in the International Convention Centre over and above its contracted commitment, and it will build the new hotel, laneway and extra carparks at the same time.  That takes the total building project to $700 million.

“This is a tremendous result for New Zealand, made even more so by the fact that it has been achieved without any direct financial contribution from the Government.”

SkyCity is now very close to starting construction on what will be a world-standard facility for Auckland and New Zealand, Mr Joyce says. The centre will be able to host 3,150 conference delegates at any one time. Plenary capacity will be 2,850, and the total floor area of the NZICC will be more than 32,000m2.

“The NZICC will drive a significant increase in tourism expenditure in the city and around New Zealand through an estimated 33,000 more international convention delegates and the $90 million in expenditure they are expected to bring each year.

“We will now be able to compete effectively to attract high-value business visitors from across the Asia-Pacific region, and all of New Zealand will benefit from the anticipated $49 million annual increase in GDP.

“The NZICC will be a world-class facility that will put New Zealand on the international convention centre stage.”

Building is expected to commence by Christmas.
