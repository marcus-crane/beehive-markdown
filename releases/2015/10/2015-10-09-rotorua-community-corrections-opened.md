Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially opened the new Rotorua Community Corrections site.

The $1.37 million rebuild of the site is part of a five-year nationwide renewal programme to make Community Corrections sites more secure and better equipped to support offenders to turn their lives around.

“If we are to reach our goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017, Corrections needs to create the best possible environment for offenders to make the changes in their lives that will allow them to live crime-free,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“It is also important that our staff and visitors to the centre are as safe as possible. The renovation of the Rotorua site includes new security features that create a safer working environment.”

Since the original building in Haupapa St was opened in 2000, the number of staff and the region they cover has increased significantly. A total of 65 staff now work at the site.

“The site is now fit-for-purpose and incorporates features that support Corrections’ overall priorities of reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
