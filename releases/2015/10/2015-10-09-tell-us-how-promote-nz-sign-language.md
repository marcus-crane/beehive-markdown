Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the start of consultation for the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Board’s three year action plan.

“New Zealand Sign Language is vitally important for the thousands of New Zealanders who use it as their primary form of communication,” Ms Wagner says.

"The Government is committed to promoting and maintaining the use of NZSL as one of New Zealand's official languages. The NZSL Board and the NZSL Fund were established to help support this commitment.

“The priorities within the NZSL action plan will outline how the Board works with government agencies, the NZSL community and other key stakeholders to promote and maintain the language.

“I look forward to the NZSL community providing feedback to inform this important plan,” Ms Wagner says.
