Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has opened a new ‘See and Treat’ clinic for skin cancer at South Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital.

“Delivering faster quality services is a priority for the Government. We know that prompt treatment is more likely to ensure better outcomes for patients,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new ‘See and Treat’ skin cancer clinic brings together specialists from Middlemore Hospital’s plastic surgery department and GPs.

“Suitable patients will be able to have treatment at their First Specialist Appointment, instead of waiting for up to four months for a separate appointment.

“This innovative new approach to skin cancer will mean more patients will receive the treatment they need faster.”

Skin cancer is a common condition in New Zealand, with around 70,000 cases diagnosed each year.

At Middlemore Hospital surgeons treat between 160 and 190 patients a month under local anaesthesia. It is estimated that 80 per cent of these patients would be suitable to go through the new ‘See and Treat’ clinic.

“The new clinic is modelled on international examples where this one-stop shop approach has been proven to speed up treatment and streamline care,” says Dr Coleman.

“This integrated style of care also helps to build stronger relationships between primary and secondary care.”

This new service is being supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year.
