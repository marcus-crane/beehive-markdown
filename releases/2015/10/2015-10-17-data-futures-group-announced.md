Finance Minister Bill English and Statistics Minister Craig Foss today named the working group responsible for leading the new Data Futures Partnership.

“The Data Futures Partnership is an exciting opportunity to potentially deliver economic and social value for New Zealand by solving issues that limit trusted data-use and innovation,” Mr English says.

“I’m confident this diverse group of people has the knowledge and experience necessary to understand the issues and look for innovative solutions.”

Mr Foss says the success of the Partnership depends on the appointments to its working group.

“I’d like to congratulate Dame Diane Robertson, the outgoing Auckland City Missioner, on being appointed Chair. Dame Diane has considerable experience using data to solve long-term problems for everyday New Zealanders.”

The other members of the Partnership’s core working group are:

- Stephen England-Hall, CEO of Loyalty New Zealand
- Lillian Grace, CEO of Figure.NZ
- Professor Miriam Lips, Professor of Digital Government at Victoria University’s School of Government
- Tina Porou, Head of Sustainability at Contact Energy
- Professor Rhema Vaithianathan, Professor in Economics at the Auckland University of Technology
- John Whitehead, former Secretary to the Treasury

“The working group will now form the larger Partnership, identifying and inviting leading data thinkers and doers to join the project,” Mr Foss says.

The Data Futures Partnership will undertake a range of activities, including the launch of catalyst projects to expand the use of data, and development of guidelines to provide clarity on ethical data use following widespread engagement with New Zealanders.

The Data Futures Partnership builds on the Data Futures Forum launched in 2013.
