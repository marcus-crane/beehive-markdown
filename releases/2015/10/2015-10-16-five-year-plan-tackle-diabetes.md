Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the national diabetes plan launched today provides a clear roadmap for how to tackle one of New Zealand’s greatest health challenges.

“We have made significant progress in improving the health of more than a quarter of a million New Zealanders living with diabetes,” says Dr Coleman.

“There is always more work to be done, and this new plan sets out how we can build on that progress and further reduce the impact of diabetes.

“The plan places an emphasis on supporting people to manage their condition. We want to ensure people with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes have the support they need to live well and access high quality patient-centred services.”

The plan has been compiled with input from the health workforce and patients. It identifies six priority areas:

- preventing high-risk people from developing type 2 diabetes
- enabling effective self-management
- improving quality services
- detecting diabetes early and reducing the risk of complications
- providing integrated care
- meeting the needs of children and adults with type 1 diabetes

The plan also aligns with other Government initiatives including Healthy Families NZ and Green Prescriptions.

Dr Coleman launched the plan at Middlemore Hospital with the support of Sir Peter Leitch, a diabetic and an ambassador for Diabetes New Zealand.
