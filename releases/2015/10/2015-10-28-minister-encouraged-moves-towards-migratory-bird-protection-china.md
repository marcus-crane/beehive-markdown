Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says progress on red knot protection in China is a significant step towards safeguarding the bird’s migration routes.

On a visit to the Pukorokoro-Miranda Shorebird Centre in Thames today, Ms Barry met with Chinese Ambassador Wang Lutong to discuss his work to secure protection for vital migratory bird wetland habitats in China’s Bohai Bay.

“The red knots which visit Miranda each year form an ancient and tangible link between New Zealand and China,” Ms Barry says. “They rely on wetlands in Bohai Bay as a refuelling stop on their way from the North Island to breeding grounds in Siberia – a 30,000km round trip.”

Ambassador Wang has worked with authorities in Hebei Province to gain protection for a significant habitat for red knots and shorebirds, covering more than 3000 hectares, with other extensive wetland sites under consideration.

“The Ambassador is a bird enthusiast who understands the crucial importance of Bohai Bay to conservation and has given generous support to this initiative,” Ms Barry says.

DOC Director-General Lou Sanson will soon travel to China to discuss details of an agreement on protection of migratory bird habitat in both countries.

The continued health of the Firth of Thames coastal wetlands at Miranda is one of the goals of the $20 million Living Water partnership between DOC and Fonterra.

“This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the Pukorokoro-Miranda Naturalists’ Trust, which runs the shorebird centre,” Ms Barry says. “The trust is respected internationally for its success in protecting this important habitat, and the birds which make it their home.”

“By building strong local and international ties, DOC has developed a wide-ranging strategy to ensure red knots and other migratory birds flourish in our coastal wetlands and are able to continue their epic annual journeys.”
