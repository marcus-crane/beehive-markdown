The Government is seeking submissions on an exposure draft of the Contract and Commercial Law Bill, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

Eleven contract and commercial statutes, some dating back to 1908, have been revised and consolidated into a single Bill without changing the substantive effect of the law.

“This Bill is significant because it relates to laws which govern transactions in the commercial world as well as dealings between individuals,” Mr Finlayson said. “As a result of this work, people and businesses will be able to understand more easily the laws that apply to them, helping to reduce regulatory costs.”

This is the first revision Bill of the government’s statute revision programme, presented to the House of Representatives in December last year.

“The statute revision programme is part of this government’s commitment to producing an accessible, clear and up-to-date statute book for New Zealand. It builds on initiatives like the Statute Repeal Bill announced last week,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Bill makes some very minor amendments to the law, as permitted under the statutory revision powers, which are clearly identified for comment.

The exposure draft of the Bill and information about how to make a submission are available at [www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/consultation-cclb](http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/consultation-cclb). 

Submissions close on 7 December 2015.
