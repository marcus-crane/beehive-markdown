Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced Portia Baine, 18, as the overall winner of the 2015 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition.

“Portia’s poem, titled ‘Passchendaele’, captures the very essence of this competition — remembering those who served on the Western Front, particularly those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,” Mr Foss says.

“The Battle of Passchendaele was one of New Zealand’s most deadly conflicts during World War I. On just one day, 12 October 1917, more than 845 Kiwi men were killed and more than 2700 wounded. 

“This battle is such an important piece of New Zealand history.  It’s encouraging to see so many young people took the time to consider what it means to go to war and the impact it has on the individuals, their loved ones and the country.”

Mr Foss will present Portia, from Sacred Heart Girls’ College in Hamilton, with a $2000 education grant at a commemoration ceremony marking the 98th Anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele, at the Auckland War Memorial Museum on Monday.
