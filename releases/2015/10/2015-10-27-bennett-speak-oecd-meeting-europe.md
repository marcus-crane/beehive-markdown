State Services Minister Paula Bennett is in Finland and Sweden this week to attend meetings with Ministerial counterparts and present New Zealand’s perspective on providing better public services.

Mrs Bennett will deliver one of the keynote addresses at the OECD Public Governance Ministerial meeting in Helsinki, Finland.

“This is a great opportunity to discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by growth and demographic change,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Through things like our Better Public Service targets, the Business Growth Agenda, and our Social Investment approach, New Zealand is leading the way in showing that smart, innovative policy is possible when you put citizens at the centre of what you do. 

“I’m looking forward to presenting New Zealand’s view on how to promote outstanding public services that are focused on delivering results.”

Mrs Bennett will also visit Stockholm, Sweden for visits with ministerial counterparts for discussions on public finance, housing, and local government.
