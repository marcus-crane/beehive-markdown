Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says “Cabinet has approved amendments be made to the Māori Language (Te Reo Māori) Bill.”

“I am pleased that Cabinet has agreed to the landmark decision to enact the Bill in dual languages and that will mean the reo Māori text will prevail in law”, he says.

The key proposals approved by Cabinet include:

- giving legislative status to two Māori Language Strategies, one the responsibility of the Crown, which will focus on national-level issues and the other strategy the responsibility of tāngata whenua that will  focus on matters at an iwi and community level;
- that the primary responsibilities of Te Mātāwai is to support whānau, hapū, iwi and communities, but also enabling it to influence central government efforts.
- adjusting the membership of Te Mātāwai to ensure representation for Urban Māori and providing for Te Puni Kōkiri to facilitate the selection process;
- maintaining Te Taura Whiri and Te Māngai Pāho as Crown Entities and;
- establishing two governance and engagement forums between Te Mātāwai and the Crown

“These Cabinet decisions will be incorporated into the departmental report for consideration by the Māori Affairs Committee. These proposals further support the goal of strengthening a strong Crown and Māori partnership for coordinating efforts to revitalise te reo Māori,” says Minister Flavell.
