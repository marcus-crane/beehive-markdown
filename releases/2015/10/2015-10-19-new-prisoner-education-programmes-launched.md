Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has launched new programmes to improve the literacy and numeracy of prisoners.

Te Wānanga o Aotearoa and Methodist Mission Southern have been contracted by Corrections to deliver the intensive literacy and numeracy programmes in all Corrections-run prisons, giving priority to learners with the highest educational needs.

“Many prisoners have literacy and numeracy skills below the necessary level to benefit from trades training qualifications, employment activities and rehabilitative programmes in prison,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Research has shown that participation in education and employment can significantly reduce the risk of reoffending, which helps our government’s goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”

Both contracts are for three years and will provide tuition to 1300 prisoners a year.

Under the programme, prisoners will receive 100 hours of tuition to help improve their literacy and numeracy skills. This may help them gain NZQA qualifications and the skills they need for employment.

A second part of the agreement with Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is to help Corrections improve each prison’s ability to identify and address prisoners’ literacy and numeracy needs.

Te Wānanga o Aotearoa will deliver the programmes in all prisons except Otago Corrections Facility, where the Methodist Mission Southern will run the programmes.

Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is a tertiary education organisation guided by Māori principles and values. Since April 2015, it has been delivering a National Certificate in Māori Level 2 (Te Waharoa), at five Corrections Te Tirohanga units (Māori Focus units).

Methodist Mission Southern is a private training provider based in Dunedin which delivers literacy and numeracy services to high-needs learners.
