Transport Minister Simon Bridges has turned the first sod of a major urban cycleway that will connect Auckland’s eastern suburbs with the city centre.

The Glen Innes to Tamaki Drive Shared Path is a key project in the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme which, once completed in 2018, will allow people to walk, run or cycle from the east to the harbour and city centre.

The $40 million dollar project provides another link in the Auckland Cycle Network.

Mr Bridges says this funding is helping the NZ Transport Agency and Auckland Transport to work together to speed up the delivery of a world class cycle network for the city.

“Using funding from a range of different sources, we can deliver these high-quality, priority projects much faster than would otherwise have been the case.

“This is just one of 41 cycleways around the country to be constructed from the Government’s $333 million Urban Cycleways Fund – which amounts to the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history.

“We have already seen the great success of the Grafton Gully cycleway and the progress on the impressive Nelson Street Cycleway. This will be another significant section to help join these routes and grow cycling as an integral part of Auckland’s transport network.

“This government recognises the rapid growth that Auckland is experiencing and is investing $200 million dollars in cycling across the city over the next three years to make cycling a safer, easier and more enjoyable transport option.”
