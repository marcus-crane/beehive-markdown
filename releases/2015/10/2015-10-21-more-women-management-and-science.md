Minister for Women Louise Upston has welcomed a new report released by Statistics New Zealand showing women are now almost as likely as men to work in managerial roles.

“More women in leadership is great news. It reflects the qualifications women are gaining and that New Zealand organisations are recognising the benefits of diversity.”

Statistics New Zealand’s new report examines gender and occupations over the period 1991-2013, based on census information.

Ms Upston says it provides a useful snapshot of the occupations where men and women are working.

“It is pleasing to see progress in areas where women have historically been under represented. Women have increased their representation in the physical science-related fields from 9 percent in 1991 to 21 percent in 2013.

“The report does show many occupations have either a high proportion of women or men. The Ministry for Women is working on activities to broaden the range of career options for women, particularly on roles offering high growth and good employment and income prospects.

“Women are playing an increasing role in employment in Canterbury.  There are now 7700 more women employed in Canterbury than at the same time in 2013. 

“We are also encouraging greater use of flexible work to ensure we attract and retain talented workers in the workforce,” she said.

“In order to continue growing our economy and to meet the demand for skills in the workplace I encourage employers to consider more women in a wider range of roles,” said Ms Upston.
