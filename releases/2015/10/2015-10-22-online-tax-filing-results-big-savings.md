The increase in customers filing tax online has meant big savings in postage and printing.

Revenue Minister Todd McClay says Inland Revenue was spending more than $18 million on print and postage each year, but by giving customers access to their details online, it is dropping dramatically.

“Because most customers have embraced online filing Inland Revenue has saved $600,000 per year on prepaid envelopes for Employer Monthly Schedules (EMS), and this is expected to fall much lower,” says Mr McClay.

In the 2012/13 year, the cost to send envelopes was around $840,000. In 2014-15 it reduced to $200,000, and in 2015-16 Inland Revenue expects it to drop to as low as $40,000.

“More importantly, online filing means businesses and individual taxpayers are saving time and money,” says Mr McClay.

“Already an annual personal tax summary, which used to take around 27 hours to complete, can now be done in under seven.

“Inland Revenue closely monitors how customers rate their services and know that 94 per cent of individual customers and 96 per cent of businesses who file online report high satisfaction.

“As we move forward with Business Transformation there will be continual improvements in the ease and simplicity that people and businesses deal with Inland Revenue.

“And that’s good for everyone. When paying tax is simple, more people comply,” says Mr McClay.
