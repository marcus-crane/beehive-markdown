Health Minister and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is travelling to the UK and France where he will meet his Ministerial counterparts, and also attend the final stages of the Rugby World Cup.

“I’m looking forward to meeting with both my Health and Sport Ministerial counterparts in London and Paris,” says Dr Coleman.

“I am particularly interested in hearing about innovative programmes which leverage the links between sport and health.

“Rising rates of obesity are a global issue. New Zealand is one of the first OECD countries to have a target and a comprehensive plan to tackle childhood obesity.”

Dr Coleman will meet the UK’s Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sport, Tourism and Heritage, Tracey Crouch. He intends to meet with French Health Minister, Marisol Touraine and Minister for Youth and Sport, Patrick Kanner.

While in London Dr Coleman will also meet with the Chair and Chief Executive of the National Health Service.

Dr Coleman will also be speaking at the UNESCO Conference of Parties to the International Convention against Doping in Sport in Paris.

“New Zealand’s sporting ethos is about competing hard but fair. These conferences are an important way for the international sports community to ensure we are working together against drug cheats,” says Dr Coleman.
