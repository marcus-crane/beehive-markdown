Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today formally opened Christchurch’s new $53 million Bus Interchange, with the unveiling of a plaque to mark the occasion.

“As the first Government-led anchor project to be completed in the central city, the official opening of this facility takes us another step towards the modern, easy to navigate city that has been envisaged,” Mr Brownlee says.

“With its airport-style passenger lounge and the first of the retailers already in place, I’m confident the Bus Interchange will encourage greater use of public transport.

“A lot of work has gone into the planning, design and construction needed to create this high-quality public asset.  Credit goes to all those involved in the project to deliver it on time and on budget.

“All greater Christchurch metro services now connect to the Bus Interchange, and by 2041 it’s estimated that 70,000 people will pass through the facility every day.

“The facility also incorporates artwork by local artists based on a narrative of Ngāi Tūhaitara/Tūāhuriri migration to the South Island, which adds to the distinctive Canterbury feel.

“Muffin Break is now operating in the Bus Interchange, and other retailers Zuzu Gelato, Auntie Dai’s Dumplings and an outlet for booking intercity travel are expected to open in the facility over the next few months,” Mr Brownlee says.

The first stage of the Bus Interchange was completed for public use in May and the second stage in August.
