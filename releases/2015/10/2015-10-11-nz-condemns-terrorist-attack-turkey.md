Foreign Minister Murray McCully has condemned the terrorist attack carried out in downtown Ankara, which has led to a significant death toll with hundreds more wounded.

“This is an abhorrent attack on innocent people carrying out a peaceful demonstration," Mr McCully says.

"Our thoughts are with all those affected and our deepest condolences go out to the families of those who have lost their lives.

"New Zealand has a special relationship with Turkey built on our shared history and we stand with the people and Government of Turkey in their fight against terrorism in all its forms," Mr McCully says.

There are no reports of New Zealanders being caught up in the attack, but official enquiries are continuing.
