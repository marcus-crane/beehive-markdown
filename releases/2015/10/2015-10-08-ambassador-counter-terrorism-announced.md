Foreign Minister Murray McCully today announced senior diplomat Carl Worker as New Zealand’s new Ambassador for Counter Terrorism.   

“The decision to appoint an Ambassador for Counter Terrorism was announced by the Prime Minister late last year, and reflects the importance we attach to countering the evolving international threat presented ISIL and other terrorist groups,” Mr McCully says. 

“Appointing a specialist Ambassador will enable New Zealand to contribute further to international and regional efforts to counter terrorism and allow us to expand our diplomatic engagement with important international counter terrorism forums, including the Anti-ISIL Coalition, the Global Counter Terrorism Forum, and the United Nations.

“The role will also be charged with strengthening our engagement with key partners in the Asia-Pacific, with a view to increasing New Zealand’s counter terrorism policy cooperation and capacity building in the region,” Mr McCully says. 

Mr Worker has served previously as Ambassador to China, Mongolia, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and as Consul-General in Hong Kong. He is currently serving as New Zealand’s acting Ambassador to the United States.  He will take up his New Zealand-based assignment early next year.
