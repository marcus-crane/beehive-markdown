Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says Customs officers are on patrol for the yacht season, and this year expect to welcome between 600 and 700 small craft to our shores during the warmer months.

“Yacht visitors contribute to New Zealand’s economy through tourism, berthage and marine services. Customs is an international yacht’s first port of call so it’s a great opportunity to make a first impression,” Ms Wagner says.

“The 2014/15 summer yacht season saw 620 arriving yachts including 57 superyachts. This was the highest number of superyachts since we hosted the America’s Cup in 2000.

“Most visiting small craft will arrive into Opua, Whangarei or Auckland and Customs experiences high levels of compliance from these vessels. Customs receives 93 per cent of Advance Notice of Arrivals in good time, up from 30 per cent a decade ago.

“However, global criminal organisations continue to use small craft to smuggle drugs, weapons and people and Customs remains vigilant to potential threats.

“Customs officers will conduct maritime surveillance activities over an extended period this season using the Customs vessel, Hawk IV, and Police and Navy patrol vessels.

“Experienced maritime-trained Customs officers also work behind the scenes with agency partners at the Integrated Targeting Operations Centre to assist in the identification of high risk craft.

“Earlier this year, Customs took part in a successful trial using RNZAF helicopters to conduct close in-shore air patrols. Further use of helicopters, along with maritime assets, is planned this season and Customs officers will team up with Police on both Customs and Police patrol vessels.

“It’s fantastic to see border agencies working together to welcome visitors to New Zealand’s shores while keeping our border safe,” Ms Wagner says.
