Finance Minister Bill English will travel to Sydney tomorrow to meet with new Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison.

“The New Zealand and Australian economies have many similarities – our proximity to growth in Asia, our strength in commodity exports, and most recently our increased partnership through the TPP trade agreement,” Mr English says.

“Australia is our largest trading partner. When Australia does well, we do well – so it is important to understand the prospects for the Australian economy and the views of its policy makers.”

Mr English will also present a keynote address at the Citi Australian and New Zealand Investment Conference on Thursday.

“This is an opportunity to discuss both the domestic and global investment outlook with key decision makers from the largest investment houses in Australia,” Mr English says.

“I want to ensure investors have a good understanding of the New Zealand environment and the opportunities available here.”
