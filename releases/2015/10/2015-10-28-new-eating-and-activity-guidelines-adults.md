Associate Health Minister Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has today announced the publication of new eating and activity guidelines by the Ministry of Health.

Eating and Activity Guidelines for New Zealand Adults combines the ministry’s updated nutrition and physical activity advice into one document for the first time.

Although primarily focused on adults, the advice complements the government’s recently announced package of initiatives aimed at reducing childhood obesity in New Zealand, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“We realise that to really tackle the growing problem of childhood obesity in New Zealand we need to provide advice for the whole family.”

The guidelines provide an authoritative source of information for health practitioners and others who provide information on eating and physical activity in an easy-to-use format.  The guidelines are accompanied by health education resources for consumers.

“They provide advice on healthy eating and regular physical activity that can be used for improving adult health and as the basis of healthy lifestyle advice for families,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The updated advice is based on latest international evidence and is closely linked to recommendations from the World Health Organisation and the World Cancer Research Fund, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

A panel of specialists in nutrition and physical activity helped develop the guidelines. Representatives of the health and physical activity sectors, together with everyday New Zealanders were also involved.
