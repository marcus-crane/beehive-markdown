Statistics Minister Craig Foss is celebrating World Statistics Day today with a new infographic explaining how better data leads to better lives for all New Zealanders.

“World Statistics Day is an opportunity to reflect on the enormous value of data and whether we — as a government, business, family or individual — are making the most of the opportunities it presents,” Mr Foss says.

“This new infographic uses the inner workings of an analogue wrist watch to show how information produced by Statistics NZ keeps our economy and our country ticking.”

Statistics NZ surveyed 20,000 fewer businesses last year compared to five years ago. The total time spent on surveys also decreased from 120,000 hours to 102,000 hours.

“When we collect better data we sometimes need less off it. I’m pleased to say tens of thousands of hours can now be spent on the business of being in business, and not on administration,” Mr Foss says.

“This is one of the many ways the Government is providing better public services and making it easier for businesses to interact with its agencies.

“While Statistics NZ is focussed on reducing the burden on businesses, it’s important New Zealanders know the value of the information they provide.  This new infographic is an easily accessible, visual representation of that value.”

As well as the five-yearly census, Statistics NZ produces over 240 statistical releases each year, ranging from key economic measures such as gross domestic product and employment figures, through to wellbeing measures such as social connectedness and trust in institutions.
