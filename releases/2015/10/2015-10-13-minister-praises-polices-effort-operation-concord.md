Police Minister Michael Woodhouse acknowledges today’s progress in relation to the criminal blackmail threat to poison infant milk formula with 1080 (Operation Concord).

“Today’s arrest is a milestone in what has been a long and complex investigation over the past 11 months,” says Mr Woodhouse.

"The investigation is one of the most significant undertaken by Police in recent times. Having visited the Operation Concord investigation team in Auckland I can attest to the commitment and tireless efforts which has led to today’s arrest, and I want to thank them for their efforts.”

Police have dedicated more than 30,000 staff hours to the investigation.

As the matter will be before the Courts the Minister is not able to comment further.
