Transport and Energy and Resources Minister, Simon Bridges, will attend APEC meetings in the Philippines this week, promoting economic cooperation and opportunities.

Mr Bridges will attend the 9th APEC Transportation Ministerial Meeting from 8-10 October, and the 12th APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting from 12-14 October.

The Transportation Ministerial Meeting includes sessions on investment, resilience, intelligent transport systems and clean technology.

“These are all areas where we have a strong interest, and I plan to showcase New Zealand’s adaptive approach to emerging trends in the global transportation sector.

“I will also attend bilateral meetings to discuss air services, intelligent transport systems, and the other business opportunities New Zealand offers,” he says.

At the Energy Ministerial Meeting, Mr Bridges will promote New Zealand as an exploration destination that takes a mixed and balanced approach to the world’s energy future.

“New Zealand is pursuing opportunities in both renewable and non-renewable energy. We are a world-leader in renewable energy generation, and I will take every opportunity to promote our renewable advantage.

“In my bilateral meetings I will also be encouraging APEC members to join New Zealand in leading the way to fossil-fuel subsidy reform by endorsing the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Communiqué that will be delivered to the Paris climate conference in December,” Mr Bridges says.
