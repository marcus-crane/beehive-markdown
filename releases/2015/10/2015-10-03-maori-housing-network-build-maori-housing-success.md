Minister for Māori Development Te Ururoa Flavell formally launched the Māori Housing Network at the opening of the Ranga-Bidois whānau papakāinga in Ngāruawahia today.

The Māori Housing Network has been set up under Te Puni Kōkiri to support Māori-led housing initiatives and develop greater Māori capability in the sector.

“Te Puni Kōkiri essentially becomes a one-stop shop to work alongisde whānau and lets them know what funding is available, while also offering expert advice, information and support to help improve their housing situation”, says Mr Flavell.

“There’s some great work being done, and the Ranga-Bidois papakāinga initiative is an example of that”, he says.

“Over the last four years, pūtea Māori funded the building of 95 new homes.  In addition, 110 new houses and 126 existing whare received infrastructure support”, he says.

Mr Flavell says the establishment of the Network responds to the Auditor General’s call for a single co-ordinated point of contact to better support tāngata whenua to build on Māori land.

Additional funding of $7.235 million for Māori housing was secured in Budget 2015, and existing funds that were administered by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) have been consolidated under the Network creating a total pūtea of $14.491 million per annum.

Minister Flavell says the Māori Housing Network had developed an Investment Strategy for the next three years.

“The current focus is on smaller scale projects that improve housing quality for whānau, build capability, and increase the supply of social housing”, says Mr Flavell.
