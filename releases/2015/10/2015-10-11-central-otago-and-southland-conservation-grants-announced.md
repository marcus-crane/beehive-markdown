Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner says conservation projects throughout Central Otago and Southland, including reforestation, pest control and preservation of the endangered galaxiid fish family, will all receive a boost from the Community Conservation Partnership Fund (CCPF).

“The Wakatipu basin is a highly regarded tourist destination, but at the same time it no longer has many of the native plant species which would once have been present,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Wakatipu Reforestation Trust will receive $100,000 to significantly increase native habitat in the Wakatipu basin. This will be done by partnering with the community to increase conservation volunteerism and awareness.

“The Fund will provide $66,000 to the ‘Kids Restore the Kepler’ project, to inspire young people to protect and enhance the natural environment. The project involves preservation of birdlife through pest eradication, and implementing these restoration efforts into the existing ‘Kids Restore the Kepler’ education programmes.

“The Matukituki Catchment Animal Pest Project will receive a $50,000 grant to support its collaborative approach to intensive pest control in the Matukituki Catchment. A reduction in animal pests in this area will help protect both flora and fauna.

“The Fund is providing $47,000 to help the ‘Growing our Galaxiids’ project to protect and enhance the endangered galaxiid fish species. The galaxiid is New Zealand’s largest and most endangered family of native fish, and is concentrated in areas of Southland, Otago and Canterbury.

“The project includes habitat restoration, species translocations, as well as education to empower private landowners to support galaxiid conservation.

“Pest eradication on Lake Manapouri’s Pomona Island will receive a boost, with a $47,000 grant going to the Pomona Island Charitable Trust. Following a pest eradication operation in 2007 the island was predator free for five years, however in 2012 rats re-established on Pomona.

“This funding will help the Trust to cut a 10km track linking a network of pest control traps, allowing volunteers quicker and safer access to the traps.

“As with all CCPF grants, the funding for these projects works hand in hand with contributions from community organisations and countless volunteer hours. The best conservation outcomes are achieved when government and local communities work together,” Ms Wagner says.
