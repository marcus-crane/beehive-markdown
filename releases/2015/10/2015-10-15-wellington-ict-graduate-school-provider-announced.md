Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced that three Wellington tertiary education providers will jointly host the region’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Graduate School.

“Victoria University of Wellington, WelTec and Whitireia have collaborated on developing a successful proposal for an ICT Graduate School that will be based in the heart of Wellington to support connectivity to the city’s burgeoning ICT sector,” says Mr Joyce.

“The school will work closely with local technology businesses to provide industry focused education to equip graduates with the technical skills sought by businesses.”

The Wellington ICT Graduate School will join the Auckland and Christchurch Schools that were announced in July to deliver more of the skilled ICT graduates that New Zealand needs.

“New Zealand’s ICT sector is growing rapidly, with the 2015 ICT sector report showing that exports of IT services and software have doubled since 2008,” says Mr Joyce.

“The ICT Graduate Schools are designed to provide a vital link between our fast-moving hi-tech industries and tertiary education providers.”

“Through this collaborative approach we will see ICT graduates with work-relevant, business-focused skills, as well as more direct pathways from education into employment.”

The Government committed $28.6 million over four years for the development and delivery of the three ICT Graduate Schools. Once fully established, the three schools are expected to train more than 350 students annually in one year graduate and post-graduate courses.

“The Government’s Business Growth Agenda recognises that information technology is a key driver for economic growth. This is one of many initiatives targeted towards the future growth of the ICT sector,” says Mr Joyce.

The successful ICT Graduate Schools have been selected following a competitive procurement process run by the Tertiary Education Commission and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
