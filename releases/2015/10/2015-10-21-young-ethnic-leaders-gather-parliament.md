The first group of graduates from a government initiative to nurture future ethnic leaders will gather at Parliament tomorrow.

Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the event recognises high-potential young ethnic leaders.

"We set up the Young Leaders Programme to cultivate skills, talent and connections and encourage young ethnic leaders to pursue careers in the state sector. This is a further step in creating greater ethnic diversity in leadership positions in government."

The programme is one of the first by an OECD nation to focus building leadership skills in ethnic youth and increase their representation in the public sector.

The parliamentary event will bring together 30 programme graduates from Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Canterbury.

A total of 60 young people of 25 ethnicities participated in the pilot programme in 2012 and inaugural programme in 2014.

The Young Leaders Programme is administered by the Office of Ethnic Communities. For more information go to: [http://ethniccommunities.govt.nz/story/young-leaders-programme](http://ethniccommunities.govt.nz/story/young-leaders-programme)
