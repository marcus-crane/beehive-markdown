Education Minister Hekia Parata will attend the Global Education Industry Summit in Helsinki next week before travelling to Paris to speak at the OECD.

Ms Parata will attend the Global Education Industry Summit from 19-20 October and the OECD seminar on 22 October. She will also attend meetings while in Helsinki and Paris, as well as in London.

The Global Education Industry Summit features sessions on learning environments, mobilising technology to improve education systems, digitalisation, and partnerships for transformative education policies.

“I’m looking forward to discussing and engaging in these sessions with other ministers of education and bringing new ideas back to New Zealand,” says Ms Parata.

At the OECD seminar Ms Parata will speak about New Zealand’s use of data to inform system improvement and achieve better educational outcomes.

“I will also attend several bilateral meetings in Helsinki, Paris and London to discuss international opportunities in education, educational disparities, and education policies and systems,” she says.

“New Zealand has a world-class education system and I have a lot to share with my international counterparts.

“There’s also a lot we could learn from other countries so I will be focussing on what we can tailor to New Zealand to improve our education system and further lift student achievement.”
