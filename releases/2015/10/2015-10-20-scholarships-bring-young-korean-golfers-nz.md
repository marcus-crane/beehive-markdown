Four aspiring Korean golfers are the recipients of an edu-sport scholarship announced by Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce in Korea last night.

The scholarship supports the ‘Game On English – Golf’ programme, which was launched by Prime Minister John Key in March during his visit to Korea to witness the signing of the New Zealand-Korea Free Trade Agreement. It targets talented young Koreans aged 13 years and over who aspire to become professional golfers.

“This programme brings together New Zealand’s expertise in golf coaching with our education system that consistently ranks among the best in the world,” says Mr Joyce.

“I am delighted that these talented young golfers have the opportunity to come to New Zealand to both learn English and improve their swing. The experience will help them build self-confidence, leadership and teamwork skills to reach their sporting and learning potential.”

During a month in New Zealand, the students will study at English language school Unique New Zealand and work on their golf game under the guidance of professional coaches at New Zealand’s Institute of Golf, where the youngest-ever top golfer in the world Lydia Ko was coached from the age of five.

Korean students make up the fourth largest group of international students studying in New Zealand, with 7,910 students enrolled in 2014.

Mr Joyce’s visit is to further the New Zealand Korea trade relationship, and explore possibilities for collaboration in the areas of science and technology, and education.
