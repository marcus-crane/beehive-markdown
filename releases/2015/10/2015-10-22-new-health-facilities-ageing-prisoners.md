Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has today opened a new wing at Rimutaka Prison’s High Dependency Unit to care for more ageing prisoners.

The new wing has 10 beds, taking the total number of beds at the unit to 30. 

A walkway with a ramp for wheelchair and walker access links the new wing to the original unit.

The unit was established in 2012 to meet the needs of prisoners with ongoing and complex health or disability needs.  It is the only one of its kind in New Zealand.

“The additional beds have been added to deal with an ageing prison population and will allow more men to receive the care and support they need,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Reflecting the general population, the prison population is also ageing. Corrections is aware that extra resources are needed to provide for these men.

“Prisoners generally have poorer health than the rest of the population and their bodies are often a lot older than their actual years due to lifestyle choices and neglect”. 

Mr Lotu-Iiga acknowledged the collaboration between Corrections, the Ministry of Health and Hutt Valley District Health Board in establishing the unit.

“The unit is an excellent example of agencies working together to deliver an effective service,” he said.

As at the end of September this year, there were 118 prisoners aged over 70, compared with 51 in 2011.
