Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss today announced a $150,000 grant for the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association’s (RNZRSA) support services.

Mr Foss made the announcement during his opening address to the RNZRSA’s 99th National Council meeting in Wellington this morning.

“The Government appreciates how hard the RNZRSA works for the care and welfare of our veterans.

“RSAs are at the heart of many small communities around New Zealand, working tirelessly supporting and advocating for veterans and their families.

“I know this grant will be used to further assist many veterans and, where possible, make their lives easier,” Mr Foss says.
