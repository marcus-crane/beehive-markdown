Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne is welcoming the launch today of an ‘airline-style’ patient safety card and video. The resources are available to all New Zealand hospitals. Mr Dunne says the airline industry leads the way on safety and the resources echo the industry’s simple way of ensuring people know how to stay safe.

“Based on the concept of safety advice given on aircraft before take-off, the information card has simple advice about thing such as preventing falls, blood clots, pressure injuries and infections. The video has similar information.

“The card and video will give patients more confidence and let them know what to expect during their stay in hospital. Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff work hard to ensure everyone in New Zealand receives safe, quality health care.

“For example, hospitals have introduced measures to prevent people from falling, getting infections or being given the wrong medicines, and programmes to make surgery as safe as possible.

“But there are also simple things patients can do to keep themselves safer, such as using a walking aid if they need one, doing simple leg and ankle exercises, washing their hands and talking to their doctor, nurse or pharmacists if they have any questions or concerns about their medicines”, Mr Dunne said.

The card and video have been adapted from resources used by National Health Service Trusts in England, and tested with a New Zealand audience. They are available to District Health Boards and private providers to use if they wish. Their launch coincides with Patient Safety Week 2015, which runs from 1 to 7 November.
