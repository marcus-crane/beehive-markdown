Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is calling on all New Zealanders to take part in Niue Language Week this week.

 “Niue Language Week is a chance for New Zealanders to celebrate Niuean culture and help ensure the language survives and is used”, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

 The theme of this year’s Niue Language Week, which begins today, is *“Tau tagata Niue, tau magafaoa Niue, fakaaoga e vagahau Niue – Niue people, Niue families, use vagahau Niue”*.

 “The Niuean community in New Zealand is small but passionate. They recognise the importance of safeguarding the Niuean language and culture for future generations,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

 At the last Census there were just under 24,000 people in New Zealand who identified as Niuean. The majority of them were born here. The number of Niuean speakers has declined since the previous Census.

 “Niue Language Week is about finding opportunities to increase the use of the Niuean language at home, work and in the community,” Mr Lotu-liga says.

 “I encourage everyone to attend a Niue Language Week event and learn more about Niue language, music, culture and heritage.”

The 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week later this month.
