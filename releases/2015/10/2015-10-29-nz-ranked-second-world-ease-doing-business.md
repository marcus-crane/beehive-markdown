A report ranking New Zealand as one of the best places in the world to do business has been welcomed by Regulatory Reform Minister Steven Joyce.

The World Bank’s *Doing Business* report, is an annual study measuring government regulations and their effect on business across 189 economies.

“New Zealand has been ranked second for ease of doing business for the second year in a row. It goes to show that New Zealand is a great place for investment and growing businesses,” say Mr Joyce.

New Zealand ranked first in four out of the ten categories that were measured including starting a business, registering property, getting credit and protecting minority investors.

“This report is regarded highly around the world and compliments the Government’s recently announced Investment Attraction Strategy.”

“It is of course a competitive world and other countries will be looking to improve their reputations as a good place to do business. The Government is using the Business Growth Agenda to continue to improve our regulatory settings and maintain our rating as one of the best places in the world to start and grow a business,” Mr Joyce says.
