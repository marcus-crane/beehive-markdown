Youth Minister Nikki Kaye visited Northland College in Kaikohe today with Retirement Commissioner Diane Maxwell to announce further investment in developing the potential of young people in Northland.

“The Government is committed to helping young people in Northland realise their potential and today I unveiled new ways that we’ll be doing this,” said Ms Kaye.

“We’ve already announced a major, $14 million redevelopment of Northland College. In August when I visited the college to share news of this project, I also saw the opportunity for more local youth development opportunities.

“Today, along with the Retirement Commissioner, I was pleased to tell students that the Commission for Financial Capability will invest more resources, and work with the Young Enterprise Trust, to help Northland College extend financial capability learning in the classroom.

“Financial capability is about having good financial awareness, so you can do everything from avoid getting into debt, to maybe one day starting your own business. A more financially capable society is important, because it can help create a more prosperous New Zealand.

“The Business Studies Department at Northland College for 2016 will work with the Commission and the Young Enterprise Trust to implement financial capability programmes across all year levels within the College.

“This initiative could be extended beyond the classroom and offered to other people in the local community, as well as to schools in other communities around New Zealand.

“I’ve been working with the Hon Paul Goldsmith, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, who leads work in this area and has released the [Government’s plan for financial capability](http://www.cffc.org.nz/financial-capability/national-strategy/government-statement-on-financial-capability/).

“During my visit today I also announced a one-off $15,000 grant from the Services for Young People Fund, to enable the Scouts Upper North Island Team to establish a Venturer Unit at Northland College.

“This unit will offer programmes to students that enable them to develop self-confidence and important skills such as leadership and team building. This could include opportunities to undertake the Duke of Edinburgh Hillary Awards and the Scouts Queen’s Award.

“It’s also my intention to continue to visit Northland College and Kaikohe, and provide further youth development opportunities for young people in Northland.

“I have been really impressed by the students at Northland College. I know they will make the most of these new opportunities, and I’m sure we’ll see them go on to achieve some great things in the years ahead.

“The Government is pleased to be able to work with the local community to support them along the way.”
