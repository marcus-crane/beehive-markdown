Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government will be entering into negotiations over pay rates for care and support workers.

“The Government is committed to working with providers, unions and DHBs to ensure care and support workers are recognised for their valuable work,” says Dr Coleman.

“Care and support workers play a key role helping our elderly and disabled people to live quality lives in their own homes and in residential facilities.

“With a growing ageing population it is important to ensure our health services can sustain future growth and continue to deliver the high quality homecare and residential care services that New Zealanders expect and deserve.

“The work done over the next few months will look at how to best recognise the contribution of our care and support workers.

“We are confident that the responsible approach taken by the unions, employers and funders to resolve the long standing in-between travel issue can be replicated in these discussions.” 

The negotiations will cover around 50,000 workers in aged and disability residential care, and aged and disability home and community services.

The parties include NZ Council of Trade Unions, E Tu, Public Service Association, NZ Nurses Organisation, NZ Aged Care Association, NZ Disability Support Network, Business NZ, DHB representatives and the Ministry of Health.
