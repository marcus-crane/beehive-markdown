Live to see summer by taking care on the roads this Labour Weekend, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“Labour Weekend signals that summer is just around the corner — I want everyone to live to see it, which means we all need to take care on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

“Sadly, this year’s road toll is likely to be higher than last year’s. It’s important to remember each and every number in the road toll represents a lost life — a parent, child, brother, sister or friend who will be greatly missed. 

“So, this long weekend, and every other time you get behind the wheel, be considerate of other road users, drive sober, buckle up and take a break if you’re tired.

“I encourage motorcyclists to visit [www.rideforever.co.nz](http://www.rideforever.co.nz) and check their gear is up to scratch.”

The official Labour Weekend holiday period for 2015 begins at 4pm on Friday 23 October and ends at 6am on Tuesday 27 October.
