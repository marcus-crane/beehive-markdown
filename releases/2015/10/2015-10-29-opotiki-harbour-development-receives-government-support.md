Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Economic Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell have today announced up to $3 million to finalise geotechnical investigations and design options for a new harbour entrance in Ōpōtiki.

The Ōpōtiki Harbour Development Project is one of the key initiatives of the Bay of Plenty Regional Economic Action Plan designed to lift employment, incomes and investment across the region.

“The Ōpōtiki Harbour Development Project is an exciting, community-led strategy to revitalise the economy of the eastern Bay of Plenty through the development of aquaculture, related industries and most importantly, jobs,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Harbour Project is a collaborative partnership between central, regional and local government, iwi, business and local stakeholders; a significant demonstration of what the Bay of Plenty Action Plan and the Regional Growth Programme aims to achieve.”

The validation study will include geotechnical investigation and design options to create a year-round navigable harbour entrance, Mr Flavell says. “This supports the wider harbour development project to construct a new commercial wharf which will enable a range of industries, including processing facilities for the 3,800ha offshore marine farm.

“The engineering assessment will be completed within the next two years in parallel with industry testing of the commercial viability of the mussel farm.”
