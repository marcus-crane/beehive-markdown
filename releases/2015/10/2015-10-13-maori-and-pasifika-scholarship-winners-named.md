Thirty outstanding Māori and Pasifika student teachers in early childhood, primary and secondary education were today awarded Kupe Scholarships by Education Minister Hekia Parata at a ceremony in Wellington.

Ms Parata said she was delighted to have the opportunity to present the scholarships. “These scholars all have strong track records of academic success and will help raise the status of the teaching profession among young Māori and Pasifika and provide strong role models of success in education.”

The Kupe Scholarships fund course fees and study allowances, and offer professional mentoring and recruitment support after graduation.

The recipients also receive taonga keepsakes in the form of a stylised paddle ‘hoe’ or waka / vaka / va’a as a permanent recognition of their achievements.

The Kupe Scholarship is designed to attract young, highly-talented Māori and Pasifika to the teaching profession and to help them become inspiring teachers and role models. 

The successful scholars were chosen from a large number of applicants nationally, and came through a rigorous selection process. They were drawn from across New Zealand.
