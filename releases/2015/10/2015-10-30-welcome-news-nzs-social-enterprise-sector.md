Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Hon Jo Goodhew has welcomed today’s announcement by the Ākina Foundation that New Zealand will host the Social Enterprise World Forum in 2017.

“Social enterprises are organisations that use commercial models to generate income for social or environmental goals,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“By combining social goals and business methods, social enterprise has the potential to play a significant role in economic development, and innovative business that supports the social sector.

“Despite being a fledgling industry in New Zealand, impressive pockets of growth are bringing real results for communities throughout the country.”

“By hosting the World Forum, our local social entrepreneurs will access international expertise from countries where social enterprise is already well established.

“Congratulations to Chief Executive Alex Hannant and the Ākina Foundation staff for seeing through their vision for Christchurch to host the World Forum in 2017.”

Government funding has helped the Ākina Foundation support more than 600 aspiring and operating social enterprises across New Zealand, and launch 11 ventures from their successful pilot ‘Launchpad’ accelerator programme.
