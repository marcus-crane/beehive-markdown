Prime Minister John Key will travel to Marrakech, Brussels and London for a series of high level meetings and to chair a meeting of the International Democrat Union (IDU). 

In Marrakech, Mr Key will chair a meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Democrat Union, before travelling on to Brussels where he will meet with President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.

“The EU is a key trade partner for New Zealand with two-way trade totalling more than $19.5 billion,” says Mr Key. 

“In March 2014 the EU signalled its openness to look more closely at our trade and economic relationship, including New Zealand as a potential FTA partner.  My visit to Brussels provides the opportunity to progress those discussions and agree on next steps.”

Following his visit to Brussels, the Prime Minister will have a range of meetings in London, including a private dinner with Prime Minister Rt Hon David Cameron and an audience with Her Majesty The Queen.

He will also attend events that support New Zealand’s trade and tourism interests and All Blacks matches in the latter stages of the Rugby World Cup. 

Trade Minister Tim Groser will accompany the Prime Minister to Brussels and London.

Mr Key will depart on 23 October, returning on 2 November.
