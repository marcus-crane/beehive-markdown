Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Vicki Poole as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Timor-Leste.

“New Zealand has a close friendship with Timor-Leste and we have been proud to work alongside Timor-Leste throughout its nation building process,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand provides support through our aid programme for Timor-Leste’s sustainable economic development, education and skills training, and the security and justice sectors.

“Internationally, Timor-Leste is a valued partner for New Zealand, championing our bid for a seat on the UN Security Council and leading the G7+ grouping of fragile states,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Poole was previously Deputy Director for Pacific Development, and has recently served in the New Zealand Delegation to the OECD in Paris.
