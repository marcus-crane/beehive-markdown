Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the appointment of Alison Barrass to the Callaghan Innovation Board.

Callaghan Innovation was established in 2013 to support science and technology-based innovation and its commercialisation by businesses, in order to improve their growth and competitiveness.

Ms Barrass has considerable experience in the fast-moving consumer goods sector and in governance, leadership and marketing-led innovation. She is Chief Executive of Griffins Foods Ltd, one of New Zealand’s largest food brands, and on the board of plumbing hardware manufacturer Methven.

She was previously Chair of the Breast Cancer Research Trust for three years and a director of the New Zealand Food and Grocery Council.

The Callaghan Innovation Board consists of members with a broad range of skills and expertise and the right mix of business and science experience relevant to the high-value manufacturing and services sector, Mr Joyce says.

“I am looking forward to the expertise that Alison will bring to Callaghan Innovation.”
