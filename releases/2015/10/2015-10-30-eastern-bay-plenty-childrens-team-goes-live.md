Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has today officially launched the Eastern Bay of Plenty Children’s Team in Whakatane, the seventh to be rolled out across the country.

The new team will ensure that children with multiple and complex needs have a single point of contact and an individually-tailored and co-ordinated support plan, with agencies working together to provide the best outcomes for kids, so they don’t need state intervention.

The Eastern Bay of Plenty Children’s Team will cover Matata, across to Waihau and down to Minginui, and includes Whakatane, Opotiki, Edgecombe and Kawerau. It is expected to work with around 400 vulnerable children in the first two years.

“Children’s Teams are about working together in a different way to get better outcomes for at-risk children, and to keep them safe from abuse and neglect,” Mrs Tolley says.

“If everyone working with a child sits around the table, shares information and co-ordinates services we can get better outcomes for these children and their families.

“This is not about adding more services, but making sure those children who need support have access to the right services at the right time.”

“A lot of work has gone into launching the Eastern Bay of Plenty Children’s Team and I want to thank all of those involved for their hard work and dedication,” Mrs Tolley says.

“While the hard work is just beginning, I know everyone involved in this Children’s Team is dedicated to making sure vulnerable children in the Eastern Bay of Plenty have every opportunity to succeed.”

Children’s Teams are also being established in Whanganui, Christchurch and Counties Manukau. Children’s Teams have already been launched and are accepting referrals in Rotorua, Whangarei, Marlborough, Ōtaki/Horowhenua, Hamilton and Tairawhiti.
