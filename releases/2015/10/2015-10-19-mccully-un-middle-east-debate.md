Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to New York this week to participate in a UN Security Council open debate on the Middle East.

“As the current President of the Security Council, Spain has announced that the Council’s quarterly public debate on the Middle East will this month be at Ministerial-level given the significance of recent developments in the region,” Mr McCully says.

“The current levels of violence in the Middle East, and the urgent need to get the Middle East Peace Process back on track, have given the regular open debate greater urgency.

“New Zealand has long called for the Security Council to work in a cohesive way to address some of these issues and we welcome Spain’s decision to elevate this debate to Ministers,” Mr McCully says.

While in New York Minister McCully will meet with senior UN officials and other Ministers participating in the debate.
