The Inquiry report into Phillip John Smith / Traynor’s escape is being released alongside the Government’s response to its findings, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

A Government Inquiry was launched in December 2014, following Mr Smith / Traynor’s abscondment while on temporary release from prison.

“I am confident that this review provides information needed by agencies to assist with their response to vulnerabilities identified through Mr Smith / Traynor’s departure from New Zealand,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Justice Minister Amy Adams will now be leading the work programme coordinating how agencies respond to the findings of this report.”

The Inquiry was Chaired by Hon Dr John Priestley, a retired High Court judge, and he was assisted by Simon Murdoch CNZM, a former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Chief Executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

“I would like to thank Dr Priestley and Mr Murdoch for their diligence and hard work over the past few months,” Mrs Bennett says.

A copy of the Inquiry report is attached.
