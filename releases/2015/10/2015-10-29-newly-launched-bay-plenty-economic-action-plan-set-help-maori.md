Māori have stamped their mark on the newly launched Toi Moana Bay of Plenty Regional Economic Action Plan which aims to lift employment, incomes and investments across the region.

Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell is welcoming the Action Plan saying it will help tāngata whenua realise their aspiration of being self-sufficient. 

“Tāngata whenua have added their voice to the Action Plan that aims to grow nine priority areas including Māori land utilisation, agribusiness, aquaculture, education and skills, forestry, geothermal and horticulture”, he says.

Iwi, businesses, local and central government have worked together to develop the plan.

Mr Flavell says the Action Plan clearly identifies the important contribution iwi and hapū make to the region already and the priority they place on better utilising Māori land.

“Māori in the region own more than 400,000 hectares of land. The Toi Moana Bay of Plenty Action Plan will provide them with support to develop their whenua through numerous mechanisms such as partnerships, joint ventures and knowledge sharing. The Action Plan will complement the reform of the Ture Whenua Act which will make it easier for Māori land owners to use their land”, he says.

The Action Plan also highlights economic development opportunities for Māori in geothermal energy, horticulture and aquaculture.
