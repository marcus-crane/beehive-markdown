Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today announced the release of the updated Disability Action Plan 2014-2018 for the second round of public consultation.

“This is about making sure the Plan remains relevant and focuses on what will make the most difference for disabled people. Feedback from the first round of public consultation has been incorporated into the updated Plan,” Ms Wagner says.

“As a result of feedback so far, there are new actions planned in the areas of increasing employment and economic opportunities for disabled people, using data to deliver better outcomes and investigating how technology can reduce barriers.

“The Disability Action Plan 2014-2018 adds value by applying a whole of Government approach and bringing multiple agencies together to act on disability issues.

“New Zealand has a worldwide reputation for involving disabled people in decision making and the process for updating the Disability Action Plan is no exception. I encourage all people with an interest in disability issues to have their say,” Ms Wagner says.
