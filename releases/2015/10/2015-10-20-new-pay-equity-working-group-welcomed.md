Employers and unions have agreed to a Government proposal to set up a Joint Working Group to develop principles for dealing with claims of pay equity under the Equal Pay Act.

Minister for Women Louise Upston says she is pleased that gender equality issues are on the table and this is another way the Government is taking proactive steps to look at how the gender pay gap can be closed.

‘Until women have equal rights, equal choice, equal opportunities, equal expectations and are valued equally there is more work to be done. These constructive conversations are a big step in the right direction, and I am confident that we can reach an outcome that is beneficial for all parties involved.’

Minister of State Services Paula Bennett and Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Woodhouse say the group will recommend agreed principles on pay equity that could be applied in all sectors of the economy.
