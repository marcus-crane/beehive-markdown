Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today announced changes to the International Relationships Fund to better support high-quality international science collaborations.

The changes follow an independent evaluation commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which determined that the fund was valued but that adjustments were required to improve its impact.

“International collaboration strengthens the capacity of our science system and ensures New Zealand remains at the forefront of new developments,” Mr Joyce says.

“The redesigned fund will be simplified, streamlined and flexible to ensure we target investment in the right areas and can respond to emerging opportunities.”

The new fund will be called The Catalyst Fund and will consist of four funding streams that target investment in leadership, influence, seeding and strategic co-operation.

“Funding levels will not change at this time, with The Catalyst Fund continuing to invest around $9.3 million per annum in strategic international science and innovation collaboration,” Mr Joyce says.

“Some programmes and activities currently supported by the fund and administered by MBIE, the Health Research Council and the Royal Society of New Zealand will continue, while others may be provided for through more open funding instruments.

“International science and innovation links are a key part of the Government’s plan to improve economic performance and increase New Zealanders’ wealth and wellbeing.

“The Catalyst Fund will ensure we’re at the forefront of advances in science and that we are making the most of our international partnerships.”

MBIE will be launching a new investment round for this fund on 5 October 2015.  For more information: [HERE](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/investment-funding/current-funding/funding-for-international-relationships)
