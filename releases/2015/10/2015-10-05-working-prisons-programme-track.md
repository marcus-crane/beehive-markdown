All Corrections-run prisons are now either working prisons or well on their way to reaching that status, with the aim of helping prisoners lead crime-free lives on release.

In working prisons, all eligible prisoners are engaged in industry, learning and/or rehabilitation activities for 40 hours a week.

“Working prisons help prisoners develop skills, experience and behaviour that will help them to find jobs and stability following release,” says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“This focus on preparing prisoners for release is a key part of our government’s efforts to reduce reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”

Tongariro/Rangipo Prison, Rolleston Prison and Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility have been working prisons since December 2014.

Four more prisons - Northland Region Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility, Hawkes Bay Prison and Otago Corrections Facility - attained working prison status in June 2015.

All other Corrections-run prisons have either implemented their plans or are in the process of doing so, with the goal that all will be working prisons by 2017.

“Prisons are aligning their activities for prisoners with the skills they will need for employment on release,” said Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Corrections has also been entering into partnerships with employers to offer job opportunities for prisoners. Jobs can help prisoners lead crime-free lives when they are released. That is also good for their families and their communities.”

Working prisons activities include:

- More opportunities for prisoners to attain education qualifications
