Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce today announced a new scholarship for European Union (EU) students that will allow them to study for a semester at a New Zealand university.

The announcement comes during Prime Minister John Key’s visit to Europe to advance the bilateral and trade relationship between the EU and New Zealand.

Up to $100,000 in funding will target Study Abroad students from throughout the EU. The scholarships will contribute towards study costs at any of New Zealand’s eight universities, where they will earn academic credit towards the programmes they are enrolled in at their home institutions.

“Study Abroad students typically like to travel and experience a different culture while improving their English language skills,” Mr Joyce says. “New Zealand is an education destination among the best in the world, offering a supportive, welcoming and safe learning environment.

“New Zealand universities are ranked among the top three percent in the world and in addition, we have an enviable lifestyle with majestic mountains and beautiful beaches on our doorstep.”

The scholarships will initially be offered for study in semester two 2016 (July till November) and semester one 2017 (February till June).

In 2014, 1773 students from EU member states attended a New Zealand university.

Further information will be available from early January on Education New Zealand’s [website](http://www.enz.govt.nz/our-services/scholarships).
