Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced Community Conservation Partnership Fund (CCPF) grants for projects in the Nelson and Marlborough regions, with support for conservation of long-tailed bats and native birds, and restoration of local wetlands.

“The CCPF will provide $127,000 to help the Brook Waimarama Sanctuary Trust develop a large pest-free sanctuary for wildlife close to Nelson City,” Ms Wagner says.

“This funding will allow the Trust to complete the next stages of sanctuary development, including eradicating pests within the site, initiating pest monitoring and preparing native species for reintroduction.

“The Brook Waimarama Sanctuary will allow native birds, including the New Zealand falcon, yellow-crowned parakeet, weka and robins, to flourish along with 250 species of native plants.

“The 715 hectare sanctuary is expected to transform the surrounding area over time as young native birds disperse from the protected site.

“The Fund will also provide $113,000 to help conservation efforts for the New Zealand long-tailed bat in the Upper South Island.

“This support will help Forest and Bird to carry out predator control programmes, as well as bat monitoring, near the Pelorus Bridge Scenic Reserve. The long-tailed bat is endemic to New Zealand.

“The Grovetown Lagoon Restoration Project will receive $37,000 to support restoration efforts of the 9 hectare Springs Wetland near Blenheim.

“The Springs Wetland, between the eastern arm of the Grovetown Lagoon ox-bow and the Wairau River, has the potential to be a leading venue for wetland education.

“By removing invasive plant species, native plant species, including the cabbage tree, raupo and kahikatea will have a better chance to thrive throughout the wetland. This in turn will attract a mix of native and exotic birdlife to the area, including the paradise shelduck, the grey teal and the white heron.

“I am thrilled to see a range of community conservation projects – from birds to bats to wetlands – supported in the Nelson and Marlborough regions and I look forward to hearing about the good results in years to come,” Ms Wagner says.
