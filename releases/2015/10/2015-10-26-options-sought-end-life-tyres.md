The Government is seeking innovative ideas on how New Zealand can better use the millions of end-of-life tyres through the Waste Minimisation Fund, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today. 

“New Zealand generates about four million end-of-life tyres each year. About one million are re-exported for material recovery and waste energy, and the remaining three million go to landfill or end up not being responsibly disposed of. We are seeking innovative bids from businesses that have the technology and marketing skills to develop a practical use for the waste tyres that will generate jobs and a better environmental outcome,” Dr Smith says. 

“There is strong interest from the tyre industry in a compulsory collection system and prohibition on waste tyres going to landfill. The problem is identifying alternative uses. The markets for recycled rubber products like mats and artificial turf are limited. We need to grow these materials as well as find more ways to use waste tyres if we are to find an enduring and sustainable solution to this waste problem. Possible alternatives include using the tyres as a source of fuel in cement kilns and power stations.” 

The Government’s Waste Minimisation Fund was established in 2009 and is funded by a levy that is charged on waste disposed of at landfills, of $10 per tonne. Over $60 million has been awarded to more than 100 projects to date. This current funding round is specifically focused on end-of-life tyres and closes on 11 November. 

“New Zealand’s current management of waste tyres does not match up with our clean green brand. Too many end up in rivers and on the coast, or unwanted stockpiles posing a fire risk. Our ambition from this initiative is to fund work with entrepreneurs on a solution that can create jobs and improve the environment.”
