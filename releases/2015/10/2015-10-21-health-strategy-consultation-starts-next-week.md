Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government will be consulting with the sector and the public on the draft updated New Zealand Health Strategy.

“It’s important that the health sector has a clear, unified direction based on a shared set of values,” says Dr Coleman.

“We need a new vision for the next 10 years as the Health Strategy has not been updated since 2000.

“The draft Strategy sets a clear view of the future we want for our health system to ensure that all New Zealanders live well, stay well, and get well.”

The Health Strategy covers five strategic themes – people-powered, closer to home, value and high performance, one team, and smart system.

Priorities include prevention and wellbeing, more integrated services, support for innovation, better collaboration, new ways of working to reach our most vulnerable, giving every child a healthy start, and ensuring information and services are more accessible.

The Health Strategy will be supported by a Roadmap, which sets the direction for the next five years.

“The Strategy will help the sector meet our future health needs with more integrated patient-centred services delivered in the community, and a stronger push on prevention and self-management,” says Dr Coleman.

“We look forward to further engaging with the sector on the draft Strategy. We also want to encourage feedback from the public.”

The Ministry will be consulting on the draft Strategy and Roadmap from 27 October to 4 December 2015. People are also encouraged to take part in an online discussion forum. For more information visit: [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz)

The Health Strategy is expected to be released in the first half of 2016.
