A record high number of offenders serving community sentences have enrolled in Corrections-funded work and living skills interventions.

In the last financial year the number of offenders throughout the country enrolled in work and living skills interventions (WLS) interventions increased to 5152.

In the 2014 financial year the number was about 600.

WLS interventions provide training that aims to have a positive effect on offenders’ lives. WLS training covers a wide variety of skills including driving, parenting and budgeting skills and skills to increase employment opportunities.

“We know offenders who are motivated to attend training are also more likely to comply with their sentences,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Motivating and helping offenders leads to less crime and fewer people in prison or on community-based sentences and orders. This is good for the offenders, their families and the community.

“It is also good for our goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”

Judges are able to convert up to 20 per cent of a sentence to basic WLS interventions for eligible offenders.

“Participating in WLS interventions is not an easy way out,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Offenders must complete all the agreed WLS hours satisfactorily or none will count against their community work sentence.”
