Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new Bill will ensure Support Workers are paid for the time and costs travelling between clients.

The Home and Community Support (Payment for Travel Between Clients) Settlement Bill has passed its first reading and has been referred to the Health Committee for consideration.

“The Bill sets in place an enduring, affordable, and sustainable framework to remedy the in-between travel issue between Crown funded employers and their employees,” says Dr Coleman.

“It represents an important milestone in recognising the valuable work of people who provide care and support to assist elderly and disabled New Zealanders to stay living in their own homes.

“This is a responsible approach to not only resolving a long standing industry issue, but to also setting out a roadmap for ensuring there continues to be a skilled workforce available to support New Zealanders to live in their homes and be part of the wider community.”

The Bill resolves a claim filed in the Employment Relations Authority. It will implement a settlement agreement between support workers, service providers, unions, DHBs and the Crown.

The settlement agreement also sets out an agreed process for investigating transitioning this important workforce towards a more regularised employment model.
