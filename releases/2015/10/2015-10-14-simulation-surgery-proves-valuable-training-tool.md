Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an evaluation report shows surgical teams benefited from a training centre which simulates operations.

The University of Auckland has been running a replica operating theatre with funding support from Health Workforce New Zealand.

120 health professionals including surgeons, surgical trainees, anaesthetists, anaesthetic technicians, and nurses from Auckland took part in the course.

“The Multidisciplinary Operating Room Simulation project was designed to be a course for teams of operating room staff to train together to improve teamwork which can lead to better outcomes and reduce patient harm,” says Dr Coleman.

“Simulation training is not new for surgical staff, but it is traditionally taught by each discipline separately. The Simulation Centre for Patient Safety brought surgeons, nurses, anaesthetists, and technicians together.

“This type of training is still rare worldwide. In Auckland, the training teams were able to be put to the test operating on realistic surgical mannequins which can bleed, breathe and be monitored.

“An evaluation report of the course has shown clear benefits of this training. Feedback from participants was very positive, and there was evidence of improved information sharing and teamwork.

“Participants rated the course highly, with realistic simulations where they behaved as they would in real life. Nearly two-thirds reported positive changes in their clinical practice following the course.”

The report is available on the Ministry of Health’s website: [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz)
