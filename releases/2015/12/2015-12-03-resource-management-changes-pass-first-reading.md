A Bill to overhaul the Resource Management Act has passed its first reading in Parliament by 92 votes to 14, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today.

“The changes in this bill will support job growth, more affordable housing and better environmental management. The support of 75 per cent of Parliament reinforces that this is a moderate sensible reform that deserves broad support,” Dr Smith says.

The Bill, which is made up of 40 proposals, will deliver substantive, system-wide improvements to resource management law, to achieve:

- Stronger national direction, including better management of significant risks from natural hazards
- Better plan making, to create more flexibility to be more responsive to needs
- Simpler consenting, including quicker consenting options for simple proposals
- More affordable housing, with requirements on councils to ensure sufficient land development capacity
- Improved alignment with other Acts, to reduce duplication and costs
- Process improvements, to ensure timely, efficient and cost effective processes
- Improved Maori participation, to provide better processes for iwi to be involved in council plan making.

“A key feature of this set of reforms is greater national direction to improve consistency, set clear guidance for councils and cut out unnecessary duplication of environment controls across the country. The management of significant risks from natural hazards will be added as a matter of national importance to section 6 of the RMA.

“The changes include a new national planning template to improve consistency of plans across New Zealand, making them easier and cheaper to use and review. Plan-making can be sped up and made more flexible so councils can address urgent local issues like housing shortages.

“The proposed changes will reduce the number of consents by thousands each year. The Bill will simplify the consenting process to reduce costs and unnecessary delays so consents fit the scale of the proposed activity. Some minor activities will no longer require resource consents and a new 10-day fast-track consent will be available for simple projects. The costs of consents will be made more transparent.

“The changes support a range of initiatives to improve housing affordability.  Councils will need to proactively plan to have enough residential and business land for population growth. Appeals will be limited on consents for infrastructure for housing The bill phases out the double charging regime between development contributions under the Local Government Act and financial contributions under the RMA.

“The Bill also makes important improvements to environmental management. It will enable regulations to require stock like dairy cows to be fenced out of rivers and lakes, with instant fines for breaches. It requires decommissioning plans for offshore oil and gas rigs”.

The Bill has been referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee for public submissions and a full select committee process.
