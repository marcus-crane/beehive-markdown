The government remains committed to introducing legislation that will enable co-operation across councils, Local Government Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“When councils need to work together to deliver better local services for their ratepayers, it should be easier for them to do so. At present it is difficult for functions and responsibilities to either be shared or transferred across local and regional councils,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“In 2016 new legislation will be introduced that makes it easier for councils to work together to provide more efficient services for their communities. I supported this initiative when it was first announced and I will be working closely with the sector to achieve support.

“I want councils to be able to decide to work together by passing simple resolutions following appropriate consultation. The only solution should not be forced amalgamation with the social and financial costs that involves.

“I support efficient, tailor-made, regional solutions to our big infrastructure challenges.  Technology is driving new solutions for councils to work across boundaries. There is an urgent need to act and this government is on course to allow councils greater freedom to choose how they do so,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
