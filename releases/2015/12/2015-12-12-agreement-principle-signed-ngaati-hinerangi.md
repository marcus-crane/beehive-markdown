The Crown has signed an agreement in principle with Ngaati Hinerangi to settle its historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Ngaati Hinerangi is an iwi from the Tainui waka confederation whose area of interest extends from Matamata to the Western Bay of Plenty and encompasses the Kaimai Range.

“The agreement in principle marks the start of the next phase of negotiations with Ngaati Hinerangi and is an important milestone for both the iwi and the Crown. This agreement provides the basis for a more detailed deed of settlement,” Mr Finlayson said.

The agreement in principle outlines a broad settlement package which includes Crown apology redress as well as financial, commercial and cultural redress.

The settlement includes transfer of sites in the Kaimai Range, with continuity of public access guaranteed to all but one site of high cultural significance to the iwi. All existing third party interests will be maintained by the settlement.

“These sites are of profound cultural and historical significance to Ngaati Hinerangi and are valuable to New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Finlayson said. “This agreement balances the interests of the public, the Crown and Ngaati Hinerangi.”
