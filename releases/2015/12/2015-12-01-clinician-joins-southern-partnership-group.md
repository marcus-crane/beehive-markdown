Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has announced that Dr Margaret Wilsher has been appointed to the Southern Partnership Group.

The Southern Partnership Group was set up in September to oversee the redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital. Dr Wilsher joins Chair Andrew Blair, Andrew Connolly, Dr Tony Lanigan and Richard Thomson.

“Dr Wilsher brings significant clinical expertise to the Southern Partnership Group,” says Dr Coleman.

 “She is currently the Chief Medical Officer at Auckland DHB and also has extensive experience in health sector governance, including on the Hospital Partnership Redevelopment Group for Canterbury DHB.

 “The Government is committed to the redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital and ensuring the people of Southern receive the health services they need.

“The Southern Partnership Group will provide governance oversight of the redevelopment process, working closely with the DHB and Commissioner.

“To be done well, hospital redevelopments take time - particularly in the early stages where considerable work is needed to define how services will work in the future and how best to configure them.”
