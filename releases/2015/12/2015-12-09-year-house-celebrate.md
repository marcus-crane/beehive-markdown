Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee says there is much to celebrate in the Government’s busy and productive legislative year, which ended with Parliament’s adjournment this afternoon.

“The House sat for 88 days this year, compared to 70 days in 2014,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We saw 120 bills pass their third reading and become law this year.

“This included the KiwiSaver HomeStart Bill, reflecting the Government’s commitment to help over 90,000 Kiwi families into their first home through the new $435m HomeStart grants scheme.

“A continuing priority for the Government is the settlement of all historical Treaty grievances, a process being superbly led by the Minister for Treaty Settlements Christopher Finlayson.

“Parliament’s Business Committee has further developed its important role in facilitating the best from an MMP Parliament.

“The Committee has enabled extended hours on six occasions this year, some of which was used to further progress Treaty Legislation. I want to commend the parties and members across the House for support of this procedure. 

“Six settlement bills passed their third reading into law, including the completion of the Te Hiku Claims Settlement Bill.  A further four settlement bills had their first reading and were sent off to Select Committee.

“Extended sitting hours have been used to progress non-controversial legislation since 2012, meaning the rate at which Treaty claims are settled has increased significantly.

“Parliament sat for 30 weeks in 2015; there were 87 question times with members answering 1044 oral questions and thousands more supplementary questions.

“There have been 1177 papers presented this year, similar to 2014.

“Up until Monday 8 December, Ministers had been asked 16,180 written questions.

“I want to thank all Members of the House for their hard work this year, and wish them, their families and friends a safe and enjoyable holiday season,” Mr Brownlee says.
