Today marks the start of a new phase in Christchurch’s earthquake recovery, with responsibility for around 8,000 residential red zone properties transferring from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ).

Minister for Land Information, Louise Upston, said the transfer will provide communities with confidence about the future management of the land.

“The immediate focus will be on maintaining current service levels and minimising any disruption to residents and neighbours of red zone properties.

“LINZ has a huge amount of experience managing Crown-owned property. The residential red zones – particularly in the Port Hills – come with their own set of challenges.

“To make sure these are properly addressed, LINZ will be engaging closely with the community, councils, emergency services, Ngāi Tahu, and other central government agencies.

“CERA has done a fantastic job setting the framework for the new Christchurch, and leading the recovery and rebuild efforts. But with CERA winding down in April 2016, it’s time to start looking to the long-term arrangements for the regeneration of the city,” Minister Upston said.

Government’s decision to transfer responsibilities for these properties was outlined in the Transition Recovery Plan released by the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery in October.

From 1 December LINZ will be responsible for completing demolitions and clearances of residential red zone properties in the flatlands and Port Hills areas, and for interim management of the land. LINZ will not make decisions about the long-term use of the properties.

CERA will continue to manage the voluntary Crown offer process, working to help those with red zone properties who want to sell their land and homes to the Crown.

The timeframes for the public engagement on the future use of the Christchurch red zones are still to be determined. Once this engagement is complete, CERA will work in conjunction with Regenerate Christchurch to determine the future use of specific areas and what work will be required to meet this.
