New food safety regulations under the Food Act 2014 will allow businesses to keep their costs down by managing food safety well says Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew.

“These new regulations are designed to help businesses as well as consumers,” says Mrs Goodhew. “It will help us keep pace with changes in science and technology, and bring efficiencies for business.”

“One way the new regulations do this is by regulating food activities according to risk. A high risk business, like a meat pie manufacturer, will be checked more often than a low risk business like a corner dairy.”

“Under the new law, rather than being checked annually, businesses will be checked less often if they are performing well and more often if they are performing badly. This means many will pay less to be regulated.

“New Zealand is already a world leader in food safety. This comprehensive package of regulations further strengthens our food safety system, protecting people’s health and our reputation as a trusted supplier of safe food,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The new law will affect more than 45,000 food businesses. From 1 March 2016 all new businesses must comply with the new law, but existing businesses have some time to transition.

The Ministry for Primary Industries has information available online, including the tool ‘Where do I fit?’ which helps businesses find out how the new law applies to them. It also includes step by step guides for following the new rules. To prepare for the new law, visit [www.mpi.govt.nz/foodact](http://www.mpi.govt.nz/foodact)
