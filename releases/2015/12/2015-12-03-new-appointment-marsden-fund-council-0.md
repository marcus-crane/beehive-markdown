Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced today the appointment of a new member to the Marsden Fund Council.

Emeritus Professor Carolyn Burns joined the Council for three years from December 1 and will convene the Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour Panel.

“Emeritus Professor Burns is a well respected scientist with strong leadership, governance experience and an excellent research track record,” Mr Joyce says.

“Her role on the Marsden Fund Council will involve assessing and recommending funding for research proposals, providing strategic direction for the Fund, and helping ensure that the relevance and importance of Marsden-funded research is communicated to the New Zealand public.”

Emeritus Professor Burns is a researcher in the Department of Zoology at the University of Otago. Her areas of expertise are in biological processes and population dynamics in lakes, plankton ecology and productivity, water quality, the effects of climate change, and conservation of freshwater ecosystems.

Mr Joyce also announced today that Professor Jarg Pettinga has been reappointed to the Marsden Fund Council for a three-year term, also from December 1, and will continue to convene the Earth Sciences and Astronomy Panel.

“In 2015, $53.5m is being invested in 92 new research projects through the Marsden Fund, which supports excellent investigator-led research in order to promote high-quality science in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says. 

“Since its inception in 1994, the Marsden Fund has been instrumental in further developing advanced research skills in New Zealand, as well as attracting and retaining top research talent. 

“I welcome the contribution that the new and reappointed members will make to New Zealand’s science and innovation system.”
