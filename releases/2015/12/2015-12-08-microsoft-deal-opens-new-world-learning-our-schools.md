A new agreement with Microsoft will reduce IT complexity for schools and enhance access to the online world for students, enabling them to learn anywhere, any time and on any device, says Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

Ms Kaye announced the new agreement between the Ministry of Education and Microsoft during a visit to Lyall Bay School in Wellington this afternoon.

“The Ministry has extended its Schools’ Agreement with Microsoft NZ for the next three years. The new contract includes a range of exciting features that will benefit schools, teachers, students and their families alike,” says Ms Kaye.

“A key feature of the new agreement is that it will enable schools to move to a cloud-based IT environment.

“This means instead of storing software, teaching information and student records on school PCs and servers, it can now be stored in the cloud, reducing both cost and IT complexity for schools.

“An added bonus in the deal for students and teachers in schools using Office 365, is that they will be able to download Office software to their personal devices and home computers free of charge.

“In the past, you might have paid around $200 a year to license Office. This is a significant saving that will help more students and their families use the online world for learning.

“21st Century learning and education goes beyond the classroom and this agreement reflects that. It gives schools, teachers and students the latest software to help them work together on projects, share documents and give and receive feedback in real time.

“Under the agreement, the Ministry and Microsoft will work together to provide support and training to schools to help them make the transition to a cloud-based system. New software supplied to schools as part of the deal makes it easier for schools to run their IT environment, freeing them up to concentrate on teaching.

“I recently announced that around 90 per cent of schools are now connected to the N4L Managed Network, which provides high-speed internet and uncapped data funded by the Crown, and all schools will be able to connect by the end of next year at the latest.

“The Government is committed to helping schools and students harness the power of digital technologies to enhance teaching and learning, and this latest agreement between the Ministry and Microsoft is further testament to this.

“Technology is changing the world we live and work in at an ever-increasing rate, and we want every student to gain the skills necessary to succeed in that world, no matter where they live or go to school in New Zealand.”
