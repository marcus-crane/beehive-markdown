Newly built social housing units in West Auckland will ensure more vulnerable people can access healthy, modern housing while they need it, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

Mrs Bennett today opened 10 new units developed by VisionWest Community Trust at Triangle Road, Massey. The 30-bedroom development cost $4.3 million, which included $2 million in funding from the Government’s Social Housing Unit fund.

“Auckland desperately needs more social housing, especially in West and South Auckland, so I’m thrilled to open these brand new units,” Mrs Bennett says.

Last week, the Government announced that it would partner with five community organisations to increase the number of social housing properties available in Auckland by 508. These units are separate and in addition to that announcement.

“VisionWest is an outstanding organisation that has local knowledge and genuinely care about its tenants’ and clients’ often complex needs,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The Government is supporting groups like this to play a bigger role in social housing because we want to unlock more of that frontline experience and partner with them to house more vulnerable people.”
