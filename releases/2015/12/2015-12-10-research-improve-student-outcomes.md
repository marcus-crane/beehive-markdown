Education Minister Hekia Parata says six new research projects granted funding for the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative will benefits teachers and students for years to come.

Ms Parata has congratulated this year’s recipients of the fund, which has supported 125 high calibre projects since it began in 2003. 

“A lot of this research is focussed on improving outcomes for all students, no matter their backgrounds,” says Ms Parata.

“New research topics include how to get Māori and Pasifika boys excited about writing, student well-being in the wake of the Canterbury earthquakes, and language programmes in intermediate schools.”

The six projects will receive a total of $1.125 million over two years, and are designed to overcome challenges faced in classrooms every day.

“The fund intends to get teachers and researchers working together to find solutions. This is essential if we want to keep improving our kids’ experience of education and the options they have once they leave school,” says Ms Parata.

“The calibre of applications was very high this year. The successful projects will look at a wide range of topics, from primary teaching in low socio-economic areas to mathematics techniques in secondary and tertiary settings.”
