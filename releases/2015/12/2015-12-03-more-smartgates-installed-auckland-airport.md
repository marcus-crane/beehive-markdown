Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today officially opened the first nine brand new SmartGates – or eGates – installed at Auckland International Airport for departing passengers in time for summer’s peak travel season.

“As part of Budget 2015, the Government is investing $6.6 million to more than double the number of SmartGates, with 29 new gates being installed over the next 12-18 months,” Ms Wagner says.

“The first nine new gates are now up and running at Auckland Airport in time for Christmas. As 75 per cent of international travellers pass through Auckland Airport, it made sense to introduce them here in time for the busy season.

“The first of their kind in New Zealand, this next generation technology performs passport and emigration checks at the gate, making it quicker and easier for passengers.

“The new technology incorporates the passport scanner into the gate, eliminating the need for the kiosk and ticket. Departing passengers scan their passport and step up to the biometric scanner, which is faster and more efficient than the current two-step process.

“Having nine new gates more than doubles Customs’ capacity for departing passengers. The four previous SmartGates are being put to good use too – they have been relocated, so arriving passengers also have more gates from next week.

“The expansion and modernisation of SmartGate will help manage the increasing numbers of travellers, which is expected to grow by 2.3 million to about 13.3 million by 2019. The new gates ensure legitimate travellers can enjoy faster border processing and officers can focus more on the high-risk travellers,” Ms Wagner says.

Expansions for Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown Airports are planned over the next 12-18 months.

Today also marks the sixth anniversary of SmartGate in New Zealand – four gates were installed at Auckland Airport’s arrivals area in 2009. Almost 15 million passengers have used SmartGate in this time.
