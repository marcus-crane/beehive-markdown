Communications Minister Amy Adams was in Masterton today to announce the completion of the town’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) build.

More than 9500 homes and business in Masterton are now able to connect to ultra-fast internet using our world class fibre-to-the-premise network. All 21 schools in the Masterton area are now able to connect to fibre through the UFB and rural broadband programmes.

“Access to faster, more reliable broadband will open up an array of opportunities for the Masterton community,” says Ms Adams.

“Faster, more reliable broadband removes the barrier of distance and means towns like Masterton can better position themselves to attract businesses and residents domestically and internationally.

“Better connectivity will help create more jobs and improve health and education outcomes across the Wairarapa region.”

Together, the Government and its build partner Chorus have invested more than $20 million in bringing better broadband to Masterton.

The build has taken just over four years to complete and Masterton is the thirteenth New Zealand town to be fully-fibred.

“Providing as many New Zealanders as possible with connectivity is a Government priority and we’re now looking ahead at our next steps,” says Ms Adams.

The Government recently set an aspirational target that would see 99 per cent of New Zealanders able to access peak broadband speeds of at least 50 Mbps by 2025.

An additional $360 million dollars has also been set aside to extend the Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband Initiatives and to create a Mobile Black Spot Fund.
