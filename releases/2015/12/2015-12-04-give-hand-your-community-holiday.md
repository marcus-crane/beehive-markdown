For International Volunteer Day this Saturday, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is encouraging New Zealanders to consider how they too can contribute to their local community.

“This Saturday is a time to recognise the impact of volunteers – who generously provide their time, skills, energy and commitment to our communities,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“There is enormous personal satisfaction in making a positive difference for others,” says Mrs Goodhew. “The holiday season is a time for giving, and one way to give back to the community is by joining the more than one million New Zealanders who volunteer.”

This year New Zealand ranked third in the CAF World Giving Index 2015, proving once again that Kiwis are amongst the world’s most generous when it comes to donating and volunteering.

Each year, volunteers contribute around 270 million hours to the community, providing approximately 67 per cent of the non-profit workforce and contributing about 2.3 per cent to New Zealand’s GDP.
