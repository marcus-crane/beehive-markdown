Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse is praising a Joint Period of Action carried out by New Zealand and seven other countries to deter people smuggling and trafficking in persons.

Law enforcement and immigration agencies from the eight countries conducted separate but co-ordinated activities as part of a Working Group co-chaired by New Zealand and Sri Lanka under the *Bali Process*. The Bali

Process brings participating countries together to work on practical measures to help combat people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. 

“We recognise that people smuggling and trafficking in persons are significant regional problems that require countries to work together to find regional solutions,” Mr Woodhouse says. 

“New Zealand has already strengthened our legislation to send a clear message to potential people smuggling ventures that New Zealand is not a soft touch and our commitment to combatting these complex crimes is the main reason why New Zealand established the Working Group under the Bali Process.”

During the Joint Period of Action authorities across the eight countries assisted 59 trafficked persons, identified 63 suspects, made 32 arrests, launched eight new investigations and made over 70 enquires to progress current investigations.

“This is the first time countries under the Bali Process have undertaken a Joint Period of Action. The outcomes achieved reflect the shared commitment of New Zealand and other regional partners to disrupt and dismantle these networks.

“We look forward to working again with our regional partners through a similar joint initiative next year.”
