The Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Bill has been introduced to Parliament.

The Bill is designed to repeal and replace the now outdated Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966. It provides for the compulsory treatment of a small group of people with severe substance addiction and severely impaired capacity, who are unable to engage in treatment of their own accord.

“The Bill is based on extensive work undertaken by the Law Commission in 2010 and is a significant step forward in managing people effectively who are seriously ill as a result of their addiction to alcohol or other drugs”, said Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne

“Most people who abuse alcohol or other drugs do not need compulsory treatment, and can do well when they choose to engage in a treatment programme. However, some people are so unwell that they are not able to make that decision for themselves”.

Unlike its predecessor, the new Bill permits only a short period of compulsory treatment, with the aim of moving the individual into voluntary treatment.  It also provides specific protections for the rights of patients subject to compulsory treatment.

“I expect the Bill to proceed through Parliament to Select Committee in early 2016”, Mr Dunne said.

The Bill is the last outstanding item from the Prime Minister’s Tackling Methamphetamine action plan.
