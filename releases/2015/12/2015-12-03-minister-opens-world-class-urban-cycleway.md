Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened the Nelson Street Cycleway in Auckland, which is the city’s newest and most anticipated urban cycleway.

“This is a great day for Auckland’s inner city cycling network. The cycleway is a new and exciting urban space, creating a city centre where people feel more safe and confident to ride a bike,” Mr Bridges says.

The $18m cycleway, which also caters for walkers, is being funded by the Government’s Urban Cycleways Programme and built in two phases. Phase 1 stretches from Upper Queen Street to Victoria Street and connects with the existing Northwestern Cycleway and Grafton Gully. Phase 2 of the cycleway will extend to Quay Street and be open by the middle of 2016.

“The cycleway, which has been built in the midst of Auckland’s central motorway junction, is New Zealand’s most ambitious piece of urban cycling infrastructure ever built.

“The cycleway will transform Auckland’s inner city cycling network.

“I’m pleased that we have been able to deliver a world class cycleway that will shape the way Aucklanders and visitors move around the city.

“This project was included in the Government’s $333 million Urban Cycleways Programme which is the single biggest investment in cycling in New Zealand’s history and one that will change the face of cycling across the country,” Mr Bridges says.
