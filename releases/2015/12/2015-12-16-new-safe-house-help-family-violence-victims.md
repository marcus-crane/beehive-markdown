A new safe house in Hamilton will help women and children escaping from family violence start to get back on their feet, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The property, provided by Housing New Zealand for Waikato Women’s Refuge Te Whakaruruhau, was opened today and is well situated for medical services, supermarkets, public transport, parks and other community infrastructure.

It replaces a property first occupied by Te Wakaruruhau nearly 20 years ago that had become unsuitable for the refuge because of its location and configuration.

“I am delighted Te Whakaruruhau is now able to offer its critically important residential services from a five-bedroom base that better meets its whanau’s needs,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The Government is committed to partnering with organisations like the Maori Women’s Refuge, because they do an outstanding job on the frontline working with New Zealanders who are most in need of support.”

Housing New Zealand provides 86 Community Group Houses to Women’s Refuges and another 1506 properties for other community organisations to rent around New Zealand.

“Community Group Housing is a valuable service for many organisations providing residential services for New Zealanders needing support whether they are escaping family violence or people with disabilities who need a home,” says Mrs Bennett.

Te Whakaruruhau was the first Māori Women’s Refuge established in 1987. It provides services including safe housing and advocacy to Māori women, families and children and has a 24-hour crisis line.

The organisation also has a community team that supports women at home with dealing with agencies such as Child, Youth and Family and Work and Income.
