Three reports released today show New Zealand met its target for reducing emissions under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and is on track to meet its 2020 target, Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett says.

“New Zealand’s second biennial report to the United Nations shows that we met our target for the period from 2008-2012 through a combination of emissions reductions, carbon removal by forests, and international trading,” says Mrs Bennett.  

This is backed up by the true-up report, which is a detailed statement of account for that period. The 2020 net position report shows that New Zealand is projected to meet its 2020 target.

“I’m pleased New Zealand has been successful in the first commitment period and is on track towards meeting the 2020 target,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Following the successful talks in Paris, the Government is now focusing on domestic policy to transition to a low carbon economy.”

The Ministry for the Environment has also published a non-technical snapshot which outlines the difference between the reports, and the key findings of each. 

The reports are published by the Ministry as part of New Zealand’s international climate change reporting obligations, and are available here:
