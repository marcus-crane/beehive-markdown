### Three new Law Commissioners appointed

Justice Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of Douglas White QC, Donna Buckingham and Helen McQueen as new members of the Law Commission, each for a term of five years.

“Between them, these three new appointees have a tremendous depth of experience and know-how, and bring a fresh perspective to one of the justice sector’s most important policy institutions,” Ms Adams says.

“With their considerable legal experience, I’m confident they will each provide a valuable contribution to the Commission’s law reform projects in the coming years.”

Ms Adams also acknowledged the contributions of the two outgoing Law Commissioners, Judge Peter Boshier and Dr Geoffrey McLay.

“I want to pay tribute to the important contribution Judge Boshier and Dr McLay have each made over their time as Law Commissioners. They have left a tremendous legacy of reports which have helped improve the legal framework of New Zealand and I’m grateful for all their work.”

The Law Commission is responsible for the systematic review, reform, and development of the law of New Zealand.
