The Government will invest $12.3 million to redevelop two more Wellington schools, Newtown School and Ngaio School, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

This follows last week’s announcement of an $8.5 million redevelopment of Kelburn Normal School in the capital.

“These two latest redevelopments will help address roll growth and a range of building and site issues, including weathertightness and structural strengthening, and will create exciting new innovative learning environments for students,” says Ms Kaye.

“An $8.9 million redevelopment of Newtown School will see temporary buildings at the school replaced with new flexible learning spaces, including a new Maori immersion unit.

“A two-storey block at the school was demolished in 2011 following a seismic review, and the school has since been using a number of temporary learning spaces.

“The redevelopment will see a new two-storey block built, along with sheltered outdoor recreation areas and safe drop-off areas.

“Plans for the redevelopment aim to make the most of the school’s small compact site, and also allow for future roll growth.

“At Ngaio School, $3.4 million will be invested in five new learning spaces. These will replace existing buildings affected by structural and groundwater issues, which will be demolished.

“This project will complement the recent completion of eight new learning spaces at the school, which were needed to keep pace with roll growth

“The latest new building at the school will be more appropriately situated to provide more outdoor learning space.

“These redevelopments will help create innovative learning environments, with flexible learning spaces that can provide an open-plan layout or be closed off into traditional classrooms.

“This will allow students to learn in groups or independently, and help them develop skills such as collaboration as well as independent problem solving.

“Acoustics, lighting, heating and air quality will be high-quality, to help students concentrate on learning, and facilities will also be equipped with the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand can learn in an environment that inspires and supports them to achieve to the best of their potential.

“Over $83 million of school redevelopments have been announced in the Wellington area since early November. These redevelopments include Newtown School, Ngaio School, Kelburn Normal School, Wellington East Girls’ College and Aotea College in Porirua.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation nationwide. This is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”

Construction at Newtown and Ngaio Schools is expected to start late in 2016.
