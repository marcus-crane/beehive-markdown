Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an evaluation of this year’s national rheumatic fever awareness campaign shows positive results and a scorecard of excellence.

“The independent evaluation by Allen + Clarke Policy and Regulatory Specialists Ltd describes the rheumatic fever campaign as efficient, effective and relevant,” says Dr Coleman.

“The campaign exceeded the expected level of reach amongst the target Maori and Pasifika audience, with about 95 per cent having seen or heard the campaign. They also had a good understanding of the issue, and the campaign was promoting positive health behaviour and discussions.

“The evaluation also showed the $1 million campaign provided excellent value for investment, rated excellent for relevance to the target audience, and had good alignment with other rheumatic fever prevention activities.

“The Government has invested more than $65 million on a range of initiatives to prevent rheumatic fever. Other prevention activities in high incidence areas include targeted sore throat drop-in clinics, school based services, healthy homes initiatives, and Pacific engagement services.

 

“Combined these initiatives are making a difference. Rheumatic fever rates are trending down. The latest national figures show a 24 per cent decrease in first episode rheumatic fever hospitalisations since 2012.

“There’s still more work to be done to achieve the Better Public Services target of reducing rheumatic fever by two-thirds by June 2017, as well as ensuring the sustainability of gains made.”
