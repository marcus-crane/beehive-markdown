Samoan culture, ‘talking about it’ and education are key to preventing violence against Samoan women and girls, according to a new report released by the Minister for Women, Hon Louise Upston, and the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

The report, *A malu i ‘āiga, e malu fo’i i fafo: Protection for the family, protection for all - Samoan people’s understanding of primary prevention of violence against women*, shows Samoan communities see the need to strengthen education on women’s safety. 

“Samoan communities have told us that Samoan culture has a key role  in combating violence against women.  Their traditional values and practices are steeped in ensuring that women and girls are safe,” Ms Upston said.

“One of the most important conclusions reached in this report is that Samoan youth, in particular, find open discussion about violence prevention and education useful in understanding how to prevent it.”

“If we can have these conversations with youth, to create healthy and respectful relationships within families, it will support healthy and respectful relationships outside of the families, meaning healthier communities for all,” she said.

The report, exploring protective factors in keeping Samoan women and girls safe from violence, was developed by the Ministry for Women in partnership with the Ministries for Pacific Island Affairs and Social Development.
