Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner is delighted work will soon begin to enhance Christchurch’s iconic Bridge of Remembrance.

“Today I have released images showing the new design for the bridge and its surrounds, which I think will ensure this memorial is of a standard befitting those whom it commemorates,” Ms Wagner says.

“The bridge was damaged in the earthquakes, but has since had repairs and strengthening work carried out on the Triumphal Arch and the foundation structure to ensure it is safe. The next step is to ensure its appearance is something Christchurch can be proud of.”

City Care and JFC Limited have been awarded the contract to begin constructing the next sections of Te Papa Ōtākaro /Avon River Precinct, which includes the Bridge of Remembrance and adjacent Park of Remembrance.

“Changes include removing the walls at the western end of the Bridge and the construction of a grand staircase, a new ramp creating a processional connection to the Nicholas Statue, and paving which links with the river promenade and in-ground lighting to highlight the Triumphal Arch,” Ms Wagner says.

“Strengthening work on the Triumphal Arch and the bridge foundation structure was completed at the end of September 2015 by the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT).

“We’ve worked with the Christchurch Returned Services’ Association (RSA) to make sure we get the design right.

“The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority will continue to work closely with the RSA, Christchurch City Council and SCIRT as work progresses on the bridge.

“Landscaping will also be completed in the Park of Remembrance. The enhancement of the Bridge of Remembrance is due to begin in mid-January, work is expected to be complete by Anzac Day 2016,” Ms Wagner says.
