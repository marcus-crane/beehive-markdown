Education Minister Hekia Parata has today released the findings of 156 Special Education Update engagement forums held by the Ministry of Education with over 3,650 people across New Zealand, including parents, families and educators.

Ms Parata also released an action plan that outlines how the Ministry will work with others to improve both frontline services and its sector support and stewardship.

“We know that the current system of additional learning support is too complicated, and we are determined to make it easier for families to access the support they need,” says Ms Parata.

“Our suggestion of a single point of contact to liaise with families, teachers and specialists to plan and arrange additional learning support was well received, and is one of the improvements canvassed in the action plan.

“We have some significant design work to do to achieve these improvements. To keep up the momentum, 22 improvement projects will start in the coming weeks. From mid-2016 we’ll roll out a new streamlined approach that better supports the children and young people who are most in need of additional learning support.

“Collaboration between parents, families, students, educators and specialists is key to improving the system. I want it to be child-centred, simple to access, and available promptly, early and without interruption for as long as required.

“Today is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and this year’s theme is ‘Inclusion Matters’, which reflects what we heard at the forums.

“I’d like to thank everyone who participated in the forums. Your feedback is helping to shape the improvements that we will make to ensure that additional learning support is available at the right time and in the right way.

“Our intention is a world class inclusive education system that puts progress and success for all children and young people at the heart of teaching and learning.”
