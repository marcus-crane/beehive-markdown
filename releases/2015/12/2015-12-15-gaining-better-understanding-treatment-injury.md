The Government is working to gain a full understanding of treatment injury to inform a range of initiatives to reduce treatment injury rates, say Minister of Health Jonathan Coleman and Minister for ACC Nikki Kaye.

“ACC’s treatment injury liability account is subject to a rising number of claims. It’s important from a clinical and financial point of view to understand why this is happening,” says Dr Coleman.

“We want to deliver better outcomes for patients. While rates of patient harm in New Zealand are comparable to other countries, we can further improve patient safety and reduce avoidable patient harm.

“ACC, Ministry of Health, Health Quality and Safety Commission (HQSC) and the Health and Disability Commissioner are working together to understand what is driving the increase and the interventions that are needed.”

Claims to ACC for treatment injuries are increasing at higher rates than other types of injury. Infections and adverse reactions are the most common types of treatment injury claim.

“ACC is committed to ongoing work towards understanding the cause of treatment injuries, and I can confirm that it has also signed off an investment of $15 million to $20 million over the next five years towards preventing treatment injuries,” says Ms Kaye.

“As part of this investment, ACC has begun working in partnership with the health sector to progress a number of initiatives, including:

- funding surgical simulation training for operating theatre staff
- developing a programme to reduce the number and severity of preventable birth injuries
- establishing a programme to help reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries
- extending HQSC’s surgical site infection programme.

“This morning I visited the Multidisciplinary Operating Room Simulation (MORSim) training programme based at the University of Auckland. This programme was piloted last year, and will be rolled out next year with funding support from ACC.

“It’s important that there’s good communication and teamwork between staff in the operating room, and this programme is aimed at improving teamwork and communication skills. An evaluation of the pilot programme showed this could translate to a 14 per cent reduction in treatment injuries.

“Injury prevention is an important part of ACC’s role. These initiatives to address treatment injuries are testament to how ACC is developing closer relationships with partners, and making better use of the analysis of injury data and evidence-based interventions to help reduce injuries in New Zealand.”

**Notes to editors**

**Treatment injury trends**

Since 2009 ACC treatment injury claims have increased by 63 per cent, from 1.8 claims per 1,000 in 2008/09 to 2.9 in 2014/15. Costs have increased by 43 per cent, from $264 million in 2008/09 to $379 million in 2014/15.

**MORSim training**

Simulation training is not new for surgical staff, but has traditionally been taught by each discipline separately. MORSim is deliberately multidisciplinary – bringing surgeons, nurses, anaethesthetists and technicians together to focus on improving communications and teamwork in the operating room.

Training is centred on complex, challenging scenarios using realistic surgical mannequins (which can bleed, breathe and be monitored), real drugs and fluids, real equipment and instruments and realistic patient clinical notes.

**Programme to reduce birth injuries**

ACC and HQSC are working with MOH, DHBs and professional associations to develop a programme of actions to reduce birth injuries. ACC will fund a specialist taskforce as part of this work.

**Programme to reduce pressure injuries**

ACC will fund work to apply international guidelines to the New Zealand context and New Zealand best practice, aimed at reducing pressure injuries.

**Extending HQSC surgical site infection programme**

ACC is working with HQSC to extend the existing surgical site infections programme. This programme promotes and encourages culture change and provides guidance on practice improvements that can reduce surgical site infections. The first procedure focused on was hip and knee arthroplasty surgery – ACC’s support will help extend the programme to include cardiac surgery and private hospitals.
