Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry today announced the appointment of three additional members to the Auckland Unitary Plan independent hearings panel.

“The remaining Auckland Unitary Plan hearings include significant work relating to site specific hearings on the rural urban boundary, rezoning and precincts. The additional members will help ensure the panel meets its deadline of delivering recommendations to the Auckland Council on the proposed Unitary Plan by 22 July 2016,” Dr Smith says.

“The new panel members are Alan Watson, David Hill and Les Simmons. They are currently mediators in the Auckland Unitary Plan process and have backgrounds in law, resource management planning and policy development. As they are familiar with the process and the panel’s way of working they will be able to quickly and effectively contribute to the remaining hearings,” Dr Smith says.

Ministers worked with Auckland Council, the Independent Māori Statutory Board and the current chairperson of the Panel, Judge David Kirkpatrick, to select the appointees.

The Auckland Unitary Plan will be the first combined resource management plan for Auckland. It follows the amalgamation of eight Auckland councils in 2011. The plan will replace the regional policy statement, and the previous regional and district plans.

“Getting the unitary plan right is crucial both for the continued development of Auckland and the protection of its special natural places,” Ms Barry says.

“The three new panel members have a broad range of experience to draw on and will make a valuable contribution towards its final shape.”

The increase in panel size from seven to ten members was passed through changes to the Local Government (Auckland Transitional Provisions) Act 2010. The other panel members are Judge David Kirkpatrick (chair), Desmond Morrison, Janet Crawford, Paula Hunter, John Kirikiri, Stuart Shepherd, Greg Hill and Peter Fuller.
