A total of $315,820 in funding has been approved for 48 applicants from not-for-profit organisations working with refugees and migrants, Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga announced today.

The money comes from the Office of Ethnic Communities’ Settling In fund, which is available for projects or initiatives that seek to support successful settlement for refugee and migrant communities in New Zealand. 

“This funding allows local organisations help these communities overcome challenges and settle successfully in New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“New Zealand is culturally diverse and our government is committed to supporting our migrant and refugee communities. The quality and quantity of applications during this round were very impressive and I look forward to seeing the positive impact the Settling In-funded projects have on our communities.”

The funding has gone to a variety of projects which include access to services such as maternity care, employment, cultural and sporting activities designed to promote integration and cultural understanding.

The grants, which range from about $2500 to around $25,000, will be distributed before Christmas.
