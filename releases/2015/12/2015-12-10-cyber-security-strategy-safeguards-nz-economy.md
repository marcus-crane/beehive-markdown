Ensuring New Zealanders are safe, resilient and prosperous online is at the heart of the Government’s refreshed national Cyber Security Strategy launched today.

The strategy was launched by Communications Minister Amy Adams with an Action Plan and a National Plan to Address Cybercrime

“The Government is building infrastructure and investing $2 billion into our Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband Initiative programmes because we want New Zealanders to engage in the digital economy,” says Ms Adams.

“While New Zealand has benefited enormously from the innovations offered by technology, it has also led to new vulnerabilities. The threat to New Zealanders and the economy from cyber intrusions is real and growing, and there are serious implications for our economic wellbeing and national security.

“The pace of change and emergence of new and complex threats mean constant vigilance is required. By refreshing the action plan each year we will keep pace with any emerging threats.”

While New Zealand has yet to experience a significant cyber attack, estimated economic losses last year alone reached $257 million.

According to research, 56 per cent of New Zealand businesses experience an information technology security attack at least once a year and only 65 per cent of businesses are confident that their IT security systems are effective. 

“Unlike traditional threats, we need to understand that New Zealand’s geographical position offers no protection against cyber threats. New Zealand is experiencing cyber incidents, including growing cybercrime, in the same way as countries around the world,” says Ms Adams.

“The Government and private sector need to work together on cyber security. The private and public sectors must find ways to share information and expertise to address cyber security risks and this strategy relies on a close and active public-private partnership to ensure New Zealanders remain safe online.”

A key action in the new strategy is the development of a national CERT to reduce harm from cyber security incidents and improve New Zealand’s ability to deal with attacks. The CERT will act as a single entry point for organisations or individuals needing assistance, and provide information to businesses, including small and medium enterprises, government and individuals so they can protect themselves from cyber threats.

“New Zealand’s key international partners each have a national CERT of some form, and creation of our national CERT brings us into alignment.”

Ms Adams says the CERT is intended as a partnership between the public and private sectors, and will work with companies and government agencies depending on the nature of the issue. 

The Cyber Security Strategy contains four areas of work:

- **Cyber resilience** is about the on-going protection of New Zealand’s most important information infrastructures
- **Cyber capability** involves building the skills of New Zealanders, businesses and government agencies to protect themselves online, spearheaded by the Connect Smart public-private partnership
- **Addressing cybercrime** will focus on building police capability to deal with cybercrime
- **International cooperation** will allow New Zealand to maintain a voice internationally on the promotion of a free, open and secure cyberspace, and involves international engagement on cyber security issues.

Ms Adams also announced New Zealand will host its first ever Cyber Security Summit in the first half of 2016 in Auckland.
