A Selwyn Housing Accord aimed at improving the affordability of housing and availability of land was signed today by Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and Mayor Kelvin Coe.

“Following the Canterbury earthquakes, the Selwyn District grew faster than expected, which led to housing pressures and land supply issues. In addition, the Selwyn district has been the fastest growing region in New Zealand for the last eight years and we expect that to continue well into 2018,” Dr Smith says.

“The Council approached me in October asking the Government to enter into a Housing Accord with them to provide the tools they need to improve housing supply issues and address the lack of land available for construction.

“The Accord we’ve signed today will allow Selwyn Council to recommend Special Housing Areas (SHAs) to me. These are areas where developments can be fast-tracked through the consenting process to rapidly provide additional housing supply.

“The Council has set some ambitious targets with this Accord. They aim to recommend large SHAs with the capacity for up to 1600 sections before the Accord legislation expires in September 2016. The council is focusing on creating a pipeline of land for development. The Council plans to make the most of the SHA status and will work with developers to use the SHAs through to 2018 and beyond.

“These challenging targets aim to double the pre-earthquake historical average of new properties consented, to house the growing population. The targets will help boost supply and improve affordability. They will also help council to make up Selwyn’s post-earthquake historical construction shortfall of almost 300 homes.

“I look forward to seeing the council progress toward these targets, which I’m confident they can achieve.

“I congratulate the Mayor and Selwyn Council for all their work on the Accord and I commend their efforts to address the housing issues in their region. I look forward to receiving recommendations for SHAs next year and watching them progress between now and 2018,” Dr Smith says.

Selwyn Mayor Kelvin Coe says the Accord will have significant long-term benefits for the district. “The Council appreciates the opportunity to use the Housing Accord legislation to ensure an adequate supply of land for residential housing,” he says.

“This will enable competition, and hence price restraint, as well as choice for potential buyers in Selwyn over the coming years.”
