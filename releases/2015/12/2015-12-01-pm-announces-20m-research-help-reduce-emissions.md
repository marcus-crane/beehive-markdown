Prime Minister John Key has announced at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris that New Zealand will commit another $20 million to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.

“This world-leading research has the potential to reduce global emissions, particularly in developing countries that have similar emission profiles to New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

“In New Zealand half our emissions are from agriculture where there are not yet cost effective ways of reducing emissions, but we are working hard to change that.

“Alliance is doing some great work and I’m pleased to announce that New Zealand will boost its funding by $20 million over four years, to capitalise on some new research to reduce methane emissions.

“The sooner we have technology available, the sooner farmers can start using it to further reduce emission both in New Zealand and in other countries.”

The $20 million is on top of New Zealand’s initial investment of $45 million.

The Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases was formed in 2009 and has 46 member countries.

It is focused on the research and development of technologies and practices that will help deliver ways to grow more food without growing greenhouse gas emissions.
