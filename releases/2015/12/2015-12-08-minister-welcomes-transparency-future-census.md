Statistics Minister Craig Foss is welcoming the release of Cabinet papers on the future of the census and appointments to the working group of the Data Futures Partnership.

Statistics New Zealand has published the Census Transformation paper and a Cabinet paper of the appointments made to the Data Futures Partnership Working Group.

“New Zealand needs the information from the census to enable communities to plan for things like schools, health needs and roads,” says Mr Foss.

“For well over a hundred years, the census has been the only way to get this, but the transformation paper shows that Statistics NZ is looking at a raft of options for the future after the next census in 2018.

“There is a data revolution underway, and this has the potential to transform the New Zealand census. We want greater value from data and this is the right time to look at new ways of producing the information provided by census.”

The Data Futures Partnership aims to drive greater trusted data sharing and use across citizens, consumers, businesses, Māori, non-governmental organisations, and government.

Statistics New Zealand has also begun publishing online, its responses to requests received under the Official Information Act.

“This is similar to the process that Treasury follows, aiming to increase the accessibility and availability of information to help enrich and promote informed debate,” says Mr Foss.
