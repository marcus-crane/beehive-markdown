More than 1000 people have so far made their voices heard in the development of a new national Health of Older People Strategy, says Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

More than 20 workshops and meetings have been held by the Ministry of Health around the country this year to gather information on what works well for older people and what needs improvement before the strategy is drafted.

“We want to make sure older people live well, stay well and have a dignified end of life when that time comes,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“I’ve been following work on the strategy with interest and I am delighted that such a large and diverse group has been involved so far.”

Older people as well as interest groups, Maori and Pacific health providers, aged care providers, clinicians, district health boards and primary care providers were involved in the consultation this year.

The Ministry of Health will begin working with the sector to design and draft the strategy early next year.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says those who have not yet had the opportunity to comment can do so through the ministry’s Health of Older People Strategy Update website [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz) or by emailing [hopstrategy@moh.govt.nz](mailto:hopstrategy@moh.govt.nz) 

The Health of Older People Strategy will sit under the New Zealand Health Strategy, which is being redeveloped.
