Thousands of visitors have taken the chance to experience the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington since it opened in April this year, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“In April the park attracted 16,116 visitors with a further estimated 50,000 at the Anzac Day Dawn Service, and numbers have remained high,” Ms Barry says.

“The National War Memorial Park and Arras Tunnel was a $120 million legacy project for our First World War centenary commemorations, and it is encouraging to see so many New Zealanders have embraced it.”

In addition, more than 133,000 people have viewed Sir Peter Jackson’s Great War Exhibition at the Old Dominion Museum, behind the National War Memorial.

“Both Pukeahu and the Great War Exhibition are giving New Zealanders an opportunity to reflect on our country’s role in military conflict and peacekeeping throughout the world.

“They are sharing family stories with their children and grandchildren, and taking the time to understand and reflect on New Zealand’s history in these tranquil surroundings.”

“We now have an inviting and user-friendly space where people from all around New Zealand can take time to reflect, and the large visitor numbers reinforce this. Pukeahu is a national attraction which will be developed further with the inclusion of other significant international memorials, complementing the already unveiled Australian War Memorial.”

A daily Last Post ceremony, held alongside the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at 5pm, will run until 11 November 2018. The ceremony is on rain or shine and people are invited to read the Ode of Remembrance, in either English or Te Reo or both, or play the bugle call.

“With the long summer months ahead of us and the extra daylight hours, many more people will enjoy the opportunity to visit Pukeahu and attend the ceremony,” Ms Barry says.

Details about how to sign up for the Last Post are on the Ministry for Culture and Heritage website, [www.mch.govt.nz/last-post](http://www.mch.govt.nz/last-post)
