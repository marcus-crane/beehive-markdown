Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has introduced a bill to update and futureproof the New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority Act 1987.

“The proposed changes in the bill will update the export framework and enable New Zealand industries to be global leaders in horticultural exports,” says Mr Guy.

“The changes will enable growers and exporters of horticultural products like avocados, summerfruit and buttercup squash to better target their marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of different markets.

“The global market for horticultural products has changed significantly since 1987 as the value chain has become more innovative and complex.

“The bill also clarifies the requirements for product groups to enter or exit from this framework, to provide greater certainty and reduce costs. It has been drafted following consultation with both the New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority and the nine product groups which use the current export framework.

“To remain internationally competitive, the industry needs a more flexible and cost effective export framework that helps deliver quality products for consumers.

“Collective promotion of the ‘New Zealand Inc’ brand, together with minimum quality requirements have helped to underpin our reputation and achieve premiums for New Zealand fruit and vegetables.

“Export values for the fruit and vegetables exported under the Act rose from $50 million in 1988 to just under $300 million in 2015, showing the Act’s effectiveness as a tool for coordinating exporting and marketing.”

The bill will be referred to the Primary Production Committee, which will then call for public submissions.
