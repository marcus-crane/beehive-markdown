Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today released a consultation document seeking comment on whether businesses fundraising for charities should divulge certain information to the donating public.

“There is currently nothing in legislation that requires third party fundraisers to disclose information about their fundraising activity when asking for donations from New Zealanders,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“This document discusses whether we should change that by introducing information disclosure regulations that, for example, would require a third party fundraiser to disclose any financial benefits they will receive as a result of soliciting for charitable donations.

“Third party fundraisers are either professional fundraisers used by many charities to raise money on their behalf, often by telemarketing, street collecting or door knocking. They can also be businesses that have an association with a charity and donate a portion of their profits from selling a specific good or service.

“In 2012 the Government amended the Fair Trading Act by inserting section 28A to allow for disclosure regulations to be made for third party fundraisers, but no regulations have been made yet.

“This change came from a concern that third party fundraisers may be retaining too high a proportion of donated money, and that those donating were unaware of where their money was going.

“The aim of a disclosure regime would be to introduce more transparency and accountability into the costs and practices of fundraising activities and make New Zealanders more confident about donating to charitable causes.

“I encourage all those with an interest to read the discussion document and provide feedback to MBIE,” Mr Goldsmith says.
