Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced the appointment of a high quality design team to work with the Government and Christchurch City Council on developing the city’s new Metro Sports Facility.

“Warren and Mahoney, along with Peddle Thorp Architects and MJMA (MacLennan Jaunkalns Miller Architects), have been chosen to provide architectural design services for this facility, which is going to be a great community asset for Christchurch for generations,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Aurecon, with ARUP, Powell Fenwick Consultants and Aquatic Design and Engineering, have also been selected to provide multi-disciplinary engineering design services.

“There was strong interest in these design roles from leading firms in New Zealand and overseas, and as a result we have a design team that will ensure we build a fantastic facility to cater for all.

“The next step will be for the design team to sit down with staff from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) and Christchurch City Council in the New Year to lay out what needs to be done.”

The Government and Christchurch City Council have agreed joint funding arrangements for the Metro Sports Facility.

It will include an indoor aquatic hall with a 79 metre, 10-lane competition pool and seating for a minimum of 1000 spectators, a leisure area including hot pools and hydroslides, nine indoor courts for sports such as netball and basketball, and retractable seating for a minimum of 2500 spectators.  There will also be a dedicated base for High Performance Sport New Zealand, and spaces for fitness and other activities.

“Comments were recently sought from the public on what should be on offer in the Leisure Water Area of the Facility, and about 1385 were received, all of which will be considered in the design process,” Mr Brownlee says.

Meanwhile, a Request for Proposal was issued on Friday to four contractors shortlisted for supply of Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) services for the Metro Sports Facility.

“ECI is well-regarded by the construction sector, where construction companies bring their expertise to the design table instead of being appointed after design is complete,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This will allow us to create a strong design and build team.  Up to two preferred ECI contractors will be selected to initially provide services, before a single contractor is chosen.”

Request for Proposals for Project Management and Design Management Services, and Quantity Surveyor Services for the Metro Sports Facility are open until 3 February 2016 on the Government Electronic Tenders Service website [www.gets.govt.nz](http://www.gets.govt.nz).
