Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss is welcoming changes that will provide more support, and more services, to more veterans than ever before.

The Veterans’ Independence Programme (VIP), established under the Veterans’ Support Act 2014, begins on 7 December 2015. The VIP allows Veterans’ Affairs to offer a range of support and assistance designed to help veterans maintain their independence in their own home.

“Under the VIP support is available to all veterans with qualifying service, whether or not they have a service-related injury,” Mr Foss says. 

“This means that more veterans will be able to access the services and support provided by Veterans’ Affairs than ever before.”

Just over $5million additional funding has been allocated to the VIP, in recognition of the broader group that Veterans’ Affairs will now be able to assist, and the new way in which support can be provided.

“The increased coverage established by the VIP recognises the sacrifice that veterans, and their families, have made and continue to make for us every day – putting themselves at risk of harm to protect us, as New Zealanders, and to serve our country,” Mr Foss says.
