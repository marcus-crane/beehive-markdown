Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has congratulated MPI staff and the Auckland community for the successful eradication of Queensland fruit fly, but is warning the public to stay on high alert this summer.

“It’s great news this small population has been eradicated and all restrictions are now lifted. It means that New Zealand is officially free of this potentially destructive pest,” says Mr Guy.

“I want to thank local residents in the affected area who have been very patient and followed the instructions around the movement of fresh fruit and vegetables.

“I also want to thank MPI and AsureQuality who have provided the field operations, Auckland Council and industry partners Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand and Horticulture New Zealand who have worked on this response.

“However we will still be on high alert this summer for any further incursions, given the wide spread of the Queensland fruit fly throughout the eastern states of Australia.

“We have already made major improvements to our biosecurity system in recent years, including a $27 million boost in this year’s Budget which is helping fund 20 more detector dog teams, five new x-ray machines and a new mobile x-ray machine.

“From 1 January next year we will have a Border Clearance Levy so that travellers will directly pay for biosecurity and customs service as demand increases, and we have signed three new industries to the Government Industry Agreement biosecurity partnership.

“However no system is ever perfect and we need all New Zealanders, especially travellers, to be alert and aware of the risks.

“Our horticulture industry earns around $3.6 billion a year in exports which is why biosecurity has always been my number one priority as Minister.”
