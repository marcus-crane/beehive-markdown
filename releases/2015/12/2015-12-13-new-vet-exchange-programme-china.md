A new veterinary exchange programme with China will help build closer relations in the equine industries, says Primary Industries and Racing Minister Nathan Guy.

“China is a growing and important market for New Zealand-bred horses. This programme will train Chinese vets to learn from New Zealand and increase their skills and experience in animal health and welfare,” says Mr Guy. 

The Equine Veterinary Professional Development pilot is a partnership between Rider Horse China, the New Zealand equine industry and the Ministry for Primary Industries. It was launched today at a Chinese New Zealand business function at Ellerslie racecourse.

The nine week programme provides training on areas such as basic equine anatomy and physiology, diagnostic approaches to musculoskeletal ailments affecting performance racehorses, treatment of common equine reproductive conditions and equine artificial insemination.

Three Chinese veterinarians from the China Rider Horse Group are currently in New Zealand as part of the programme.

“This includes four weeks study at Massey University and five weeks clinical placement with local vets, working in the field.

“It also has the potential to be expanded into professional veterinarian development between the two countries for dairy and sheep sectors as well.

“This programme is an important way of helping to further grow relationships between New Zealand and China.”
