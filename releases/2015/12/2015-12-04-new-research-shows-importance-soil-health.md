Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the release of a new report on soil health by Landcare Research, ahead of World Soil Day tomorrow.

“Good quality soil is fundamental to life on earth and to New Zealand given that the primary sector makes up around three quarters of our exports,” says Mr Guy.

“This report was commissioned by the Ministry for Primary Industries to summarise what we know about our soils and soil management, and how we may need to improve in the future.

“The main conclusion is that although a lot is being done to protect and maintain New Zealand’s soils, there are a number of ongoing pressures that need to be taken into account for the future.

“The report says our soils are fragile, finite and precious. They are under increasing pressure from some land uses and management practices, climate change, erosion, and urban expansion.

“I agree with the call for greater collaboration and co-ordination between central and regional government, iwi and industry. This is why MPI is working with other stakeholders to create a National Soil Management Group, which will help advise on research directions, build capability, inform policy, and set up monitoring.”

Currently a number of initiatives are underway to improve our soil management in New Zealand, including:

- Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) has programmes such as the Pioneering to Precision programme led by Ravensdown which seeks to improve fertiliser practice on hill country farms through remote sensing of the nutrient status of the farms and precision application of fertiliser.
- The Ballance Agri-Nutrients Clearview PGP programme is seeking to improve nutrient efficiency in both flatland and hill country.
- Funding for erosion control through the Afforestation Grants Scheme ($22.5 million over the next six years).
- The Hill Country Erosion Fund makes $2.2 million per year available in grants to treat erosion-prone land.
- Promotion of sustainable farming practices through the Sustainable Farming Fund (27 projects directly related to soils over the past 10 years).
