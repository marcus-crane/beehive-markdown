Consultation has opened today on a discussion paper by the Ministry of Health on actions to address Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).

The public are invited to make submissions to the Ministry until February 26, 2016.

The Government has committed through the National Drug Policy, to publish a cross-government Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Action Plan in the 2015/16 year.

It also recently announced that $1 million from the latest round of funding under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act would be spent on a first steps package of initiatives aimed at preventing, identifying and responding effectively to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

“It is estimated 570 New Zealand children are born with a FASD each year. These babies typically grow up with less cognitive and adaptive function. They are more likely in the course of their life to be difficult to parent, disruptive at school, come into contact with the criminal justice system, develop mental health and addiction problems and expose their own children to alcohol during pregnancy,” says  Mr Dunne.

“This is an issue that spans many parts of our society, and thus many agencies. It also spans generations. I welcome this discussion document as a first step towards a future action plan and urge interested parties to take this chance to make a submission.”

Mr Dunne says agencies are already working together to develop possible future actions, and consultation will help that. In addition, during the consultation period, the Ministry of Health, with the support of relevant agencies, will be conducting a series of targeted meetings with key interested groups to gather in-depth feedback to support written submissions.

“As we enter the Christmas and New Year holiday period, I am conscious that many will be enjoying a drink with family and friends. If you are pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, then the safest approach to alcohol is to avoid it”, Mr Dunne said.
