Agencies are taking steps to ensure an effective response to the growing problem of cybercrime with the establishment of a new interagency cybercrime plan.

“In a changing world where online security is an issue, we need to be on the front foot against cybercrime” says Justice and Communications Minister Amy Adams.

The cybercrime plan is part of the Government’s refreshed Cyber Security Strategy, launched in Auckland today by Ms Adams.

Ms Adams says cybercrime is a global issue and New Zealanders are not immune with online criminals causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage each year.

“It’s important that we have the right tools, the right information, and the right relationships to combat this type of crime,” says Ms Adams.

New initiatives in the National Cybercrime Plan include:

- New training to help Police deal more effectively with cyber crime at the frontline new training programmes
- Checking relevant aspects of Crimes Act 1961 and other legislation to test whether they are fit for purpose in addressing cybercrime
- Working more effectively with other countries and the private sector to help stop crime from offshore
- Improving use of Police information to better understand the nature and impact of cybercrime on New Zealanders.

“The internet is a rapidly evolving tool for criminals. They can use this technology to commit offences such as theft, fraud and the distribution of offensive material in new and faster ways.  They can also use technology to inflict damage or disruption to computer systems,” Ms Adams says.

“These crimes can have a devastating impact – for example, individuals may lose all their stored data or have their information stolen. For organisations, cybercrime can ruin business reputations and result in major financial losses.”

One recent report estimated the annual cost of cybercrime to the global economy at more than NZ$600 billion. Last year, approximately 856,000 New Zealanders were impacted by online crime.

Police Minister Michael Woodhouse said cybercrime can range from personal theft and ‘denial of business’ attacks on businesses to extortion and fraud, and it’s difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute perpetrators.

“In a changing world where online security is an issue, we need to be on the front foot against cybercrime. Our new plan focuses on prevention through building awareness and helping Kiwis and businesses to protect themselves, while also building the capability of Police and other agencies to deal with crimes committed online,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The plan brings together a number of government agencies, as well as non-government and private sector organisations.

“We have already got strong connections between agencies, but this national shared plan truly creates an interagency and cross –sectoral landscape to improve security and respond to cybercrime.”

The National Cybercrime Plan is aligned to New Zealand Police’s *Prevention First: National Cybercrime Operating Strategy 2014-2017*, and builds on recent progress including expansion of both the Cybercrime Unit and the development of the High Tech Crime Group and increased linkages to the Interpol Complex for Global Innovation in Singapore.
