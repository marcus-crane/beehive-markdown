With a week to go until submissions close, Education Minister Hekia Parata  is encouraging all those with an interest in education to have say on the update of the 1989 Education Act.

“Already 356 submissions have been received and I’m expecting to see many more in the coming days. The Act sets the legislative framework for education and it is vital that it is creates an environment that helps all children and young people to succeed educationally,” says Ms Parata.

By the time submissions close next Monday, 120 consultation workshops and meetings with specialist sector groups will have been held.

“I want to thank everyone who has participated in the process. It’s wonderful to hear that parents, whānau, teachers, principals and many education organisations are taking the opportunity to offer their views on the proposals in the discussion document.  

Submissions can be made online at [www.consultation.education.govt.nz](https://mymail.education.govt.nz/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=bqOnXQxNXULw9YYJkWlkrlN2MgT_vBcZbr-cuyUOw7qQRM--T_nSCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AdwB3AHcALgBjAG8AbgBzAHUAbAB0AGEAdABpAG8AbgAuAGUAZAB1AGMAYQB0AGkAbwBuAC4AZwBvAHYAdAAuAG4AegA.&URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.consultation.education.govt.nz).   Background information and links to the discussion document can be found at the same site.
