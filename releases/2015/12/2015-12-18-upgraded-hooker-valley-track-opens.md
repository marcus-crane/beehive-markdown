A newly completed upgrade of Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park’s popular Hooker Valley track makes it easier for visitors to experience the spectacle of New Zealand’s highest mountains, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Ms Barry officially opened the improved track at a ceremony outside Mt Cook Village today.

The $1.7 million project means the track is less prone to flooding, avoids potential avalanche and rockfall areas and is more accessible for walkers.

“Realigning and upgrading the track has taken more than two years of hard work by DOC staff in remote and rugged areas,” Ms Barry says. “It means the 70,000 people who walk it each year will have an even better experience than before.”

A three-hour return trip to the Hooker Lake, the track gives walkers outstanding views of Aoraki/Mt Cook and Mt Sefton, the Mueller Glacier and the Southern Alps. Walkers pass through tussock lands blooming with rare wild flowers such as the Mt Cook lily, the world’s largest buttercup.

“The track upgrade is part of DOC’s $16 million investment in improving Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park since 2010,” Ms Barry says. “This has seen new tracks, huts and cycle trails built, more car parks and road upgrades as well as the world-class visitor’s centre in Mt Cook Village.”

“These developments will support the increasing numbers of people who visit Aoraki/Mt Cook and the many tourism businesses operating there – DOC is committed to supporting our tourism industry and ensuring all visitors to our country can enjoy its beauty.”
