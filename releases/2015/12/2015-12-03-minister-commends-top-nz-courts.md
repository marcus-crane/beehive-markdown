Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams has acknowledged New Zealand’s courts for their hard work in 2015.

“There’s a lot of work underway to modernise our court system and this year we’ve made some good progress. In particular there’s been a huge improvement in the way courts services are managed and improving these services for the public,” Ms Adams says.

“Some of the initiatives of the last year include smarter scheduling of court cases, text message reminders for forthcoming hearings, the completion of the Manukau District Court extension and ongoing work to develop the Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct.

“These awards are an opportunity for the Ministry to recognise the innovation and success we’re seeing so far.  This year’s award winners have all displayed excellence, innovation and a commitment to customer service.”

The award winners from all three court categories were: 

- District Courts: The Auckland Civil and Family Services Team for significant improvements addressing the timeliness of Family Court appointments.
- High Courts: The National Transcription Service – which transcribes hearings from Courts throughout the country – for its ongoing work to ensure Courts progress cases efficiently.
- Special Jurisdictions: The Specialist Courts Group, which supports the Employment, Environment and Coroners courts, for reducing the average age of cases in their jurisdictions by more than 30 percent since 2013.
