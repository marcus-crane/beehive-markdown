A Ministerial Investigation into the affairs of Te Aupōuri Māori Trust Board has been completed and its findings have been reported to Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell.

On 17 September 2015, Mr Flavell appointed Grant Taylor, a Partner at Ernst and Young, to conduct an investigation.

Its purpose was to piece together how the Board reached its financial situation.

“The investigation found no evidence of fraud or criminal activity.  I am pleased to hear that this is the case,” he says.

However, the report has confirmed that the Board is insolvent. 

Mr Flavell has directed the Board to comply with its financial reporting requirements under the Māori Trust Board’s Act 1955.

He also encouraged the Board to continue working closely with Te Rūnanga Nui o Te Aupōuri to address liabilities and risks identified in the report.
