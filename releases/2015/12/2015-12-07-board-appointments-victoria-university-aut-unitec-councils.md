Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced nine appointments to three tertiary education institution councils.

“I am pleased to welcome high-calibre council appointees into their new roles. I also welcome the reappointment of a number of council members in recognition of the high-quality governance they have been providing to these institutions,” Mr Joyce says.

“I also wish to recognise the valuable contribution made by outgoing council members and to thank them for their service.”

The appointments and reappointments of council members are:

•         Victoria University of Wellington: the appointments of Dame Patsy Reddy and Dame Therese Walsh as members, the reappointment of Sir Neville Jordan and Mr Neil Paviour-Smith;

•         Auckland University of Technology: the reappointment of Ms Lyn Lim, Ms Judith Thompson, Ms Sussan Turner and Mr Lex Henry as members;
