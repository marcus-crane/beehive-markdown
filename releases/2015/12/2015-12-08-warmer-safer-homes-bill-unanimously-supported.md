A Government Bill to require insulation and smoke alarms in all rental properties and to increase enforcement of housing standards received unanimous support in Parliament on its first reading, Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith said today.

“This is an important, practical Bill that will make homes warmer, dryer and safer for tens of thousands of New Zealanders without imposing unreasonable costs. I welcome the broad support across Parliament for the Bill that recognises the strong link between the quality of housing and the health and wellbeing of families,” Dr Smith said.

“The insulation requirements will apply to social housing that is heavily subsidised by Government from 1 July 2016 and to other tenancies from 1 July 2019.  All landlords will need to disclose in tenancy agreements from 1 July 2016 the extent of insulation in their rental property.  These new mandatory requirements are the next logical step after having insulated all state houses and having provided Warm Up New Zealand grants for insulating 285,000 homes.  The policy includes exemptions where it is not practical to install insulation.

“Smoke alarms will also need to be installed in all residential rental homes by 1 July next year. Regulations will make landlords responsible for ensuring operational smoke alarms are installed in their properties, and tenants responsible for changing batteries and reporting faulty alarms. Officials estimate that these changes will save an average of three lives per year, and reduce the number of fire-related injuries.”

“We are also including other targeted measures to tackle sub-standard rental properties. There are a small proportion of unsafe rental properties that have rot, unsafe wiring, leaky roofs, and broken plumbing.  These properties breach the current regulations. The answer is not more rules but better enforcement. The Bill gives new powers to the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to investigate and take direct action against landlords for breaking tenancy laws where there is a risk to the health and safety of tenants. We are also strengthening the protection for tenants who themselves take up these issues with the Tenancy Tribunal. 

“The final change reduces the time it takes to confirm abandoned tenancies. The current process can take up to six weeks, leaving a house empty and a landlord losing weeks of rental income. The Bill creates a fast-tracked, 10-day process enabling the re-tenanting of properties where a tenant has no intention of returning.”

The regulations on insulation and smoke alarms will be consulted on in parallel with the Select Committee process. Details on the quantity of insulation and number of smoke alarms required will be determined in the regulations. The regulations will also set under what circumstance a property can be excluded. Consultation is open from Thursday 3 December 2015 and closes 11pm on Thursday 10 February 2016.
