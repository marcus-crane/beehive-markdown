Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is encouraging road users to do the right thing and travel safely over the summer holidays.

“The Kiwi road trip, a great holiday tradition, often involves travelling long distances on unfamiliar roads. Anyone getting behind the wheel can help keep themselves, their loved ones and other road users safe by following the rules and applying common sense,” Mr Foss says.

Do the right thing:

- Wear a seatbelt
- Wear a helmet on motorcycles and bicycles
- Drive within the speed limit
- Drive to the conditions
- Drive sober
- Take regular rest breaks
- Be patient – it’s not a race

Mr Foss says drivers should also remember the road is a shared space.

“If you’re towing a caravan or trailer, be courteous, pull over when you can and let faster traffic pass.  If you’re behind a slower vehicle or a cyclist, only pass when it’s safe to do so.

“It’s the responsibility of all road users — drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians — to be vigilant and considerate while travelling.

“This is a special time of year for families, friends and communities, the last thing anyone wants to see or experience is carnage on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

The official holiday period begins 4pm Thursday 24 December 2015 and ends 6am Tuesday 5 January 2016.
