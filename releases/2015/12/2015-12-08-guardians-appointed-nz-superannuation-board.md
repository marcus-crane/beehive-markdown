Catherine Savage has been named as the Chair of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation Board, replacing current Chair Gavin Walker, who has resigned, Finance Minister Bill English has announced.

Ms Savage begins her tenure as Chair on 1 January 2016 for a term of just over three years, while Mr Walker’s term will end on 31 December 2015.

“I’d like to thank Gavin for his strong professional and personal leadership during his tenure,” Mr English says.

“Under his guidance the Superannuation Fund has become a global leader in setting standards in Sovereign wealth management. We wish him well”.

Ms Savage was appointed Deputy Chair of the Guardians in 2009 and has brought a depth of experience in New Zealand fund management and private equity to the Board. She is a Chartered Accountant and also a Chartered Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Directors.

She says she is delighted to have been given the opportunity to lead the Board and is looking forward to embracing the challenges the role will bring. 

Board member Lindsay Wright has been elevated to Deputy Chair. 

Ms Wright brings broad experience in international financial markets gained during a 25 year career in financial management.

Mr English says that as well as the vacancy left by Mr Walker’s departure, the terms of another two members will expire in 2016.

He says with the potential for three vacancies coming up, it is appropriate to review the fees to attract the best talent possible. 

“Cabinet has agreed to increase the base fee of a Director of this Board to $49,000. 

Setting the fee at this level recognises the $30 billion of assets under their care and the significant impact that this Board has on the provision of future retirement income for New Zealanders.”

The increase brings it in line with other large Crown entities, such as Housing New Zealand. 

Fees for the Deputy Chair and Chair are set at 1.25 and 2 times the ordinary fee respectively.
