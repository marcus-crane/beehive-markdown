New Zealand is the newest member of the Global Geothermal Alliance (GGA), Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges announced overnight in Paris.

The GGA is an initiative led by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to increase geothermal electricity generation and the direct use of geothermal heat. The announcement of New Zealand’s membership of the GGA took place in Paris as part of the Climate Change Conference.

“Joining the Alliance will position New Zealand firms to benefit from geothermal projects and partnerships around the world,” Mr Bridges says.

New Zealand currently has geothermal experts operating around the world including the Philippines, Indonesia, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

“We have a very unique value proposition and advantage in geothermal.  New Zealand has a long and successful history in the development of geothermal resources, with the first plant established still providing a reliable electricity source over 50 years later.

“We are now the fourth largest geothermal power generator in the world, after the United States, the Philippines and Indonesia.

“As the world transitions towards a lower carbon future, the increased demand for renewable energy, coupled with the ongoing interest in energy security, has focused attention on geothermal energy. Worldwide installed capacity is forecast to double this decade.”

The GGA’s objectives are to reduce risks associated with geothermal business, encourage geothermal investment and help integrate geothermal facilities into energy markets. It also promotes ways of using geothermal resources and associated network infrastructure efficiently.

Other members of the GGA include: Bolivia, Burundi, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, France, Honduras, Iceland, Nicaragua, Kenya, the Philippines, the United States, Turkey, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.
