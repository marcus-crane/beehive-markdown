Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will host the Australian Defence Minister, Senator Marise Payne in Christchurch today.

The Ministers will discuss a range of regional and international security issues, including international efforts to counter Da’esh and deployments such as the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai, and Operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan.  The respective New Zealand and Australian Defence White Papers will also be a topic of conversation.

“I welcome Senator Payne to New Zealand,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Although I have met with Senator Payne before, this will be our first formal bilateral meeting and will provide a timely opportunity to discuss mutual defence and security issues. 

“Australia is our closest security and trade partner, and it is important that we stay closely in touch on key issues that impact us both.”
