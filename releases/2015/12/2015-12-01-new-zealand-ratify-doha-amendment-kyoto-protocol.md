New Zealand will ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser announced today.

“We see ratification of the amendment as critical for maintaining momentum in global climate change negotiations,” says Mr Groser.

The Doha Amendment created a second commitment period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020. It needs to be ratified by three-quarters of Kyoto Protocol parties to enter into force.

“While New Zealand made its commitment for this period under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol’s parent treaty, we want to support this amendment’s entry into force.

“Delivering existing commitments is an important sign of good faith in the lead up to negotiations for the new agreement,” says Mr Groser.

“Supporting the amendment reinforces our commitment to the global effort to respond to climate change. 

“It is also critical that New Zealand can influence decisions that may have significant long-term impacts on our economy such as access to international carbon markets and accounting rules for the land- sector.”

New Zealand will continue to apply the Kyoto rules to its target under the UNFCCC. The Government has announced an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) target of reducing GHG emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Doha Amendment will come into force when at least 144 countries in the Kyoto Protocol formally accept it under their domestic procedures. So far 54 countries have completed this procedure. New Zealand has now formally deposited its instrument of acceptance with the UN bringing the total to 55.
