Associate Climate Change Issues Minister Simon Bridges will tomorrow travel to Paris, France to take part in the Paris Climate Change Conference.

“For the first time leaders will seek to agree a new binding climate change agreement that includes contributions from all major emitting countries.

“Ensuring maximum participation will be essential for putting the world on a path to keeping global temperature rise below two degrees.

“Climate change is a very important part of my portfolios, not only as Associate Minister for Climate Change Issues, but also as Energy and Resources Minister and Transport Minister as we transition to a low-carbon future.

“I will therefore pursue the numerous opportunities for bilateral meetings at the conference and take every opportunity to push New Zealand’s interests in promoting our renewable advantage and our country as a technology test-bed.

“I want New Zealand to be positioned to make the most of emerging transport and energy technologies, and promote our renewables expertise and experience, in the transition to a low-carbon global economy,” says Mr Bridges.
