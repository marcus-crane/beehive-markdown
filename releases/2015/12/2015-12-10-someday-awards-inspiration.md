Conservation and Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has congratulated the young winners of the 9th annual The Outlook for Someday film challenge.

“The Outlook for Someday is all about sustainability, celebrating New Zealand’s natural world and exploring the social and environmental challenges which confront us as a nation,” Ms Barry says.

“This year has drawn a diverse and interesting range of different approaches from the 20 award winners, covering everything from an animation on the impact of plastic bags, a mockumentary on overpopulation and a rapper’s guide to recycling.”

Anyone up to the age of 24 can enter a film up to five minutes long on any aspect of the broad theme of sustainability in the competition, which is run by Connected Media.

The Department of Conservation is one of the sponsors as part of its national outreach and education programme.

“It’s through inspiring young people that we ensure the future of conservation, and the future of our nation, is in good hands,” Ms Barry says.

“As Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister, I think it is great to see such creative, clever and engaging films from young people, which reinforces my belief that the next generation will see our arts continue to thrive and grow.”

At the awards ceremony in Auckland tonight, Ms Barry presented the Body Shop Standout Winner award to 16-year-old Hunter Williams, from Auckland, for his film *NVader*, a hard-hitting and extraordinarily mature examination of sex trafficking.
