Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed today’s release of the final report of the Dairy Capability Working Group.

“The Working Group found the food safety capability of New Zealand’s dairy sector is in good shape,” says Mrs Goodhew. “Looking forward, to maintain our reputation as a world class provider of safe and suitable food we now need to anticipate the changing face of food safety.

“For the report’s recommendations to make a real impact we need strong commitment from the dairy sector. However, it is helpful that the report isn’t just about dairy. As a food producing nation all food sectors will find the report useful.

“The report supports a holistic and future-focussed approach to food safety, where the end consumer is firmly at the centre. This approach will be critical to achieving the government’s target to double agricultural sector exports by 2025.

“I would like to thank the members of the Working Group for their hard work. The report gives us a very strong basis to move forward in those areas where further action is needed to secure a strong food safety future for New Zealand.”

The independent Dairy Capability Working Group was established in August 2014 to assess food safety capability and capacity in the dairy sector and make recommendations to ensure that current and future needs of the industry are met.
