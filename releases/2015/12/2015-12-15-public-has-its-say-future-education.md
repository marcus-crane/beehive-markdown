Education Minister Hekia Parata says she is delighted so many members of the public have taken the opportunity to have their say on the future of education.

When submissions on the proposed update of the Education Act closed last night 1814 submissions had been received.

“This shows New Zealanders recognise the critical importance of ensuring our education system is fit for purpose in the 21st century,” says Ms Parata. “I want to thank all those who went to the trouble of attending one of the 120 consultation workshops and meetings held around the country and all those who made a submission.”

“This consultation has been an important first step to gather ideas on how we can bring the Act, which has been in force since 1989, up to date.”

The submissions and workshop feedback will now be analysed by the Ministry of Education and used to shape firmer proposals for ministers’ consideration.

Ms Parata says proposed changes to the Act will be put to Cabinet for approval and, if Cabinet agrees, a Bill will be drafted for introduction to Parliament next year.

People will then have the opportunity to provide feedback on specific proposals when the Bill is referred to a select committee for consideration.

A report summarising submission themes will be made available on the Ministry’s website in early 2016 [here](http://www.education.govt.nz/education-act-udpate.).
