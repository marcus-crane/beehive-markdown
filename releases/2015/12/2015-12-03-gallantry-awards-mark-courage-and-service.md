Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has paid tribute to the courage and high standards of service exhibited by New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel who have been recognised in the Special Honours List released by Government House today, and also those who have received honours announced by the Chief of Defence Force.

“A range of honours have been conferred today, for gallantry and other outstanding service in two of the NZDF’s most demanding deployments of recent times, Afghanistan and South Sudan.

“Those locations are far apart on the map, but what these officers and soldiers have in common is a dedication to their duty in the most dangerous circumstances, in keeping with New Zealand’s long tradition of maintaining the highest standards of military service,” Mr Brownlee says.

One of today’s awards has had to be made posthumously.

“Lance Corporal Rory Malone gave his life in the service of New Zealand,” Mr Brownlee says.

“His sacrifice, and that of other personnel who lost their lives, must never be forgotten.

“The core values of the NZDF are courage, commitment and comradeship.

“These personnel have exemplified those values.  I am proud of them all.”
