Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced the Ministerial appointments to the governing council of the new tertiary institution for Canterbury, which merges Aoraki Polytechnic and Christchurch Institute of Technology (CPIT).

The Ministerial appointees are Jenn Bestwick as Chair of the new institution, Janie Annear as Deputy Chair, and Elizabeth Hopkins and Stephen Collins as council members. 

Jenn Bestwick, the current Chair of CPIT, will become the Chair of the new organisation while Janie Annear, currently the Chair of Aoraki Polytechnic, will become the new organisation’s Deputy Chair. 

The new council will take over on 1 January 2016 when the newly formed organisation of CPIT Aoraki is established.

“I am confident that these four Ministerial appointees will provide high-quality governance and leadership to the new institution,” Mr Joyce says. “They are all well qualified and experienced for the role, and have invested their time and governance skills over the past 18 months to build a new sustainable Canterbury-wide tertiary organisation.”

The four other members of the new institution’s governing body are appointed by the council. They include existing CPIT council members Jane Cartwright, John Hunter and Lynne Harata Te Aika.  The council has also made a new appointment in Jeremy Boys, the former Chief Executive of PrimePort, Timaru who will join from 1 January 2016. 

“The new appointees will strengthen the regional outlook of the council and will effectively contribute to the successful leadership required to lead the newly formed Canterbury-wide organisation,” says Mr Joyce.

“These new appointments reflect the role of the new polytechnic as a truly regional entity focused on delivering skills for students and employers right across the region. It was important that the entire region was represented on the board, and this board reflects that. The new larger tertiary institution will provide Canterbury-wide access to high-quality vocational education.”
