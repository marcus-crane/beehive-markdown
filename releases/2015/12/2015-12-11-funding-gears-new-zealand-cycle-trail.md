Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has announced the Government is investing almost $530,000 in 10 new projects that will contribute to enhancing and maintaining the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

The funding comes through the latest round of the Maintaining the Quality of the Great Rides fund and Mr Key said priority has been given to proposals that aim to improve the safety and quality of the Great Rides - the premier rides of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“This is the third round of Maintaining the Quality of the Great Rides funding. The Government is investing $8 million over four years through the fund to ensure that the Great Rides are maintained to their current world-class standards,” says Mr Key.

“The Great Rides have provided a significant boost to tourism in New Zealand and the funding provided will help ensure that users can continue to soak up New Zealand’s beautiful scenery in a safe and enjoyable way.”

Mr Key said that use of the cycle trails by international and domestic visitors has seen significant growth.

“More than 125,000 people got in the saddle to use the cycle trail in January 2015, compared to 97,000 in January 2014.”

The Government has invested a total of just under $2 million in the fund so far to maintain and further enhance the trails that are used by thousands of people every day. 

The 10 projects to receive funding in this funding round are:

- Waikato River Trails Charitable Trust $53,400
- Hauraki Rail Trail Charitable Trust $39,904
- Central Otago Clutha Trails Limited $19,716
- Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust $29,514
- Hawke’s Bay Regional Council $23,220
- Ruapehu District Council – two grants of $15,000 and $40,000
- Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency  $229,600
- Wanganui District Council $36,243
- Westland District Council  $42,750

The next funding round will be in February 2016.
