Ten community groups will receive the services of a skilled professional free of charge for up to a year, Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew announced today.

The internships, together worth more than $230,000, will be funded from the Community Internship Programme.

“Many community groups are desperately in need of specialist help,” says Mrs Goodhew. “By funding their employment costs this programme allows community groups to hire a professional to help them with projects the groups don’t usually have the capability or resources to do on their own.”

“Projects identified for this year’s interns range from developing communication plans, carrying out compliance and contracting reviews, and building a new digital platform.

“Over the year, the interns themselves will get valuable experience working in organisations where the good they do and the positive change they make will be seen every day.”

The 10 successful applicants are:

•         Citizens Advice Bureau, Napier

•         Link House Trust, Waikato

•         Neighbourhood Trust, Christchurch

•         Presbyterian Support, East Coast

•         Shama Hamilton Ethnic Women's Centre Trust

•         Tangata Whenua, Community and Voluntary Sector Research Centre

•         Te Runanga o Te Rarawa, Kaitaia

•         Te Wananga o Tamaki Nui A Rua Incorporated, Dannevirke

•         Volunteer Nelson

•         Young Men's Christian Association of South and Mid Canterbury
