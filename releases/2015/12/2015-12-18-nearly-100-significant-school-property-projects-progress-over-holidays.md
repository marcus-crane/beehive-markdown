Classes may have stopped but the Government’s investment means lots of building work will be happening in schools over the holidays, with around 100 significant projects of over $3 million each currently on the go, says Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

“Christmas and New Year is an important time to undertake redevelopments because it enables the least disruption to students and teachers,” says Ms Kaye.

“There are 23 larger projects, with a total value of more than $785 million, which will be progressed or completed during the upcoming holidays.

“These include redevelopments at Koru School in Auckland, Tarawera High School in Kawerau, Murupara Area School in Bay of Plenty and Aotea College in Porirua, and the building of Rolleston College in Canterbury and Wakatipu High School in Queenstown.

“There are another 74 projects in the $3-15 million range also currently underway. This is only possible because the Government has invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation nationwide over the past seven years, which is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.

“This year, the Government has announced significant investments in school infrastructure, including projects aimed at accommodating roll growth, addressing weathertightness issues, increasing earthquake resilience and modernising and replacing ageing buildings.

“We’re committed to ensuring that students all over New Zealand have access to safe and inspiring environments in which to learn.”

When new schools are built or redevelopments carried out, this is also an opportunity to create innovative learning environments, featuring the latest IT infrastructure to support digital learning; high quality acoustics, lighting and heating, to help students concentrate on learning; and flexible learning spaces which can provide an open-plan layout or be closed off into traditional classrooms.

“All up, there are thousands of school property projects currently underway, ranging from small-scale, school-run capital maintenance projects, such as re-roofing or replacing a heating system, right through to multi-million dollar redevelopments and the construction of new schools.

“Because of our investments in addressing leaky buildings and earthquake strengthening, we’ve been able to significantly increase smaller-scale projects, which can make a big difference to students and teachers having more comfortable, safe learning environments.

“In addition to the property work underway, there are also significant projects waiting in the wings.

“Ten major redevelopments have been approved and are currently at the planning or design phase, including Western Springs College in Auckland, Aotea College in Porirua and Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges in Blenheim. Work on some of these projects will begin in 2016.”

The new year will also see five new schools opened – Rototuna Junior High School in Hamilton; and Marshland School, Waitakiri School, Rawhiti School and West Rolleston School, all in Canterbury.

“We’re ensuring that young people all over New Zealand can learn in environments that inspire and support them to achieve to the best of their potential.”
