Transport Ministers today released a consultation paper that looks at options for new rules for passenger services such as taxis, private hires, shuttles, and ridesharing.

Earlier this year the Government initiated the small passenger services review to ensure regulations for the sector were both fit for purpose and flexible enough to accommodate new technologies.

“The review found the regulations, established in the late 1980s, need to be updated due to changes in technology, the range of services now offered and changing consumer expectations,” Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

“Technology, such as smart phones and apps, are really changing the range of services on offer and the way they operate.

“The proposed options set out how to simplify the regulations and ensure they are fit for purpose, accommodate new technologies and maintain the safety of passengers and drivers.”

“The Government is a strong supporter of innovations that enable all New Zealanders and theirbusinesses, traditional or otherwise, to enjoy the benefits of new technology,” Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

“We want to make sure we have the right rules in place for the right services. Consumers should have a range of services to choose from, and feel safe and well informed no matter what service they’re are using. Drivers should also feel safe in their place of work.

“Before the Government makes a decision about the appropriate level of regulation, we’re seeking feedback from both the sector and the public.”

Submissions close Friday 12 February 2016. The consultation paper and information about how to make a submission can be found at: [www.transport.govt.nz/spsreview](http://www.transport.govt.nz/spsreview)
