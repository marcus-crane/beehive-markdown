Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams has announced a range of board appointments to some of New Zealand’s iconic broadcasting institutions.

“Across the board, these appointments will see a mix of new experience and valuable continuity retained at a time when we are looking at the impact of convergence on the sector,” Ms Adams says.

“Chair Peter Radich is taking up the reins of the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) for a third term as his knowledge and understanding of the environment make him invaluable while we assess laws to make sure they’re relevant in today’s online broadcasting environment.

“With several new appointments at the BSA, Ms Pearson will also remain until October 2016 to give continuity during this time of change.”

Ms Adams also announced the appointment of Toko Kapea to the Board of Television New Zealand (TVNZ).

“Mr Kapea is a Wellington-based lawyer and director. He is the Chair of Bathurst Resources, and has held a number of directorships with Maori and Iwi-based businesses and organisations. Mr Kapea’s commercial experience alongside his Maori perspectives will bring a valuable dimension to the TVNZ Board,” Ms Adams says.

Rodger Finlay from Akaroa and Bill Francis of Auckland will join the Radio New Zealand (RNZ) Board.

“Mr Finlay is a professional director with extensive commercial experience. He will bring significant commercial and financial acumen to the RNZ Board,” Ms Adams says.

“Bill Francis’ name is synonymous with radio broadcasting in New Zealand. As a former General Manager of the Radio Network for nearly twenty years, he will bring a depth of knowledge and understanding of the business of radio to the board of Radio New Zealand.”
