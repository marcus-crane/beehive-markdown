Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a draft Action Plan to guide training and development of mental health workers is out for sector consultation. 

“New Zealand has a highly skilled and professional health workforce. Each year the Government invests around $20 million in mental health and addiction workforce development,” says Dr Coleman

“The *Mental Health and Addiction Workforce Action Plan* will help to ensure we have sufficient well-trained mental health and addiction staff to meet increasing demand and the future needs of New Zealanders.”

The five year draft Action Plan addresses four key areas – primary care and community care, integration between primary and secondary care, specialist training pathways, and addiction treatment pathways.

“The steps in the draft Action Plan range from increased training in primary care, to greater involvement of family to support prevention and early intervention,” says Dr Coleman.

“There has been an increasing shift towards more mental health and addiction services provided in the community. This aligns with the draft updated New Zealand Health Strategy which emphases the importance of care closer to home.”

Over 300 mental health and addiction workers have been involved in the development of the draft Action Plan. A series of four regional meetings with stakeholders have been held in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. Formal feedback on the draft plan finishes mid-January 2016.

The Action Plan is expected to be finalised early next year.
