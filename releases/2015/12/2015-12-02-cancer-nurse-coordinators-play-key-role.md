Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an evaluation of the cancer nurse coordinator initiative shows overwhelmingly positive feedback from patients and their families.

The independent evaluation by research consultancy Litmus comes two years into the $4 million a year initiative to fund cancer nurse coordinators across the 20 DHBs.

“Cancer nurse coordinators fill a very important role - acting as a single point of contact for patients and families,” says Dr Coleman.

“These nurses have become the go-to-person to help patients’ navigate their way through the health system.

“The evaluation found cancer nurse coordinators help to improve patient outcomes by coordinating care and making sure assessments, diagnostic tests and treatment occur in a timely and seamless manner.

“It also found the initiative is meeting the goals set in 2013. Other key successes include the nurses’ integration into the workforce, and their contribution to system improvements.

“Providers surveyed also acknowledged the nurses’ contribution to patients having more coordinated care through increased timeliness of referrals, diagnosis, and access to treatment and services.”

There are 71 cancer nurse coordinators across the country.

The evaluation, undertaken between November 2014 and April 2015, included analysing systems databases, DHB case studies, and survey data from cancer nurse coordinators, providers, patients, and senior managers.
