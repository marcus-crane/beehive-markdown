Prime Minister John Key and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel had a productive meeting in Berlin today.

“The relationship between our two countries has grown significantly over the last 12 months,” says Mr Key.

“It was great to meet with Federal Chancellor Merkel today following her successful visit to New Zealand late last year, and continue our discussions on a wide range of political, economic, social and security issues.

“Germany is the world’s fourth biggest economy so today’s meeting was a good opportunity to discuss further trade and economic opportunities.

“We talked about New Zealand and the European Union’s recent commitment to move towards negotiating a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. I welcomed Chancellor Merkel’s renewed support for this important undertaking.

“We also discussed international issues, including the international response to terrorism, the situation in Syria and refugee and migration issues.” 

New Zealand and Germany have strong links in science and innovation.

Earlier today it was announced that a venture between Auckland University’s Bioengineering Institute and the Fraunhofer IPA, has been awarded ICON status which will provide them with additional support and funding to help develop bionic joints.

“New Zealand and Germany produce some of the most innovative researchers in the world so this makes us ideal partners. 

“The bionic joint project has the potential to improve quality of life for millions of people with reduced use of their limbs,” says Mr Key.

“New Zealand and Germany also have strong agricultural links.  Today I am pleased to announce we’re establishing a working group to look at scientific ways to address some of the global challenges facing agriculture. New Zealand will host the working group’s first meeting in 2016.”

Mr Key also announced a one-off Prime Minister’s First World War Centenary Peace and Security Scholarship, to be awarded to a German student at master’s level to study in New Zealand.

“New Zealand and Germany’s have strong links across a number of areas and I look forward to strengthening our ties in the future.”
