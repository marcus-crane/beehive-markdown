Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated the Pacific recipients of appointments and awards in the New Year 2016 Honours.

Among those who have been recognised are former All Blacks Keven Mealamu and Ma’a Nonu, both made Members of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

“These men are positive role models for young Pacific people and for our wider community,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“It is not just their on-field exploits that we have admired over the years but their compassion for others and the time they are willing to put in, despite heavy commitments, to promote good causes and charity work.”

All Blacks assistant manager and mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his services to rugby and sport psychology.

“The Cook Islands community, in New Zealand and in the Pacific, will be proud of his achievements,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Emeline Afeaki-Mafile’o was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit and Lani Tupu and Hola Taue were awarded Queen’s Service Medals for their services to the Pacific community.

All three have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of Pacific people and others in their communities.

“We applaud these members of our community for the positive effect they have and the work that will benefit future generations,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Pacific people have much to contribute to New Zealand society and beyond, and this year’s honours recipients have helped bring our unique cultures into focus through their work.”
