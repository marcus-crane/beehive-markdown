Trade Minister, Todd McClay, today issued a call for public submissions on the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between New Zealand and the European Union (EU).

“New Zealand enjoys a close and long-standing relationship with the EU and last year concluded a Partnership Agreement on Relations and Cooperation.  A modern, high-quality FTA is the missing link in our important relationship,” says Mr McClay.

“The agreement reached in Brussels at the end of October between the Prime Minister and EU Presidents Juncker and Tusk, that the two sides would start the process for negotiations is the first step towards achieving a comprehensive, high quality FTA.” 

The EU is New Zealand’s third largest trading partner, with two-way trade valued at $19.6 billion in goods and services in the year to June 2015.  This includes exports of over $8 billion and imports of $11.5 billion in goods and services combined.  

The EU is also the second largest source of foreign direct investment in New Zealand, as well as a major partner for New Zealand companies and organisations conducting international research and development.

“Early next year, we expect to begin discussions to define the scope and overall approach to the negotiations,” says Mr McClay.

“We are keen to hear from all New Zealanders with an interest in an FTA negotiation with the EU, including businesses, NGOs, and members of the public.

Mr McClay says that, given the steps that need to be completed before FTA negotiations can commence, the most likely date for the start of negotiations would be early 2017.

“In this initial call for public submissions, we have asked to receive submissions by the end of February, but there will be further opportunities for public input as the next steps in this process occur, “says Mr McClay.
