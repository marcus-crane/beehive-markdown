The next round of the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Fund opens for applications today, Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner has announced.

“NZSL is central to Deaf culture and identity, and is crucial to Deaf people’s ability to communicate and fully participate in society,” Ms Wagner says.

“The second round of the NZSL Fund seeks proposals for NZSL community-led projects that strengthen NZSL, especially in the home, within whānau, hapū and iwi, and within the Deaf community.

“Up to $1 million in NZSL Fund grants are available for the second round of funding. These grants will support community-based and community-led projects that promote and maintain NZSL.

“Focusing the Fund on community-led projects will help the NZSL community to ensure both the language and the culture continues.

“The support of local and national projects through the NZSL Fund will help create a vibrant, healthy, and prosperous Deaf culture, for current and future generations of Deaf people and NZSL users,” Ms Wagner says.

Applications are open until 19 February 2016. Further information about the NZSL Fund, including how to make an application, can be found here: [www.odi.govt.nz/nzsl-fund](http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzsl-fund)
