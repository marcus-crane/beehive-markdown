Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed news that Iraqi troops who were trained by the New Zealand Defence Force’s (NZDF) Building Partner Capacity mission in Taji were part of the force that has retaken the city of Ramadi from Daesh (ISIL).

“The success of these troops results from their commitment to the training programme they have been involved in. New Zealand and Australian trainers can take some pride over the successful action by the recruits,” Mr Brownlee says.

“NZDF trainers have gone into a dangerous environment and professionally established a training operation which is upskilling large numbers of Iraqi troops to better equip themselves to fight.

“New Zealanders can be very proud of the work our troops are doing to professionalise the Iraqi security forces.”
