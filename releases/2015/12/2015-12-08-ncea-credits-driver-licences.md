Students are to be given the chance to earn NCEA credits by obtaining driver licences, Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss announced today.

“Too many young people are missing out on jobs because they don’t have a licence and too many others are entering the courts system because they are driving without licences,” says Ms Parata.

She says schools and tertiary education providers will not be obliged to include driver training in their curricula, but many will find doing so makes learning more relevant for students.

“As an example a school might find that incorporating a learning module for the licence theory test into its Year 11 English programme or a Gateway programme helps to engage the interest of students.”

The granting of licences will remain the responsibility of the relevant driver licensing agents.

Students will be able to gain 2 credits towards NCEA Level 1 by passing the learner licence theory test, 4 credits towards NCEA Level 2 by earning a restricted licence and a further 2 credits towards NCEA Level 2 by gaining a full licence. The administrative systems to support this change will be in place from April 1 next year.

Mr Foss says a major benefit of the initiative, which a Government inter-agency group has been working on for the past 12 months, will be to open up employment opportunities for young people.

“Employers are telling us that not having a driving licence is holding many 16-24 year olds back. Removing barriers that some young people face in gaining their licence is an ongoing focus for the Government.

“One way we can help is to assist young people to obtain a licence as part of their NCEA aspirations.

“Assisting young people to undertake driver education and training will also support young drivers to become safer on our roads,” says Mr Foss.
