Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has launched the country’s ninth Children’s Team in Canterbury, which will work with around 1,300 vulnerable children in its first two years.

The team will ensure that at-risk children have an individually tailored support plan to address their multiple and complex unmet needs, and will work with families and agencies to implement it.

“These children are growing up in families where there is domestic violence, financial hardship, drug and alcohol abuse and inconsistent attention and love paid to them,” Mrs Tolley says.

“A Lead Professional will work with them and their family to address their needs and support them to thrive, so they don’t need state intervention.

“This is not about adding new services, but making sure a child and their family are accessing the support they need – whether it is health, housing, education or parenting support.

“If government agencies, NGOs and iwi work together, share information and provide coordinated services we can make a significant difference in the lives of these children and their families.

“I want to thank everyone involved in the launch of the Canterbury Children’s Team for their commitment and determination to help our vulnerable children,” Mrs Tolley says.

Teams have already been launched and are accepting referrals in Whangarei, Rotorua, Horowhenua/Ōtaki, Marlborough, Hamilton, Tairawhiti, Eastern Bay of Plenty and Whanganui. A team is currently being established in Counties Manukau.
