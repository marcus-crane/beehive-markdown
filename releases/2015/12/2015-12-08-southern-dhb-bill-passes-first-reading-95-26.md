Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a Bill to extend the term of the Southern DHB Commissioner passed its first reading today 95-26.

The New Zealand Public Health and Disability (Southern DHB) Elections Bill will extend the term of the Commissioner and her team to 2019.

“Achieving financial stability at Southern DHB is a long term process. Without legislative change the Commissioner and her team would have less than 18 months to improve the DHB’s position,” says Dr Coleman.

“Exempting Southern DHB from next year’s Board elections is essential to give the Commissioner and her team time to implement the financially sustainable plan to ensure that high quality health services are delivered, as well as the vital redevelopment of Dunedin Hospital.

“It will also ensure that the next Board, to be appointed as part of the 2019 local body elections, will begin its term on a more secure financial footing.”

The New Zealand Public Health and Disability (Southern DHB) Elections Bill has been referred to the Health Committee for consideration.

A Commissioner was appointed in June following serious concerns over the Board’s financial performance. A spiralling deficit had been forecast and it was expected to increase up to $42 million for 2015/16.

An improved deficit position of $35.9 million for 2015/16 for Southern DHB has been agreed, which shows progress is being made.
