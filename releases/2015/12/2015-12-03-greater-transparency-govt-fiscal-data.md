Data released today by Treasury and Figure.NZ makes is even easier for the public to dig into the Crown’s books for details on its spending and revenue, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“New Zealand is a leader in budget transparency - we’ve again been ranked 1st in the international Open Budget Index 2015 - but we are committed to ongoing improvements.”

The release covers over 90 categories of fiscal data; from headline measures such as the OBEGAL surplus and net debt to more detailed information around different categories of spending.

“The data shows, for example, that the Government has successfully reduced core Crown expenses from 34 per cent of GDP in 2011 to 30 per cent in 2015.  The real benefit in the release, however, is that by pulling fiscal information into one place in a format that meets open data standards, it’s much easier to access and analyse.”

The Government is continually working to increase data transparency across all public services, such as the 2011 Declaration on Open and Transparent Government, the expansion of the scope of the world-leading Integrated Data Infrastructure, and the establishment of the Data Futures Partnership.

“Government doesn’t have all the answers – so we are using greater transparency to help drive improved results from public spending,” Mr English says.
