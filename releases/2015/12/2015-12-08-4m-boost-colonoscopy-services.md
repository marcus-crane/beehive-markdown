Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an extra $4 million is being made available for DHB colonoscopy services.

“A colonoscopy can identify whether a person has cancer or pre-cancerous growths. Early identification and treatment can save lives,” says Dr Coleman.

“This extra $4 million in funding will support DHBs to undertake additional colonoscopies and help to reduce waiting times.

“Two years ago less than a third of patients waiting for a non-urgent colonoscopy received one within the timeframe of six weeks. Now almost 60 per cent receive a colonoscopy within this target time.

“Nationally the urgent colonoscopy target is being exceeded. Figures for September show 76.6 per cent of patients in the urgent category had their colonoscopy within the recommended 14 days, exceeding the 75 per cent target.

“Wait times for non-urgent and surveillance colonoscopy are trending well, but are slightly below target. The funding boost will help to address this.”  

Improving colonoscopy services is a priority for the Government, with an additional $11.4 million provided in Budget 2013 and 2014.

There are a number of initiatives underway to strengthen the endoscopy workforce and increase the use of CT colonoscopy where available and clinically appropriate.

To inform the next steps towards a possible roll out of a national bowel screening programme, the Ministry of Health has been consulting with the sector on how the service could be provided across DHBs.
