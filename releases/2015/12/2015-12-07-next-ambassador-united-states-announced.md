Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister John Key has announced Tim Groser as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to the United States.

“New Zealand’s relationship with the United States is one of our most crucial,” Mr Key says.

“As the world’s largest economy and New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner, the United States is a key destination for our exporters. New Zealand and the United States also cooperate on a range of international peace and security issues.

“Tim’s extensive international experience as Trade Minister makes him well-placed for this role, particularly as the Trans-Pacific Partnership progresses towards implementation.”

Mr Groser has been a member of Parliament since 2005 and a Minister since 2008, holding the Trade, Climate Change Issues, Conservation and Associate Foreign Affairs Ministerial portfolios in that time.

His previous roles include New Zealand’s Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, Chief Executive of the Asia New Zealand Foundation and New Zealand’s Ambassador to Indonesia.

Mr Key thanked outgoing Ambassador Mike Moore for his contribution and service to New Zealand in Washington.

“I want to thank Mike for the role he has played as Ambassador since 2010. New Zealand’s relationship with the United States has been strengthening over a number of years and Mike has been a key contributor to that improvement.

“I wish him and his wife Yvonne all the best as they return home to New Zealand.”

Mr Groser will to take up the appointment in early 2016.
