Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Education Minister Hekia Parata have congratulated the twelve New Zealanders who are recipients of New Year’s Honours for their services to education.

“I’d like to congratulate the 2016 recipients for the valuable contribution they’ve made to education in New Zealand and internationally,” Mr Joyce says. “It’s great to see some of the best being honoured for their services.”

“The tireless work of these honourees across early childhood education through to senior secondary and tertiary has helped ensure that New Zealand has a world-class education system. It’s wonderful that they’ve been publicly recognised,” Ms Parata says.
