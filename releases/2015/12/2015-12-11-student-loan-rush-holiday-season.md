Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew is congratulating the 63,728 tertiary students who have applied for their 2016 Student Loans and Allowances.

“Peak season used to result in lengthy application hold up’s for students,” Mrs Goodhew says. “But the process is now much faster thanks to StudyLink’s improved services, a better online application system and students applying earlier.”

Between 1 October and 5 December, 63,728 students applied for allowances and loans for their 2016 study, 7,970 more than in the same period in 2014.

“Those students have submitted a total of 98,257 applications, 7,293 more than last year.

“At this rate we expect that more than 160,000 students will have applied by March 2016.”

By applying before 16 December students will be in the best position to have their finances in place before they start their study. Students can visit ([www.studylink.govt.nz](http://www.studylink.govt.nz)) for more information.
