Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has congratulated 24 young people in care who have been acknowledged in the ninth annual William Wallace Awards in Wellington.

“I wholeheartedly congratulate today’s winners – they are achieving well in their chosen field and have overcome many challenges to do so,” Mrs Tolley says.

The William Wallace Awards recognise outstanding young people in care and provide scholarships of up to $4,000 to help them pursue tertiary study, vocational training or leadership development.

“These young people are in care through no fault of their own – but they’ve chosen to make the most of every opportunity and have applied themselves to achieve their goals,” Mrs Tolley says.

“They are role models for other young people in care. Many are considerably involved in their communities and culture, and many excel in sport and music.

“I’d also like to thank the caregivers and foster families who have taken these young people into their homes, given them the love and attention they deserve and supported them to do their very best.

“These scholarships will help them take the next step in achieving their goals and aspirations – whether that’s through contributions to university fees, halls of residence, equipment or leadership training.

“These remarkable young people, the families, social workers and caregivers can be very proud of what they have achieved and I wish them all the best.”
