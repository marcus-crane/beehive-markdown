Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has congratulated students from Palmerston North Girls’ High School for winning the Enterprising Primary Industries Career (EPIC) Challenge today.

The competition involves students promoting careers in the primary sector to their peers.  

“The winning entry included posters with information on becoming a Beef Manager, Dairy Farmer and Bee Keeper and a promotional video,” says Mr Guy

“Congratulations to the team members Nomuna Amarbat, Sophie Brokenshire, Olivia Durston and Aliyah Shariff, as well as their teachers Sheryl Murwood and Jenny Dunstan.”

The winner of the Dairy Award was the *Boys’ Own Primary Zone* team from Huanui College in Whangarei. Their entry focused on engaging boys in learning that would lead them to careers across all sectors of the primary industries.

They developed the promotional concept of a series of e-magazines targeted at Year 9 and 10 students that would focus on a different sector every second month.

“This competition is important because it involves young people talking to their peers in their own language to promote these exciting careers.

“To meet our goal of doubling the value of primary sector exports by 2025, we will need an additional 50,000 workers. Raising awareness of the great career options is a major priority.

“The EPIC challenge is one of a range of initiatives to attract more young people into the sector. Soon we will be have primary sector ambassadors engaging with students to give hands-on experience and advice.”
