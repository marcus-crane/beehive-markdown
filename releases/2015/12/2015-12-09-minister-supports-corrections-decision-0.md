Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says he supports Corrections’ decision not to renew Serco’s contract to manage Mount Eden Corrections Facility.

“The decision is one for the chief executive of Corrections to make. However, I fully support the decision he has made. The contract allowed for non-renewal after six years and I have been briefed on the reasons behind this decision,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Ministers will receive advice from Corrections on options for the future management of MECF early next year.

“This decision not to renew the contract will allow the department to consider changes to the management contract that will ensure it is run safely and effectively,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I have been informed that the Corrections chief executive has received the Chief Inspector’s report into MECF. I am unable to comment further on this as it is the subject of legal action by Serco.”
