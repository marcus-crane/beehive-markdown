Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss welcomes a new civil aviation rule, enabling New Zealand aircraft maintenance training organisations to more easily train overseas aircraft engineers.

“This Rule will ensure New Zealand aligns with international best practice in certification and operation of aviation maintenance training organisations,” says Mr Foss.

”It will allow international business opportunities for New Zealand aircraft maintenance training organisations.”

New Zealand stands to gain from the opportunity to train overseas aircraft engineers. Target markets include China, Indonesia, India, Viet Nam and Malaysia.

“The aviation industry has been integral in the development of Part 147,” says Mr Foss

“I would encourage the industry to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new Rule,” says Mr Foss.   

To become Part 147 certificated, organisations undertaking specific types of aircraft maintenance training must demonstrate to the Director of Civil Aviation how they will meet the requirements in Part 147.

The requirements relate to aspects such as employing appropriately qualified staff, providing appropriate facilities, keeping accurate records and ensuring training courses and examinations are appropriately conducted.

Civil Aviation Rule Part 147 (Maintenance Training Organisations) will come into force on 1 February 2016.
