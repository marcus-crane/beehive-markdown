Todd McClay will next week attend the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. 

This will be Mr McClay’s first duty as Trade Minister, a portfolio change which takes effect on Monday.

“Key issues for trade and development will be in the spotlight at Nairobi, including in the important area of agriculture,” says Mr McClay. 

“WTO Members will be trying to agree a package of measures from the Doha Round agenda, which has been stalled since 2008.

“While no negotiation with more than 160 participants could be described as easy, we hope that all players come to the table prepared to play their best hand.

“As well as negotiations on new market access and improved multilateral trade rules, the WTO works to ensure that hard-won market access is preserved and existing WTO rules are complied with.

“While New Zealand has been successful in securing a network of high quality free trade agreements, we believe that FTAs should complement and contribute to the WTO system.  

“When it comes to trade issues, global solutions are the most effective ones.” 

Mr McClay will have a range of bilateral meetings in Nairobi.  

The WTO Ministerial Conferences take place every two years.
