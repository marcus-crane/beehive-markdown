Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming the completion of additional road safety measures on the West Coast ahead of the busy summer holiday period.

NZ Transport agency contractors this week completed the installation of 55 kilometres of rumble strips on State Highway 6 between Hokitika and Haast and 12 road safety billboards throughout the region.

“The Government recognises the concerns many have with poor driving on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations.  That’s why, in March this year, we extended the multi-agency Visiting Driver Signature Project (VDSP) to include the West Coast. 

“Studies show rumble strips reduce crashes by up to 20 per cent. There are now more than 200 kilometres of both centre and edge line rumble strips throughout Otago, Southland and the West Coast.

“Signage is also a simple yet effective way to get the road safety message across. The new billboards feature three messages: ‘Keep left’, ‘Your speed affects others, slow down’ and ‘Allow extra time on NZ roads’.

“Earlier this month the Transport Agency announced a further $25 million investment in road safety initiatives. This funding is a clear sign of the Government’s commitment to saving lives and reducing injuries on our roads.”
