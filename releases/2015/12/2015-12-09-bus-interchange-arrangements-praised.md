Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee is pleased that good governance arrangements have been recognised as a key component to Christchurch’s Bus Interchange being successfully completed on time and on budget.

The Performance Audit into the Governance and Accountability Arrangements for the Bus Interchange Project was carried out by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), and its report was released yesterday.

The OAG audited the Bus Interchange, along with two other key Christchurch projects; the new Central Library and the Christchurch District Health Board’s Acute Services Building.

The report takes a thorough look at the Bus Interchange, which was the first Crown-led Anchor Project to be completed this year. It opened on 29 October 2015.

“The report highlights that the work programmes CERA has in place are well up to the task of implementing Anchor Projects,” Mr Brownlee says.

“All projects of the scale currently underway in Christchurch will face challenges, but having good governance arrangements in place meant that the Bus Interchange delivery team could deal with any difficulties quickly and easily.

“As well as recognising strong leadership, the report also found that there were enough opportunities for the public and other users of the Bus Interchange, such as the bus companies, to have their say on the design.

“Information was also made readily available to the public, particularly through the Future Christchurch Update and social media. 

“While CERA will not be the organisation in charge of the Anchor Project delivery programme from April next year, the report has provided insight and constructive advice for its succeeding organisations,” Mr Brownlee says.

The report is available through the Controller and Auditor-General’s website at [http://www.oag.govt.nz/2015/christchurch-projects/docs/christchurch-projects.pdf](http://www.oag.govt.nz/2015/christchurch-projects/docs/christchurch-projects.pdf)
