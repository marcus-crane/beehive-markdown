Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says Cambridge is all set for today’s start of the UCI Track Cycling World Cup at the Avantidrome.

“Around 300 top track cyclists from around the world including 20 New Zealand cyclists will be taking part in this weekend’s event,” says Dr Coleman.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for New Zealanders to head along and support our cycling team as they compete in the team pursuit, team sprint, individual sprint, keirin and omnium.

“Cycling is one of our priority high performance sports, and hosting this event gives our elite cyclists a chance to take on some of the best in the world in our own backyard. It will be great experience ten months out from Rio.

“Our elite cycling team is considered one of New Zealand’s best medal prospects for the Olympics following a number of medal winning performances in UCI World Championship events this year.

“This weekend’s event is also a great opportunity to showcase the world-class Avantidrome facilities. The Government contributed $8.5 million to help build the Avantidrome, the home base for our elite cyclists and support crew.

“Cycling is also an important sport for New Zealanders from a recreation perspective. Seeing our top athletes at events like this helps to encourage people to get active which is especially important for young people whose lives are becoming more sedentary.”

The World Cup event is the second of three events in the UCI global series.  Points accumulated help determine the international ranking of track cyclists and ultimately their qualification for the World Championships and Olympics.

New Zealand is gaining a reputation for delivering world-class sporting events on the back of this year’s Cricket World Cup and FIFA U-20 World Cup.
