The Government is making good progress in providing better social services by publically releasing data which will assist its agencies – and the social sector - understand the needs of the most vulnerable New Zealanders, Finance Minister Bill English says.

“Reducing misery, rather than servicing it, requires a deep understanding of drivers of social dysfunction. Good information will enable the Government to better help vulnerable people make positive changes to their lives and become more independent.”

Since 2013 Statistics New Zealand has collected data from government agencies including the Ministries of Social Development, Health and Education, as well as Child Youth and Family (CYF), Corrections, Police and Housing to create the world-leading Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).

Analysis of the IDI, released today, reveals the key early warning signs of the 15-24 year olds around New Zealand who are most likely fail at school, access mental health services, stay on a long term benefit or go to prison.

This follows the release of analysis of the Ministry of Social Development's Integrated Child Dataset (ICD) for 0-5 year olds in September.

Mr English says some of the risk factors most likely to cause these problems include whether they have been brought to the attention of CYF as a child, whether they were stood down from school, whether their parent/caregiver was on a benefit or whether their parent/caregiver has served a corrective sentence.

“We now know for example that the most at-risk 15 per cent of 15 year olds are 13 times as likely to have a CYF notification and 10 times more likely to have been stood down from school than other 15 year olds.”

The data identifies just over 4,000 teenage girls on a benefit as one high risk group.

By the time they reach 35, half will have been on a benefit for more than five of the last ten years, and 19 per cent will have received a corrections sentence. Only one third will have achieved NCEA level 2 by age 23.

“On average, each person in this group will cost the Government over $100,000 in corrections and benefit costs between ages 25 and 34 – and much more than that over their lifetimes.

“The Government’s programme of social investment is about intervening early to help these people lead better lives – and save the taxpayer money in the long run,” Mr English says.

“As an example, our major investment in Youth Services has contributed to the number of young mothers requiring a benefit almost halving since 2009 and, over the year to June 2014 we reduced the average time they spend in the welfare system from 19 years to 17.5 years.”

Ongoing use of this data will include further analysis to design the best services to respond to these young people.

“These insights are crucial to understanding who these young people are, and how services can be mobilised for early intervention.

“We aim to share as much information as possible across Government, NGO’s and business so we can develop a common sense of purpose on the wide range of solutions required to solve long-term, complex social problems, family by family,” Mr English says.

NB: Using the IDI, further analysis is being undertaken to complete the picture by identifying at-risk children aged 0-14. This is expected be made available in February 2016.
