Transport Minister Simon Bridges today cut the ribbon opening the Cambridge section of the $2.1 billion Waikato Expressway.

“This is the country’s newest stretch of road and it has been two years in the making. I’m excited it is open six months ahead of schedule and in time for the upcoming holiday period,” Mr Bridges says.

The $250 million Cambridge section is one of seven that make up the 102 kilometre Waikato Expressway, a Road of National Significance identified early by the Government for progression.

It stretches from the Tamahere interchange to just south of Cambridge. The project also makes it safer for people to walk and cycle around the Waikato with eight new bridges, artworks, native plants and new pathways.

Mr Bridges says today marks a major milestone on the journey to complete the entire Waikato Expressway project by 2020.

“The Expressway will be a game changer. It will create jobs, boost the economy, and greatly reduce travel times while improving safety.

“This will be the critical transport corridor for the region, connecting Auckland to the agricultural and business centres of Waikato and Bay of Plenty. In that regard, this project is also of serious inter-regional significance.

“The Expressway is a good example of the Government’s focus on building infrastructure that will drive New Zealand’s economic success and improve safety,” Mr Bridges says.
