Research released today focusing on Chinese visitors’ preferences will support further strong growth in the tourism sector, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The China Visitor Insight report presents key findings into the needs of Chinese travellers to New Zealand and will to help local businesses develop a deeper insight into the expectations of independent Chinese travellers.

“This Government has made it a priority to focus on customers and their particular needs, and I’m thrilled that this programme will give tourism operators more knowledge to provide a memorable experience,” says Mrs Bennett.

“China is the fastest growing and second largest source market for visitors to New Zealand, with expenditure increasing 61 per cent to over $1.3 billion for year ending June 2015.

“The research provides insights into a broad range of areas, from ways to encourage Chinese visitors to explore beyond our main tourist centres to common misconceptions about the seasonal temperatures in New Zealand.

“Findings highlighted that Chinese visitors often think our seasons are similar to their own, when New Zealand seasons are far more moderate and less extreme,” Mrs Bennett says.

“This insight alone offers a great opportunity for tourism operators to promote opportunities for year round visits.

“It also helps us understand how to encourage visitors – in particular the growing number of repeat visitors – to experience many regions of New Zealand, not just the most popular tourist destinations. This is fantastic for regional development.”

Tourism operators will get an opportunity to learn about the research in a series of regional workshops early in 2016. These interactive sessions will help operators apply the research insights to their businesses.

The report-commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is part of a wider programme aimed at providing practical information that tourism operators can use to realise greater value from the rapidly growing China market.
