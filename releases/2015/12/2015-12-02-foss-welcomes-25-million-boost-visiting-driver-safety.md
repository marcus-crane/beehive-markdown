Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming the NZ Transport Agency’s $25 million boost to visiting driver safety initiatives.

“For more than six months the Government and Visiting Driver Signature Project (VDSP) partners have been continuously rolling out initiatives to help visiting drivers keep themselves and others safe on New Zealand roads,” Mr Foss says.

“This significant funding boost is yet another demonstration of the Government’s commitment to improving safety for all road users.”

The funding will be split between state highway and local government initiatives, as well as a social marketing programme.

“While a programme of initiatives is still being developed, it’s likely to include further rumble strips, improved rest area signage, barriers, slow vehicle bays, shoulder widening and more ‘keep left’ arrows,” Mr Foss says.

“This is about saving lives and reducing the harm we’ve all seen caused on our roads, especially around some of our most popular tourist destinations.

“The list of both Government and private sector safety initiatives is extensive and covers every stage of a tourist’s visit — planning, booking, in-flight, on arrival and on our roads.

“Still, there is more to be done. This additional investment will help strengthen and reinvigorate our efforts to ensure visitors have a safe and enjoyable time in New Zealand.”
