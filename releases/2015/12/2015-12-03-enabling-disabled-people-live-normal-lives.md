Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, celebrated globally on 3 December every year.

“This year’s theme, ‘Inclusion matters’, reflects what I hear loud and clear from disabled New Zealanders; disabled people want to be included and want the opportunity to live an ordinary life,” Ms Wagner says.

“Part of enabling disabled people to live normal lives is recognising that the vast majority of disabled people want to work, and can work. That is why the Government has a number of initiatives in place to help connect disabled people with work opportunities.

“Project 300, a project to get an extra 300 Christchurch-based disabled people off benefits and into work, is progressing well, and employment remains a focus of the Disability Action Plan 2014-2018.

“The Enabling Good Lives demonstrations are also providing disabled people with more choice and control over the supports they receive. Instead of dealing with multiple Government agencies, participants receive a personalised budget and purchase their disability supports.

“The Christchurch demonstration was launched in 2013 and I was pleased to launch the Waikato demonstration this year.

“Today, Education Minister Hekia Parata also released the findings of the Special Education Update forums and an action plan outlining improvements that could be made to the system. Many children will need additional learning support at some time in their education, and I think the Special Education Update is a welcome enhancement of the Government’s support for disabled people.

“The Disability Data and Evidence Working Group I announced earlier this year is working to ensure the Government collects and uses good data on the disability sector so we can focus on providing better outcomes for disabled people.

“My experience of the Christchurch rebuild has also emphasised how important it is to make cities inclusive and accessible both for disabled and non-disabled people.

“Finally, I would like to thank everyone who has provided input and advice into the update of the Disability Action Plan. The quality of ideas raised shows that when we work together, we can develop the best solutions for the disability sector, and that is a wonderful thing to celebrate on this International Day,” Ms Wagner says.
