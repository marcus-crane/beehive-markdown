Promoting New Zealand as an outstanding tourist destination and stronger ties between nations is the focus of Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett’s visit to Argentina this week.

Mrs Bennett travels with Air New Zealand today aboard its inaugural flight to Buenos Aires. A Boeing 777-200 will operate three return services a week out of Auckland.

“I’m thrilled that our national carrier is opening yet another new route, making New Zealand so much more accessible to Argentinians and other Latin Americans eager to experience what’s on offer here,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Argentina and other Latin American nations like Brazil and Chile are important emerging markets for New Zealand, and I am pleased to be able to support the great work Tourism New Zealand is doing to promote our country as a premiere destination.”

While in Buenos Aires, Mrs Bennett will also attend portfolio-related meetings including with provincial tourism ministers and the NZ-Latin American Business Council.
