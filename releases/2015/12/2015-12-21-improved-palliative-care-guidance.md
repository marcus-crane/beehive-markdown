Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes new guidance on providing the best possible care for people during the last days of their lives.

“It’s important that New Zealanders have access to quality, personalised and compassionate palliative care,” says Dr Coleman.

“Around 17,000 adults and their families accessed palliative care services this year, and this figure is expected to increase as our population grows.

“The new guidance for the health sector, *Te Ara Whakapiri: Principles and Guidance for the Last Days of Life*, places a much greater focus on

developing individual care plans. It also highlights the importance of clear and respectful communication, and providing patient-centred services.

“This guidance has been designed to help ensure consistent and quality care is provided for New Zealanders, whether they are in a hospice, aged residential care, hospital or their own home.”

Palliative care is a priority for the Government, with $76.1 million invested into hospice community palliative care services in Budget 2015.

*Te Ara Whakapiri* replaces the Liverpool Care Pathway of the Dying Patient, and has been developed in conjunction with the health sector following both sector and public consultation.

The guidance has been endorsed by the key organisations relevant to palliative care, including the Australia and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine, Palliative Care Nurses New Zealand and Hospice New Zealand.
