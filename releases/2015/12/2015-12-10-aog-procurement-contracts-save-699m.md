All-of-Government procurement contracts are now estimated to be saving $699 million for participating government agencies and taxpayers, an increase on June’s forecast figure of $415 million, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

“The increase in forecast savings is due to improved supplier engagement, greater efficiencies and the implementation of more new contracts,” Mr Joyce says.

“By harnessing the collective purchasing power of government and establishing single supply agreements for selected common goods and services, government agencies are saving a significant amount on procurement.

“Government agencies have been embracing the availability of these contracts. More than 860 agencies are participating in one or more AoG contracts, including more than 500 schools.

“The All-of-Government approach to procurement is also benefitting suppliers.  The panels of suppliers that have been created as part of the contracts are diverse and made up of suppliers of all sizes, which gives everyone an opportunity to pitch for government business.”

The initial AOG contracts for Vehicles, IT Hardware, Office Supplies and Print Devices delivered savings of more than $130 million. They have recently been re-tendered following the conclusion of their original terms and are now projected to save an additional $168 million.

The recently announced All-of-Government Banking Services solution is expected to deliver savings of $120 million across the eight-year lifespan, as well as significant productivity gains for agencies.

AOG Procurement is one component of the Procurement Functional Leadership programme, which was set-up in 2012 to focus on building procurement effectiveness across the public sector.

All agencies that are part of the New Zealand public sector are eligible to participate in AoG contracts.
