Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman paid tribute last night to New Zealand’s top sports journalists and photographers at the annual Sir Terry McLean Sports Journalism Awards in Auckland.

“Sport is a key part of our identity as New Zealanders. Our sports media play an important role in bringing to life the great sporting stories,” says Dr Coleman.

The awards honour legendary sports journalist Sir Terry McLean who covered more than 100 All Black tests and wrote 27 books on rugby. He was knighted in 1996 for services to sporting journalism, and died in July 2004 aged 90.

The event is an opportunity to recognise New Zealand’s top sports journalists and photographers, and includes awards for print, radio, television, photography and digital mediums.

“Congratulations to all the winners and finalists for your outstanding coverage of sports people and events over what has been a great year for New Zealand sport,” says Dr Coleman.

Dr Coleman presented the Sport NZ Lifetime Contribution to Sport through Journalism Award to Wynne Gray.

“Wynne Gray has been covering the All Blacks for over 27 years and has covered around 250 tests during his time at the New Zealand Herald,” says Dr Coleman.

“He is one of our most knowledgeable and respected rugby journalists and this award is due recognition for his excellent service to sports journalism.”
