The achievements of some of the country’s most talented young Pacific people have been recognised at the Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards at Parliament this afternoon.

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards celebrate high-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders who have the potential to contribute significantly to the future of our nation,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“Five young Pacific leaders have been recognised for their contributions to their communities and achievements in the arts, commerce, sport, leadership, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

“I congratulate all the winners, who illustrate the wealth of Pacific talent, knowledge and expertise we have in New Zealand.

“Ensuring that our young people thrive is crucial for our economy and culture. These awards are an investment in our country’s future,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

A record number of more than 150 young Pacific people applied for the awards this year.
