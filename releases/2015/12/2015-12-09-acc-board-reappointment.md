ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the reappointment of James Miller as a member of the Accident Compensation Corporation Board. 

“I’m pleased to announce that James Miller has been reappointed for a three-year term,” says Ms Kaye.

James has extensive experience in financial markets, investment management and commercial governance. He sits on ACC’s investment subcommittee and is Chair of the Shaping Our Future subcommittee.   

“Shaping Our Future is a very important business transformation project being worked on by ACC. I expect to be able to discuss progress further with the Board next year.

“I’d like to thank the Chair of the Board, Paula Rebstock, and the rest of the Board for their hard work, which has seen the Corporation achieve several milestones this year.

“ACC’s three levied accounts are now fully funded, which provides reassurance to New Zealanders that ACC is well placed to meet their ongoing support needs.

“The scheme’s investment portfolio grew to around $32 billion this year, up from $10 billion in 2009.

“As well as these impressive financial results, the Corporation is focused on improving its service for New Zealanders.  The results are becoming evident with trust and confidence rising in the last year from 54 per cent to 60 per cent.”
