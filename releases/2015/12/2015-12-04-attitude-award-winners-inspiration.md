ACC Minister Nikki Kaye and Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner have congratulated the winners of last night’s Attitude Awards, which recognise exceptional contributions made by New Zealanders who live with disabilities.

“ACC is the principal sponsor of the Attitude Awards, which promote positive role models and celebrate people living with a disability who are achieving great things,” Ms Kaye says.

“This was the first Attitude Awards I have attended, and I was very moved by the finalists’ inspiring stories. There are so many high achievers who despite significant challenges are doing great things across New Zealand.

“The positive attitude and character of the finalists made the awards a really special evening. You could see their courage and determination shine through. It was also positive to see so many young people in the award categories.

“Another great thing about the Attitude Awards is that they recognise not only those living with disabilities, but also those who support them to achieve. An example is the Attitude ACC Employer Award, which recognises an organisation that demonstrates exemplary support and commitment to employees with disabilities.

“From ACC’s perspective it’s important that employers support people with disabilities, because work plays such a crucial part in rehabilitation from injury and leading a fulfilling life.”

Ms Wagner says that once again, the awards have showcased the many and diverse contributions made by outstanding New Zealanders, and reveal the depth of talent in the disability sector.

“These are New Zealanders who show strength of character and are role models, tutors and coaches who have pushed the limits to excel in their fields,” Ms Wagner says.

“Disabled people tell us loud and clear that they want the same opportunities as everyone else, including having a job.

“The Government is committed to getting more disabled people into real jobs that enrich both the employee and employer. Working in partnership with the disability sector, we believe that we can make a real difference.

“It was a privilege to present awards to inspirational New Zealanders last night, and I would like to congratulate all the winners.”
