Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges today announced the award of nine new oil and gas exploration permits for Block Offer 2015.

Block Offer 2015 includes three onshore permits and six offshore permits, all in the Taranaki Basin.  Collectively the permits include a committed work programme expenditure of $4.4 million, with the potential of more than $364 million if all contingent work is realised.

Mr Bridges says the result shows that the Block Offer approach is successfully attracting investment in New Zealand, even in the face of low commodity prices, which are putting pressure on exploration companies to reduce expenditure.

“Over the past three years, the Block Offer process has successfully increased petroleum exploration investment.  Block Offer 2015 consolidates these gains and confirms what the industry already knows – that the potential for Taranaki is far from reached.

“The exploration industry is now far more sensitive to budgets in the global context of a low oil price.  But the sector is enduring and resilient.  They remain attracted to the quality and varied investment New Zealand has to offer,” says Mr Bridges.

Permits were awarded to:

- OMV NZ Limited: four offshore Taranaki permits (in partnership with Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited)
- Todd Exploration: one offshore Taranaki permit
- Mont D’Or Resources Limited: one offshore Taranaki permit
- Petrochem Limited: three onshore Taranaki permits

“The award of exploration permits today is another step toward unlocking New Zealand’s oil and gas potential, both on and offshore.

“The Government remains committed to the safe, sensible and environmentally responsible development of our oil, gas and minerals resources,” Mr Bridges says.
