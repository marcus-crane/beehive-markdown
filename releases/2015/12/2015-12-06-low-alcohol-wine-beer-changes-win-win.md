Supermarkets will be able to sell low and non-alcohol beer alongside regular beer under a new Bill introduced to Parliament by Justice Minister Amy Adams.

The Sale and Supply of Alcohol (Display of Low-alcohol Beverages and Other Remedial Matters) Amendment Bill 2015 makes two minor technical changes to New Zealand’s alcohol legislation.

Under the 2013 alcohol reforms, alcohol displays and promotions can only be in a single area in supermarkets and grocery stores, to help limit how much shoppers are exposed to them.

“However current wording of the definition of alcohol means low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer and wine cannot be displayed in the single alcohol area,” says Ms Adams. 

“It doesn’t make sense that supermarkets technically cannot place these non-alcoholic products alongside alcohol when we’re trying to promote responsible drinking. It’s also irritating for supermarkets and confusing for customers.”

The Bill will:

- permit supermarkets and grocery stores to display low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer and wine in the same area of the store as regular alcohol
- clarify that a company can hold an alcohol licence

The change to make clear that companies can hold a licence will bring the law into line with the previous Sale of Liquor Act 1989, which explicitly said they could. 

The Bill is expected to have its first reading next year.
