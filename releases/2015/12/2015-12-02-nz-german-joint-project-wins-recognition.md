A pioneering Kiwi-German artificial limb project has been recognised by Europe’s largest applied research institution, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce says.

The Bionic Joint project, developed by the University of Auckland’s Bio-engineering Institute and the Fraunhofer IPA, has been awarded ICON status by Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, which will provide additional support and funding.

The announcement was made by Prime Minister John Key in Berlin today.

“The ICON Bionic Joint project has the potential to improve quality of life for millions of people with impaired use of their limbs,’’ says Mr Joyce.

“The technology developed is also likely to create real opportunities for New Zealand and German companies in the health devices industry.”

The project aims to develop a bionic elbow joint for use in human exoskeletons intended to reduce workplace injuries and aid recovery of upper arm function in stroke survivors.

“New Zealand and Germany produce some of the most innovative researchers in the world, which makes us ideal partners”, Mr Joyce says.

The project is a three-year, $3 million collaboration co-funded by the Fraunhofer Society, the IPA, the New Zealand Government’s Catalyst fund, and the University of Auckland.
