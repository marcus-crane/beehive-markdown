Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has today announced his intention to establish a new polytechnic in the Bay of Plenty that will better service the tertiary education needs of the Bay of Plenty region.

Both Waiariki Institute of Technology (Waiariki) and Bay of Plenty Polytechnic (BoPP) will be disestablished and merged into the new institution from May 2016.

“After carefully assessing the merger application, I’m confident this new combined institution will provide significant benefits for learners across the Bay of Plenty including improved access to education, improved academic quality and more of the skills that will help graduates obtain and maintain employment,” Mr Joyce says.

“It will be able to better meet the needs of industries, businesses and communities across the whole region, and will be able to drive the skill development sought in the new Bay of Plenty Tertiary Strategy and the Bay of Plenty Regional Action Plan.”

The new institution will maintain an equitable distribution of leadership, corporate and academic functions across the two existing hub campuses in Rotorua and Tauranga. Impacts on staff will be minimised.

Centres of Excellence will be established based around key courses and qualifications.  The Centres will be linked to key industries in the region including tourism and hospitality, forestry and wood processing, marine and aquaculture, and transport and logistics.

“I’m pleased the new institution will develop a strong relationship with the University of Waikato. This will see the partnership already formed between BoPP and the University in Tauranga extended to Rotorua.  This will be particularly relevant to progressing freshwater research in the Rotorua area.” 

There were 106 submissions received during the public consultation that were considered alongside the Business Case and additional information supplied by both Councils about the proposal to merge. While there were a greater number of negative submissions, few made any specific comments in relation to the Business Case. Submissions in support associated a range of benefits with the proposal including more effective educational delivery, less duplication, the provision of a region-wide approach to tertiary education, improved collaboration and engagement and the benefits of scale.

It is intended the new institution will commence operations in place of the existing polytechnics on 1 May 2016.  Until a name is confirmed for the new institution, the interim name will be Waiariki Bay of Plenty Polytechnic.

“I am currently considering ministerial appointments to the new combined council.  It’s critical that the best representatives be appointed. They must reflect industry, sub regional, cultural, community and iwi interests. They will need a range of skills to achieve the transition and establish effective relationships across the wider region. I attend to announce the appointments in February,” Mr Joyce said.

Once appointed, the new Council will establish a constitution, appoint additional members and appoint a Chief Executive.

An Establishment Committee has been set up to manage the transition, led by Ian Turner and Graeme Nahkies, the Chairs of the current BoPP and Wairaiki Councils. The committee will be responsible for planning, preparation and communications with staff, student and stakeholders. 

“Both Waiariki and BoPP have been high performers and are financially stable. I expect that the new merged institution will deliver even greater outcomes for learners, for the wider region and New Zealand as a whole.”
