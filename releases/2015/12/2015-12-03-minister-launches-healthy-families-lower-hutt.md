Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially launched Healthy Families Lower Hutt at the recently opened Walter Nash Centre.

“Healthy Families NZ is about encouraging people to live healthier lives by making good food choices, being physically active, moderating alcohol consumption and being smoke-free,” says Dr Coleman.

“The initiative challenges communities to think differently about how to address the underlying causes of poor health at a local level.”

$3 million is being invested in Healthy Families Lower Hutt over four years.

Hutt City Council is the lead provider and is supported by a local governance group which includes leaders from Te Runanganui o Taranaki Whanui, Te Awakairangi Health Network, Sport Wellington, Pacific Health Service Hutt Valley, New World Stokes Valley, Hutt Valley DHB, Te Awakairangi Maori Relationship Board and Taita College.

“While it’s being launched today Healthy Families Lower Hutt is already making great progress to address the drivers of obesity and chronic disease,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Hutt City Council has shown great leadership in the development of the Walter Nash Centre. It will provide the local community with new facilities, sport and recreation opportunities, and also encourages healthy eating with its newly opened café not offering deep-fried food options.

“I recently launched the Childhood Obesity Plan – making New Zealand one of the first OECD countries to have a target and a comprehensive plan to tackle childhood obesity.

“The roll out of Healthy Families NZ is one of the 22 initiatives in the Plan as this initiative has a significant role to play in changing environments, attitudes and behaviours.”

The initiative will also be launched in the Far North, Whanganui, Manukau, Manurewa-Papakura and Spreydon-Heathcote. It has already been launched in the East Cape, Invercargill, Rotorua and Waitakere.

The rollout is supported by $40 million over four years committed to the initiative in Budget 2014. Healthy Families NZ has the potential to impact the lives of over one million New Zealanders.
