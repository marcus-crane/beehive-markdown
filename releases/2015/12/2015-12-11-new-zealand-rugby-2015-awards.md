Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman will tonight mark the success of New Zealand rugby at the 2015 NZ Rugby Union Awards.

“I’d like to congratulate all the nominees. It’s been a fantastic year for rugby with so many great team and individual performances,” says Dr Coleman.

“The All Blacks can not only be incredibly proud of their history making achievement in winning back-to-back Rugby World Cups, but also for the values they display on and off the field.

“About 170,000 people turned out this year to play, coach, referee and administer rugby around the country, and hundreds of thousands more supported players and teams at every level.

“The profile of rugby is set to rise further in 2016 with the inclusion of the Men’s and Women’s Sevens at the Rio Olympics.”

Tonight’s awards are being held at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland and will celebrate all levels of rugby from grassroots through to the All Blacks and Black Ferns.

Dr Coleman will present the Adidas Team of the Year award.
