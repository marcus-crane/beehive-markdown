Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce leaves for the United States tomorrow on the inaugural Air New Zealand flight to Houston, Texas.

“Houston is the fourth largest city in the US and a major airline hub for the southern and eastern United States,” says Mr Joyce. “It is hugely exciting to see our national carrier flying there and reaching into the middle of the continental US for the first time.

“This new route will assist New Zealanders heading to the United States and provide a more direct link for millions of US citizens to visit New Zealand.

“It will also open up more convenient air links to Central and South America as well as through to Europe, and will help to foster New Zealand’s connections globally.

“New Zealand’s future economic success relies on us becoming ever-connected in a global world.  This new service and others to Argentina and Vietnam help to strengthen the reach of New Zealand businesses right across the Asia-Pacific region.”

While in Houston, Mr Joyce will attend portfolio-related meetings including a visit to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and an Asia Society event to promote the bilateral benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

The US is New Zealand’s third largest trading partner and is also a significant source of foreign direct investment, innovation and research, and tourism.

“Trade with Texas alone is worth $500m a year, and this new air link will support more New Zealand companies to build ties in the southern states and through Central and South America,” says Mr Joyce.

He returns to New Zealand on Saturday.
