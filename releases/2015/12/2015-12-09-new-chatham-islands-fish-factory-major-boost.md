The opening of a new $3 million fish processing plant in the Chatham Islands yesterday is a major economic boost for the community, says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“Fishing is the major industry on the islands with around $124 million worth caught in the waters here and much of it exported to Asia. The community here punches well above its weight given the population is just 600.

“The new Aotearoa Fisheries plant has 50% greater capacity to process species like blue cod, crayfish and paua. It means more processing can take place here rather than being sent elsewhere which will create more local jobs.

“This redevelopment wouldn’t have happened without the Government’s $52 million investment into a new Waitangi wharf, with construction due to begin early next year.

“The wharf is the lifeline for the Chathams and without this, private companies wouldn’t have the confidence to invest here.

“This is a big vote of confidence in the economic future of this very important community.”
