Corrections Minister Judith Collins has announced the government will provide additional funding of $17.6 million to the Department of Corrections.

“The funding will address cost pressures from the greater than expected prison population growth and enhancements to electronic monitoring,” Ms Collins says.

“Despite significant progress in reducing crime and improving public safety, the number of prisoners has been increasing at a rate consistently above forecasts.

“In October 2015 the prison muster was 800 higher than at the same projected point in the 2011 Justice Sector forecast. This is equivalent to a large sized prison.

“The number of prisoners reached a record high of 9,171 on the 30 November 2015 and currently sits at 8,968.”

The funding will provide $15 million to address the prison population growth. A further $2.6 million is being provided  for improvements to the electronic monitoring system.

Corrections has established a 24 hour GPS Immediate Response Team as well as an Electronic Monitoring Assurance Team.

The funding for the monitoring of returning offenders from Australia will be considered as part of the 2016 Budget process.
