A new hotel opening in New Plymouth will create 70 jobs and support more tourism growth in the Taranaki region, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Novotel New Plymouth Hobson Hotel opened by Mrs Bennett today is the first 4.5-star modern hotel with a global network to open in New Plymouth City. The hotel has 85 rooms, a restaurant and bar, conference centre and meeting rooms.

“It’s an honour to open this beautiful new hotel and support a city as vibrant and positive as New Plymouth,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Tourism plays an important role in the Taranaki region’s diverse, resilient economy. Last year, it contributed $233 million to the local economy, which includes $57 million in international visitor spending.

“New Plymouth and the entire Taranaki region are developing unique local attractions that make it a great place to visit, including the outstanding Len Lye Centre, the Puke Ariki museum, and WOMAD.

“This Government is committed to backing our regions to develop more unique offerings and further grow local economies.”
