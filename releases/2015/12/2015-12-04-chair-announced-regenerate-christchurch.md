The first significant step for Christchurch’s joint organisation Regenerate Christchurch has been marked today with the announcement of its chairperson, Andre Lovatt, who is the Chief Executive of the Arts Centre of Christchurch.

The appointment has been jointly agreed by Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel.

“We know from his tremendous work in Christchurch that Mr Lovatt will bring positive energy and drive to his role in Regenerate Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

Mayor Dalziel says Mr Lovatt’s experience and his commitment to the city will ensure that he will have the community’s backing in his role as chair.

“We need a strong leader with a clear focus to make this new phase of our city’s regeneration really excel, and most importantly someone who can navigate what the Crown and Council each needs,” she says.

“I am very confident that Andre brings exactly that to the table and I very much look forward to him getting started.”

Mr Lovatt says the appointment is a huge challenge but one he is excited to begin.

“I returned to Christchurch in 2012 and I have experienced the incredible change that has occurred in the city since the earthquakes.

“The aim of Regenerate Christchurch is to really take where we are now and run with it, using the backing of the Council and Crown to test new ideas and create a fantastic city for the future.”

Mr Lovatt says he will continue in his role at the Arts Centre, and is inspired by the challenge of what lies ahead.

**Notes:**

Regenerate Christchurch will oversee the long-term development and enhancement of areas including the Central City, residential red zone and wider-New Brighton.

Regenerate Christchurch will become a legal entity when the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Christchurch Bill is passed next year.

The board will report to both the Crown and Council and after five years the organisation will transfer to the city as a fully Council Controlled Organisation.
