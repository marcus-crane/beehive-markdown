Community Housing Providers will deliver over 500 new social housing places in Auckland, well in excess of the 300 target, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will contract with five registered Community Housing Providers to deliver 508 new social housing places over the next three years. $10 million in up-front funding will be provided to support costs related to bringing the supply on stream.

The Prime Minister announced the supply boost in January as a part of the Social Housing Reform Programme to increase and improve New Zealand’s social housing supply, particularly in high-demand areas like Auckland.

The Salvation Army will provide 87 places, Accessible Properties will provide 358 places, and the Chinese New Settler Trust will provide 36 places. A further two Community Housing Providers are expected to sign contracts for the remaining places in the next few weeks.

“I’m really thrilled with the response we’ve received,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We have been working closely with the community housing sector to find sustainable ways to grow the supply of social housing in Auckland and house more vulnerable New Zealanders.

“While developing housing in Auckland remains challenging, this announcement shows real progress.

“This initial request to the community sector was seeking 300 places and was primarily to gauge providers’ interest and capability, and to test a competitive process that was new to many of them.

“The response is beyond our expectations and signals an innovative sector that is ready to work with the Government to play a bigger role in social housing.”

Under changes introduced in May 2015, MSD is able to negotiate contracts for the Income Related Rent Subsidy up to 25 years, giving Community Housing Providers a Government backed, guaranteed income stream.

“A crucial part of the Social Housing Reform Programme is working closely with those on the frontline to enable them to grow and provide more support to the vulnerable New Zealanders they work with on a daily basis,” says Mrs Bennett. 

“Community providers consistently told us they needed longer term, more flexible contracting to fund new social housing developments, and we have responded to them.

“Fundamentally, this is about vulnerable New Zealanders, and ensuring they can get access to housing while they need it.”    

A request for a further 1,000 places is now open for responses and is expected to close on 25 November 2016. More information is available at: https://www.gets.govt.nz/MSD/ExternalTenderDetails.htm?id=17027338.
