Transport Minister Simon Bridges today turned the first sod on construction of the new $22 million Kawarau Falls Bridge on State highway 6 at Frankton near Queenstown.

The bridge will replace the existing, historic 90 year-old single lane bridge and will be one of the biggest roading infrastructure projects seen in the Queenstown area in a number of years.

Mr Bridges says over 7000 vehicles a day are using the existing bridge and during the summer holiday period and winter ski season there are long traffic queues at the bridge causing considerable delays and frustration for motorists.

“That’s why the Government fast tracked funding for construction of this through our Accelerated Regional Roading Package. Building will get going much sooner than would otherwise have been possible.

“It is exciting to see this important roading project get underway because it will serve Queenstown and the wider area for decades to come.

“The new bridge will support the strong growth in the area and provide a safer and faster link to Frankton, Queenstown Airport, the Queenstown CBD and developments south of the Kawarau River.

“Motorists can look forward to the traffic flowing more freely, with more predictable travel times when the new bridge opens in 2017.

“I’d like to acknowledge the efforts of the local MP, Todd Barclay, who has advocated strongly for the new bridge and for construction to start as soon as possible.

“I’m also pleased to see that once the new bridge is complete the existing one will become a cycle and walking route as part of the Queenstown cycle trails network. It will improve connections to the existing trails in Wakatipu Basin, and help make cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice for locals and tourists,” Mr Bridges says.
