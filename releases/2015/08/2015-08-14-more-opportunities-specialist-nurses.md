Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more clinical nurse specialists are providing specialist care and expert advice.

“Specialist nurses are a core part of the healthcare team. They lead the development of nursing protocols in their area of practice, and help to ensure that our nursing workforce delivers tailored quality care,” says Dr Coleman.

“There are now 1,449 clinical nurse specialists across the 20 DHBs, making up almost six per cent of the DHB registered nursing workforce. This is a six percent increase from last year. The number has nearly doubled from 744 in 2007.”

Nurse specialists are working in almost every field of practice, including mental health, care of the elderly, orthopaedics, paediatrics, gynaecology, cardiology and emergency care, as well as forensics and eating disorders.

“Nurses now have even more opportunity to specialise and they have greater access to training and support,” says Dr Coleman.

“We have developed a new training programme for nurses performing endoscopies which will help to speed up waiting times. It will be available in 2016.

“We are also continuing to grow the number of diabetes nurse prescribers to add to the 100 already trained or in training, and we plan to further increase the number of specialist nurses in palliative care.”
