Prime Minister John Key will attend Singapore’s National Day celebrations on 9 August, this year marking 50 years of Singaporean independence. 

He will also participate in events marking the 50th anniversary of New Zealand’s diplomatic relations with Singapore and the close ties between the two countries.

“New Zealand is honoured to be one of a small number of countries invited to celebrate this historic occasion in Singapore, acknowledging the close and warm friendship between our two nations,” Mr Key says.  

“As well as being Singapore’s 50th anniversary, this year also marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries,” Mr Key says.

“As two small states in the Asia-Pacific region, we share many interests and work closely together on many issues.” 

“Singapore is also an important economic partner, importing over NZ$1 billion of New Zealand goods in the past year. It is a major source of investment and serves as a regional hub for many New Zealand companies and business people.”

“We welcome the opportunity to celebrate this special occasion and to reflect on an important partnership that has been characterised by resilience, and innovation,” Mr Key says. 

Singapore was a British colony until 1963, when it merged with the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak and Sabah to form Malaysia. On 9 August 1965, Singapore left Malaysia and became fully independent. The 50th anniversary celebration will be marked by a parade through the city, and other commemorative events.

The Prime Minister will depart on the evening of August 6, returning August 10.
