Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew says more than 130,000 students this year have benefitted from the improvements made to the student loan and allowance application process.

Improvements include simplified website content, fast pre-filled forms, a digital document depository using New Zealand Post’s ‘Connect’ service, and a vastly improved call centre experience.

“Reduced call centre waiting times have given students faster access to StudyLink support and advice. The number of unanswered calls has been slashed from over 800,000 in 2013 to less than 8,000 this year,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The online application process has also improved to the extent that our physical offices are reporting a 22.5% drop in foot traffic over the past year, which shows just how much time we are saving students.

“Three years of collaboration between StudyLink and the national student union has allowed us to respond to student feedback and the resulting improvements have made the online application experience a lot better.

“I congratulate StudyLink on these improvements and commend the student union for their collaboration and feedback,” says Mrs Goodhew. “Together, we will continue improving the service StudyLink provides to make students’ lives a bit easier.”
