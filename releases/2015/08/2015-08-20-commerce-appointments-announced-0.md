Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today announced two reappointments to the Takeovers Panel and three reappointments to the Disciplinary Committee under the Financial Advisers Act.

David Jones has been reappointed as Takeovers Panel Chairperson for one further year, starting on 1 October. Richard Hunt, who is a member cross-appointed from the Australian Takeovers Panel, has been reappointed to the Takeovers Panel for a further term until April 2018.

“I am pleased David Jones and Richard Hunt have accepted further terms on the Takeovers Panel. They have a wealth of experience and their contribution to the Panel has been very valuable so far,” Mr Goldsmith says.

The Takeovers Panel provides a mechanism for peer review and enforcement of takeovers activity, with the aim of being more efficient, less formal and faster than the courts. The cross-appointment arrangement between the New Zealand and Australian Takeovers Panels aims to help harmonise regulatory frameworks and strengthen business relationships in both countries.

The Minister also reappointed Peter Houghton, Geoff Clews and David Macdonald to the Disciplinary Committee under the Financial Advisers Act for further terms of four-five years.

“The Disciplinary Committee plays an important role reviewing complaints against financial advisers and I am pleased Peter Houghton, Geoff Clews and David Macdonald are able to continue their roles on the Committee,” Mr Goldsmith says.   

The Disciplinary Committee is chaired by Hon Sir Bruce Robertson.
