Prime Minister John Key will lead a delegation to Papua New Guinea to attend the annual Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting being held in Port Moresby.

“The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting is an opportunity for the region to come together and discuss the issues we jointly face,” says Mr Key.

“As a Pacific nation, New Zealand is committed to working with our closest neighbours to build a more secure and prosperous region.

“This year’s theme is ‘Strengthening Connections To Enhance Pacific Regionalism’.

Leaders will discuss a range of issues, including climate change and fisheries, as well as wider development and political issues.

“My attendance at the forum will also provide an opportunity to meet with a number of Pacific regional leaders.”

The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister, Murray McCully, and a small business delegation.

Mr Key will depart on Tuesday 8 September, returning on Friday 11 September.
