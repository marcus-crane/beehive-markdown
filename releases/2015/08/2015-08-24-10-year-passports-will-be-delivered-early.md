Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today welcomed the Government Administration Select Committee report on 10 year adult passports and the proposed implementation date of 30 November 2015.

“I’m delighted that the Committee has considered public submissions on the Passports Amendment Bill (No 2) so promptly and endorsed the recommended implementation date.

“I am also pleased that the hard work by the Department of Internal Affairs in preparing to introduce the 10-year validity period will mean Kiwi travellers will be able to enjoy a 10 year adult passport sooner.  Subject to legislation passing in Parliament, adults planning for their Christmas holidays will be able to apply for a 10 year passport at the end of November, one month earlier than originally planned.

“Ten year validity gives greater convenience to most adult passport holders, as they will need to renew their passport less frequently. This will also result in a reduction in the annual average price of an adult passport for New Zealanders. The 10-year adult passport price will cost $180 (including GST), an average saving of $90 over the 10-year validity period (the average price of two five year adult passports over ten years including one renewal is approximately $270).

“Because a child’s appearance can change significantly over time, the child passport will remain valid for five years as is international convention,” says Mr Dunne.

“In the current climate of international uncertainty, it is essential the Government continues to invest in technology and security, as New Zealanders expect their travel document to retain its exceptional levels of trust and integrity.

“We must safeguard the highly trusted international reputation of our passport which allows New Zealanders the freedom to visit approximately 170 countries without applying for a visa. Likewise, investing in services that make it more convenient for the travelling public to access their passports is also essential, and unlike our main counterpart countries, we already provide a service for renewing adult passports entirely online.

“We want 70 per cent of the most common transactions with government to be able to be done online by 2017. Online passport renewals are one of those transactions, with over 40 per cent of adult renewals already submitting their application online. We are looking to extend the online service to child renewals and first-time adult applicants in the future.”
