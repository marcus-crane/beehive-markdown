Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says hospitals in the lower South Island are now sharing an electronic system to administer patients’ medications.

“Medications used to be recorded on a clipboard at the end of a patient’s bed, but using an electronic system to share information is much safer than relying on handwritten notes on paper charts,” says Dr Coleman.

The electronic system MedChart has recently been introduced at Timaru Hospital, with South Canterbury DHB joining the system already used by Southern DHB.

“Nurses at Timaru Hospital are now using a laptop on a mobile trolley when they are dispensing medication. MedChart, includes checks for errors and duplications, and gives an automatic warning if a higher-than-usual dose is prescribed,” says Dr Coleman.

“Having the benefit of Southern DHB’s experience enabled Timaru Hospital to introduce the new system to 120 patients in six wards in just 12 days.

“It is good to see DHBs working collaboratively and making savings in back office functions so more resources can be directed into patient care.”

South Canterbury is the fifth DHB to introduce MedChart, joining Southern, Canterbury, Taranaki and Waitemata DHBs. Auckland DHB is planning to roll out the system later this year.

This new tool is part of the Government’s commitment to better utilise modern IT to protect and grow our public health services, supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector.
