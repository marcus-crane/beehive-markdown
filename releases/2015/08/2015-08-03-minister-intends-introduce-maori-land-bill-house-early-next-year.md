The Māori Development Minister, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, intends to allow for more time to develop the Ture Whenua Māori Bill within an expanded work programme, which is aimed at fully realising the utilisation of Māori land.

Mr Flavell is determined to ensure the legislation and any associated proposals are right, and aims to have the Bill before the House early next year.

“My aim is to ensure the reforms make it easier for Māori landowners to use their land, while at the same time ensuring the retention of the whenua, he says.

“My Advisory Group, Te Puni Kōkiri and other Crown agencies involved have identified that we need to develop further proposals for the Māori Land Service and the Ture Whenua Network to come in line with the Bill.  I agree this is what we need to do”, says Mr Flavell.

The Māori Land Service is intended to provide support and advice to landowners and governance bodies, while the Network will consider issues such as landlocked land and valuation.

“We are aiming to get a much better outcome in the long term for Māori landowners”, he says. 

“Utilisation of Māori land depends on the decisions and actions of landowners and their governance bodies, as well as access to advice, resources and a supportive regulatory system.  My aim in the end is to deliver on this”, says Mr Flavell.
