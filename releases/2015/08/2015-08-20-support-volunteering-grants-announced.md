Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced this year’s grant recipients from the Support for Volunteering Fund.

“Each year, the Fund provides up to $502,000 in grants that support, promote and strengthen volunteering in the community,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“New Zealanders are incredibly generous with their time and energy.  Voluntary work is crucial to many organisations that wouldn’t otherwise be able to provide programmes and services to people and causes that need a helping hand.”

This year the Support for Volunteering Fund will provide:  

- $100,000 to Volunteering New Zealand, which plays a leading role in the volunteer sector and builds volunteer capacity and capability through its member organisations.
- $322,000 to 17 regional volunteer centres and the Aotearoa Volunteer Centres Network, to recruit and train volunteers, promote good practice in volunteer management, and provide training and networking for community organisations.
- $80,000 to 12 organisations focusing on Māori, Pacific and ethnic communities, who will promote and support volunteering and build volunteering capacity and capabilities within their communities.

“Strong communities lead to a strong New Zealand,” says Mrs Goodhew. “I am delighted that this funding continues to help our communities create networks and enduring relationships that benefits for the whole of New Zealand.”

Examples of projects funded by the Support for Volunteering Fund:

1. A grant from the Fund to the Changemakers Refugee Forum in Auckland will assist Changemakers to launch the "Ahwa Info Hub", delivering regular workshops to assist voluntary leaders of refugee communities to build their capacity and offer professional development. The project has two specific aims: to encourage and increase social participation amongst isolated community members, and for isolated community members to become more aware of the services that are available to them.
2. The Te Ora Hou Wellington East Trust will use the Fund’s grant to help build skills and confidence through leadership roles amongst Māori and Pasifika young people, aged between 16-23. Trained youth workers will mentor young Māori and Pasifika who demonstrate potential leadership qualities and contribute to the community through volunteering and other activities.
