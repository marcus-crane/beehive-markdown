Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands next week leading a delegation of New Zealand officials and business people.

“Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands are important regional partners and fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum,” Mr McCully says

“In Port Moresby I will meet with Prime Minister Peter O’Neill, Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato, and a range of other Ministers to discuss bilateral cooperation and regional issues, including PNG’s hosting of this year’s Pacific Islands Forum and New Zealand’s support for their hosting of APEC in 2018.

“The New Zealand companies and government representatives who are travelling as part of the delegation are involved in a range of commercial relationships in PNG and the Solomon Islands and the delivery of New Zealand’s aid programme. They represent a range of sectors including energy, infrastructure development, and broadcasting, as well as Pacific and regional business organisations.

“The visit to Honiara will be my first opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and his Government. Our talks will focus on their plans for economic development, particularly in the fisheries and tourism sectors,” says Mr McCully.

The delegation will travel to Port Moresby and Honiara by RNZAF 757.
