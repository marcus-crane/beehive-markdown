ACC Minister Nikki Kaye says she’s pleased with the positive uptake of the enhanced support for hearing loss that ACC introduced just over twelve months ago.

“Over the past year, New Zealanders have received more than $20 million worth of extra support for injury-related hearing loss from ACC,” says Ms Kaye.

From 1 July 2014, ACC increased its contributions towards hearings aids and audiologists’ fees to enable more people to get suitable hearing aids.

“Since the changes, the number of people receiving new or replacement hearing aids has almost doubled, from around 6,200 in 2013/14 to around 11,700 in 2014/15.

“More people are also satisfied with their support and ACC’s service.

“A recent survey shows 86 per cent of people are satisfied with their hearing aids, up from 77 per cent in 2013, and 73 per cent are very satisfied with the level of support they received from ACC, up from 63 per cent in 2013.

“Another pleasing result is increased satisfaction with the service people are getting from audiologists.

“Last year, ACC began funding an extra consultation allowance, so that clients can shop around for hearing aids from different audiologists.

“This was to help ensure that clients can find hearing aids that are suitable and affordable. Since this change, satisfaction with the service provided by audiologists has increased to 90 per cent, up from 84 per cent in 2013.

“The enhanced support that ACC now provides was developed after the Government asked ACC to explore options to improve access to hearing loss services.

“ACC worked with many groups in the hearing loss sector, including audiologists, on the changes.

“This is a great example of ACC working collaboratively to improve its services, and the increased satisfaction amongst clients testifies to this.”
