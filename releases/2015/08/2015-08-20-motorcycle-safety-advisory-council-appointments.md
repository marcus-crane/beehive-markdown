ACC Minister Nikki Kaye has announced the reappointment of Chair Mark Gilbert and three new appointments which will ensure diverse representation on the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council.

The Council represents the motorcycling community and advises ACC on initiatives that will make motorcycling safer on New Zealand roads.

“The new appointments, who are all active motorcyclists, are Johan Bosch, David White and Alan Petrie,” says Ms Kaye.

“Johan has good networks through his association with various motorcycling clubs and brings professional experience of the health and safety sector.

“Alan has a strong background in private sector leadership and rider safety, education and engagement, while David brings extensive government sector experience to the Council.

“Current Council member Yvonne Forrest, who is Vice President of the Women’s International Motorcycle Association, has also been reappointed for another term.

“It’s important to me that the Council acts as a voice for all motorcyclists.

“We all want to see fewer motorcycle-related injuries, and the Council has a key role to play in generating ideas to help achieve this goal.”

**Notes:**

***About the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC)***

The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC) was set up in 2011 to oversee investment of the motorcycle safety levy (MSL) fund.

The MSL is a $30 levy collected when motorcyclists register their bikes.

Money collected through the levy is earmarked exclusively for improving motorcyclists’ safety on New Zealand roads.

It’s MSAC’s job to advise and recommend to ACC how to invest this money, and ensure it’s spent on initiatives that will actually make motorcycling safer.

MSAC members are appointed because they’re passionate about motorcycling and road safety and want to make a difference.

***$4 million investment in motorcycle safety initiatives***

$4 million will be invested in motorcycle safety initiatives in 2015/16 advised by the MSAC.

Recent and upcoming work includes:

- supporting the re-engineering of identified high-risk routes in urban and rural areas
- inviting ideas from motorcyclists on ways to improve motorcycle safety in their community
- presenting the findings of a motorcycle commuter survey in Wellington
- launching a nationwide motorcycle safety campaign.
