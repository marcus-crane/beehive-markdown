The Hawke’s Bay Regional Planning Committee Bill passed its third reading in the House today, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced.

“When enacted, this bill will give effect to the Crown’s commitment, made in the Ngāti Pāhauwera Deed of Settlement and recorded in the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Deed of Settlement, to work with iwi and hapū to establish a joint Māori-Council body in the Hawke’s Bay,” Mr Finlayson said.

“This legislation will ensure that relevant iwi entities and the Regional Council can appoint representatives to the Hawke’s Bay Regional Planning Committee. This is consistent with the government’s overarching position on natural resource management in the settlement of historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.”

Mr Finlayson acknowledged the work of the iwi leaders involved in the development of the legislation and the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council’s efforts and willingness to engage with iwi and hapū representatives.

“The bill has received unanimous support from iwi and from the Regional Council. It will form the basis of a new, constructive, on-going relationship between the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and the iwi of the Hawke’s Bay region,” Mr Finlayson said.
