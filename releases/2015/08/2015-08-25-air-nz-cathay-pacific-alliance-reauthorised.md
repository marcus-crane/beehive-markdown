The extension of a strategic alliance between Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific will result in more benefits to travellers than would otherwise have been the case, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Mr Bridges has reauthorised the alliance for almost four years beyond its initial expiry date of 30 January 2016.

“This alliance has ensured the airlines work together on tourism and marketing initiatives so travellers can continue to benefit from more seats, improved flight schedules, shorter connection times, and reciprocal frequent flyer schemes,” he says.

Since the alliance was approved in 2012, visitor arrivals from Hong Kong to New Zealand have increased by more than 16 percent. Cathay Pacific recently announced it will operate an extra 13,500 seats on the Auckland-Hong Kong route in the 2015/16 peak summer period.

“While the alliance has given travellers to and from Asia more choice and flexibility than would otherwise have been the case, there is room for further improvement. My expectation is that Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific will continue working to show the alliance is in the best interests of consumers.

“The aviation industry is firing on all cylinders, with low fuel prices and strong demand for international travel. The Government is monitoring the Hong Kong route to ensure airlines are responding to these favourable conditions when setting their fares and schedules,” Mr Bridges says.
