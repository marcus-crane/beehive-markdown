Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, welcomes a new initiative to encourage more Māori into the Information Technology sector today.

The scholarship funds students through a 19-week course teaching them what it takes to succeed in the IT industry, and connecting them with prospective employers.

It is a joint initiative between Te Puni Kōkiri, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and Callaghan Innovation in partnership with the Wellington training organisation, Enspiral Dev Academy.

Minister Flavell told those at today’s launch in Wellington that the goal is to have 100 Māori students graduate through the programme and in high value jobs in three years.

“Those graduates will enter an exciting industry and join a growing pool of Māori digital technology leaders. The sector is thriving, but more than half of New Zealand’s IT companies find it difficult to recruit qualified workers. This scholarship will help address that shortage, while making the industry more culturally diverse.”

The Minister also acknowledged Ngāi Tahu, which is the first iwi to invest in the programme, its committed $25,000 towards placing tribal members in the programme.
