Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has expressed condolences to the victims and families affected by the explosion at Erawan Shrine in Central Bangkok last night (midnight Monday NZT). 

“There are reports that at least 19 people have been killed and many more injured in what appears to be a deliberate attack on an area frequented by tourists," Mr McCully says.

“Our thoughts are with the people of Thailand as they come to terms with the senseless loss of innocent life, the victims, and the families of those injured or killed in the blast.

“There is currently no confirmed information on the nationalities of the victims and casualties. The New Zealand Embassy in Bangkok remains in close contact with the relevant Thai authorities and local hospitals for reports of any New Zealanders who may have been affected by the incident,” Mr McCully says.
