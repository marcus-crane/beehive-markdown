The Government has today signed a Terms of Reference with Auckland Council, setting out how central and local government will work together to agree on an approach to develop the city’s transport system.

“Over 700,000 additional people are expected to live in Auckland by 2045,” Mr English says.

“Long-term solutions for Auckland’s transport system are central to ensuring it remains a great place to live and do business, and it is also important for the economy as a whole.”

“This population growth means Auckland will need another 400,000 houses over this timeframe – and transport infrastructure is key to delivering this.”

Mr Bridges says that together the Government and Council plan to invest $4.2 billion in Auckland’s transport system over the next three years.

“While that work will continue as agreed on the roads, public transport, walkways and cycleways, we are now turning our focus to the next three decades and beyond.

“The Government and Council broadly agree on the priorities for the transport system, and we are particularly focussed on addressing congestion and increasing public transport use,” he says.

The Terms of Reference sets out a structure under which officials from the Ministry of Transport, Auckland Council, Auckland Transport, the NZ Transport Agency, Treasury and the State Services Commission will work together to test alternative options for how the transport system could develop.

“I look forward to officials recommending a preferred approach to the Government and the Mayor of Auckland in about a year’s time,” Mr Bridges says.

“The Government and Council will then consider the preferred approach and how it may be delivered, including whether changes might be needed to legislation and funding arrangements.”
