Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says he’s very pleased to announce the second and final stage of Christchurch’s new $53 million Bus Interchange is now complete and open to the public.

“This second stage opening marks the physical completion of the first of the Government-led anchor projects in the central city,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It includes an extended airport-style passenger lounge area, and a further eight bus bays bringing the total to 16 bays, as well as a secure bicycle lock-up area for cyclists.

“Bus services will be rolled out by Environment Canterbury to the bays in the second stage following testing.

“The Bus Interchange can now be accessed from Tuam Street, Colombo Street and the main entrance on the corner of Colombo and Lichfield Streets.

“It’s a real credit to all those involved, including the contractors working on site, that the building has been completed on schedule and to such a high standard.

“Having a high quality facility is crucial to encouraging the use of public transport in the city, and a new central city transport network that includes dedicated bus lanes is also important in that.”

Retail areas in the facility are complete and tenants will begin moving in over the coming weeks.
