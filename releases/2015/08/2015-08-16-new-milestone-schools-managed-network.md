Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye is pleased to announce that in the next few days, 2000 schools will be connected to the government-funded N4L Managed Network, giving them fast, reliable internet.

“A bundle of schools will be connected this week. One of these will be the 2000th school connected, and I’ll be calling the principal to mark the milestone,” says Ms Kaye.

“This will mean more than 80 per cent of schools are using the Managed Network, which as well as fast, reliable internet also provides uncapped data, web filtering and network security services, at no cost.

“Schools connected within the past week include the country’s largest school, Auckland’s Rangitoto College, with 3000 students, and several small rural schools.

“All up, around 600,000 students and 36,000 teachers now have fast, reliable internet for learning.

“The Government is investing $211 million in this project, so that all state, state-integrated and partnership schools can have uncapped internet access funded by the Crown.

“This is about ensuring every young person has access to high-quality internet for learning, no matter where they go to school in New Zealand.

“Fast connections and uncapped data are like heat and water. Every student should have as much as they need to achieve their best and make the most of their school day.”

The project to connect schools, which is led by Network for Learning (N4L), continues to run ahead of schedule.

“The Managed Network is helping bring the internet to children who might not otherwise be able to access it, and it’s expanding learning opportunities for everyone in the classroom.

“It’s also reducing IT complexity in schools, so that teachers can focus on teaching and learning. Having access to reliable, ultra-fast broadband is critical to enabling schools to explore more innovative approaches to teaching and learning, using the internet and digital technologies.”

By the end of this year, it’s anticipated that up to 90% of New Zealand’s 2,500-plus schools will be able to connect to the Managed Network, with all participating schools able to connect by the end of 2016.

**Notes:**

**About N4L**

Network for Learning (N4L) is a Crown company. It was created to build a managed network specifically designed for New Zealand schools, and to create an environment that encourages the uptake of digital learning.

**What is the N4L Managed Network?**

The N4L Managed Network provides participating schools with fast, reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering, network security services and helpdesk support.

Because it’s centrally managed, schools don’t need to support their own internet connection and related services, reducing ICT complexity and costs.
