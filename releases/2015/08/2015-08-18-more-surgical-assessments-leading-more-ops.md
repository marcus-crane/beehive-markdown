Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more New Zealanders are getting their First Surgical Assessment, and faster, compared to seven years ago.

“As New Zealanders live longer lives, access to elective surgery is becoming more important than ever,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why speeding up patient’s access to First Surgical Assessments has been a priority for this Government.

“In the last financial year 322,196 patients across the country received a First Surgical Assessment, compared to 261,226 in 2008/2009. That’s an increase of 24 percent.”

In 2006 there were just over 15,150 patients nationwide waiting over six months for their First Specialist Assessment. Today there are just 21.

As a result of speeding up access to First Surgical Assessments more patients are going on to get the operations they need.

The number of patients receiving elective surgery across the country has increased from 117,954 in 2007/08 to 167,188 in 2014/15. That’s around 50,000 more surgeries over the last seven years - a 42 percent increase.

“Improving access to electives is a multi-dimensional goal. It includes reducing waiting times, increasing the number of First Specialist Assessments and elective discharges,” says Dr Coleman.

“While there is still more to be done, we are heading in the right direction. These improvements are a credit to our dedicated health workforce, and are supported by the $400 million extra invested into health in Budget 2015.”
