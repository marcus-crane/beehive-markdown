Transport Minister Simon Bridges says plans for the northern-most link of Auckland’s Western Ring Route reflect the Government’s commitment to improving public transport in our biggest city.

The NZ Transport Agency has today announced the latest design plans for the Northern Corridor Improvements project which, once completed, will provide a direct, continuous motorway connection between Albany in the North and Manukau in the South, and an alternative motorway route through Auckland.

Mr Bridges says he’s particularly pleased NZTA is working to bring forward funding for the construction of the Northern Busway extension.

“This extension will run between Constellation Bus Station and Albany Bus Station, and align it with the other accelerated timelines planned for the wider Northern Corridor Improvements project. 

“The Northern Busway is one of the most successful public transport initiatives we have seen. The Transport Agency has identified an opportunity to gain significant cost savings and reduce construction disruption to the community if the Busway is built at the same time as the rest of the project.

“Prioritising the Busway extension also responds to the strong public support that came through to the Transport Agency in their last public consultation in 2014,” he says.

The Northern Corridor project is working closely with local bodies like Auckland Transport to produce a fully integrated transport plan that will support communities in and around the wider Albany Metropolitan centre - which has been singled out by city leaders for its significance in the city’s growth.

Mr Bridges is encouraging Aucklanders to find out more about the Northern Corridor Improvements project and provide feedback by attending one of a series of open days being held by the NZ Transport Agency and Auckland Transport.
