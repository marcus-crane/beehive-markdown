More than 6,000 people in small communities around New Zealand are set to benefit from improved drinking-water supplies thanks to the latest round of Government subsidies. This was the final funding round for the drinking-water subsidy scheme, a ten-year programme aiming to help small, disadvantaged communities establish or improve their drinking-water supplies.

“While drinking-water supplies in larger centres already provide safe drinking-water, the subsidy scheme has assisted smaller supplies in the most deprived areas to optimise the quality of their water. In this final round of applications, funding of more than $10 million for a total of 19 projects was approved”, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says.

“Unfortunately a number of applicants have not been successful. However I can reassure them that their local DHB public health unit can still assist in optimising the quality of their current water supply.

“DHB public health units have staff with expertise in drinking-water and access to engineers and scientists who can help councils and communities decide the best options to get a safe and adequate supply of water, which is also affordable.”

Once all projects approved or currently underway are completed, the Government will have provided over $96.5 million to help small disadvantaged communities improve their drinking-water. Over 130,000 people will receive safer and more secure water supplies.
