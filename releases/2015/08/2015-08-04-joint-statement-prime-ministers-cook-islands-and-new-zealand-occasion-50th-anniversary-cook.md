On 4 August 1965 the Cook Islands became self-governing in free association with New Zealand.  Today marks the 50th anniversary of that important occasion which is another major milestone in our unique and long-standing relationship, spanning over 100 years.  The visit to the Cook Islands by New Zealand Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key and his accompanying high-level delegation to celebrate this anniversary reflects the special nature of the relationship. 

The principles underpinning our relationship were last outlined by the Prime Ministers of both countries in the Joint Centenary Declaration (JCD) in 2001, and continue to frame the nature of the relationship today.  That relationship is a living and dynamic one which goes beyond simple international engagement.  The JCD recognises the Cook Islands’ responsibility for making its own laws and for the conduct of its foreign affairs.  The JCD also sets out a commitment by both countries to work cooperatively and consultatively together.

Over the last 50 years, the Cook Islands’ international personality has evolved significantly as it has gained membership of an increasing number of regional and international organisations.  This journey has been actively supported by New Zealand.  Most recently, the Cook Islands successfully applied to join the International Labour Organisation. New Zealand advocated strongly for the Cook Islands’ membership and it will continue to support the Cook Islands’ efforts to have its voice heard internationally. 

Together our governments have successfully partnered on a number of ground-breaking development activities.  The Te Mato Vai water partnership project is the first tripartite arrangement of its kind, led by the Cook Islands in partnership with New Zealand and China.  The Northern Group Renewable Energy Project has provided almost 100 percent renewable electricity to the entire Northern Group, increasing access to electricity and reducing diesel costs and carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.

This year’s anniversary of Cook Islands’ self-government in free association with New Zealand has provided an opportunity to celebrate 50 years of the close and enduring partnership between our two countries. The Cook Islands – New Zealand relationship is based on traditional, cultural and social ties that have existed between our two countries and their people for many hundreds of years going back to Polynesian settlement of New Zealand/Aotearoa.  We are linked by shared values, history, citizenship, and partnership which complement the Government-to-Government relationship that we highlight today.  

The Prime Ministers of both countries agreed that the principles and values set out above have provided a sound basis for the New Zealand – Cook Islands relationship, and will continue to do so in the years to come.
