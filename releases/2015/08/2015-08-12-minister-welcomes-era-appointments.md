Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse has today welcomed the appointment of a new Chief, three new members and the reappointment of eight current members of the Employment Relations Authority (ERA).

Long serving member Jim Crichton has been appointed to the position of Chief of the ERA.

“Mr Crichton was first appointed to the ERA in 2004 and will bring a wealth of experience to the position of Chief. He is a well-respected member of the employment law community and has been acting as the Chief Delegate of the ERA since March this year.” Mr Woodhouse says

“He replaces the late Rosemary Monaghan who made an enormous contribution to the ERA having served continuously for over twenty years, the last two as Chief.”

Andrew Dallas, Nicola Craig and Peter van Keulen have been appointed as members of the ERA for the first time, and will serve three year terms.

“Nicola Craig and Peter van Keulen are employment lawyers and will join the Auckland and Christchurch offices respectively. Andrew Dallas has extensive experience in the public service and will also be based in the Auckland office.”  

The eight current members who have been reappointed to the ERA on terms of between 20 months and four years are David Appleton, Vicki Campbell, Anna Fitzgibbon, Christine Hickey, Michael Loftus, Trish MacKinnon, Michele Ryan and Tania Tetitaha.

“The ERA performs a very important role in New Zealand’s employment relations system. It investigates and works to resolve employment relationship problems.

“The members appointed today have considerable experience in this area and I have every confidence the ERA will continue to provide a high quality service under its new members.”
