Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says the rapid uptake of an online service helping customs brokers meet border requirements for imports and exports has far exceeded expectations.

Self-service registration for the Joint Border Management System’s Trade Single Window was launched in July. It allows brokers to register and manage import and export information online.

“More than 600 registrations are being processed each week, and to date 145 brokers have registered their details to manage their own information in under a minute instead of facing a 24 hour manual processing delay,” Ms Wagner says.

“The take up has been so popular that more than 50 per cent of all client and supplier codes are now registered online each week.

“It’s another clear example that Trade Single Window, which was launched in 2013 to allow traders to meet all border requirements in one place, is saving businesses valuable time and effort.

“Customs will continue working with brokers to help them take up the new service, and will keep the manual registration system in place for the small proportion of private individuals that need to get codes,” Ms Wagner says.

More than 2.2 million trade transactions have been processed using Trade Single Window, and in July, it managed 60.2% of all inward and 100% of outward transactions.
