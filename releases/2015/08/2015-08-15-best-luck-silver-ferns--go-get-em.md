Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is wishing the Silver Ferns the best of luck as they head into the final weekend of the Netball World Cup.

“The Silver Ferns have shown passion and determination as they have worked towards today, winning all their pool matches,” says Dr Coleman.

“This team is a force to be reckoned with and I wish them all the best for today.”

The Silver Ferns will meet England in the semi-finals in Sydney, Australia this afternoon. The winners will go to the final being played tomorrow afternoon.

“Success on the world sporting stage is important to New Zealanders. Sport is part of our national identity, and when we see Kiwis winning we are inspired to get active,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is particularly important at the moment that we encourage our young people to be active and to get involved in sport, with our lives becoming more sedentary and rising rates of obesity. The Silver Ferns are great role models for a healthy, active lifestyle.”

Fans wanting to show their support can message the team via the Silver Ferns page at [www.MyNetball.co.nz](http://www.MyNetball.co.nz) or through the New Zealand Netball Facebook page [www.facebook.com/netballnewzealand](http://www.facebook.com/netballnewzealand).
