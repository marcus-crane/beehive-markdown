Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the South Dunedin Social Sector Trial is showing positive results helping young people off benefits and into employment and training.

“The latest figures from Dunedin show the Work and Income Youth Link team has helped 210 young people, aged 18-24, off a benefit between March 2015 and the end of July, with 170 going into employment and 40 into study,” Mrs Tolley says.

Social Sector Trials are taking place in 16 communities around New Zealand and involve a number of agencies working together to get better results for those receiving social services.

The South Dunedin Social Sector Trial is focused on reducing truancy, youth offending, and alcohol and drug abuse as well as increasing participation in education, training and employment.

“This is another example of how we can get better results for people when we work together and take a collaborative approach,” Mrs Tolley says.

“South Dunedin identified youth unemployment as an issue they hadn’t made enough headway on. They’ve put in a lot of hard work and the results are already paying off.

“Youth Link encourages young people to drop in and get the support they need in a relaxed environment.  They can also attend jobseeker seminars which are held 12 times a week.

“They’re also working with secondary schools and tertiary providers to make sure those who leave school and need additional support get the help they need to find the path that suits them.

“Nationally youth unemployment has fallen markedly since its peak in 2010, with a 26.7 per cent fall in 18-24 year-olds receiving Jobseeker Support since June 2010.

“We know that young people who go on benefit are at risk of remaining on a benefit long term so it’s vital we help them find their next step, whether it’s further education, training or employment, so they can lead successful lives,” Mrs Tolley says.
