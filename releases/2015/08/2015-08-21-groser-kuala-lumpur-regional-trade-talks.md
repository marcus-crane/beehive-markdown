Trade Minister Tim Groser travels to Malaysia tonight for a series of meetings including the third Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Ministerial Meeting, the annual East Asia Summit Economic Ministers’ Meeting, and ASEAN Economic Ministers’ consultations with New Zealand and Australia.

“The Kuala Lumpur meetings are an important point of engagement for New Zealand with ASEAN and the wider Asian region,” says Mr Groser.

“The RCEP meeting will review the overall state of the negotiation and its forward path. We also look forward to confirmation of an agreement on the structure for initial market access offers on goods.”

“East Asia has more than 3 billion people and there is increasing regional economic integration. RCEP countries include 7 of our top 10 trading partners who took nearly $30 billion of our exports in 2014. Helping New Zealand businesses gain greater access to that massive customer base will provide significant benefits to our economy.”

“I’ll also be taking part in celebrations to commemorate the 40th anniversary of dialogue relations between New Zealand and ASEAN. This includes events to showcase the New Zealand-ASEAN relationship, such as a NZ-ASEAN awards event, NZ-ASEAN Business Council meetings and an alumni forum for the ASEAN-New Zealand Young Business Leaders’ Initiative.”
