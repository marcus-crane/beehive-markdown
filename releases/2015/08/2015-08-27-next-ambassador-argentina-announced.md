Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Raylene Liufalani as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Argentina.

“Argentina is an important partner for New Zealand in Latin America, and the resumption of direct flights to Buenos Aires later this year will serve to further strengthen ties between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand companies are increasingly looking to Latin America for opportunities and there are already major New Zealand investments in the dairy, fisheries, wine and tourism sectors in Argentina.

“New Zealand and Argentina also share a love of sport and we welcome Argentina’s inclusion in the annual Rugby Championship and Super Rugby from next year.

“As major agricultural producers, New Zealand and Argentina are founding members of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases and we cooperate closely in this area,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Liufalani has previously served in the New Zealand Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva and the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office, Taipei. She will also be accredited Paraguay and Uruguay.
