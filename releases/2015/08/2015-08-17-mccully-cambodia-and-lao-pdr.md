Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Cambodia and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic this week for a range of meetings to mark the 40th anniversary of New Zealand’s formal partnership with ASEAN.

“New Zealand is developing an increasingly diverse relationship with the Mekong region, including Cambodia and Lao PDR,” Mr McCully says

“In Cambodia I will meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hor Namhong to discuss bilateral issues and New Zealand’s relationship with the wider ASEAN grouping.

“While in Phnom Penh I will also sign an Air Services Agreement, which will help Air New Zealand to make the most of the Cambodian dimension of its strategic alliance with Singapore Airlines, launched in January.

“My visit to Lao PDR will include meetings with Prime Minister Thongsing Thammavong and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr Thongloun Sisoulith. Lao PDR assumes the chair of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit for 2016, and has just concluded three years as ASEAN’s coordinator for New Zealand.

“New Zealand’s trade links with both countries are modest but growing and there are real opportunities for New Zealand business with increasing regional economic integration,” Mr McCully says.
