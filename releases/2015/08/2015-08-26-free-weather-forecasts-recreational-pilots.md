Recreational pilots now have access to specialised weather forecasts free-of-charge, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

Budget 2015 included funding for MetService to provide the weather forecasts through MetFlight GA — an aviation weather website for recreational pilots.

“Free access to MetFlight GA ensures recreational pilots have the high-quality, specialised aviation forecasts they need to plan their flight and stay safe in the air,” Mr Foss says.

The use of MetFlight GA services are expected to increase over summer, when recreational pilots do most of their flying.
