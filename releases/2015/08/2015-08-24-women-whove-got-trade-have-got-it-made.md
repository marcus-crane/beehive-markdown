Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Louise Upston is highlighting the importance of encouraging women to consider a career in trades during Got a Trade Week.

“Got a Trade Week is a great way to celebrate the talents and achievements of young Kiwis making headway in their chosen craft,” Ms Upston said.

“It’s also an excellent opportunity to encourage more women into trades training. Currently less than one third of Government-funded industry trainees are women, and only eight per cent of apprentices are women.

“As New Zealand looks to overseas workers to fill the trades gap, now is a good time for women interested in the more male-dominated industries to get started training in a rewarding trades career.

“Women’s talents have been utilised in the workforce to address trades labour shortages in areas such as Canterbury, where in the past year 2,400 more women have been employed in the construction industry.

“One of the added bonuses of encouraging girls and women to train and work in non-traditional, high-growth occupations such as construction and trades is that it helps to continue the downward trend of our gender pay gap.”

With more than 50 events being held around New Zealand, Got a Trade Week provides an opportunity for school leavers, their parents, teachers and job-seekers to get up-close and personal with New Zealand’s trades and services.

The annual celebration of trades is collectively owned and funded by seven Industry Training Organisations and is part of a national campaign to raise awareness of careers in New Zealand’s trades and services.
