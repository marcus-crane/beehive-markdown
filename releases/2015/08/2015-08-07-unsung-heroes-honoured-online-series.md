A new series of stories honouring New Zealand’s unsung heroes of World War I launched online today, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says.

The stories recognise the gallant actions of individuals and military units during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915.  The first story, now available on the WW100 website, profiles Lieutenant-Colonel William Malone, who led the Wellington Battalion in the capture of Chunuk Bair.

“Many acts of battlefield bravery were not officially recognised during World War I.  As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle for Chunuk Bair this weekend, I encourage Kiwis — especially young people — to read these stories and consider how they might react in the midst of such a horrific, desperate situation,” Mr Foss says.

The series also explains how the military honours system worked during WWI.

“Signaller Cyril Bassett was awarded New Zealand’s only Victoria Cross of the Gallipoli campaign for laying and repairing a telephone wire to the front line during the Battle for Chunuk Bair.

“Medallic recognition, including the Victoria Cross, requires a very specific set of circumstances.  There’s no doubt many other men committed extraordinary acts of bravery and self-sacrifice at Chunuk Bair and every other battle during World War I.

“These stories go a small way toward honouring their actions.  New Zealanders should be immensely proud of these men who came from towns and cities all over the country,” Mr Foss says. 

The stories will be released periodically at: [http://ww100.govt.nz/unsung-heroes](http://ww100.govt.nz/unsung-heroes)
