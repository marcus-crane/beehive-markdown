Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming a significant reduction in wait times for sitting the restricted and full driver licence tests.

“A driver licence provides independence, mobility and helps expand employment opportunities. I’m pleased to see wait times for the full test are now within the target range of two to three weeks,” Mr Foss says.

“Vehicle Testing New Zealand has been working closely with the New Zealand Transport Agency since taking over the administration of practical licence tests on 1 May. 

“By increasing the number of trained testing officers and allowing drivers to book their tests further in advance, wait times have reduced week on week.

“While some wait times are still above the target of 21 days, they have reduced considerably since April. I’m confident these timeframes will continue to move in the right direction.”
