Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the newly expanded Productive Series is already benefiting patients and staff at MidCentral general practices.

“I want to see greater integration of health services which are closer to home, and an important part of this is supporting general practices,” says Dr Coleman.

The Productive Series is an evidence-based approach to finding simple ways to do things better in hospitals across the country.

Seven general practices in MidCentral DHB are the first to use the newly launched Productive General Practice programme.

“While it is still early days, the practices in MidCentral are already seeing significant benefits both to their model of care and their business model,” says Dr Coleman.

“For example, the practices have made changes to their rosters to increase the number of GP appointments available at the start and end of the day, to better align with patient needs.

“Some practices have also streamlined their repeat prescription process by using Patient Portals, freeing up GPs for more one-on-one time with patients.

“Feedback from both staff and patients has been positive. This programme is improving services and providing better patient care.”

MidCentral DHB is keen to work with other local general practices who would like to opt into the Productive General Practice Programme.
