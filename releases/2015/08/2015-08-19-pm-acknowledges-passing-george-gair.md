Prime Minister John Key has today acknowledged the passing of former National Party MP and Deputy Leader George Gair.

Mr Gair was a long-standing National MP and Senior Cabinet Minister who held the North Shore electorate from 1966 to 1990.  He also served as Deputy Leader of the National Party.

From 1991 to 1994 he represented New Zealand as High Commissioner in London, before returning to New Zealand where he served one term as Mayor of North Shore. 

Mr Gair was a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for his dedication to public services and was a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

"I am saddened to learn of George Gair’s passing,” Mr Key says. 

“George made a significant contribution to the National Party, to Parliament and to the community.  He was well-known for his competent and well-mannered approach and was highly regarded by his colleagues.”

“My thoughts are with his wife, Fay, and his family at this time.”
