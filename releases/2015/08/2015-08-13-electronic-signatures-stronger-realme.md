Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Dunne says Secured Signing’s use of the RealMe verified identity service will give people using e-signatures an easy and reliable way to assure identity.

“Secured Signing enables people to sign documents electronically, RealMe verified identity enables you to prove who you are online. Used together, the two services will mean greater convenience and assurance for people who are asked to sign documents.

“Now Secured Signing clients will be able to allow their customers to electronically sign a document and use their RealMe verified identity to prove who they are, saving time. A RealMe verified identity provides high confidence for the identity of the customer who has digitally signed the document. Through this process, local councils, banks, schools, law firms, real estate companies and others will have access to government-backed digital proof of identity services. 

“I welcome Secured Signing’s take-up of the RealMe service It is another example of better public services and helps build a more productive economy”, says Mr Dunne

More than 62,000 customers can use a RealMe verified identity to open bank accounts with BNZ and TSB, transfer foreign currency with NZForex, enrol to vote with the Electoral Commission and other services. Students are able to use a RealMe verified identity when they apply to StudyLink for allowances and loans.

“Almost a third of adults renewing their passport online have already upgraded their RealMe account to a RealMe verified identity using the passport photo they submit as part of their application, at no extra cost. Up to 400,000 adults renew their passport every year, 150,000 of them use the world-class online renewal service which is growing annually.

“RealMe is a core component of the Government’s drive to deliver better, faster online services.”

The Electronic Verification Act was introduced in 2012 to allow people to prove their identity electronically to public and private providers, using RealMe *as* a secure, trusted, consent based online identity verification service. Once a customer has verified their identity they will no longer need to supply paper identity documents to prove who they are.

Banks and finance companies can use RealMe to meet the requirements for electronic identity verification set out under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation.

*“*RealMe is another example of the Government making life easier for New Zealanders. A RealMe verified identity is a secure, trusted, consent-based online identity. I look forward to more organisations signing up to this innovative service in the near future,” says Mr Dunne.
