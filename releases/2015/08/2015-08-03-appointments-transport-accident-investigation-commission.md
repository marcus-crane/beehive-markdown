Transport Minister Simon Bridges has made three appointments to the Board of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) that he says will boost the organisation’s ability to carry out complex investigations.

Helen Cull QC has been reappointed Chief Commissioner, Peter McKenzie QC Deputy Commissioner, and Stephen Davies Howard a Commissioner. They join current Commissioner, Jane Meares.

Mr Bridges says he is pleased to formally reappoint Ms Cull as Chief Commissioner.

“Helen Cull has been in the role since March 2015. Her previous experience as Deputy Chief Commissioner, combined with her legal background, means she is well placed to lead TAIC in its very important work,” he says.

“Having a total of four Commissioners will increase TAIC’s capacity to deal with its increased workload and complex investigations.

“Mr McKenzie and Mr Davies Howard bring a range of skills and expertise. Both share governance, investigation and leadership experience. Mr McKenzie has been the Chair of the Securities Commission while Mr Davies Howard has an aviation background, including serving as a Board member of the Royal NZ Air Force.”

The terms of the new members come into effect on 10 August 2015.

TAIC is an independent body for investigating aviation, rail and maritime accidents. Its principal purpose is to determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future. The Commission is made up of three to five members, appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. Terms vary in length from 3-5 years.
