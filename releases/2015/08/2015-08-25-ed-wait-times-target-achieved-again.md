Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest quarterly health target results show the ED target has been met for the second consecutive quarter.

“DHBs are continuing to improve their performance on the Government’s health targets,” says Dr Coleman.

“Across the country over 250,000 New Zealanders were admitted, discharged or transferred from an ED within six hours. Achieving the 95 per cent target for the second consecutive quarter is a significant achievement.

“It highlights the continued excellent performance by DHBs and reflects the hard work by staff. We know that it is currently a challenging time for EDs during the busy winter months.”

The better help for smokers to quit primary care target of 90 per cent was met for the first time. The hospital component of the target has been consistently achieved in the last two years.

“There is good evidence that talking with a health professional is one of the most effective ways to get people to give up smoking,” says Dr Coleman.

“By helping people quit not only are we reducing the risk of a smoker having a smoking-related disease, we’re also improving the health of the family.”

All DHBs met the improved access to elective surgery target for 2014/15. DHBs delivered 10,614 more elective surgical discharges than planned.

“The Government is committed to delivering year-on-year increases in elective surgery. We have delivered around 50,000 more surgeries over the last seven years - a 42 per cent increase,” says Dr Coleman.

The quarterly results also show:

- Progress towards the new faster cancer treatment target increased to 68 per cent.
- 89 per cent of eligible people had their heart and diabetes check.
- Immunisation coverage for eight-month olds remained at 93 per cent.

These improvements are supported by the $400 million extra invested into health in Budget 2015.
