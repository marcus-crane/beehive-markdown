Transport Minister Simon Bridges has acknowledged the outstanding contribution Geoff Dangerfield has made to the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA), following his resignation as Chief Executive today. 

In 2008, Mr Dangerfield was appointed the inaugural Chief Executive of NZTA, which was established by the merger of Transit New Zealand and Land Transport New Zealand.

“Geoff leaves behind a positive legacy. Under his leadership, NZTA has become a high-performing and well-regarded agency which has overseen the delivery of one of the largest periods of investment in land transport in the country’s history.

“On behalf of successive Transport Ministers, I want to acknowledge and thank Geoff for his strong leadership, vision and relentless pursuit of excellence.

Mr Dangerfield will depart in December. The Board of the New Zealand Transport Agency will soon commence a recruitment process for a new Chief Executive.
