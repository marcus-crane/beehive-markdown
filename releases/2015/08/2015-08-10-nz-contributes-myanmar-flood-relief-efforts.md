Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will provide an initial $500,000 to support the response to serious flooding in Myanmar.

“Flash floods and landslides in Myanmar have affected more than 500,000 people across the country and there are reports of close to 100 fatalities,” Mr McCully says.

“Our thoughts are with the people and Government of Myanmar as they come to terms with this disaster and our funding will support the immediate humanitarian response to the flooding.

“New Zealand will give $250,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross to provide essential relief items and $200,000 to the World Food Program to provide immediate food aid.

“A further $50,000 will go to the New Zealand Embassy’s Emergency Head of Mission Fund to provide practical support on the ground.

“We will continue to monitor the situation closely and keep the need for further assistance under review,” Mr McCully says.
