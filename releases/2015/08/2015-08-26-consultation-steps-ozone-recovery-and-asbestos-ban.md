The Ministry for the Environment will commence targeted consultation on the final steps to ban two substances with known risks to both the environment and human health, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today at the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Australasia conference in Nelson.

“The Government has proposed new regulations banning the import of new bulk hydrochlorofluorocarbons and asbestos-containing products. Already New Zealand has all but phased out these substances so the number of businesses expected to be affected is low. The Ministry for the Environment will be contacting these businesses directly about the proposed regulations and work with them on alternatives,” Dr Smith says.

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) commonly used for products such as air conditioners, refrigerators and some foams. They contribute to damage of the ozone layer and increase ultraviolet radiation exposure, which harms the environment and people’s health.

“The regulations will complete the phase-out of HCFCs in New Zealand by removing a residual category of wholesale import permits. This will enable us to meet our commitment to phase out ODSs by 2020 under the Montreal Protocol ahead of schedule – which is fitting given New Zealand’s early championship of what is considered to be the most successful environmental protection agreement in the world,” Dr Smith says.

“The Government is also proposing to extend the ban on asbestos. Asbestos is a recognised carcinogen, poses risks of respiratory disease and is a leading cause of work-related disease and mortality. The importation of raw asbestos is completely banned already in New Zealand but there is currently no ban on products that contain asbestos, which would bring New Zealand’s regulations into line with that of many other countries.

“The use of asbestos-containing products is limited to the marine, aviation and electricity generation and supply industries. The Ministry will work with these industries that will be affected by the regulations as part of the targeted consultation process. An inventory released by the Ministry last year indicated that in most of these cases, alternative products were available,” Dr Smith says.
