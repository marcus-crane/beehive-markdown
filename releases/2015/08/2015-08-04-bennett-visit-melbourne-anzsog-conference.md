Putting citizens at the centre of policy and using information to deliver results will be key themes of a Trans-Tasman conference on Government, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

Mrs Bennett travels to Melbourne today to attend The Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG) Annual Conference, where she will be a keynote speaker.

“I’m pleased to have the opportunity to offer New Zealand’s perspective on the Conference’s theme of Government engagement with the public in the information age,” says Mrs Bennett.

“New Zealanders quite rightly expect outstanding public services, but more importantly, they expect results.

“Through things like the Better Public Services targets, our Welfare Reforms, and the Business Growth Agenda, we have focused on measuring the performance of the public sector and ensuring it delivers for hard-working taxpayers.

“Central to this focus has been driving the public sector to put New Zealanders at the heart of their thinking, constantly asking whether policy fits the needs of real people and not a set of processes or institutions in Wellington.”

Mrs Bennett will also attend meetings with community organisations and Victoria Government officials.
