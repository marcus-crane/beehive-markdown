Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a major investment of up to $14 million to redevelop Northland College.

Speaking to students and staff at the college this morning, Ms Kaye said “We really believe in this community and can see the positive turnaround happening at the school. Today’s announcement confirms a strong commitment to invest in young people in Northland.”

Design work is well underway, and construction will start in early 2016.

“This is the culmination of a complex planning and consultation process involving the Ministry, the school and the community, particularly over the last 18 months,” says Ms Kaye.

“A Commissioner is currently in place at Northland College. This is because of the school’s previous poor history of student achievement and financial management, including a lack of investment in property maintenance and renewal, which saw buildings get into a very bad state.

“The Ministry has invested around $1.5 million over recent years to address urgent property issues, and things have recently come a long way.

“The Commissioner has worked with the Ministry to focus on health and safety and urgent remedial work, while consultation and planning for the redevelopment was carried out.

“As with any redevelopment of this scale and complexity, it has been necessary to follow proper process. This will ensure good design and quality buildings that will meet the school’s vision, now and in the future.

“A small number of current buildings agreed between the school and the Ministry will remain, including an administration block already invested in and improved. However, the project is effectively a school rebuild. 

“Most of the current infrastructure will be replaced with new, flexible learning spaces. Future growth to a roll of around 450, up from the current roll of around 310, will be accommodated for.

“The new learning spaces will include a multipurpose gym and hall, as well as new library and technology areas.

“A swimming pool at the college is managed by the college and Far North District Council, but the redevelopment will include new changing rooms so the pool can be better used by the community.

“It’s great to see the college partnering with the council to share its facilities with the local community.

“Northland College is an important school within the local community, and we want it to continue in the positive direction it’s now tracking in.

“This is a significant investment that will ensure the college offers an environment that inspires students to succeed, and which the community can be proud of.”

Preparation work for the reconstruction is expected to start over the Christmas holiday period this year.

The Northland College project is part of a $300 million programme to redevelop schools throughout New Zealand that have complex property issues.

**Notes:**

**About Northland College**

Northland College is a decile one school in Kaikohe, teaching years 9-13. It is one of two co-ed mainstream secondary schools in the area, and has a current roll of around 310.

**What is the major redevelopment programme?**

In 2013, the Government announced funding of $300 million over six years to help around 30 schools throughout New Zealand that require major redevelopment.These schools typically face a combination of legacy issues such as old and leaky buildings.

So far, 14 other major school redevelopments have been signed off.

**Has the timeframe for the Northland College redevelopment been brought forward?**

No, today’s announcement has been the culmination of a thorough process over the last few years between the Ministry and the college, which has included condition assessments, concept design work, community meetings, completion of a business case and funding approval.

This process is necessary in major redevelopments where there are complex issues involved, which can include old and leaky buildings, geotechnical issues and a need for seismic strengthening.

It’s also important that adequate consultation is carried out to ensure plans reflect the needs and vision of the school and its community.

The Northland College project has followed the standard process for a major redevelopment. Around $1.5 million has also been invested to address urgent repairs and weather-tightness issues at the school.
