Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell congratulates Hineuru and Ngāruahine for persevering with their historic Treaty of Waitangi settlements which both had their first reading in Parliament today.

“Ngāruahine has been deeply scarred by the land confiscations in Taranaki and the imprisonment of many of their men in the South Island. Ngāti Hineuru were left virtually landless following dodgy Crown land purchases and massacres in their region,” says Mr Flavell.

“These iwi have faced profound hardship over more than a century and they have found the courage to reach an agreement with the Crown.”

“I am particularly heartened to see that some of the redress provisions will reset relationships between the Crown and iwi.”

As part of the redress, the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill will allow the iwi to set up a relationship agreement with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment that recognises it as a kaitiaki over minerals and petroleum. It also allows eight iwi of Taranaki to nominate iwi on to Taranaki Regional Council standing committees.

Hineuru will receive financial redress and the return of significant sites such as the Tarawera Hot Springs Scenic Reserve.

The Hawkes Bay Regional Planning Committee Bill also had its third reading in Parliament today.

The Bill establishes a standing committee that comprises half council and half iwi representatives from the Hawke’s Bay region.

“While the proposed Hawkes Bay Regional Planning Committee can only make recommendations to the council, it is another step forward in recognising the Treaty of Waitangi relationship between iwi and the Crown,” says Mr Flavell.
