Trade Minister Tim Groser is disappointed that the TPP negotiations were unable to reach a conclusion today, but TPP ministers collectively pledged to meet again as soon as possible to finalise the deal.

"Good progress was made this week, but a number of challenging issues remain, including intellectual property and market access for dairy products", Mr Groser said.

“We will continue to work toward a successful conclusion. This is about getting the best possible deal for New Zealand, not a deal at any cost.”

“I am confident that we will reach an agreement that is in the best interests of New Zealand when negotiations resume.”

Negotiators will continue to work on the remaining issues in the coming weeks and ministers are planning to reconvene soon to finalise the agreement.
