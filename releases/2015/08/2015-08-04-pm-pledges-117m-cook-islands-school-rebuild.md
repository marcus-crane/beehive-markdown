New Zealand will contribute up to $11.7 million towards rebuilding the Cook Islands’ national secondary school to mark 50 years of our association, Prime Minister John Key says.

Mr Key has led a delegation of Ministers, MPs and New Zealand-based Cook Islands community leaders to Rarotonga to take part in the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of Cook Islands self-governance in free association with New Zealand.

“That unprecedented arrangement was established in 1965, and since then our two countries have worked together to forge a unique relationship that is stronger today than ever,” says Mr Key.

“This anniversary is a significant milestone and New Zealand wants to mark the occasion with an enduring gift to Cook Islanders.”

New Zealand’s contribution will help to rebuild Tereora College, which is the Cook Islands’ greatest education infrastructure priority.

Specifically, it will help fund the first phase design of the redevelopment of the college, which includes the design and construction of an administration centre, library and technology block.

“Schools are both a cornerstone of the community and places of learning which help prepare our young people for the future,” Mr Key says.

“It is these students who will form the next generation of leaders and who will build on the relationship our countries have forged over the past 100 years.”

Mr Key met with his Cook Islands counterpart Henry Puna on arrival in Rarotonga today and will attend the official Constitution Day celebrations tomorrow.

“Thousands of Cook Islanders are expected to turn out to celebrate the occasion and it is a great privilege to be here to mark it with them,” Mr Key says.
