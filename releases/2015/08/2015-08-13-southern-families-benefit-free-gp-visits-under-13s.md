Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says 96 per cent of general practices in Southern DHB are offering free GP visits for children aged under 13.

Dr Coleman today met with staff from Wakatipu Medical Centre in Frankton.

“Just one month after the launch of free GP visits and prescriptions for under 13s, it’s fantastic to see such high sign up rates,” says Dr Coleman.

“At Wakatipu Medical Centre, 709 of their enrolled patients are aged under 13. The practice had no hesitation in extending free visits for under 6s – a move which has been popular with families.

“The Government is committed to supporting families in giving their children the best possible start in life. Removing the cost barrier will make a real difference to thousands of families.”

Nationally, 97 per cent of general practices around the country have now signed up to provide free GP visits for under 13s, covering 99 per cent of children aged under 13.

On 1 July, all New Zealand children aged under 13 became eligible to access free GP visits at any time of the day or night seven days a week, as well as free prescriptions.

Over 400,000 children will benefit from the scheme being expanded, taking the total number of children who are benefiting from free GP visits and prescriptions to over 750,000.

In Budget 2014 the Government committed $90 million over three years to extend free GP visits and prescriptions to children aged under 13.
