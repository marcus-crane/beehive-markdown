Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed a new package of biosecurity measures to be implemented at international airports, including more detector dogs and new x-ray machines, as a result of $27 million in new funding in Budget 2015.

The Ministry for Primary Industries has announced today that by December there will be:

- 20 new biosecurity detector dog teams
- Five new x-ray machines
- Trialling a mobile x-ray machine that can shifted to different sites
- Introducing new communications to target passengers more likely to carry Queensland fruit fly host materials.

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and these moves show how seriously we are taking this issue. This will provide a stronger presence at the border to deal with growing passenger numbers and help prevent pests and diseases entering New Zealand.

“It’s important to note that we already have 100% screening of all passengers by biosecurity officers.

“We have already beefed up the border over last two years with 130 new staff, new x-ray machines, and increased the number of detector dog teams.

“We’ve brought in Government Industry Agreements (GIAs) which involve shared preparation and response to biosecurity threats.

“The Government has also decided to bring in a committed passenger border levy as a fairer way to fund these services. It also means that foreign travellers who make up around 55% of passenger numbers will be directly contributing.”
