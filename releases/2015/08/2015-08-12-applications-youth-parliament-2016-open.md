Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that applications are now open for Youth Parliament 2016, to be held on 19 and 20 July 2016.

“Youth Parliament is a great opportunity for young leaders to get a first-hand experience of how Parliament works,” says Ms Kaye.

As Youth Minister, Ms Kaye is responsible for Youth Parliament, but a committee comprising a member of each political party and the Parliamentary Press Gallery oversees running the event.

“I’d like to acknowledge MP Louisa Wall for her work chairing this committee, as well as the MPs who invest so much time into assisting their youth representatives, and the Press Gallery for the pivotal support they provide.

“Each MP will select one young person to represent them and their community in Youth Parliament 2016, so we’re looking for 121 young people aged between 16 and 18 to be Youth MPs.

“MPs use their own criteria to select their youth representative. Based on past experience, there can be keen demand and the selection process can be competitive.

“Youth Parliament replicates the actual workings of Parliament as closely as possible. The Youth MPs get to debate legislation, sit on select committees and ask questions of Ministers.

“We’re also looking for up to 20 aspiring journalists, aged between 16 and 24, to be Youth Press Gallery members. They will be selected by the Parliamentary Press Gallery, and get to report on events leading up to and during Youth Parliament.

“A notable change to Youth Parliament 2016, agreed by the cross-party committee, is providing six-month tenures before the two-day Parliamentary session in July. This will give Youth MPs more time to canvass the views of young people in their communities and work with their respective MPs before the Youth Parliament sits.

“I’m pleased to be making this announcement today, which is the United Nations International Youth Day.

“Youth Parliament is an investment in the future leadership of New Zealand.

“We want young people from Cape Reinga to Bluff to apply. If you know someone who would be a good youth representative, then please also encourage them to apply.”
