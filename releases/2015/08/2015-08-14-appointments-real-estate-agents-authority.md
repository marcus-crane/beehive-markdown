Associate Minister of Justice, Simon Bridges, has announced a number of appointments to the Real Estate Agents Authority.

Experienced commercial and property lawyer, John Auld, has been reappointed as the chairperson for a two year term while three new members have been appointed to the Authority, each for a three year term.

Those members are Elizabeth Nidd, Anthony Stack and Marion Cowden. Ms Nidd and Mr Stack have experience as real estate licensees, while Ms Cowden has held senior directorship roles in the public and private sectors.

Mr Bridges says since the Authority was established in 2009, it has brought about considerable change to how the real estate industry is overseen.

“The Authority is an independent Crown entity responsible for promoting high service standards and professionalism in the real estate industry. It plays a vital role helping protect participants in the property market.

“It provides information to buyers and sellers, provides guidance to agents, and deals with complaints about agents’ behaviour,” he says.
