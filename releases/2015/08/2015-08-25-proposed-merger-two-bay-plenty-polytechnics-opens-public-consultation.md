Public consultation on the proposed merger of Bay of Plenty Polytechnic (BoPP) and the Waiariki Institute of Technology has been opened today by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce.

The Chairs of both institutes propose disestablishing the existing organisations and forming an entirely new institution serving the total Bay of Plenty region. It would have a new name, identity and organisational culture. The governing council of the new institution would provide appropriate cultural and geographical representation from across the region.

Earlier this year BoPP and Waiariki set out to investigate ways they could collaborate more closely to ensure they could better meet the needs of students, communities, business and industry in the wider Bay of Plenty. This proposal is a result of their work.

“I’ve spoken with the Council Chairs who confirm both polytechnics have consulted with their staff and regional stakeholders, and spoken with their learners. They indicate their proposal does not take anything away from either Rotorua or Tauranga, but would build on the best of both institutions to improve results across the entire region,” says Mr Joyce.

The proposal suggests a new and innovative vocational and professional tertiary education institution could be created with the advantage of scale and the ability to take a region wide view of investment, responding to both the aspirations of learners and the needs of industry sectors in the region.

The public consultation will be conducted before Mr Joyce makes any decisions on the proposal.

“I want to be sure the proposal would achieve what it sets out to achieve. I am keen to hear a full range of views before making any decision.”

Members of the public and interested parties are encouraged to take part in the consultation, which closes on 22 September 2015.
