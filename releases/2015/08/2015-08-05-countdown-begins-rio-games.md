Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says a year out from the Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games it looks like New Zealanders will have plenty to celebrate at both events.

“High Performance Sport NZ tell me we are on track to achieve our medal targets of 14 or more Olympic medals and 12 Paralympic gold medals,” says Dr Coleman.

“If we can hit those targets that will make Rio our most successful Olympic and Paralympic Games ever.

“The Olympic and Paralympic Games have provided some of our greatest sporting moments and I am confident Rio will produce even more.

“I wish all of those athletes, teams and coaches preparing for Rio the best of luck over the next year and I look forward to seeing them take on the world, and win.

“Success on the world sporting stage is important to New Zealanders. Sport is part of our national identity, and when we see Kiwis winning we are inspired to get active.

“It is particularly important at the moment that we encourage our young people to be active and to get involved in sport, with our lives becoming more sedentary and rising rates of obesity. Our high performance athletes are great role models, and hopefully their efforts inspire others.”

The one year to go milestone is being celebrated at the Olympic Gala Dinner in Auckland this evening.
