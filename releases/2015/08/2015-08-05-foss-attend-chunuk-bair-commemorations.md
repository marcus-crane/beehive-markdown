Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss will attend the Battle for Chunuk Bair centenary service at Gallipoli on Saturday.

“Chunuk Bair holds a special place in the hearts and minds of many Kiwis,” Mr Foss says. 

“During the Gallipoli campaign, hundreds of our soldiers fought and died in an ultimately futile bid for control of this picturesque hill.

“This year’s service, like the Anzac Day commemorations in April, will be extra special, with hundreds of Kiwis expected to attend.” 

The service is open to all and is not ticketed.

While in Turkey, Mr Foss will attend the Australian service at Lone Pine and catch up with Ahmet Cinar, Governor of Canakkale province.

Mr Foss will also visit London and Dubai for meetings in his Statistics, Associate Immigration and Small Business portfolios.
