High speed broadband and mobile connectivity is supporting regional growth and innovation across New Zealand, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Communications Minister Amy Adams say.

The Ministers have released the latest regional broadband snapshots today which highlight the deployment progress of the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) across each New Zealand region. They show steady progress in build and uptake across the programmes.

“The Government is committed to supporting our regions and providing them with the infrastructure they need to support local jobs and encourage investment,” Mr Joyce says.

“Our world-leading broadband projects were developed as a key part of our strategy to increase the global competiveness of every part of New Zealand.

“Fast broadband is enabling unprecedented economic opportunities for regional New Zealanders. It enables business to better connect with markets and customers both here and overseas while enjoying the lifestyle benefits of living outside the main centres.”

“In my view improving connectivity is the single biggest thing we can do to support regional economic development,” Ms Adams says.

“Better connectivity is transforming our regional and rural communities. We’re making good progress with UFB and RBI but we want to do even more to satisfy New Zealander’s thirst for better connectivity. That’s why we’ve committed to an extra $360 million to extend UFB, RBI and mobile coverage to more parts of New Zealand.

“From rural agriculture to Telehealth, digital learning and social benefits, high speed connectivity is game changing for regional New Zealand.”
