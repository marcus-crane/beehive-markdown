Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson has today responded to Hauraki District Council Mayor John Tregidga’s statements about Hauraki Treaty negotiations.

“The Crown is committed to completing historical Treaty settlement negotiations with the iwi of Hauraki as quickly as possible,” Mr Finlayson said.

“My officials are working hard on these negotiations. Earlier this year I appointed a new Chief Crown Negotiator, Hon Rick Barker, to bring a new perspective to negotiations which are progressing in a constructive and timely manner. Just under two months ago, for example, we initialled a deed of settlement with Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki.”

Five of the iwi of Hauraki have filed litigation in the Waitangi Tribunal. The Crown does not negotiate with iwi at the same time they are litigating against the Crown. This has required iwi-specific and collective negotiations to be paused.

Iwi-specific negotiations are active with those Hauraki iwi who did not file in the Tribunal, including Ngāti Paoa, Ngāti Hei, Ngaati Whanaunga and Ngāti Rahiri Tumutumu.

“The claims of the iwi of Hauraki are complex and overlapping. We are making good progress on these negotiations but it is simply wrong to say negotiations are 99 per cent complete. I have heard that figure before. It is wrong and repetition does not make it right.

“I look forward to the completion of the Tribunal’s inquiry so we can resume all negotiations with the iwi of Hauraki.

“I have offered to meet Mr Tregidga, and other interested mayors, to update them on progress with Hauraki negotiations,” Mr Finlayson said.
