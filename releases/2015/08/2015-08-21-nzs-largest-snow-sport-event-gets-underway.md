Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcome today’s opening of the fourth Winter Games New Zealand in Queenstown.

“This bi-annual event attracts the world’s elite snow sport athletes and is on track to becoming one of the top three international snow sport events,” says Mr Joyce.

“The Government invests in major events like the Winter Games because they generate a range of benefits for the country, including tourism and international exposure, new business opportunities and the development of local infrastructure.

“The Winter Games delivers a significant economic benefit partly because many of the athletes train in New Zealand in the run up to the competition.”

The Major Events Development Fund has invested in the Winter Games since 2009. It has invested $1.5 million into this year’s event and a further $1.25 million for 2017. A post-event analysis by MBIE found the 2013 Games generated over $7.8 million in net economic benefit for New Zealand.

“Unlike other major events New Zealand hosts, the Winter Games are a fully home grown event – making its international success more significant,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Winter Games athletes are great role models for a healthy active lifestyle. We want to encourage our young people to be active and get involved in sport, particularly with our lives becoming more sedentary and rates of obesity rising.”

The Winter Games run over the next 10 days with disciplines including alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, free skiing, snowboarding and curling. Tonight’s opening ceremony includes a performance by Ladi6, fireworks and a dual slalom.
