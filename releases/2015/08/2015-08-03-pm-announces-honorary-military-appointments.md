Prime Minister John Key has announced that Her Majesty The Queen has approved the appointment of HRH The Prince of Wales to three honorary positions in the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF):

- Admiral of the Fleet of the Royal New Zealand Navy
- Field Marshal, New Zealand Army
- Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

The New Zealand Defence Force will publicly recognise the honorary appointments when the Prince of Wales visits New Zealand this November.

“These appointments recognise the consistent and strong support Prince Charles has maintained for the New Zealand Defence Force,” says Mr Key.

“Speaking at this year’s ANZAC Day Dawn Service in Gallipoli, the Prince demonstrated a deep empathy and understanding for the contribution and sacrifice of our Defence Force personnel in conflicts and peace keeping operations around the world.”

The Prince of Wales has a strong association with the military, embarking on a naval career following in the foot-steps of his father, grandfather and both of his great-grandfathers.

The Prince also qualified as a Royal Air Force pilot flying both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. Members of the Royal family hold a number of honorary appointments within the NZDF.

The Prince of Wales was appointed as Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Air Force by The Queen in 1977, and relinquished this honorary position prior to his appointment as Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.
