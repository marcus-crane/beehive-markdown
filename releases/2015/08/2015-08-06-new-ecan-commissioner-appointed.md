Elizabeth Cunningham has been appointed as a commissioner at Environment Canterbury (ECan), Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Associate Local Government Minister Louise Upston announced today.

“Elizabeth Cunningham has a strong background in local government and brings to the table knowledge and expertise in tikanga Māori as it applies to Canterbury,” the Ministers say.

Ms Cunningham has previously been a member of ECan, the Canterbury District Health Board and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority National Earthquake Memorial Steering Group. She replaces Mr Donald Couch, who resigned as a commissioner earlier this year, and was nominated by Ngāi Tahu.

“I am confident that Elizabeth will represent the needs of the Canterbury region. She will complement the experience and capabilities of the other commissioners, and will help ensure continued stable governance for the region as it transitions to a mixed governance model,” Dr Smith says.

Ms Upston said that full consideration has also been given to the need for the membership of the Commission to have an appropriate gender balance.

“I am pleased that we have been able to appoint a commissioner who not only has the necessary skills and experience to succeed in the role, but who helps the gender balance of ECan,” Ms Upston said.

“I also want to pay tribute to the contribution that Donald Couch has made during his time as a commissioner. Donald’s background in resource management and his strong relationship with Ngāi Tahu has made a big difference in ensuring that good progress has been made in Canterbury under the commissioners’ stewardship,” Dr Smith says.

Ms Cunningham’s appointment has been gazetted today and will commence on 6 August 2015.
