Education Minister Hekia Parata says Maths Week, which starts today, shows the real-life importance of mathematics in a fun and engaging way.

“The challenges tackled during maths help students work out things like what cellphone plan they can afford, or how to budget for a trip to the movies.”

“This year’s challenges and daily competitions are better than ever, and over 200,000 students from around the country have already signed up.”

The annual online programme is run by the New Zealand Association of Mathematics Teachers (NZAMT), supported by the Ministry of Education, and aimed at students in Years 1 to 11.

“The message is loud and clear,” says Ms Parata. “Maths opens doors. It gets you through the routine challenges of daily life and helps you work towards future goals.”

“Some of this year’s questions are designed so that students have to seek help from their parents or grandparents because families, parents and whānau are essential when it comes to encouraging our kids to use maths.”

The website tools can be accessed with a computer, tablet or iphone, and some can be used offline. Teachers can print imitation money for practical exercises.  The interactive *Who wants to be a Maths Millionaire?*, modelled on the television show, is back by popular demand.
