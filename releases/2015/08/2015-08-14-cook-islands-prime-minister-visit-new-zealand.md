Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna will visit New Zealand as part of the celebrations marking 50 years of the special relationship between our two countries, Prime Minister John Key says.

Prime Minister Puna arrives tonight ahead of a series of community and official engagements, including a meeting with Mr Key.

“It was my pleasure to attend the celebrations marking 50 years of Cook Islands self-government in free association with New Zealand in Rarotonga last week,” Mr Key says.

“The anniversary is a significant occasion for both our countries and I am pleased to confirm that New Zealand will return that hospitality, and mark the anniversary with a celebration of our own.

“I look forward to hosting an official lunch for Prime Minister Puna to mark the occasion.”

The Prime Ministers will meet at Government House in Auckland and attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Auckland War Memorial Museum on Thursday.

Mr Puna will also attend a number of other engagements in Wellington and Auckland including a Cook Islands community celebration of the anniversary and a breakfast with members of the New Zealand-Pacific Parliamentary Friendship group.
