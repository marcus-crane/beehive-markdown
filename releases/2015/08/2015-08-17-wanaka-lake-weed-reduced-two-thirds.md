Lake Wanaka is healthier than it has been in decades, thanks to weed control work led by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), Minister for Land Information Louise Upston said today.

“In 2005, LINZ and a number of other agencies developed a 10-year strategy to deal with lagarosiphon. A decade on, two-thirds of the lake is clear of the aquatic weed, and LINZ is ready to begin the next phase of control work.

“These results show how LINZ’s collaboration with others is helping protect New Zealand’s iconic landscapes and waterways,” Ms Upston said.

LINZ’s control programme is developed in consultation with the Lake Wanaka Lagarosiphon Management Committee, which, along with LINZ, has members from Otago Regional Council, Queenstown Lakes District Council, the Department of Conservation, and the Guardians of Lake Wanaka.

The committee also has representatives from LINZ’s biosecurity partners Boffa Miskell, who manage the control programme, and from NIWA, who provide scientific advice.

“LINZ is now working closely with these groups on a new 10-year strategy for controlling weed at the lake. The focus for the next few years will be clearing Paddock and Glendhu Bays where major infestations in these areas have been problematic. Dealing with the weed in these bays will improve the situation across the entire lake.

“LINZ is also applying lessons learned at Wanaka to nearby Lake Dunstan, setting up the Lake Dunstan Aquatic Weed Management Group. This group will bring together a number of organisations to develop long-term plans to deal with lagarosiphon similar to those in place at Wanaka,” Ms Upston said.
