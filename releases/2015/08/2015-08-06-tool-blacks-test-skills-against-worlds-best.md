Associate Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Louise Upston has today wished New Zealand’s WorldSkills team all the best as they head to Brazil for seven days of intense competition.

WorldSkills is an international competition that brings together over 1300 young people from 73 countries. The 15-member Kiwi team known as the Tool Blacks will represent the elite of New Zealand’s young people undertaking vocational training.

“Members of the Tool Blacks have gone through regional, national and Oceania competitions just to qualify for this international event so are well prepared for what lies ahead in Sao Paulo, Brazil,” Ms Upston said.

“A skilled workforce is vital to growing New Zealand’s economy and lifting the standard of living for all New Zealanders. The Tool Blacks team are shining examples of our top trainees and I will be following the results of the competition with interest.”

The competition is held biennially and at the 2013 event the New Zealand team won a silver medal and four medallions of excellence.

“I’m absolutely certain this year’s Tool Blacks will match that result or better yet, get a couple of gold medals into their tool belts to bring home,” Ms Upston said.

Trades such as aircraft maintenance, autobody repair, welding, hairdressing and floristry are just some of the 45 skills where competitors are aiming to win titles for not only themselves, but also their country and their vocation.

The Government currently spends over $170 million on industry training supporting approximately 130,000 apprentices and trainees across a wide range of industries.
