More than 200 future Kiwi innovators and 126 hi-tech companies will be able to benefit from research and development student grants announced today by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.

Up to $1.5 million will be made available through Callaghan Innovation to enable 126 businesses to employ up to 233 students to gain important work experience in New Zealand’s fast-growing hi-tech sector over the 2015/16 summer break.

“R&D Student Experience Grants allow students with science, technology, engineering, design, or business qualifications to advance their skills and understanding of commercial R&D within New Zealand companies,” Mr Joyce says.

“The Government is investing in these grants to help keen, qualified Kiwis obtain work experience in New Zealand’s fast-growing hi-tech sector. The companies also gain by employing smart, ambitious young people to help advance their R&D projects.”

Some of the projects to be funded this year include:

- Development of harvesting handling systems for fruit
- Novel organic solvent technologies for agricultural chemicals
- Software development for virtual reality content production
- Software development to improve the accuracy of GPS fleet tracking
- Improving the nutritional benefits in dairy products for lactose-intolerant consumers

Changes are currently being made to a related Grant Scheme that supports businesses to hire a new graduate on a permanent basis, Mr Joyce says.

“Callaghan is developing a process that better matches businesses with graduates who have completed their study. An improved, on-demand R&D Career Grant will be available later this year.”

More information on the eligibility criteria for students and businesses, timelines and how to apply for Student Grants can be found at [www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz](http://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/)

Qualifying students must have completed their penultimate or final year of undergraduate or graduate study in science, technology, engineering, design or business at a New Zealand university or tertiary institute.
