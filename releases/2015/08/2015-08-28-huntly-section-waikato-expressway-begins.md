Construction of the Huntly section of the $2.1 billion Waikato Expressway has begun with Transport Minister, Simon Bridges, turning the first sod today.

The 102 kilometre Waikato Expressway is one of the Government’s seven Roads of National Significance and is being built in seven sections.

The Huntly section is the fifth section to start and will connect to the already completed Ohinewai section in the north and to the Ngaruawahia section at Taupiri in the south.

The 15 kilometre Huntly project will involve four million cubic metres of earthworks, including an 80 metre cutting through the Taupiri Range, and has nine bridges.

Mr Bridges says the Waikato Expressway is crucial to supporting a strong, growing economy in the region.

“Today is a significant milestone on the journey to completing the entire Waikato Expressway project by 2020.

“The $2.1 billion project will create jobs, boost industry and improve safety for all motorists travelling on this section of State highway 1.

“It will reduce congestion and unlock economic potential by providing stronger links between the business and agricultural centres of Auckland and the Waikato, as well as the Bay of Plenty.

“This project will not only benefit businesses, it will also provide commuters, tourists and all those travelling between Auckland and Hamilton a safer and more efficient connection.”

“The Government is committed to seeing the expressway completed as part of our focus on providing lead infrastructure that drives economic and social success for the Waikato region,” Mr Bridges says.
