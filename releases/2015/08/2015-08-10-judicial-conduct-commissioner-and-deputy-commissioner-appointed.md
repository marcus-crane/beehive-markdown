Alan Ritchie has been appointed Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Kathryn Snook has been appointed Deputy Judicial Conduct Commissioner, both for a term of five years effective from 31 August 2015, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

Mr Ritchie has been the Deputy Judicial Conduct Commissioner since 2011 and was Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of the New Zealand Law Society from 1985 to 2008.

Ms Snook is a lawyer with a background in commercial and public law and disputes resolution. She has also had significant involvement in Treaty settlement issues.

Both Mr Ritchie and Ms Snook are members and convenors of the New Zealand Parole Board.

“I am confident that Mr Ritchie and Ms Snook have the skills and experience to ensure fair consideration and determination of judicial conduct complaints,” Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Finlayson also acknowledged the service of Sir David Gascoigne, the previous Judicial Conduct Commissioner, who was appointed to the role in 2009. Sir David did not seek reappointment.

The Office of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner is a statutorily independent entity responsible for examining complaints about the conduct of judges.
