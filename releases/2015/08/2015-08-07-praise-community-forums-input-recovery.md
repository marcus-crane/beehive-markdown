Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes a report on the work and achievements of the Community Forum.

“The Community Forum was established in 2011 to advise the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery and plays a crucial role in the recovery of greater Christchurch, Ms Wagner says.

“The Forum provides active community input into decision-making at the highest level while moving the recovery forward.

“The Forum’s advice on a wide range of important issues, including recovery policies, recovery plans and anchor projects, during more than 70 meetings to-date, is trusted and always considered.

“The members of the Forum are nominated by community groups from around Canterbury and represent a cross-section of the wider community. They are all volunteers and I thank them for the considerable time and effort they have invested in the earthquake recovery process,” Ms Wagner says.

In the report the Forum has recommended that if earthquake recovery powers are transferred to a different agency, that this agency considers an ongoing engagement with the Community Forum or an equivalent community body.
