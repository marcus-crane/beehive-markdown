Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming two new in-flight initiatives to help international visitors keep themselves and others safe on New Zealand roads.

A series of short road safety videos and an app will soon be available on Air New Zealand’s in-flight entertainment system.

“I’m pleased to see Air New Zealand has updated and enhanced the information it provides about our road rules and conditions. These initiatives are yet another way of communicating important road safety messages,” Mr Foss says.

“Visitors to New Zealand have access to a range of information and support at various stages — when they are planning and booking their trip, when they are on their way here and once they arrive.”

Air New Zealand worked with a number of organisations to develop the material, including the New Zealand Transport Agency, Tourism New Zealand, New Zealand Police and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“Air New Zealand’s videos and app join a range of other initiatives to improve safety on our roads, including improvements to roads and roadsides, a new Code of Practice for rental vehicle companies and an online training module for overseas travel agents.

“There is no silver bullet here.  However, when combined, a number of seemingly small actions build to create a safer system for all road users, including the increasing number of overseas visitors choosing to explore our country by car,” Mr Foss says.
