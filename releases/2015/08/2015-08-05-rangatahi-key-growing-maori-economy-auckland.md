Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, welcomes the release of a report on the Māori economy in Tāmaki Makaurau.

The Independent Māori Statutory Board commissioned a report called, *The Auckland Māori Economy: Size, Issues and Opportunities,* which was released today.

The [report](http://www.imsb.maori.nz/index.php/news-events/media-releases) identifies that the Auckland Māori economy’s asset value makes up over half of the country’s $43-billion Māori asset base and that much of its wealth is derived from real estate, ICT, financial and insurance services.

“Tāmaki Makaurau clearly has a different economic base from other regions and this report confirms that the opportunity for Māori economic growth lies with our young people.

“Supporting rangatahi Māori to further their education at both secondary and tertiary levels as well as considering careers in areas like ICT and business will result in significant growth,” says Mr Flavell.

He encourages anyone with an interest in Māori economic development and the future of Tāmaki Makaurau to read the report.
