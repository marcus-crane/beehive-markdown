Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will visit Westmere School in Auckland this afternoon to mark the completion of a $9.9 million redevelopment.

“The project was completed early last month and includes 21 new teaching spaces, a new library and administration building and general infrastructure upgrade,” says Ms Kaye.

“There were weather-tightness and structural issues with a number of existing buildings at the school.

“I’d like to acknowledge the school and community for their support while plans to address this were developed, and the redevelopment was carried out.

“Students and teachers can now enjoy fantastic new facilities which support modern learning methods.

“As with all major school redevelopments, the confined classrooms of yesterday have been replaced with innovative new learning spaces. These are open and flexible, and will enable children to learn in new and exciting ways.

“This is about providing children with an inspiring environment that supports both independent and collaborative learning, and prepares them for a world of change.

“The community can now mark the centenary of the school in its brand new environment.

“Westmere School actually turned 100 last year, but celebrations were deferred until October 17 this year, because of the rebuild work underway.

“I hope current and former pupils and staff will come together to celebrate the new facilities and mark this significant milestone in the school’s history.”

**Notes:**

**About Westmere School**

Westmere School is a decile 10, state co-educational contributing school (years 1-6). Its roll as at March 2015 is 575 students.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
