Transport Minister Simon Bridges and Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss say the launch of the ninth annual Rail Safety Week is a timely reminder to stay alert around trains, tracks and level crossings.

“There are a range of events taking place around the country — all focused on reminding people how to keep safe around trains,” Mr Bridges says.

“The theme this year is ‘Expect trains’. Whether you are an urban commuter, or in a car, truck or van at a rural level crossing, the message is the same — remember a train can come along at any time and from any direction. Events taking place around the country will reinforce this, and other important safety messages.”

Events include ‘Cops in Cabs’, where Police  will ride in locomotive cabs to find out what it is like to be in a train when it is involved in a collision or near collision, while Christchurch school children will experience a locomotive training simulator. The New Zealand Transport Agency will also launch a new safety campaign focussed on improving driver behaviour at rural level crossings.

“Rail Safety Week is an excellent opportunity to highlight the care that needs to be taken around railway tracks and trains year-round,” Mr Foss says.

“A large number of organisations are involved in Rail Safety Week and it’s great to see companies like Fonterra and Mainfreight also helping to spread the word about rail safety.”

Rail Safety Week runs through to 16 August. The week is planned and coordinated by KiwiRail with the support of TrackSAFE NZ, NZ Transport Agency, NZ Police, Auckland Transport, Transdev Auckland and Greater Wellington Regional Council.
