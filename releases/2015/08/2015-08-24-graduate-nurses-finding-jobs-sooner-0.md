Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more graduate nurses are finding jobs sooner according to the latest figures from the nationwide system which places graduates into the workforce.

“The national recruitment system (ACE) provides accurate information much sooner for both nurse graduates and employers, helping to match new nurses with employers,” says Dr Coleman. 

“In the latest six-monthly ACE matching round, 285 students (43 per cent) have already been placed in DHB positions prior to receiving their final Nursing Council state exam results. This is 52 more nurses than last year.

“Data shows that a year on from July 2014’s ACE round only 13 of the 482 graduates, under three per cent, are still looking for positions through ACE – that’s a significant success rate.”

The national recruitment system (ACE) has now been running for over three years. There are two ACE rounds in a year, in July and November (the largest).

“New Zealand needs more nurses over the coming years as more senior nurses will begin to retire, and with a growing and aging population, the skills of nurses are needed more than ever in our communities,” says Dr Coleman.

The Government has funded 1,232 nurse entry to practice positions in 2015 this includes 225 extra training places, 160 in DHBs, 40 in aged residential care and 25 in general practice.

This is supported by the Government investing $400 million extra into health in Budget 2015.

There were 52,729 nurses with annual practising certificates registered with the Nursing Council of New Zealand as of 31 March 2015. This represents an increase of 6,764 since 2009.
