Big increases in South Island’s tourist numbers are contributing to strong regional growth rates, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

Mrs Bennett is in Dunedin and Christchurch today speaking with tourism operators and students about the opportunities and challenges faced by the sector.

“New Zealand’s economy is more diverse and resilient because of the growth we’re seeing in sectors like tourism, and the South Island is experiencing some particularly impressive results,” says Mrs Bennett.

Dunedin is hosting the 2015 Tourism Export Council Annual Conference, which Mrs Bennett addressed before visiting with students and staff at the University of Otago’s Faculty of Tourism.

“The number of international visitors to the Otago region topped 1.4 million in the year to March 2015 – the highest ever,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Those guests spent over $1.3 billion, a massive injection into the region that not only benefits the local tourism operators but has a positive flow-on effect in the wider Otago economy which grew 6.3 per cent last year.”

Mrs Bennett toured the International Antarctic Centre while in Christchurch, which included an up-close experience with Little Blue Penguins and a Hagglund ride.  

International visitor arrivals into Christchurch for the year ending June 2015 saw a 6.7 per cent increase on the previous year to almost 440,000, spending an estimated $837 million. Canterbury’s economy grew 10.6 per cent last year.

“Canterbury tourism operators face unique and very difficult challenges as they recover. They are our gateway to the South and I’m really impressed with the way they are rebounding,” says Mrs Bennett.

Nationally, tourism contributes 4% to our GDP, and the Government remains committed to ensuring the sector keeps expanding through things like the Tourism Growth Partnership, investing in vital regional infrastructure, and supporting Tourism New Zealand’s promotional work.
