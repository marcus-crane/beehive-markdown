The next round of applications for the Racing Safety Development Fund has opened today, Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced.

“The fund supports projects around the country for improving racecourse health and safety standards. In the past this has included improvements for safety running rails, irrigation and drainage, swabbing boxes, and grandstand repairs,” says Mr Guy.

“The fund can support projects that improve the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, and officials.

“Many of these facilities are public places and widely used by the community in rural areas, outside of racing events as well as at race days.”

Two rounds of funding are held each year with a total of $1 million available.

All racing clubs and code bodies may apply for funding. New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses.

On-line applications must be submitted by 23 September 2015.  Further information is available from: [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) and [Racing Safety Development Fund - dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Racing-Safety-Development-Fund?OpenDocument)
