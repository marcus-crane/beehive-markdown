A suite of Government initiatives has built momentum for efforts to reduce New Zealand’s horrific family violence track-record, says Justice Minister Amy Adams.

Ms Adams today launched a review into New Zealand’s family violence legislation – the latest milestone related to the package of measures announced by Prime Minister John Key in July 2014.

“Just over a year ago, this Government made a firm commitment to push back against the scourge of family and sexual violence,” Ms Adams says.

“The level of family violence in New Zealand is appalling. Last year alone, more than 100,000 incidents were reported to Police –around one every five minutes. What’s more, nearly half of all homicides and reported violent crimes are family violence-related.

“The legislation review is one of many ways we’re striving to get victims the help they need, hold perpetrators to account, and stop family violence from happening in the first place.”

Minister of Justice Amy Adams and Social Development Minster Anne Tolley also recently announced a new Ministerial work programme focused on improving and better coordinating the Government’s overall system for addressing family violence and sexual violence.

“We’re dealing with an immensely complex issue, and we can and will do more,” Ms Adams says.

“The initiatives announced last year added momentum to the whole-of-government approach to dealing with these problems. Our next phase, such as the new work programme, will help chart a course that leads to real and lasting change.”
