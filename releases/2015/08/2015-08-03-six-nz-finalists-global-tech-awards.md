Communications Minister Amy Adams has acknowledged six New Zealand companies which have been selected as finalists in this year’s World Summit Awards for creativity and innovation in ICT.

The awards are a global showcase of 40 projects, across eight categories, with a special emphasis on those which show the benefits of information and communication technology for the development of communities.

New Zealand has finalists in six of the eight categories. Those are Figure.NZ, ARANZ Medical, Pond, Ngā Tapuwae Gallipoli, Wipster and Attitude Live.

Ms Adams says this year’s finalists are prime examples of New Zealand companies effectively using ICT to put their innovative ideas into action.

“New Zealand companies have always pioneered global thinking and it’s great to see these clever Kiwi initiatives being showcased on the world stage,” Ms Adams says.

New Zealand has participated in the World Summit Awards since 2003. Final judging will take place in Azerbaijan in September.

Further information on the finalists is attached.
