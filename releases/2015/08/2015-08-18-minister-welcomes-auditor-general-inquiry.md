Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the announcement that the Auditor-General will look at the Saudi Food Security Partnership and Agrihub project.

“We have said from the outset that the Auditor-General is entitled to scrutinise any spending of public money, whenever she chooses, and we welcome her decision to carry out an inquiry into the Saudi Food Security Partnership," Mr McCully says.

"The Government is comfortable with the process that was followed in relation to the Agrihub, and the wider Food Security Partnership, and relevant departments, including  MFAT, will provide all necessary support to the inquiry.

“It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the Auditor-General's inquiry is ongoing," Mr McCully says.
