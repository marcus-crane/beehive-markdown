Empowering people to be better with money is the key focus for Money Week, says Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith.

“By building the financial capability of our families and communities we can help people better shape their lives, reduce debt and hardship, and achieve their goals,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“Getting people thinking about money and how to manage it, from day-to-day budgeting to long term planning are some of the things being discussed in events and activities across the country this week.” 

Mr Goldsmith today attended the Money Week launch in Britomart, Auckland.

“It’s encouraging to see so many schools, groups and workplaces getting behind Money Week. Regardless of your level of financial fitness, Money Week offers something for everyone,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“It’s particularly important that we equip the next generation with the skills they need for financial independence later in life.

“Recently I announced the Government Statement on Building Financial Capability which supports New Zealanders getting ahead financially. Better financial capability will help improve the wellbeing of our families and communities, increase investment and grow jobs and the economy.

“I would like to thank the team at the Commission for Financial Capability who have worked hard to organise Money Week,” says Mr Goldsmith.

Money Week is a nationwide week of events which runs from 31 August to 6 September.
