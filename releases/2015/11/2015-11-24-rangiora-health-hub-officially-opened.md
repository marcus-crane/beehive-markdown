Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened the Rangiora Health Hub which provides high quality maternity services and flexi beds for patients with a range of needs in North Canterbury.

“There has been a significant increase in the number of births in recent years in North Canterbury. With over 150 births this year, it’s timely to have expanded and improved maternity facilities in the region,” says Dr Coleman.

“From when the facility was announced in 2011, the process of engagement with the local community has been extensive. It has resulted in a $7 million health facility suited to local community needs.

“This is a great fit-for-purpose facility with two birthing rooms and 12 maternity beds. The birthing rooms are well kitted-out with pools and equipment to help safely deliver babies.” 

While the initial focus is on maternity care, Rangiora Health Hub also has four flexi beds for patients recuperating after surgery or from an illness. Meals on wheels are also provided for the local community.

“With plans for expansion, Rangiora Health Hub will provide a central location for a range of regional health services in the future,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Health Hub model is a way of providing a range of outpatient and community specialist services closer to where people live and work.

“We want to see more services being delivered closer to home. Integration and care closer to home will help develop a more efficient and sustainable health system. It will also provide a better patient experience.”
