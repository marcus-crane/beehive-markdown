Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse today announced new rules for Filipino dairy workers who may have provided incorrect information relating to their qualifications and experience with their original work visa applications.

“Today I approved amendments to immigration instructions to allow further work visas to be granted to those workers who admit to previously providing incorrect information,” Mr Woodhouse says.

Under the new immigration instructions, applicants who admit to previously providing incorrect information but who are compliant in all other respects will be eligible to be granted a further work visa, as long as they meet all other Essential Skills requirements.

“This approach acknowledges that many of these workers are making a significant contribution to their employers and their communities and are well-settled in New Zealand. It also accepts the admission of having provided incorrect information by workers who come forward.

“The changes minimise the disruption that would have been caused by a significant number of workers having their visas declined.

“However, I want to make it clear that these workers are not guaranteed that new visa applications will be successful and they may need to meet a labour market test to check whether there are any New Zealanders available to do their job.

“In addition, further visa applications from these workers could be declined if they do not meet other standard health and character requirements, or if their employer has had compliance issues with immigration or employment law.”
