Justice Minister Amy Adams today announced the appointment of renowned victims advocate Dr Kim McGregor, QSO, to the role of Chief Victims Advisor to Government.

Ms Adams says Dr McGregor has nearly 30 years’ experience working first-hand with victims of sexual and family violence and is the ideal candidate for this newly created position. 

“Dr McGregor has worked across the victim-related sector as a researcher, advocate and therapist and brings to this role a wealth of experience and knowledge about where the system is working and where the possible gaps are,” Ms Adams says.

The Chief Victims Advisor will be responsible for providing the Government with independent advice on legislative, policy and other issues relating to victims of crime.

“Dr McGregor will also assist the Government in fulfilling our election promise to make the New Zealand justice system more responsive and easier for victims to navigate as part of a wider strategy to improve services and support for victims and witnesses.”

The appointment of the Chief Victims Advisor is part of a wider suite of Government-led changes to reduce family and sexual violence, and keep victims safe.

The Ministerial Group on Family and Sexual Violence has launched a new work programme, alongside a comprehensive review of family violence laws and the roll out of the National Home Safety Service.

Ms Adams says while the Government is determined to reduce crime and reoffending, it’s also important to ensure that when someone does experience crime the justice system is easy to navigate for them and provides the services they need.

“I am very pleased to welcome Dr McGregor to this new role and look forward to seeing how her vast experience, expertise and first-hand knowledge will provide the Government with valuable advice to help advocate on behalf of victims,” Ms Adams says.
