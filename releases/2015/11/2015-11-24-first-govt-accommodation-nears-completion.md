Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says the first of the new central Christchurch buildings to house Government agencies is expected to be fully fitted out this week, in anticipation of workers moving in early next year.

“The first stage of the BNZ Centre, between Cashel and Hereford Streets, will initially accommodate about 380 workers from nine different Government agencies or Crown entities across three floors of the building,” Mr Brownlee says.

“This major development will have a mix of Government tenants, private retailers and hospitality providers, and will be a real hub of activity in the heart of the city.

“Government workers will also be part of the second stage of the BNZ Centre, which will accommodate the offices of ACC. 

“The Government has invested heavily in the recovery of central Christchurch through the development of anchor projects, but it is also backing the central city by bringing back hundreds of public servants who will add to the overall activity and help support businesses.

“Having all of these Government agencies based right in the heart of the city, and in close proximity with each other and local authorities, will also make for better public services for the people of Christchurch.”   

The agencies to be accommodated in BNZ Centre Stage 1 are: Statistics New Zealand, New Zealand Transport Agency, Department of Internal Affairs, Te Puni Kokiri, Human Rights Commission, Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, Creative New Zealand and the Health Promotion Agency.

Around 200 ACC staff are expected to move into BNZ Centre Stage 2 in early 2017, while about 550 Government workers are expected to occupy another new development, Grand Central on Cashel Street, by the end of next year.

Around 350 Government workers will also partly occupy a new development on the King Edward Barracks site that included the former central police station, with workers expected to move in in March 2017.

On top of these private developments with Government tenancies, about another 1100 people are expected to be working in the Government’s new Justice and Emergency Services Precinct when it is fully operational.
