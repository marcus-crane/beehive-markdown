The Crown has signed a deed of settlement with Rangitāne o Manawatū settling the iwi’s outstanding historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

“Rangitāne o Manawatū has been working towards settlement with the Crown since 1998, when Tānenuiarangi Manawatū Incorporated gained a mandate to represent the iwi in negotiations,” Mr Finlayson said. “Today’s signing is an important milestone and marks the beginning of a new relationship between the iwi and the Crown.”

Rangitāne o Manawatū’s grievances include the 1859-1866 Crown purchase of over 500,000 acres of land in which Rangitāne o Manawatū had customary interests. Due to the cumulative effect of Crown purchases and native land laws, by 1992 Rangitāne o Manawatū retained ownership of only a fraction of their former lands.

The settlement provides an acknowledgement, apology and redress for the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and the long-term effects of these breaches.

Rangitāne o Manawatū receives financial redress of $13.5 million as well as the transfer of and right of first refusal over specified Crown properties and land. Cultural redress includes the vesting of 11 Crown-owned sites, statutory acknowledgements and protocols with Crown agencies.

The settlement redress will be administered by the Rangitāne o Manawatū Settlement Trust, elected by iwi members as the Post-Settlement Governance Entity.

“The Crown can never fully compensate Rangitāne o Manawatū for the loss and prejudice it has suffered,” Mr Finlayson said. “This settlement provides a base for Rangitāne o Manawatū to build a brighter future for their people.”
