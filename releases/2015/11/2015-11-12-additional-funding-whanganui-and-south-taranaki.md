Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced that $500,000 in extra funding is being made available to assist Whanganui and South Taranaki with the continuing clean-up operation following severe flooding in June.

In response to the flooding, the Minister activated Enhanced Task Force Green (ETFG), a temporary employment programme which has seen local beneficiaries employed to assist with the clean-up and repair of local infrastructure.

Today’s announcement brings the total government funding through ETFG for the post-flood operation to $1 million. 

“There was extensive flood damage in these areas and while a lot of cleaning up and repair work has been done, there is still some that needs to be completed,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This additional funding will be used by councils and an iwi authority to employ jobseekers and supervisors to help with the clean-up, as well as hire or purchase equipment and training.

“These workers will be involved in fence repair, silt removal, slip clearing and any other infrastructure work required.

“We will continue to liaise with local communities to assess if further support is needed.”
