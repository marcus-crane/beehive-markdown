Prime Minister John Key will travel to Malta later this week for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, before attending climate change talks in Paris and heading to Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“CHOGM determines the Commonwealth’s activities and direction for the coming years, and is an opportunity to meet with leaders from countries that share a similar heritage.

“This year’s conference will focus on global sustainability, ahead of the climate change negotiations in Paris. It will also focus on deeply concerning security issues which require concerted action.

“Many of New Zealand’s key trading partners are Commonwealth countries, so it is also an opportunity to strengthen our trade relationships.”

The next Commonwealth Secretary-General is also due to be elected at CHOGM.

Following CHOGM, Mr Key will travel to Paris to attend the UN climate change conference.

“Momentum is building ahead of Paris with more than 160 countries committing to taking action around climate change. New Zealand will be pushing for a deal that puts the world on a pathway towards limiting global temperature rise to no more than 2°C.”

Mr Key will then travel to Berlin, where he will meet with Chancellor Merkel.

“Over the last 12 months our relationship with Germany has grown significantly, and there are opportunities to expand our economic and scientific cooperation even further.”

Mr Key will be overseas from November 25 – Dec 3.
