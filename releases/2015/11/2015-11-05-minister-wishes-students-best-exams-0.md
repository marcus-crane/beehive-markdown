Education Minister Hekia Parata has wished students well on the eve of  NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship examinations.

“This is an exciting time because it’s the culmination of many months of study, and I would hope, some years of planned pathway. I congratulate students for all their hard work so far and wish them the very best over the next four weeks.”

About 145,000 students will participate in this year’s exams which begin tomorrow with Scholarship Drama and continue until December 4.

“Exams can be stressful, but I know parents will be doing everything they can to support their kids over the coming days. Teachers and principals also do a fantastic job preparing our students and I thank them for their dedication.”

The first big exam will be NCEA Level 1 Mathematics which will be sat by just over 40,000 students on Monday morning.

The exam sat by the largest number of students – 48,700 – will be Level 1 English on the morning of Monday 16 November and the exam sat by the smallest number of students will be Scholarship Latin with 27 students on Friday 27 November.

A breakdown of the 2015 entries shows that there are a total of:

- 62,537 students entered at Level 1
- 55,272 students entered at Level 2
- 40,890 students entered at Level 3
- 9,636 students entered in New Zealand Scholarship.

A number of students are sitting exams at more than one level.

A team of approximately 1,750 markers will mark all papers by Christmas, with NCEA results expected to be released online from mid-January.

Students unable to access results online can have a printed copy sent to them but must make this request via the student login section of the NZQA website by the end of December.
