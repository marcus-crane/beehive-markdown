Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has announced changes to the Workplace Literacy and Numeracy Fund which will see more workers be able to access training.

“After feedback from employers and staff, I have decided to relax some of the criteria so the fund will be more accessible and an even better fit for businesses,” Mr Joyce says.

The Government is dropping the two-year funding limit for workplace courses, expanding from single employer applications to allow groups of employers with some common ground to apply, and dropping deadlines for applications so that funding can be applied for all year around.

“Technology is continuing to change the way businesses operate, making improving literacy and numeracy even more essential. A truck driver for example is likely to use a tablet to invoice the customer on the spot rather than relying on an accounts clerk to do this later.”

“Workers have said that after doing the training they’re more confident in the workplace, they participate more in problem solving and they are more likely to report health and safety issues. They also report that improving their literacy and numeracy has improved their quality of life more generally, and that of their families.”

This year over $20 million was allocated to through Workplace Literacy and Numeracy Fund, and more than 5,500 people are receiving training. The Fund is administered by the Tertiary Education Commission. 

“Research and employer reports show that workplace literacy and numeracy programmes improve productivity and business results, and lead to better social outcomes for employees. This is money well spent.”
