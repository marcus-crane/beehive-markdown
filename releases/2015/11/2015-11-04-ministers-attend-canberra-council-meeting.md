Justice and Courts Minister Amy Adams and Police Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Canberra today to represent the New Zealand Government at the fourth meeting of the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council.

“With key sessions on law enforcement, law reform, and family and community safety, this is an invaluable forum for discussing current justice sector issues and sharing ideas and experiences,” Ms Adams says.

“Family violence and law reform are two key areas for me and I’m looking forward to continuing discussions with my trans-Tasman colleagues around how they’re approaching these issues.”

“The LCCS Council meetings provide a great opportunity for jurisdictions to showcase recent initiatives and discuss various approaches to policing, justice and emergency management,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“This year’s meeting is particularly important for New Zealand as it will provide valuable insights into Council process, which I’m sure will be very useful ahead of hosting next year’s meeting.”

While in Canberra, both Ministers intend to arrange bilateral meetings with their Australian counterparts.

Ministers leave 4 November and return on the 6 November.
