Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC has acknowledged the contribution to the coronial system and Wellington legal community of Coroner Garry Evans, whose final hearing is being held today.

“Since Garry Evans’ appointment as Wellington District Coroner in 1997, New Zealand has benefited from his good judgement, strong work ethic and dedication,” Mr Finlayson said.  

Mr Evans also served as Acting Chief Coroner between September 2009 and November 2009.

“During his time in coronial office, Mr Evans has had a particular interest in the medical aspects of coronial inquiries, sudden infant deaths and mental health inquests.

“On behalf of the Government, I thank Mr Evans for his many years of dedicated service and wish him all the best for the future.”
