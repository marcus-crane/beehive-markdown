Tomorrow is International Volunteer Managers’ Day, a time to recognise and thank the work of New Zealand’s volunteer managers says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

“Volunteer managers are the leaders of the sector, ensuring volunteers’ skills and expertise are used to their greatest advantage, and that volunteers are well-supported,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“They drive the country’s largest workforce. In keeping with this year’s theme, volunteer managers really are ‘the power behind volunteers’.”

Approximately one-third of New Zealanders volunteer, running 90 per cent of the non-profit organisations in our communities.

“Most volunteer managers have been involved in the volunteer community for at least five years. They have built up a very special skillset to coordinate the workforce.

“The 5th of November is a time to thank our volunteer managers, and Volunteering New Zealand for providing them the support, professional development and training they need for our voluntary sector to thrive.”
