Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new initiatives are underway to streamline cancer care and deliver better faster services to patients.

“21 new initiatives started last month as part of the second round of the Cancer Service Improvement Fund which supports DHBs in delivering more streamlined cancer treatment and improved patient care,” says Dr Coleman.

“These projects will help sustain the progress we’re making to ensure that more patients are seen within the 62-day faster cancer treatment target.

“The Cancer Service Improvement Fund has now allocated more than $11 million to support DHBs and regional cancer networks to improve services.”

The 21 initiatives, selected for funding through a competitive tender process, include:

- An analysis of the diagnosis and treatment path for different tumour types in the Midland region which will identify delays, gaps and issues by DHB, ethnicity and rurality.

<!--THE END-->

- A project to improve equity for Māori cancer patients that will be rolled out across the South Island, beginning with the appointment of a Māori cancer pathway educator in Nelson Marlborough DHB.

<!--THE END-->

- A collaborative Southern region initiative to improve diagnosis and follow up of melanoma including enhanced primary care services, teledermatology, virtual lesion clinics and a South Island Network of Dermatology Services.

“23 initiatives selected for funding last year have now been completed, with some outstanding results,” says Dr Coleman.

“For example, at Auckland DHB the waiting time for cancer laboratory tests was reduced by more than three days by a project to expand capacity, and a training programme to upskill technical staff to support pathologists.”

The Government has invested almost $63 million in the faster cancer treatment programme since 2008.

Under the national target, by July 2016, 85 per cent of patients are to receive their first cancer treatment within 62 days of being referred urgently with a high suspicion of cancer. This increases to 90 per cent by June 2017.
