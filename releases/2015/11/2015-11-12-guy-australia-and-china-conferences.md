Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is travelling to Australia and China over the next four days to attend racing and agricultural conferences.

He travels to Brisbane today to attend the Australasian Racing Ministers’ Conference, which involves Australian state ministers of racing.

“New Zealand shares a lot in common with the Australian racing industry, and this is a chance to discuss issues like animal welfare and the impact of offshore online wagering,” says Mr Guy.

On Friday Mr Guy travels to Beijing to attend and speak at the Development Research Centre (DRC)’s Food Security and Food Safety Strategy Summit.

“The DRC is a government policy, research and consulting institution that focuses on China's economic and social development. This conference is a good opportunity to build closer links with China and outline how our two countries can work together on issues of food and agricultural policy.”

On Monday he visits Hong Kong to meet with New Zealand companies, and a meeting with the Hong Kong Jockey Club. New Zealand race horses are one of our most important exports to Hong Kong with exports worth $29 million in the most recent year.

He departs today and is back in New Zealand on Tuesday 17 November.
