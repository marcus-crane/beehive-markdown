Education Minister Hekia Parata is urging New Zealanders to have their say on a revamp of education legislation that will help to shape the future of the education system.

“When the reforms known as Tomorrow’s Schools were introduced in 1989 they transformed the way education was administered,” she says. “For the first time local communities, not a centralised bureaucracy became responsible for running schools.

“However, that was 26 years ago and the world has changed since then. It is time to look at an update of the Education Act to keep what is important and working and improve what is not.”

Ms Parata says the proposed update draws on the recommendations of the Taskforce on Regulations Affecting School Performance which reported in 2014 that the Act focused on structures and administration.

“These are legally necessary. However, the real emphasis needs to be on raising the achievement of all students.

“To deliver a high quality education, we need an Act that has a clear focus on children and young people, makes it clear what the system is looking for, enables collaboration and flexibility, and fully engages parents, whānau and local communities.

The consultation process, begins today and runs until December 14.
