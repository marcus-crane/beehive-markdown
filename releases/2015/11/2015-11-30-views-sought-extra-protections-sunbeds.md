Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says public consultation on proposals for additional protection from the use of commercial sunbeds starts today.

“There is clear international evidence that UV tanning devices, including sunbeds, significantly increase the risk of skin cancers among users and that younger people are at higher risk,” says Dr Coleman.

“While there is an existing voluntary standard in place for the use of sunbeds, the evidence shows that it isn’t being adhered to.

“Because of the danger sunbeds potentially pose it's important to have a licensing and training regime that ensures there are no cowboy operators in this industry.”

The proposed protections in the consultation document include:

- Licensing all sunbed premises and operators;
- Require operators are trained to ensure the risks of sunbeds use are minimised;
- And insist on clear information being provided to clients relating to the risks of sunbeds.

“These proposals complement legislation currently before Parliament, to ban the use of commercial sunbeds by those aged under 18 years,” says Dr Coleman.

“Internationally there is a shift away from the use of sunbeds. For example in Australia all UV services for cosmetic purposes will be banned by 1 January 2016.

“The proposals aim to strike a balance between the rights of informed adults to access sunbeds, while at the same time ensuring operators know what they’re doing.”

Public consultation will run until Friday 12 February 2016.
