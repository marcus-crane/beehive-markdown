Prime Minister John Key today congratulated the All Blacks on their historic victory in the Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham.

The All Blacks beat Australia 34-17.

“Not only have the All Blacks won the ultimate rugby prize, but they have successfully defended their world champion title and become the first team to win consecutive tournaments in the Rugby World Cup’s 28 year history,” says Mr Key.

“The All Blacks have shown tremendous courage, determination and teamwork throughout this tournament and are deserving world champions.

“I am sure all of New Zealand will join me in congratulating them.” Mr Key was at the final at Twickenham.

“New Zealand and Australia have a special relationship so it was great to see our two sides square off for the first time in a Rugby World Cup final.

“I know back home four million New Zealanders would have set their alarms and got up to watch the final. That dedication shows the huge amount of support the All Blacks have throughout the country.

“Once again congratulations to Richie McCaw, Steve Hansen and the All Blacks team. You have made New Zealand very proud.”
