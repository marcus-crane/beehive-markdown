Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced a Major Events Development Fund (MEDF) investment of $1.2 million in the next three Ultimate Waterman events.

The Ultimate Waterman seeks the world’s best all-round waterman across various disciplines including surfing, stand-up paddle board, waka-ama, water skill and endurance events.

The Major Events Fund invested $300,000 in the inaugural event in March this year, and the additional investment will support the 2016, 2017 and 2018 events.

“The $1.2 million investment will build on the success of this year’s event, which has been viewed online more than three million times and has aired in the United States to a household audience of more 40 million,” Mr Joyce says.

“This is an opportunity to showcase New Zealand’s coastlines and cities to the world, and attract a large international viewing audience through multiple TV, online and social media channels.”

The invitation-only contest will be based in Auckland, with competitors travelling across the country to compete in the best surf and water conditions on the day for each discipline.

There will also be opportunities for spectators to take part by competing in mass-participation events, visiting the fan zone that will be established on Auckland’s waterfront, and watching the competitors as they travel around New Zealand.

“The Government is committed to working with New Zealand's major events sector to help attract and grow high-quality major events around the country that deliver economic, social and cultural benefits and promote New Zealand to the world," Mr Joyce says.
