Governance of the Waitangi Treaty Grounds will be strengthened after the Waitangi National Trust Board Amendment Bill passed its third and final reading today, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

“These changes are about the Government working constructively with the Board to protect Waitangi for current and future generations,” Ms Barry says.

“They amend and modernise the Waitangi National Trust Board Act 1932, which vests the Waitangi Treaty Grounds and wider estate in the Board, to be held for the nation.”

The bill removes the Governor-General, Prime Minister, Minister of Conservation and Minister for Māori Development from ex officio positions on the board and puts in place new arrangements to ensure a positive working relationship between the Board and the Crown.

Two MPs, one appointed by the Prime Minister and the other by the Leader of the Opposition, will become Board members.

“The Prime Minister, the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, and the Minister for Māori Development will form a Crown representatives group to liaise with the Board,” Ms Barry says. “This removes the potential for conflict between the constitutional and trustee roles of the ex officio Board members.”

The bill will come into force on the day after it receives the Royal assent.
