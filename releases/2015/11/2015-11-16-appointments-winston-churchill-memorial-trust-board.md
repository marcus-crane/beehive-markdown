Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced six appointments to the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Board.

The Board distributes around 25 fellowships each year to New Zealanders travelling overseas to research topics that will contribute to their profession and the wider community.

“I am delighted at the diverse knowledge and expertise of each new member,” says Mrs Goodhew. “Their skills will be complementary and valuable to the current board.”

The six new members who have been appointed for six-year terms commencing 1 January 2016 are:

- Elizabeth Richards (Chair)
- Nicola Taylor
- Erin Jackson
- Robyn Scott-Vincent
- Dr Bronwyn Smits
- Dr Peggy Fairbairn-Dunlop

“Joining current board members Len Cook, Fiona Tregonning and Bruce Robertson, the new members will see through Sir Winston Churchill’s vision for New Zealanders,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“I would like to thank the outgoing Chair Rachael Selby, and members Margy-Jean Malcolm, Graeme Hall, Professor Helen Nicholson and Mary Schnackenberg for their contribution to the Board during their terms.”

The Board of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust is appointed by the Governor-General.
