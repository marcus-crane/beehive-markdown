New legislation will help give Canterbury property owners more certainty about where their property boundaries are, Minister for Land Information Louise Upston announced today.

“Due to the effect of earthquake-related ground movement on property boundaries in parts of Canterbury, it is difficult to accurately locate some legal boundaries. 

“I have introduced new legislation to provide certainty that legal boundaries have shifted with the land. This approach will ensure that legal ownership continues to reflect the reality on the ground,” Ms Upston says. 

“Under the new legislation, which had unanimous support at its first reading, surveys undertaken in Canterbury must take ground movement into account. However, all surveys undertaken between the earthquakes and when new legislation comes into effect will be validated – giving further certainty to surveyors and property owners.” 

Ground movement caused by the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes caused the ground surface in some parts of Christchurch and Waimakariri to shift. Houses, fences, and boundary pegs that sit on this land moved as well, making it difficult to accurately determine property boundaries.

“We want Cantabrians to be able to rebuild their homes with confidence and the knowledge that their property rights are protected by the state guarantee of title,” says Ms Upston.
