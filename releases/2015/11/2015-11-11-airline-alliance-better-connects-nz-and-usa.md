Transport Minister Simon Bridges today announced he has authorised an alliance between Qantas and American Airlines, which is expected to result in lower fares and more choice for passengers travelling between New Zealand and the USA.

The alliance has enabled Qantas and American Airlines to create a new direct service between Los Angeles and Auckland, which will start in June 2016.

“This new service will give more choice and lower fares for travellers on the Auckland-Los Angeles route. Los Angeles is New Zealand’s main gateway to the United States. This new service will help make Los Angeles and the wider United States more affordable and accessible for Kiwi travellers.

“The alliance means passengers can now book a single ticket for connecting flights from New Zealand centres, serviced by Jetstar, to dozens of American Airlines’ destinations throughout North America.

“Given American Airlines’ extensive domestic network in the United States, the alliance also means New Zealand will be a more attractive destination for Americans than ever before,” says Mr Bridges.

The alliance follows a recent announcement from United Airlines, which will start a direct service between San Francisco and Auckland in July 2016.

“It’s great to see airlines responding to the strong demand for travel between New Zealand and the USA. The increased competition can only be good news for consumers.

“The new services will bring more North American visitors to New Zealand. The USA is New Zealand’s third largest tourism market. So far this year, more than 230,000 US visitors travelled to New Zealand — an increase of 11.1 per cent over 2014,” says Mr Bridges.
