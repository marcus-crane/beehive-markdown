Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced the Nature Heritage Fund is investing $235,000 to purchase 124 hectares of forested karst landscape on the western flank of the Abel Tasman National Park.

“This block of land, known as ‘Lindsay’s Block’, borders Abel Tasman National Park on two sides, so it will become an integral part of the district’s protected forest system,” Ms Wagner says.

“This area is located 10km south-east of Takaka, and is one of the few intact examples of original forest on karst landscape remaining in the district. The block contains rimu, miro, matai and Hall’s totara. Striking marble karst outcrops and marble cliffs are a key feature of the landscape.

“Lindsay’s Block has significant biodiversity value, with diverse vegetation, abundant birds and significant invertebrate populations.

“Particularly interesting is the at risk shrub, melicytus obovatus, and the amber snail, Powelliphanta hochstetteri, which is endemic to the Nelson/Marlborough region.

“The 124 hectare block will be managed by the Department of Conservation as scenic reserve, with the intention of adding it to the Abel Tasman National Park.

“The Rameka Track, a nationally renowned mountain bike route, runs adjacent to the northern part of this block providing an important link to the National Park from the Takaka Valley.

“I am delighted that this addition will help protect important natural heritage and allow New Zealanders easier access into the Abel Tasman National Park,” Ms Wagner says.

The Nature Heritage Fund was established to help private landowners, local government, community groups and others protect valuable ecosystems.
