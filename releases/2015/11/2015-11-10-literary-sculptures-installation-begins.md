Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner has welcomed the addition of a literary trail to Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct.

The installation of the first literary panels has begun at The Terraces, a key attraction of the precinct. The panels display excerpts from works by prominent authors Apirana Taylor, John Deans, Wiremu Te Uki and David Eggleton.

“The words are etched onto the steps that lead down to the river’s edge, celebrating both the Ōtākaro/Avon River and Christchurch’s rich literary history,” Ms Wagner says.

“These are the first works in a series of literary sculptures that will be installed down the length of Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct’s promenade.

“Each of the panels will be located at sites relevant to their texts, for example, poems which refer to particular locations will appear in their vicinity and Ngāi Tahu texts will appear at culturally significant sites.

“Each work will reflect the key values of the precinct and add to its distinctive identity. The panels are a welcome sight along the River,” Ms Wagner says.

Ngāi Tahu artist Neil Pardington has developed the series of literary sculptures which incorporate excerpts from Christchurch literature. The quotes themselves were selected by the literary panel chaired by Marianne Hargreaves, the ‎Executive Director of the Christchurch Writers' Festival.
