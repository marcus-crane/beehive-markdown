Prime Minister John Key has condemned the attacks in Paris and expressed condolences to the people and government of France.

"Details are still emerging but the coordinated attacks are shocking," says Mr Key.

"Our hearts go out to those involved and our thoughts with them and their families.

"New Zealand stands with France in the global fight against terror and while it is too soon to attribute blame, the attacks have targeted innocent civilians and are therefore an act of terrorism.

"French authorities have not yet released the nationalities of any of the victims but consular officials in Paris and New Zealand are working to determine if any New Zealanders have been caught up," says Mr Key.
