Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sadness at the unexpected passing of All Black legend Jonah Lomu. 

“Jonah Lomu was an inspirational athlete who was generally regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby union,” Mr Key says. 

“He was the rare combination of size, speed and power, and was a game changer whenever he stepped onto the field.”  

Jonah remains the youngest All Black ever when he debuted in 1994 at the age of just 19. He went on to make 63 Test appearances, scoring a total of 37 Test tries in the All Blacks jersey.

In 2007 he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame and in 2011 the IRB Hall of Fame.  He was made a member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2007 for his services to rugby.

“Jonah was not only a great ambassador for rugby union, he was a great ambassador for New Zealand, and he made a significant contribution to the community through his support of numerous charities,” Mr Key says. 

“I caught up with Jonah and his wife Nadene a few weeks ago in London during his Unstoppable charity tour. He was in great spirits and moved the audience with stories from his childhood, through to his time as an All Black and the illness which ultimately ended his rugby career.  

“On behalf of all New Zealanders, I thank Jonah for his contribution to New Zealand. 

“My thoughts are with Nadene and his family at this time.”
