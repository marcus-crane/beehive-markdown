Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has welcomed today’s announcement by Air New Zealand that it will fly direct between Auckland and Ho Chi Minh City.

The service will begin in 2016, flying three times a week on a seasonal basis between June and October.

“Air New Zealand is the first carrier to fly direct from Auckland to Viet Nam, and the service will give greater choice and lower fares for New Zealand passengers flying to this major South East Asian centre,” Mr Key says.

“More than 15,000 New Zealanders already travel to Vietnam each year and this new service is likely to increase those numbers significantly.

“It will also help build bilateral links between New Zealand and Viet Nam, and promote not only tourism but also trade, exports, and business links for the benefit of both countries.

“Currently over 3000 visitors from Viet Nam visit New Zealand each year, and this new service will hopefully encourage more visitors to come.”
