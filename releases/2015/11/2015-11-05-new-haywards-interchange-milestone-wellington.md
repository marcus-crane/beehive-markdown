Transport Minister Simon Bridges says the start of construction of the Haywards Interchange project is an important milestone for the Wellington region.

Mr Bridges joined Upper Hutt Mayor Wayne Guppy and NZ Transport Agency officials to turn the first sod to mark the start of construction for the $43 million interchange, which will separate State Highway traffic from local traffic at the intersection of State Highway 2 and State Highway 58.

“This intersection is a bottleneck that has been a source of frustration for motorists, and it’s also seen a number of crashes. The interchange will help to make those concerns a thing of the past, and relief is just two years away.

“This project is a significant piece of transport infrastructure for the Hutt Valley that will create work for up to 800 contractors and suppliers.

“By elevating State Highway 2, the interchange will help traffic to flow more smoothly while also reducing the risk of crashes.

“Once completed in 2017, the interchange will improve economic productivity by streamlining journeys, making it easier and more efficient for local businesses and commuters to get around,” Mr Bridges says.

“The project will also make travel easier and safer for people who walk, cycle and take the train, through the provision of separate cycle paths, a new Park and Ride facility, and a pedestrian bridge to the railways station.

Mr Bridges says Hutt Valley is benefitting from a sizeable increase in Government investment aimed at improving Wellington’s transport system.

“The wider package of work includes the proposed Petone to Grenada Link Road, the proposed Wellington to Hutt Valley cycle link, the Upper Hutt station upgrade, the new Matangi trains, the Petone Park and Ride, safety improvements to State Highway 58 and the Rimutaka Hill Road, and future improvements to the State Highway 2 corridor.
