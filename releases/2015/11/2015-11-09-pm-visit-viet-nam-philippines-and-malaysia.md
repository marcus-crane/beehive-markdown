Prime Minister John Key will travel to Viet Nam, the Philippines and Malaysia for a series of meetings aimed at boosting New Zealand’s trade, political and security links in the region.

Mr Key will lead a trade delegation to Viet Nam and attend the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur and the APEC leader’s meeting in Manila.

“The Asia-Pacific region is a significant driver of global economic growth with massive demand for New Zealand products - around 70 percent of our total trade now takes place with APEC economies alone,” Mr Key says.

“It is important we continue to build on those ties and create new opportunities to further diversify and strengthen our economy for the benefit of all New Zealanders.”

APEC will this year focus on inclusive and sustainable growth, looking in particular at the issues faced by small and medium enterprises, as well as trade in services.

Mr Key will meet with other APEC political leaders and address the APEC CEO Summit, which will be attended by 700 CEOs from across the region. 

In Kuala Lumpur Mr Key will attend the East Asia Summit which will focus on regional political, security and economic issues, as well as the ASEAN-NZ Summit commemorating the 40th anniversary of our relationship with ASEAN – our fourth-largest trading partner.

In Hanoi Mr Key will meet with Viet Nam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and other Ministers, and attend a number of events focused on boosting two-way trade.  

“Viet Nam is New Zealand’s fastest-growing export market in South East Asia, with two-way trade now worth over $1 billion a year and we have committed to doubling that by 2020.

“New Zealand has a lot to offer Viet Nam and its people and this visit will be an opportunity to further explore new trade and investment opportunities which offer huge potential to both countries.”

Mr Key will be accompanied to Hanoi by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and a New Zealand business delegation, with the focus on the aviation and education sectors.

Mr Key will be in Hanoi from November 14 – 17, in Manila from November 17 – 20, and in Kuala Lumpur from November 20 - 22.
