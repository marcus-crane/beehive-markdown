The Minister Responsible for Housing New Zealand, Bill English, along with Social Housing Minister, Paula Bennett, are welcoming news that the massive programme to repair 5000 earthquake-damaged social housing stock in Christchurch has been reached ahead of schedule.

The 2010 and 2011 earthquakes damaged 95 percent of Housing New Zealand’s properties, affecting about 20,000 tenants across greater Christchurch.

 Mr English says the completion of the 5000th repair, several weeks ahead of schedule, is a significant milestone in the city’s ongoing rebuild and recovery.

“Not only have the repairs been completed ahead of time, but our tenants can now enjoy houses in better condition than they were before the earthquakes.”

Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says the milestone is an important one for both Canterbury tenants and Housing New Zealand staff.

“The people of Canterbury faced an immense task to rebuild following the devastating earthquakes, especially the most vulnerable,” she says.

“I want to thank the team at Housing New Zealand who did an outstanding job working with so many different Government agencies and contractors to lead the rebuild of its portfolio.

“Throughout the process they never failed to put the tenants and their often very challenging needs first, and this achievement is testament to their dedication.”

Mr English visited the 5000th repair today and met with the tenant, whose house has been repainted and had new carpets and ventilation installed.

“While the Canterbury earthquakes were obviously devastating for many people, consequent repairs to social housing means we now have thousands of tenants living in arguably the most modernised social housing portfolio in the country.’

“In order to improve the lives and living standards of our customers in Christchurch, Housing New Zealand is spending about $150 million on repairs to the homes they currently occupy, as well as $200 million on building 700 new homes.

“300 of those are finished and the rest are either under construction or under contract to be completed early next year, returning the numbers of Housing New Zealand homes to pre-earthquake levels,” he says.
