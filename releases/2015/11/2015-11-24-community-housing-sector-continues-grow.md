Vulnerable New Zealanders are benefiting from continued growth in the community housing sector, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The number of social housing tenancies with registered Community Housing Providers (CHPs) has now surpassed 300. CHPs have been eligible to house tenants with the Government’s Income Related Rent Subsidy since April 2014.

“A growing community housing sector is fantastic news because it means more vulnerable New Zealanders can be supported by local organisations who often work with tenants with particular and complicated needs,” says Mrs Bennett.

“At the end of October 2015 there were 310 CHP tenancies, a 58 per cent increase in the nine months since January. These providers are housing over 550 people right across New Zealand.

“Just last week, three applicants from the Social Housing Register were placed into social housing with a CHP, and I’m always pleased when I see this number grow.

“The Government is committed to carefully growing a more diverse social housing sector because we want to house more New Zealanders in homes that better suit their needs, and where possible with providers who supply support services to tenants.

“There are a number of dedicated and innovative community organisations that are telling us they want to play a bigger role in social housing.

“We are committed to working with the community sector and enabling it to grow sustainably.”
