Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says health providers have shown strong interest in the development of the new Local Mobility Action Teams.

The Government invested $6 million in Budget 2015 to create community based, multi-disciplinary early intervention teams for the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions like arthritis.

“Nearly 50 providers have come forward with proposals for the development and delivery of the new Local Mobility Action Teams,” says Dr Coleman.

“It’s great to see such a strong response from across the sector including DHBs, physiotherapy practices and public/private collaborations.

“As part of the next step, the Ministry of Health and the Expert Advisory Group, led by rheumatologist Dr Peter Jones and Associate Professor Peter Larmer, will work with nine providers to submit more detailed proposals.

“I look forward to seeing the first of the Local Mobility Action Teams, led by local clinical champions, get underway early next year. There will be further opportunities for proposals to be made for future Teams in early 2016.

“These Teams will make a real difference to patients and their families. There are many people with arthritis where early intervention in a community setting is appropriate.

“This is also about delivering to local communities to meet their specific needs, so we expect to see a variety of solutions across the country.”

The Local Mobility Action Teams will provide a range of services in the community such as physiotherapy, exercise programmes, dietary advice, and self-management support.
