Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a major upgrade of the Otahuhu Station will provide better bus and rail connections to support the roll-out of a new public transport network for south Auckland.

The Government is contributing $12m towards the facility which will link the existing Otahuhu train station platform with two new bus platforms and a terminal building.

Mr Bridges was joined by Auckland Mayor Len Brown, Auckland Transport and NZ Transport Agency officials to turn the first sod to mark the start of construction.

“This significant contribution shows the Government’s ongoing commitment to grow public transport options for all Aucklanders to help address the city’s transport challenges.”

“The new facility will support the growth and regeneration of the Otahuhu area by providing access to high quality public transport services for the public and for employers and employees working in the area,” says Mr Bridges.

“There will be better connectivity between the bus and rail networks with covered platforms providing safe transfer routes. There will also be improved facilities for cyclists with a shared path, separated cycle crossing and cycle storage racks.”

The project is expected to be completed and open to passengers by the second half of next year.
