Corrections is piloting a new programme aimed at stopping repeat drink-drive offending, says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

Corrections has obtained Justice Sector funding for the pilot programme in which it will fund alcohol interlock devices which immobilise a vehicle if alcohol is detected on the breath of the driver.

“This funding will help offenders keep to their sentences. It means offenders will not be able to drive their vehicle unless they can successfully pass a breath alcohol test,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Cost will no longer be a barrier to offenders using this technology to help them stop drinking and driving.”

International evidence shows the use of alcohol ignition interlocks results in a reduction of 64-70 per cent recidivism for alcohol-impaired driving.

Eligible repeat offenders who have an interlock device will also have the chance to shorten their licence disqualification period. Corrections aims to have at least 100 offenders on the pilot programme this financial year.

Corrections has also rolled out a nationwide programme of brief drink-drive interventions, also funded by the Justice Sector fund, until June next year.

About 1310 offenders across 15 probation districts are expected to take part in the programme which includes advice, education and in some cases referrals for treatment.

“Alcohol abuse is a major driver of crime. Two-thirds of prisoners have substance abuse problems and more than half of crimes are committed by people under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Often this is a major factor in their reoffending,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Our government is committed to reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017. Breaking the link between substance abuse and offending is crucial.”
