Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says New Zealand will next week host 25 Asia-Pacific countries in Wellington that are taking part in a major security related exercise.

Exercise Maru, which is a desktop exercise, aims to improve capability to stop the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by testing countries’ counter-proliferation systems and capabilities.

“It’s an honour for New Zealand to host this important event, and we’re delighted many of our partners are participating, including the USA, Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea,” Ms Wagner says.

“While New Zealand is not viewed as being at high risk, it could be seen as a potential transit point, or a place to send chemicals, technology, and components to be put together before sending them on to do harm elsewhere.

“The exercise is being hosted by the New Zealand Customs Service, and involves several government agencies, including the Defence Force, New Zealand Fire Service, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

“Exercise Maru is a great opportunity for countries to further discuss and learn how we can all work together to be prepared for an event involving the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction in our region,” Ms Wagner says.

Exercise Maru, which runs from 17-19 November, is the second Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercise in the Asia Pacific Exercise Rotation (APER) programme.

The APER programme seeks to maintain regular counter-proliferation activities within the region to improve countries’ capabilities. The programme began last year with Exercise Fortune Guard, hosted in Hawaii.
