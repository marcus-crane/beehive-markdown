Successful Māori companies representing New Zealand’s $1.3 billion seafood export industry will be on display at the China Fisheries and Seafood Expo in Qingdao today.

The companies are a part of a trade delegation led by Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell.

He says some of New Zealand’s largest Māori fisheries companies are participating in the seafood expo.

“I am honoured to be here to support the Māori exhibitors and all of the New Zealand companies attending the seafood expo in Qingdao. Many of our seafood companies are already exporting to China with great success.”

“Events such as these are a great way to grow and deepen our cultural-commercial connections and show the unique value that Māori businesses offer,” says Mr Flavell.

"What is clear to me is the importance of finding ways to create a single point of entry for Māori in the seafood industry exporting to China, in order to grow our collective impact.  I am keen to explore this more and support greater collaboration."

Nationwide, fisheries resources provide significant economic, social and cultural benefits to New Zealand. 

The industry has grown from being a predominantly domestic supplier to one of the nation’s leading export industries since 1970s. 

More than 90% of all fish landed are exported.

To protect this valuable resource, Māori fisheries companies harvest the resource sustainably and base business decisions on the impact they have on the New Zealand environment for current and future generations.

The delegates on the mission who are exhibiting at the seafood expo manage 40 percent of all fish quota in Aotearoa.

Aotearoa Fisheries is one of our largest fishery companies which is 100 percent owned by 57 iwi and 50 percent shareholder of Sealord.

Ngāti Porou Seafoods, Ngāi Tahu Seafood and Waitangi Seafoods are all locally owned and operated iwi companies.

“To unlock the latent potential of our assets, we aim to grow more Māori companies of international scale across a range of industries, develop more commercial leaders, and mobilise more capital and partners,” said Mr Flavell.

The trade delegation will continue to meet government and commercial leaders in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong before returning to Aotearoa on Sunday 8 November.
