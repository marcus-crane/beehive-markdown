Five district councils and three city councils have been invited to demonstrate they can meet the government’s requirements for an online voting trial. If successful, the councils will be able to offer online voting alongside postal voting in the local government elections next year.

Whanganui, Rotorua, Matamata Piako, Selwyn and Masterton districts have confirmed their interest as well as Porirua, Palmerston North and Wellington cities.

“The councils must meet a strict set of requirements before they can offer online voting,” says Associate Local Government Minister Louise Upston. “They need to show they will manage the risks – notably issues of security and fairness – and they must preserve public confidence in the integrity of the electoral system.”

Ms Upston says the onus is on the councils to make online voting work. “Once we have confidence in their ability to meet these requirements, Cabinet will allow the online voting trial to take place.”

“I look forward to the eight councils reporting back to me in early 2016 on how they will meet the government’s requirements.”

The costs of the new voting method will be met by the councils themselves. Many councils already contract specialist companies to process and count postal votes and are likely to do the same for online voting.

Details of the voting framework and an updated version of the government’s trial requirements will be on the Department of Internal Affairs’ [website](http://www.dia.govt.nz/online-voting).
