Kiwis are being encouraged to act responsibly and take care when using fireworks this year, with sales permitted from today until Guy Fawkes Day on Thursday 5 November.

“Fireworks can be fun and enjoyable but this requires people to follow the rules, take safety precautions and be considerate of bystanders, neighbours and animals,” Dr Smith says.

“There are a number of agencies working together to ensure the fireworks that are available for sale are safe and that the rules for selling them are followed. The greatest risk of harm is when the rules and instructions around fireworks are ignored.”

The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) regulates the importing of fireworks under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act and issues approvals to import fireworks. WorkSafe New Zealand is responsible for enforcing the fireworks rules in retail shops, warehouses and other places of work, and the New Zealand Fire Service, Police and emergency services work to spread safety messages and minimise harm from firework-related call outs.

“The number of Fire Service callouts and fireworks-related injuries have reduced significantly since tighter rules were introduced by the Government seven years ago. The legal period of sale was reduced to four days, the age of purchase was increased from 14 to 18, and the power and size of retail packages were restricted. I would consider further tightening the rules if there is a significant increase in problems. I will be monitoring the management of fireworks this week and urge users to take every care so as to ensure the safety of people, property and animals,” Dr Smith says.
