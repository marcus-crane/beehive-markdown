Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming progress on the Low Volume Vehicle (LVV) certification review, with some changes already underway.

“This review is about making the certification process for scratch-built or modified vehicles more responsive to innovation, while ensuring it is run as effectively and transparently as possible,” Mr Foss says.

As part of the review, the NZ Transport Agency commissioned an independent survey of LVV system users. 

“The survey identified areas of improvement and, while the review is ongoing, short-term changes are already being made,” Mr Foss says.

“For example, improvements will be made to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) process and its governance, including an enhanced role for the Transport Agency.”

The TAC process is for those using innovative new approaches or materials and for specialist enquiries.

The Transport Agency will also improve the clarity of guidelines used by LVV certifiers and develop tailored certification processes that reflect the risk of different types of modifications. 

“I’m keen to ensure our LVV certification system enables innovators to utilise new technologies and create opportunities, particularly around exports,” Mr Foss says.

“I look forward to further changes as the review progresses.”
