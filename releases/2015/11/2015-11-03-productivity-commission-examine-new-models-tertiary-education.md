Finance Minister Bill English and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce have asked the Productivity Commission to review new and emerging models of tertiary education.

“The tertiary education sector has adapted to significant change over the past 20 years and is continuing to change all the time,” says Mr English.

“We have asked the Productivity Commission to consider how changes, in technology, costs, and internationalisation, might change the way we fund, organise and deliver tertiary education and training in the future.”

The inquiry will look across the tertiary system including universities, polytechnics and wānanga as well as work-based training and private tertiary providers.

Mr Joyce said the current *Tertiary Education Strategy* encourages a shift to a more outward facing system, with strong links to industry, community and the global economy.

”It also signals a need to think more about how we will deliver the results we will need in the future, how we will manage further change, and  how we will identify new and emerging opportunities,” Mr Joyce says.

“Last year’s *Innovations in Tertiary Education Delivery Summit* showed that rapid technological development is leading to new tertiary education models worldwide.  While there is already significant innovation in the New Zealand tertiary education sector, there is high interest from the sector in a continued focus on future changes.”

“The Productivity Commission brings a fresh perspective and is well placed to draw on the considerable expertise within our tertiary education sector, from employers and communities, and international experience,” Mr Joyce says. 

“Tertiary education contributes to improving New Zealand’s economic outcomes by giving students the skills and qualifications to get good jobs, and to be part of an innovative and successful New Zealand.”

The Commission will report back in February 2017.
