Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has released a summary of the submissions made on the exposure draft of Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill.

More than 1200 people attended the 23 consultation hui held around the country in June 2015, and almost 400 written submissions were received.

“I’m grateful to the people who took the time and made the effort to either attend one of the consultation hui or to make a submission. I value all of the contributions people have made to this reform,” says Mr Flavell.

The summary of submissions is available online at [www.tpk.govt.nz](http://www.tpk.govt.nz)

Mr Flavell says significant changes were made to the draft Ture Whenua Māori Bill in response to the submissions and feedback received.

“As a result of the consultation, some proposals have been removed and others have been modified. These [changes](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/significant-changes-made-draft-te-ture-whenua-m%C4%81ori-bill-0) were signed off by Cabinet earlier this month and a revised bill is being drafted.”

The Ture Whenua Māori Bill will be introduced into Parliament next year.
