Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new expert panel will provide advice to the Ministry of Health on palliative care services for adults.

“Palliative care is a priority for the Government and we are keen to ensure high quality and well-coordinated care is available to all who need it,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why the Government invested an extra $76.1 million into hospice sustainability and palliative care services in aged residential care, primary care and community care.

“The funding boost will help expand community palliative care services so they can better support terminally ill people at home and in aged-care facilities. It will also go towards the recruitment of up to 60 new nurse specialists, palliative care educators and other roles at hospices.

“We recognise the need for systematic clinician and consumer input to ensure the development of first-class palliative care. To help achieve this, the Ministry of Health is leading a major quality improvement work programme.”

The new Palliative Care Advisory Panel (PCAP) will support the implementation of the palliative care work programme at a critical time, including the current Review of Adult Palliative Care Services and advice the Ministry on key issues such as equity of access and quality of care.

The 11 member panel was selected following an Expressions of Interest process and has a wide range of sector expertise. Including representation from the aged care, consumer, DHB, hospice, and research sectors.

The PCAP will be chaired by Professor Merryn Gott and will hold its first meeting in December 2015.
