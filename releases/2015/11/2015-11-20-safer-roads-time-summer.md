Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming the completion of important safety work on state highways 6 and 94 between Queenstown and Milford Sound.

NZ Transport Agency contractors have completed more than 50 kilometres of rumble strips in the area as part of the Visiting Driver Signature Project (VDSP) — a partnership between central government, local government and the private sector.

In addition to the rumble strips, yellow and white centrelines have also been re-sprayed. 

“The Government is committed to improving safety for all road users, including the increasing number of visitors choosing to explore our country by car or campervan,” Mr Foss says.

“It’s great to have these additional safety measures in place ahead of the peak summer season.”

There are now 175 kilometres of both centre and edge line rumble strips in Otago and Southland.

The VDSP, which was expanded earlier this year to include the West Coast, is part of the Government’s $3.2 billion road safety investment over the next three years.
