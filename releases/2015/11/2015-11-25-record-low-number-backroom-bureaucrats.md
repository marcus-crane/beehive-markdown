Ongoing restraint in the public sector and a focus on better frontline services has seen a further reduction in the number of core Government employees, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

The June 2015 update of the Core Government Administration shows 35,632 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff, a reduction of 474 from December 2014. This latest result is 843 under the cap set by the Government in 2012, and the lowest since it was introduced. 

“This Government has made it a focus to cut unnecessary bureaucracy and waste and target expenditure where it will deliver measurable results,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Ministers have set clear expectations for their Chief Executives that departments and agencies must be innovative and find better ways of delivering the outstanding public services that hardworking New Zealanders pay for.

“While previous Governments measured success based on how much they spent or how many bureaucrats they employed, we are more interested in putting resources where they are needed the most and will be the most effective. This means more frontline staff like teachers, doctors, police officers and nurses.”

Back office staff numbers climbed by close to 10,000 to over 45,000 under the previous Government. The cap on Core Government Administration staff was first introduced by this Government in 2009, and reset at the current lower level in 2012.

“It’s a testament to the dedication, innovation and drive of so many public sector workers that we are seeing historic results in so many areas, from lower crime rates through to educational achievement and job growth,” Mrs Bennett says.
