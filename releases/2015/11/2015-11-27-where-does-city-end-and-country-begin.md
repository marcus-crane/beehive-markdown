New Zealanders who want to understand the similarities or differences between Sandringham and Three Kings, Brooklyn and Vogeltown, or Sydhenham and Beckenham can have their say about how these areas and more are defined for statistical purposes, Statistics Minister Craig Foss says.

Statistics New Zealand is reviewing its Statistical Standard for Geographic Areas (SSGA) for the first time in over 20 years.  The review aims to improve how statistical geographies are defined and used in statistical data.

“We might intuitively think we know whether we’re in the city or country, but it’s not that clear in some areas, including lifestyle blocks, new developments and farmland,” Mr Foss says.

“Statistical geographies have become outdated. The increasing demand for small area statistics and advancements in geographic information system (GIS) technologies is driving the need to ensure data is accessible and meaningful to the people who use it.

“Everything happens somewhere, so the ability to locate data through meaningful geographical locations is critical to a range of organisations and businesses, from health providers to emergency services.

“An up-to-date statistical standard will ensure data remains relevant and easy to understand. I encourage anyone who uses statistical data to make a submission.”

Submissions close Monday 14 December 2015.
