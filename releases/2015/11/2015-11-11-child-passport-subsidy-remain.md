Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne has announced that the present subsidy for children’s passports will continue with the move to 10-year passports.

From 30 November the price of all standard adult passports issued in New Zealand will be $180 and child passports will be $105 (including GST). That is a 42 per cent subsidy from the adult fee, the same as currently in place for a five-year passport.

The fee for a standard 10-year adult passport will be around $90 cheaper than the fee for two five-year passports.

Mr Dunne also announced that the online passport service in 2016 will expand to include renewal of child passports and first time adult passport applications.

“Today’s announcement of the final details of our 10-year passport represents the Government’s response to what New Zealanders’  wanted while  balancing security risks and the need to make travel easy and affordable. All parties in parliament cooperated to bring this change about as soon as possible, and government agencies, particularly the Department of Internal Affairs have worked assiduously to deliver this common sense change.

“Our passport service is highly regarded, as reflected in the recent Kiwis Counts survey of people's satisfaction with government services, and our passports are among the most secure and trusted in the world. All passport fees go towards providing passports to New Zealanders.

They can’t be spent on anything else. I’m pleased to say, we’ve managed to strike the balance between continuing to develop our world-class passport service and keeping travel affordable for New Zealanders”, Mr Dunne said.
