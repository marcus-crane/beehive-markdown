The first meeting of the Pay Equity Working Group is an important milestone in the work to deal with equal pay claims, Ministers Paula Bennett and Michael Woodhouse say.

Ministers announced the formation of the Group in October to develop principles for dealing with claims of pay equity under the Equal Pay Act.

“Pay equity is a serious issue, and I am very pleased that representatives of employers, unions and Government agencies are getting together to discuss how progress can be made,” State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

“The group will give Ministers recommendations on how to achieve pay equity consistent with New Zealand’s employment relations framework and a well-functioning labour market,” says Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse.

Dame Patsy Reddy has been appointed as the Group’s facilitator.

“Dame Patsy is experienced at leading and facilitating complex review processes, and I’m sure the Joint Working Group will benefit from the perspective she will bring,” Mrs Bennett says.

Employer groups are being led by Phil O’Reilly from Business NZ. Union representatives are being led by former Council of Trade Unions President Helen Kelly. Government Chief Talent Officer Andrew Hampton will lead the Government agency representatives.

Unions have agreed to put on hold their legal action until March 2016 to allow the Joint Working Group to proceed.

Recommendations to Ministers are expected by the end of March 2016 and some may need to be included in legislation, if accepted by the Government.

The Joint Working Group agreed on Terms of Reference that will guide its work. These are available on the State Services Commission’s website http://www.ssc.govt.nz/pay-equity-working-group-terms-reference.
