Youth Minister Nikki Kaye has announced $150,000 in funding over the next three years for RainbowYOUTH to develop and increase support services for LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex) young people.

“LGBTI young people are five times more likely than other young people to attempt suicide or deliberately self-harm. They are also more likely to be bullied, physically harmed or afraid that someone may hurt them,” says Ms Kaye.

“Consultation with the LGBTI community identified a number of shared objectives and ways that government agencies can better support LGBTI young people to reach their potential.

“I have also released the document *Supporting LGBTI Young People in New Zealand*. This has been contributed to by a range of government agencies, and outlines some of the work now underway to better support LGBTI young people in New Zealand.

“The report is the first part of the response to conversations with the community and issues raised by them. This is only the start. There is more work to do.

“The Government has already taken steps to ensure vulnerable LGBTI young people receive the right services and support at the right time.

“In 2014, 23 organisations received $60,000 under a first round of small grants funding. The support provided by these organisations has included everything from counselling and online help resources, to safe spaces for young people to meet.

“In February 2015, I announced a second round of small grants funding, worth $85,000. This has supported a further 24 projects.

“Last month at Parliament, I was also pleased to launch *Inside Out*, a video and teaching resource developed by RainbowYOUTH, CORE Education and Curative, which aims to raise general awareness and understanding of the experiences of LGBTI young people.

“The $150,000 for RainbowYOUTH will help them deliver more services for LGBTI young people across New Zealand. It will also enable them to further strengthen LGBTI groups around the country, through training, mentoring and educational resources.

“This is a significant step as it’s the first Government long-term contract with RainbowYOUTH. They’ve developed a group of people with strong capabilities, and are well positioned to continue their valuable work, support the development of new initiatives and help upskill other organisations.”
