Opportunities for more investment, more jobs and better incomes for the West Coast will be the focus of a comprehensive economic study announced today by Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

The West Coast will be the fifth region to benefit from a Government-funded regional economic growth study, which is supported by Ministers and Ministries covering the economic development, primary industries, tertiary education, skills and employment, transport, communications, social development, Maori development, local government, tourism and small business portfolios.

“Studies have now been successfully completed in Northland, Bay of Plenty, East Coast and Manawātu-Whanganui, and each one has identified new investment opportunities not only for the people and businesses of each region, but for New Zealand as a whole,” Mr Joyce says.

The studies are part of the Regional Growth Programme, jointly led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry for Primary Industries, in partnership with businesses, councils and iwi/Māori in each region.

As each study is completed, the regional leaders, with the support of central and local government agencies, use it to develop and implement a regional action plan with one primary aim; to attract more investment and additional jobs to each region.

Mr Guy says the West Coast study will consider ways to bolster existing industries, and look at new opportunities.

“The West Coast is blessed with fertile land, stunning scenery, and a proud population with a strong commitment to their region. I’m keen to see that potential turn into dividends for Coasters, and the rest of New Zealand through innovative thinking.”

“The West Coast already has a well-established primary sector and I’m sure this study will highlight further opportunities for growth in agriculture, forestry and fishing.”

Mr Joyce says mining and dairy have been traditional industries, and while tourism continues to grow, it is seasonal. 

“Diversification is going to be the key for the West Coast, and this study will help identify the opportunities for competitive new industries, and help remove the roadblocks that may prevent them from developing.

It’s already clear that the region has the advantage of strong, dedicated leadership amongst its businesses, local council and local iwi.  The Regional Economic Ministers team looks forward to further stepping up our engagement with the region through this growth programme.”
