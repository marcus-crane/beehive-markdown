Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee says off-shore patrol vessel HMNZS Otago will leave Dunedin for the Southern Ocean on Thursday, to monitor fishing activity.

“This patrol is in support of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has oversight of Southern Ocean fisheries.

“Our goal is to ensure the fishery is well managed and sustainable.

“New Zealand has a strong commitment to conservation in the Southern Ocean and our Navy, along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) officials and Ministry of Primary Industry (MPI) officers are proud to help support that commitment.

“This multiagency deployment complements New Zealand’s range of work with international partners to stamp out illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Southern Ocean.

“While in the Southern Ocean MPI officers will be carrying out compliance checks on licensed fishing vessels, as well as monitoring for IUU activity.

“New Zealand has been conducting maritime surveillance in the Southern Ocean since the late 1990s, and HMNZS Otago is fully prepared for work in these difficult waters.

“Complementing the Otago will be aerial patrols by a P3K-2 Orion,” Mr Brownlee says.

The licensed CCAMLR fishing season in the Ross Sea region south of New Zealand starts 1 December 2015 and continues until the agreed limits are reached (usually in January or early February).
