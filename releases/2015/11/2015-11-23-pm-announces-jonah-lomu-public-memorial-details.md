Prime Minister John Key has announced details of the public memorial for Jonah Lomu.

A public service will be held on Monday 30 November from 1pm to 3pm at Eden Park in Auckland.

“Jonah touched people’s lives across the country and around the world,” says Mr Key.

“This service will be open to all members of the public who want to remember the significant contribution Jonah made, not only to rugby here and overseas, but also to the wider community through his work with charities such as UNICEF and Kidney Kids NZ.

“The service will be a celebration of Jonah’s life and I expect a large number of people will want to be there.”

In addition there will be special ‘Aho Faka Famili’ (Day of the Family) event allowing Pasifika to pay their respects in their traditional way.  This will be held at the Vodafone Events Centre on Saturday 28 November from 12pm.

A private funeral for Jonah will be held on Tuesday 1 December.

Lomu family spokesperson John Hart says family members were grateful to the Government for their support.
