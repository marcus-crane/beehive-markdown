Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce has today signed a new agreement between New Zealand and Viet Nam which will support Viet Nam’s rapidly growing aviation sector and create new opportunities for New Zealand businesses.

Steven Joyce and Viet Nam Minister of Transport, H.E. Dinh La Thang signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Aviation Cooperation that allows for information-sharing and regular meetings to expand aviation partnerships between both countries.  

The signing was witnessed by Prime Minister John Key and his Viet Nam counterpart, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung following a meeting in Hanoi.

“Over the past two years New Zealand and Viet Nam have undertaken joint agreements to expand air services between our two countries, and this new MOU will promote cooperation right across our aviation industries,” Mr Joyce says.

“The MOU comes at a time of rapid growth for Viet Nam’s aviation industry. Viet Nam’s international aviation passenger numbers are the third fastest-growing in the world at 14 per cent a year, and are expected to increase from 32 million in 2015 to 63 million in 2020.

“This growth means airlines operating in Viet Nam are looking to invest in new commercial aircraft, which creates a major need for pilot training, infrastructure and aviation-related goods and services. New Zealand aviation companies are already active in Viet Nam and our industry’s reputation for quality and innovation across the aviation industry makes us well-placed to increase engagement,” Mr Joyce says.

The MOU will focus cooperation on seven areas:

- Civil aviation infrastructure
- Air Transport
- Training
- Air navigation
- Environment and sustainable biofuels
- Aeronautical industry
- Consultancy and advisory services

Government representatives of both countries will meet at least every two years to review progress.

“This MOU shows the Vietnamese Government that we want to work with them at both a government and business level to deepen and expand cooperation between our aviation sectors,” Mr Joyce says.
