Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming an Automobile Association (AA) initiative to help visiting drivers keep themselves and others safe on New Zealand roads.

The AA launched its Visiting Drivers Training Programme — an online driving simulator — at Parliament today.

“This programme puts visitors in the driver’s seat of a car and asks them questions about New Zealand road rules and conditions. It will help inform visiting drivers, improve safety and save lives,” Mr Foss says.

The programme is free; however, users are given the option of paying $10 for a certificate that entitles them to discounted rates at rental vehicle firms Thrifty and Europcar.

The AA is part of the Safer Journeys Visiting Drivers Signature Project (VDSP) — a partnership between central government, local government and the private sector.

“The Visiting Drivers Training Programme builds on a number of recently announced initiatives, both Government and industry-led, promoting safe driving messages to international visitors at all stages of their holiday — planning, booking, in-flight, on arrival and on our roads,” Mr Foss says.

“Together, these numerous small actions create a safer system for all road users, including the increasing number of overseas visitors choosing to explore our country by car,” Mr Foss says.

The Visiting Drivers Training Programme is available on the AA website and will be promoted overseas.
