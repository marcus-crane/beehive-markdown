Rare native birds and threatened wetlands in Fiordland National Park will be protected by a new partnership between the Department of Conservation and Transpower, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

The partnership, worth $100,000 over five years, will see a range of conservation work in the Borland-Grebe Valley area of the national park, which is traversed by the national grid operator’s transmission lines.

“The Borland-Grebe is an important habitat for the rare mohua/yellowhead, which is now restricted to only a few sites on the mainland and pest-free islands,” Ms Barry says.

“In 2000, there were estimated to be up to 300 mohua in the area, and the valley is also believed to be a home for southern tokoeka kiwi and native bats.”

A biodiversity inventory which will give an accurate picture of the populations of native species in the area, including mohua, kakariki and South Island robins, is the partnership’s first project. The results will form the basis of a conservation management plan for Borland-Grebe.

“The Grebe Valley is also known for its exceptional wetlands, which are home to diverse array of threatened native wildlife and plant species like the small native buttercup *Ranunculus ternatifolius* and tufted hair grass,” Ms Barry says.

“As part of the War on Weeds, the partnership will undertake annual weed control and surveillance to protect the wetlands and the rest of the Borland-Grebe’s landscape from the spread of pest plants such as ragwort, heath-rush and lupins.”

“I am encouraged to see DOC continuing to build significant partnerships like this one across the country which will result in important gains for conservation.”

Raewyn Moss, Transpower general manager customers, stakeholders and environment, says it is delighted to be working with DOC.

“Fiordland National Park is of importance to all of New Zealand and we’re very much aware of that responsibility every time we visit our assets located within the Borland and Grebe Valley areas.  So we are very keen to work with DOC to see these areas become a haven for New Zealand’s native species.”
