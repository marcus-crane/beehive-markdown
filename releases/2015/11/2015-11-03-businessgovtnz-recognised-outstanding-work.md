Small Business Minister Craig Foss today congratulated the team behind Business.govt.nz for winning the government category at the 2015 AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards.

“This is the second time in four years Business.govt.nz, the Government’s website for small business, has won this award. It’s a reflection of the talented people we have working on the site and the quality content they produce for the benefit of all small New Zealand businesses,” Mr Foss says.

“Business.govt.nz is a hub of knowledge and advice for small business.  It’s easily accessible, free-of-charge and helps owners and operators get on with the business of being in business, saving them time and money.”

The website also features useful tools, including:

- [Compliance Matters](http://www.business.govt.nz/compliancematters) —­ an online tool that allows a small business to search, find and manage all their compliance requirements from across government.
- The [Employee Cost Calculator](http://www.business.govt.nz/employeecostcalculator/) — developed with input from Inland Revenue, ACC and Trade Me Jobs. It allows a business to make confident hiring decisions.

“The last year has been the busiest yet for Business.govt.nz, with 1.5 million visits to the site.  In a recent MYOB survey, almost 50 per cent of respondents said they accessed government related-information through business.govt.nz,” Mr Foss says.

“I encourage anyone running a small business or considering starting one to make use of this award-winning site: [www.business.govt.nz](http://www.business.govt.nz).”
