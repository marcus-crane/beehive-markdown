Research proposals have opened today for the redesigned Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Contestable Research Fund, says Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.

“The National Statement of Science Investment (NSSI), released last month, announced that the contestable fund will be redesigned to be a single, more flexible fund that can respond to emerging research opportunities and priorities,” Mr Joyce says.

“The previous six sector-based funds have been replaced with one fund that will be managed as an investment portfolio across social, environmental and economic objectives.

“About $35 million a year is available for investment in excellent mission-led research that has the potential for long-term impact for New Zealand, in line with the strategic direction set out in the NSSI.”

The changes to the contestable fund reflect the need to target New Zealand’s growing science investment more effectively, and incorporate feedback from the science sector. Funding will be offered through two investment mechanisms:

- Research Programmes - This investment mechanism will focus on catalysing and testing innovative research ideas. It is intended to support ambitious, excellent and well-defined research ideas which, collectively, have credible potential to deliver long-term impact for New Zealand in areas of future value, strength or critical need.
- Smart Ideas - This investment mechanism is intended to catalyse and rapidly test promising, innovative research ideas. It will support the development of excellent, ambitious research with the capacity to deliver significant benefits for New Zealand in areas of future value, strength or critical need.

A new Investment Plan published today signals how, when and why the Government will invest over a three-year horizon.

“The Investment Plan will be updated annually, creating a rolling funding horizon and allowing researchers to better predict upcoming funding opportunities,” Mr Joyce says. “It aligns with the future direction signalled in the NSSI to ensure investment is targeted in high-impact areas.”

Research proposals for the MBIE contestable fund will be reviewed by expert independent assessors, and final decisions will be made by MBIE’s independent Science Board by September 2016.
