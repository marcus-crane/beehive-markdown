Small Business Minister Craig Foss today announced one new appointment to the Small Business Development Group (SBDG) and 10 reappointments. 

Alaina Teki-Clark, from Whanganui, has been appointed to the SBDG to replace departing members Jonathan Flett and Frances Valintine. The group’s remaining members have been reappointed for a term of 18 months.

“Ms Teki-Clark is an outstanding business leader with many years’ experience starting and growing small businesses,” Mr Foss says.

“She has extensive knowledge of the retail and hospitality sectors and a long history of community leadership.  Her mix of skills and experience will serve the group well.”

The 10 members reappointed for a further eighteen months are: Tenby Powell (convenor, Auckland), Sonia McConnachie (deputy convenor, Auckland), David Hiatt (Christchurch), Ele Ludemann (Oamaru), Adrienne Pierce (Havelock North), Robert Khan (Auckland), Mitchell Pham (Auckland), Neil Pluck (Methven), Jeremy Ward (Wellington) and Sharon Henderson (Auckland).

“I’d like to thank Mr Flett and Ms Valintine for their commitment to helping small New Zealand businesses grow and thrive,” Mr Foss says.

The SBDG advises the Government on issues affecting the growth and development of small businesses.
