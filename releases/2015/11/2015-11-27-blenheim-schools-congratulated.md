Education Minister Hekia Parata today congratulated Blenheim’s 18 primary schools, one intermediate and two high schools on becoming the first Community of Learning to agree on the achievement challenges that will drive collaboration between the schools.

“Blenheim has been the first region in the country to step up to the collaboration challenge and I want to acknowledge its leadership and the enthusiasm that this reflects,” says Ms Parata.

“As a result of agreeing to their achievement challenges, Blenheim’s schools will be receiving extra funding for new lead principals and teacher roles. However, the benefit to students will be keeping their local school identity while gaining the extra expertise of Blenheim-wide teachers,” says Ms Parata.

“Research shows that the quality of teaching and leadership have a profound impact on student learning. Enabling schools and teachers to share expertise and resources will lift both.”

Blenheim was one of the first Communities of Schools, which with the added connections of early childhood and tertiary options have become Communities of Learning. It is one of three Communities to have had its achievement challenges endorsed. Further endorsements are expected shortly.   

The Blenheim Community of Learning has agreed to the following achievement challenges:

- to reduce the number of Year 1 to 8 students who are below the national standard for maths, reading and writing from 641, 500 and 748 respectively to 467 or fewer by 2017
- to reduce the number of students leaving Marlborough Boys’ and Girls’ Colleges without NCEA Level 2 from 85 to 63 or fewer by 2017; and
- to raise Māori and Pasifika achievement

***Note for editors:***

Last week Ms Parata announced that another 444 schools had formed themselves into Communities of Learning, meaning there are now 793 schools and more than 250,000 students in 96 Communities of Learning.

Communities of Learning are funded through the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative.  Designed to raise student achievement through systematically lifting the quality of teaching and learning, communities receive additional funding to enable teachers and principals to share expertise and best practice.
