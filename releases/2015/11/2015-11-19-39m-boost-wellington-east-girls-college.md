Wellington East Girls’ College’s historic main block is to be completely rebuilt as part of a $39 million redevelopment, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

“This is an exciting development,” says Ms Parata. “Once the work is complete almost half the school’s teaching space will have been upgraded and transformed into flexible, open and light spaces that can be changed to meet learning and teaching needs.”

The college’s main block was completed in 1924, but it has not been used since 2011 due to structural issues.

The redevelopment will retain the block’s striking façade, but a completely new building will be built behind it containing 28 teaching spaces. In addition a second, separate, two-storey building will be built to house the school offices and another three learning spaces.

The $39 million redevelopment is on top of the $9 million spent on infrastructure and enabling works over the last couple of years.

It  will increase the school’s maximum capacity to 1250 students. It will also provide new spaces for the special education unit and improve access across the site for all students.

Ms Parata says the modern teaching and learning spaces will ensure students are well supported to thrive in the future.

Today’s announcement follows recent announcements of major redevelopments at Balmoral School, Takapuna Grammar, Western Springs College and Aotea College totalling $149 million.

Construction at Wellington East Girls’ College is scheduled to begin in December next year and to be completed in March 2019.

**About Wellington East Girls’ College**

Wellington East Girls’ College is for year 9-13 students. Located in Mount Victoria, Wellington, the school currently has a role of 1,028 students.

The College opened in 1924 and has a site of approximately 13.4ha.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers typically address students from the front of the class, innovative learning environments facilitate collaboration and support small and large group work as well as allowing students to work individually.

When new schools are built or existing schools are upgraded, the opportunity is taken to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces.

These spaces support a range of teaching and learning approaches and can be adapted to changes in education practice. High quality acoustics, lighting, technology and heating help students concentrate on learning.
