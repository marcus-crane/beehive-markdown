Takapuna Grammar School’s historic main block will be restored as part of a redevelopment worth around $26 million, announced today by Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This is great news from a heritage perspective, because the two-storey block, built early last Century, is a well-known and much admired feature of the school and community,” says Ms Kaye.

“The redevelopment also means crucial space will once again become available to the school, which hasn’t used learning spaces in the main block for around two years because of leaks and the need for structural strengthening.

“Once it’s restored and strengthened, the main block will contain 20 revamped learning spaces, as well as an upgraded administration area and adjoining hall.

“I’m delighted for the school and for Auckland that the heritage value of this feature building can be recognised and retained.

“Takapuna Grammar is also a key secondary school on the North Shore, so this project is an important development for local families and the community.

“While the main block has been out of operation, a lot of learning has taken place in temporary facilities. There are currently 24 relocatable classrooms on-site, but most of these will be removed once the main block is back up and running.

“In addition to restoration of the feature block, the redevelopment will see two new learning spaces for art added to the existing technology block.

“Teaching spaces will also be reconfigured to better reflect the curriculum. Grouping key curriculum areas in closer physical proximity is an important way to help coordinate and share ideas, teaching and learning.

“The school will have 65 learning spaces in total, with the vast majority designed to support an innovative learning environment.

“This means they will feature the latest technology and high standards of natural lighting, heating and ventilation. Providing an environment that is physically comfortable is important to help students fully engage in their learning.

“Learning spaces will also be flexible, so they can be reconfigured to suit different teaching and learning needs on the day. In the restored main block, the degree of flexibility will be balanced against retaining key heritage features of the building.

“I was pleased to visit Takapuna Grammar this morning with local MP Maggie Barry to share news of the redevelopment with the school’s Board, principal, teachers and students.

“Today’s announcement follows yesterday’s announcement of a $24 million redevelopment at Aotea College in Porirua, and last week’s announcement of the $24 redevelopment of Balmoral School in Auckland.

“These projects are further steps in the Government’s commitment to invest in improved school facilities across New Zealand.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation. This is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.”

Construction work at Takapuna Grammar is expected to start early in 2016.

**Notes**

**What’s the process from here?**

A detailed timeline is being developed. Design, procurement and review are expected to be completed early in 2016, when works can commence. Based on current information available, the redevelopment will take around 30 months to complete. The final cost of the project will be determined once procurement processes are complete, but is expected to be approximately $26 million.

**About Takapuna Grammar School**

Takapuna Grammar School is a co-educational secondary school (years 9-13) with a roll of more than 1,400 students. The main heritage block was built in 1927.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers increasingly work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create flexible, high-quality learning spaces, including technology, that support an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
