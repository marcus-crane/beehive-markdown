Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman marked the success of New Zealand Netball at the inaugural New Zealand Netball Awards last night.

“Netball is the largest team sport for women in New Zealand and has surpassed rugby as the highest participation sport in secondary schools,” says Dr Coleman.

“The sport is part of our cultural identity. It’s great to now have an event which celebrates the sport from its grassroots level through to our Silver Ferns. Congratulations to all the nominees and winners at last night’s NZ Netball Awards.”

The 2015 New Zealand Netball Awards were held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Dr Coleman presented the award for the ‘Sky Sport Moment of the Year’ – the Silver Ferns victory over the Australian Diamonds at the Netball World Cup.

“Netball also has an important role to play in encouraging Kiwis to get active. I recently launched the Childhood Obesity Plan, making New Zealand one of the first OECD countries to have a target and a comprehensive plan to tackle childhood obesity,” says Dr Coleman.

“One of 22 initiatives in the Plan is the Big change starts small awareness campaign that aims to get people talking about how lifestyle choices are impacting on children’s health. The campaign is fronted by a number of sport stars, including Silver Fern captain Casey Kopua.”

The Big change starts small campaign is supported by a new website which offers affordable meal and activity ideas, www.eatmovelive.govt.nz.
