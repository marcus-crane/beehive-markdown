Una Jagose has been appointed Solicitor-General, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

Ms Jagose was Deputy Solicitor, Crown Legal Risk at Crown Law for two years before becoming Acting Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) in February this year.

“I have worked with Ms Jagose over a number of years in her roles at Crown Law and the GCSB,” Mr Finlayson said. “She has very sound legal judgement and has proven herself a capable and effective leader.”

The Solicitor-General is appointed on the advice of the Attorney-General and is both Junior Law Officer of the Crown and Chief Executive of the Crown Law Office.

The State Services Commission carried out a recruitment process on behalf of the Attorney-General and recommended Ms Jagose’s appointment.

Before becoming Deputy Solicitor, Crown Legal Risk, Ms Jagose worked for Crown Law for over a decade in a variety of roles. She has also been Chief Legal Advisor at the Ministry of Fisheries.

She holds an LLB from Otago University and an LLM (First Class Honours) from Victoria University and was admitted to the Bar in 1990.

Ms Jagose will take up the role of Solicitor-General on 15 February 2016. The current Solicitor-General, Michael Heron QC, will remain in the role until this date.

A recruitment process to find a new permanent Director of the GCSB will commence shortly.
