Acting Foreign Minister John Key has welcomed the peaceful conduct of Myanmar’s election on November 8.

“The election is an important milestone in Myanmar’s democratic transition, which now needs to be maintained by all parties respecting the will of the voters,” Mr Key says.

“We commend the people of Myanmar, the candidates, and the country’s electoral authorities for the scale of participation and the orderly conduct of the polls.

“New Zealand sent observers to assist with the poll and we will continue to look for opportunities to support Myanmar’s shift to democratic rule,” Mr Key says.

New Zealand’s election observation mission was made up of MPs Mark Mitchell and David Shearer, and former Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech.

Full election results are expected to be released within the next few days, with a new government due to be formed early next year.
