A total of $618,421 will be invested in 26 projects to improve safety and development at racecourses, Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced today.

The funding comes from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety and development across two funding rounds.

“This year’s first funding round has supported a wide range of infrastructure projects including track irrigation, new starting gates, toilet facilities, and greyhound track rollers,” says Mr Guy.

“The fund plays an important role in supporting the safety of the racing industry for animals, staff and the wider public. In many areas these facilities are widely used by the community, and not just on race days.”

The second funding round of the 2015/16 racing year opens for applications on 2 February 2016 and closes on 31 March 2016.

“I encourage New Zealand’s racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, to apply to the Fund where there is the potential for important safety improvements.”
