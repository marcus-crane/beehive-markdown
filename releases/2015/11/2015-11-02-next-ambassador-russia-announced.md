Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced diplomat Ian Hill as New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Moscow. He will also be accredited to Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

“New Zealand has a long-standing relationship with Russia dating back to the early 1800s, with 2014 marking the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations,” Mr McCully says.

“We work with Russia in a number of regional, multilateral and international organisations, including the United Nations, where Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council and New Zealand a non-permanent member.”

Mr Hill is currently the Manager of the Europe Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and previously served as Ambassador to Moscow from 2009 to 2012.
