Prime Minister John Key has welcomed an announcement by the Queen of a new initiative to protect rainforest and native forest throughout the Commonwealth.

The Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative (QCC) was announced at the Opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta today.

The initiative is a partnership between The Palace, the Royal Commonwealth Society, and a rainforest charity called Cool Earth. It will highlight the best conservation practice across the Commonwealth’s 53 members.

“New Zealand is one of first countries to support this initiative,” says Mr Key.

“Our commitment will build on the work being done by the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust to provide permanent protection to important biodiversity areas on private land.

“The Government will invest $1 million over three years to help the Trust extend its work.”

The Queen Elizabeth II National Trust was established in 1977 by private landowners, to encourage and promote the preservation and protection of open space, including native forests remnants. It was named to mark Her Majesty’s Silver Jubilee in the same year.

It partners with private landowners and works closely with the Department of Conservation, and other organisations to protect special natural and cultural heritage sites.
