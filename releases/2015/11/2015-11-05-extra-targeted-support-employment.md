Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says an additional 40,000 places for work focused case management are being made available for beneficiaries this year, following a funding boost of $8.5 million in Budget 2015.

The number of clients who will be able to receive intensive support from Work and Income will increase from 80,000 to 120,000, with the additional places focused on sole parents and jobseekers with health conditions and disabilities, who want to work but need extra advice and guidance. 

“A proactive approach to supporting clients prepare for employment has seen the number of children in a benefit dependent household reduce by over 42,000 in the past three years,” says Mrs Tolley.

“We want to continue this excellent progress by helping more people who want to work get into work, and to support those at risk of being long-term beneficiaries.

“Additional funding in Budget 2015 and a smarter way of working from Work and Income will give more families and individuals the opportunity to thrive and live successful lives.

“Through intensive work focused case management staff listen and adapt the way clients are seen, supported and advised, aimed at better fitting in with their commitments and work goals.

“Those with health conditions and disabilities who want to work deserve the opportunity and the extra support, while sole parents can deliver better lives for their families and help break the cycle of dependency.

“The number of sole parents on a benefit is down by almost 22 per cent over the past three years. We are doing more to try and bring the figures down even further, so we can help these clients off welfare and into work.”
