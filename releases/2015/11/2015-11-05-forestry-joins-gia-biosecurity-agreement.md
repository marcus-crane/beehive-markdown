The forestry industry has become the sixth industry group to join the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) biosecurity partnership, Primary Industries Ministers Nathan Guy and Jo Goodhew have announced today.

“It’s great to have the New Zealand Forest Owners Association (FOA) onboard, working with the Ministry for Primary Industries to manage and respond to the most important biosecurity risks,” says Mr Guy.

“A growing number of industries have now signed up to work together with the Government through the GIA.”

“MPI has worked with the forestry sector in biosecurity surveillance for over 50 years, looking out for potential forestry pests that can cause serious disease to trees and threaten the forestry industry. This government-industry relationship will be further enhanced under GIA,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Forestry is New Zealand’s third largest export earner behind dairy and meat, earning around $4.6 billion in exports. Protection from unwanted pests and diseases is very important to this major industry.”

“Biosecurity is my number one priority as Minister and this is reinforced with an extra $27 million in Budget 2015 to fund more detector dogs, x-ray machines and inspectors,” says Mr Guy.

“We also have the new passenger levy, which will mean increasing passenger numbers will fund services at the border from next year onwards,” says Mr Guy.

“Biosecurity is a shared responsibility and we need the input of industry and the wider public to make the system as effective as possible.”

The Forestry Owners Association joins Kiwifruit Vine Health, Pipfruit New Zealand, New Zealand Pork, New Zealand Equine Health Association and Onions New Zealand under GIA.
