A draft Bill to update the law governing incorporated societies is being released today for public consultation, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith says.

“There are over 23,000 incorporated societies currently operating across New Zealand,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“From the Aro Valley Citizens Advice Bureau to the Akaroa Croquet Club, incorporated societies make a huge contribution to our communities in culture, sport, recreation and community activities.

“However, the Incorporated Societies Act is more than one hundred years old, and is silent on so many important areas of governance. It fails to give the right level of direction for governing and administering a society in today’s conditions.

“Today, the government is releasing a set of proposed changes to the Act, and inviting public feedback.

“The proposed changes set out in the Incorporated Societies Bill will ensure New Zealanders can better run their societies and give them greater certainty in the processes to use.”

“The Bill also sets a framework for dealing with disputes and grievances, which the current Act doesn’t do.

“We need a modern law which gives guidance to the many New Zealanders who volunteer to run not-for-profit organisations.”

This proposed changes follow a Law Commission review of the 1908 Act that recommended that it should be replaced by a new statute to guide the sector into the future.

“I encourage everyone with an interest to provide us with feedback on the proposed law,” Mr Goldsmith says.

The draft Bill can be viewed, and submissions can be made, online at [www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/business-law/incorporated-societies](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/business-law/incorporated-societies)
