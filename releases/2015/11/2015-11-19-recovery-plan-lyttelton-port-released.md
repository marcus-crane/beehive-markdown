Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has today released the Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan, which allows for the port to be rebuilt and repaired in a timely and appropriate manner.

“In June last year I directed that a Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan be prepared by Environment Canterbury and the Lyttelton Port Company,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The draft recovery plan was released for public feedback in August, following on from two previous rounds of comment including public hearings.

“The feedback I received on the draft recovery plan made it clear that there is strong support for what is laid out in the recovery plan.”

Mr Brownlee says the measures in the Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan will allow for works that contribute to the recovery of the port to be undertaken quickly while providing for the port to service current and predicted future demand.

“This plan also allows for the port to make a positive contribution to the recovery of the township and had to take into account the social, cultural, economic and environmental wellbeing of the Lyttelton and greater Christchurch communities.

“Safe and efficient management of the local and wider transport network has also been considered.

“I look forward to seeing a rebuilt and enhanced port that supports its community and users as well as the environment around it,” Mr Brownlee says.
