Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that applications have opened for the second round of the $10 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund.

“This fund is part of our $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative and allows teachers to develop innovative teaching practices to help lift student achievement,” says Ms Parata.

“Teachers often have ideas that make a real difference in the classroom and this fund will help to bring them to life.

“More than 75 schools won funding from over 200 applications in the first round. Since July their projects have been put into practice and shared across schools.

“Successful applications from the first round include a programme focussed on teachers applying neurological research to help students with dyslexia and a collaborative project establishing an urban concept farm where students and teachers build stronger engagement in science education.

“I was delighted with the calibre and range of applications from the first round and I look forward to seeing more innovative ideas in the second round,” says Ms Parata.

An independent selection panel is overseeing the annual rounds of applications over three years. There is approximately $4 million of funding available in the second round.

Applications close on 19 February 2016.
