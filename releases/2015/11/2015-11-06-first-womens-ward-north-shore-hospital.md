Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today helped open the first dedicated women’s inpatient ward at North Shore Hospital.

“The new gynaecology ward will help to further improve the quality care being provided to women and babies at Waitemata DHB,” says Dr Coleman.

“The $6.2 million Hine Ora ward has 15 dedicated beds and is located next to the DHB’s maternity services to make it easier for patient transfers.

“The ward will also see a new 30-member specialist gynaecological team provide integrated care alongside the hospital’s maternity wards.

“Previously women have been admitted to surgical beds across the hospital so the new ward has the added bonus of freeing up those surgical beds.

“Investments like the Hine Ora ward are only possible under strong financial management. This work is being supported by the extra $400 million being invested into the health sector this year.”

Hine Ora will start taking patients from Tuesday 10 November.

The opening of Hine Ora follows recent developments at the DHB. This includes the opening of inpatient mental health facility He Puna Waiora earlier this year, the refurbishment of Waitakere Hospital’s maternity unit and the establishment of an 18‐station community dialysis facility in Mairangi Bay.

Upcoming developments include a significant expansion of Waitakere Hospital’s emergency department, a new 15‐bed medium secure unit approved for the Mason Clinic and the refurbishment and upgrade of theatres at North Shore Hospital**.**
