Economic Development and Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has left for Viet Nam today to advance New Zealand’s bilateral relationship and discuss trade opportunities.                             

Mr Joyce will be accompanying Prime Minister John Key on the New Zealand mission to Viet Nam, which will look specifically at opportunities for collaboration in the education and aviation sectors. They will be joined by a delegation of sector representatives.

The visit will also mark the signing of the New Zealand/Viet Nam Strategic Engagement Plan on Education, which was agreed to during Mr Joyce’s previous visit to Vietnam in August.

“The Plan identifies areas for collaboration which are mutually beneficial to both countries including English language training, human resource development, and postgraduate and doctoral collaboration,” Mr Joyce says.

A number of aviation agreements between New Zealand companies and Vietnamese companies will also be signed during the mission, to formalise the use of New Zealand expertise to help meet the demands of a fast-growing aviation sector in Viet Nam.

“Viet Nam’s international aviation passenger numbers are the third fastest-growing in the world at 14 percent a year, and are expected to double from 32 million this year to 63 million in 2020,” says Mr Joyce.

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation for our aviation sector and it makes sense for our two countries to be working together to collaborate on training, products, services and knowledge to help meet the growing aviation demand in Viet Nam.

“This year we celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations with the ASEAN region and the connections that have formed over the past four decades have provided a solid foundation for our relationship.

“This visit will help us to build on our foundation with Viet Nam and lead to greater collaboration, to the benefit of both our countries.”

Mr Joyce will visit Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City before returning to New Zealand on 18 November.
