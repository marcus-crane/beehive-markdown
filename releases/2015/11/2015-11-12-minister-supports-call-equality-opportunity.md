Minister for Women Hon Louise Upston has welcomed the National Council of Women of New Zealand’s report *Enabling Women’s Potential – the economic, social and ethical imperative*, which champions gender equality, fairness and equal opportunity.

“I welcome the Council’s proactive approach to generating what is an important conversation which affects all New Zealand Women. The more these discussions take place and lead to actions and changed behaviours, the better chance we have of instigating real, sustainable change”

“I am committed to improving the lives of New Zealand women and girls, by focusing on education, employment, leadership and ensuring women and girls are free from violence.

“This report aligns with the Government’s focus to broaden women’s choices and opportunities.”

Ms Upston says the report, which outlines 12 key actions to achieve positive gender culture and stronger leadership, is particularly relevant, given the high participation rates of New Zealand women in the workplace, as well as in education and training.
