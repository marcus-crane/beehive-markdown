Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that around $6 million will be invested to redevelop Te Wharekura o Maniapoto, near Te Kuiti, Waikato.

“This redevelopment will see the wharekura’s existing buildings replaced with a brand new two-storey building that will provide students with a fresh, bright learning environment,” says Ms Kaye.

“A new multipurpose space, containing specialist learning spaces and a covered, all-weather outdoor playing area will also be built.”

After starting out as a kura for years one to eight, Te Wharekura o Maniapoto now caters for years one to 13 students. 

“The redevelopment will provide the wharekura with expanded facilities that will help lift the learning experience and achievements of all its students.

“There will also be an improved site layout, with an upgraded car park and drop-off area, paved play areas and improved drainage and playing fields.

“Learning spaces at the wharekura will be flexible so they can be easily reconfigured, and there will be good internal connections and access to outside learning areas. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality will all be of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.

“As well as meeting the needs of current students, the new facilities will also allow for future roll growth.

“Te Wharekura o Maniapoto works alongside and shares resources with Te Kohanga Reo o Oparure, which is located on the same site. This close physical and working relationship provides a seamless education pathway all the way up to year 13 for local students.

“The redevelopment of Te Wharekura o Maniapoto is great news for the local community. The wharekura has faced challenges such as restricted space and flood-prone fields which the redevelopment will address.

“The new facilities will provide an asset that students and teachers can be proud of, and which reflect the wharekura’s important place in the community.”

Design work has begun, and construction is expected to start later in 2016, with the new facilities available for use in late 2017.
