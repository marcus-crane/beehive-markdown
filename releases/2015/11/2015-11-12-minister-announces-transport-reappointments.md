Transport Minister Simon Bridges today announced the reappointment of members to the boards of the NZ Transport Agency and Maritime New Zealand.

Chris Moller has been reappointed as Chair and Mark Oldfield as a member of the Board of the NZ Transport Agency.

“Mr Moller is a professional director, with experience in finance, accounting and general management. He has successfully led the Board since being appointed Chair in March 2010.

“Mr Oldfield has a strong background in local government, public sector governance and the transport sector. He has served as a board member of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority and on the Regional Transport Committee of Environment Canterbury,” Mr Bridges says.

In addition, David Ledson has been reappointed as the Chair of the Board of Maritime New Zealand.

“Originally appointed to Maritime New Zealand’s Board in February 2010, Mr Ledson had a long career in the Royal New Zealand Navy, including as Chief from 2004 to 2009.  Mr Ledson has chaired a variety of Defence Force boards and was a member of the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation Board.

“These reappointments will maintain continuity and strong leadership for both boards. In particular, leadership from the NZ Transport Agency’s Board will be important with a new Chief Executive starting in 2016,” Mr Bridges says.
