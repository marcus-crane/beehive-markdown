Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has announced New Zealand Trade and Enterprise is committing an extra $1.6 million to support Māori businesses wanting to grow internationally.

Mr Flavell says there’s huge interest in the unique value that Māori businesses offer overseas.

“I’ve just returned from leading a Māori trade mission to China that included businesses spanning tourism, dairy, seafood, wine, kiwifruit, horticulture, professional services and manufacturing,” he says.

As a result of NZTE’s increased commitment, five new positions dedicated to Māori business will be created across the NZTE network over the next 6-12 months, increasing the number of New Zealand based customer managers from three to five and creating a new Business Development Manager in China focused on growing Māori businesses. 

Working with Te Puni Kōkiri and other agencies, NZTE’s role is to help companies succeed internationally, to connect them to other partners, and work with them to make the most of the opportunities offshore.

“Māori economic development is a key theme of the Government’s Growth Agenda which will help boost the Māori economy that is valued at over $40 billion,” he says.
