Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the opening of the proposals process for Regional Research Institutes, following the completion of a series of 12 workshops around the country.

Proposals are invited from groups of businesses, researchers and private investors who are seeking to collaborate to establish regional institutes that will deliver commercially-focused and industry-relevant research to their region and New Zealand as a whole.

“The new institutes will help grow innovation and competitiveness in our regions by making the most of local industry, technology, and economic development opportunities,” says Mr Joyce.

“We are looking for proposals from groups or individuals who have the capability, experience and resources to leverage the Government’s initial investment and establish and sustain independent private research institutes.

“Proposals will need a clear industry strategy to grow research and development intensity in the regions, in line with the Government’s goal to increase business expenditure to 1 per cent of GDP.”

The privately-led institutes were announced as part of Budget 2015, which allowed for up to $25 million over three years to support the initiative.

It is expected that up to three new institutes will be established over the next four to five years in areas outside Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

“For New Zealand to succeed we need an economy where all regions are able to make the most of their competitive advantages,” Mr Joyce says. “Supporting this growth is a priority for the Government and a key focus of the Business Growth Agenda.”

“The Regional Research Institutes will have a mandate to grow R & D intensity and lift innovation in key industries across regional New Zealand.”

Notices of intent to submit a proposal are due to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) by 11 December 2015, with initial proposals required by 17 February 2016. 

Shortlisted proposals will be invited to submit more detailed proposals and, if selected, will work with MBIE to develop full business cases.
