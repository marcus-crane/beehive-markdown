Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that around $24 million will be invested to redevelop Aotea College in Porirua.

“Around two thirds of the existing teaching spaces at the college will be completely replaced as part of this redevelopment,” says Ms Kaye.

“Four new single-storey blocks will be built, including modern maths, science and technology facilities.

“In addition, a new auditorium for performing arts will be built, and the gymnasium and other buildings extended or upgraded. Earthquake strengthening will also be carried out where necessary on existing buildings that are being retained.

“The college has experienced weather-tightness issues with a number of its buildings. This has resulted from a combination of factors, including poor design, construction and maintenance in the past.

“The Ministry of Education, Board of Trustees and school leadership have worked together to address essential repairs and health and safety issues such as mould while planning and consultation for new facilities was carried out, and I’m delighted that the redevelopment now has the green light.

“The new auditorium will be a particular highlight of the redevelopment.

“Aotea College has a strong performing arts syllabus that reflects the cultural diversity and passion of its community. The new auditorium will enable this passion and focus on the arts to be strengthened and encouraged even further.

“The Ministry is currently talking with the Porirua City Council about opportunities to partner together to make the most of this new facility.

“Aotea College is a key school in Porirua, and this redevelopment will ensure the college provides a learning environment that the community can be proud of.

“The majority of facilities at the revamped college will support an innovative learning environment, with high standards of natural light, heating and ventilation and learning spaces that can be reconfigured to meet the challenges and opportunities of learning in the 21st Century.

“This is about providing facilities that are comfortable, that inspire students to achieve, and help prepare them for the reality of modern work spaces.

“Today’s announcement follows last week’s announcement of a $24 million redevelopment of Balmoral School in Auckland.

“This Government is committed to upgrading and modernising school property around New Zealand, to ensure our children receive the best possible learning environments.

“Over the last seven years, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in school property maintenance, growth and modernisation. This is more than a 30 per cent increase on the previous seven years.

“I was pleased to visit Aotea College today to share the news of the redevelopment with the school’s Board, principal, teachers and students, and I look forward to the school and the achievement of its students flourishing in the future.”

Construction work at Aotea College is expected to begin in early 2017.

**Notes:**

**What’s the process from here?**

A detailed timeline is being developed. The design for the redevelopment and procurement for construction are expected to be completed during 2016. Based on the current available information, construction is expected to begin in early 2017 and take approximately 24 months to complete. The final cost of the project will be determined once procurement processes are complete, but is expected to be approximately $24 million.

**About Aotea College**

Aotea College is a co-educational secondary school (years 9-13) in Porirua.  It opened in 1978 and has a current roll of around 900 students.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers increasingly work more collaboratively with each other and students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create flexible, high-quality learning spaces, including technology, that support an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
