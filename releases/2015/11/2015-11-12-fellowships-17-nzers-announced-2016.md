Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew today announced the names of 17 people who have been awarded a prestigious Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowship for 2016.

“The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowships, this year totalling almost $118,000, help New Zealanders travel overseas to study issues that will enrich their profession and, ultimately, benefit New Zealand as a whole,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“In celebration of the Trust’s 50th anniversary this year, three extra Fellowships have been awarded, creating an even more diverse range of research topics.”

Topics to be studied by the Fellows include innovations in primary health care in schools, marine eco-system protection and restoration, creative interactive media for children, indigenous cultural and eco-tourism ventures.

Included amongst the fellowships is the second Winston Churchill McNeish Writer’s Fellowship – awarded to Carolyn Gillum of Auckland, who will travel to Norway to carry out a research and writing project.

“I congratulate all the recipients of this year’s Fellowships and wish them successful and productive research journeys,” says Mrs Goodhew.
