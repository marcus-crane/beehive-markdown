Proposed changes to a Land Transport Rule will allow buses to carry more passengers between New Zealand’s main centres and pave the way for hybrid diesel-electric buses, Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says.

A consultation document released today proposes amending the Vehicle Dimensions and Mass (VDAM) Rule 2002, which regulates the size and weight of vehicles, to extend axle mass limits of high-capacity urban buses.

“Buses play an important role in urban and intercity transportation —  we have about 5000 on New Zealand roads,” Mr Foss says.

“Allowing heavier buses that can carry more passengers will reduce congestion in urban areas and increase tourism opportunities in our regions.

“It will also increase the viability of introducing hybrid diesel-electric buses, which are heavier due to storage batteries.

“The Government is committed to increasing road productivity and efficiency. VDAM amendments earlier this year allowed local government and other road controlling authorities to issue permits for high capacity buses, including double-decker buses, in urban areas.”

Submissions close 21 December 2015. The consultation draft rule amendment, overview and submission form is available at: [http://www.nzta.govt.nz/VDAM-Amendment-2016](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/VDAM-Amendment-2016)

A separate review looking at further changes to vehicle size and weight limits, with a discussion document on broader changes, is due to be released in the coming weeks.
