Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says over four tonnes of tobacco was abandoned at airports in the year since the duty free limits were dropped on 1 November 2014.

“Passengers choosing not to pay duty dumped almost 3.8 tonnes of tobacco – almost enough to fill a 20 foot shipping container – in Customs bins at international airports,” Ms Wagner says.

“Travellers have got the message. Almost 500kg of tobacco per month was abandoned in the first months after the lower limit came into effect, but in September this year just over 250kg was left at airports.

“I’m pleased the duty free change is deterring travellers from bringing tobacco through the border – this contributes to reducing the harm caused by smoking and the Government’s goal of making New Zealand smoke-free by 2025.

“Hundreds of kilograms of tobacco sent by mail also end up as unclaimed cargo if importers don’t pay the duty. This all adds to the significant quantity of tobacco that Customs destroys on a regular basis.

“The change was signalled well in advance and passengers have the opportunity to declare and discard excess tobacco when they arrive. People who don’t must pay the additional duty and GST.

“With Christmas and the summer travel season just ahead of us, this is a timely reminder to everyone that there is a 50 cigarette or 50 gram duty free limit for arriving passengers, and no gift allowance for tobacco sent by mail,” Ms Wagner says.

Customs recorded around 10,100 transactions for people who chose to pay duty, with the total revenue collected in the year adding to $1.62 million.
