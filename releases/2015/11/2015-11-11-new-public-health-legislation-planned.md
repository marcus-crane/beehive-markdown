Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new fit for purpose public health legislation is planned to replace the Public Health Bill.

“The Public Health Bill has been before Parliament since 2007. New legislation is needed to ensure it better meets New Zealand’s future health needs,” says Dr Coleman.

“The proposals in the Public Health Bill no longer reflect current measures for managing risks to public health, as well as addressing current priorities and opportunities to promote and protect the health of New Zealanders.

“The Government has decided that the best way forward is to withdraw the Public Health Bill and prepare a new Public Health Protection Bill that will provide a more modern and relevant legislative framework. This process will include consultation with the sector and the public.”

The Public Health Bill was introduced by the previous Government to replace the Health Act 1956. It had its first reading in 2007.

The Government is currently making amendments to the Health Act to improve management of communicable diseases. The Health (Protection) Amendment Bill is before Parliament, awaiting a second reading.

The Government is also focused on a range of non-legislative measures to improve public health, including recent initiatives to promote healthy eating and exercise and to tackle the growing challenges of obesity and diabetes.
