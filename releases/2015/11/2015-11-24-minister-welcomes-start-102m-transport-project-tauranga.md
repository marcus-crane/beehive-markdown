Transport Minister Simon Bridges today welcomed news that work is set to start on the multi-million dollar Baypark to Bayfair roading project in Tauranga that will boost the Bay of Plenty’s economy and improve road safety.

The $102 million Baypark to Bayfair Link Upgrade includes two flyovers, one which will take State highway 2 over the Maunganui-Girven intersection and a second taking State highway 29A over the railway line and the Te Maunga intersection.

“The project will connect to the recently opened $455 million Tauranga Eastern Link and once finished will reduce congestion, improve safety by separating local and State highway traffic, and support economic growth in the region by improving the route to the Port of Tauranga.

“It is exciting to see another transport project get underway that will support Tauranga and the wider Bay of Plenty’s economic and population growth for decades to come.

“Once it is finished it will make a real difference to people’s travel.”

The Baypark to Bayfair Link Upgrade is expected to be complete in 2020.

The East Coast Main Trunk railway line will be relocated to the west of Owens Place to create space for the changes, with work on the new railway site set to start before Christmas.
