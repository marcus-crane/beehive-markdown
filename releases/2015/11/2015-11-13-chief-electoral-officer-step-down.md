Justice Minister Amy Adams has announced that a new Chief Electoral Officer is to be sought following the expiry of Robert Peden's five-year term.

Mr Peden has advised the Minister he will not be reapplying for the role.

The Chief Electoral Officer is the chief executive and a member of the three-person Board of the Electoral Commission, appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of Parliament. 

The Chief Electoral Officer has much of the operational responsibility for the Commission’s functions to administer the electoral system, by-elections and referenda, and the registration of political parties.

“The Electoral Commission has efficiently managed the last three elections under Mr Peden’s leadership and Mr Peden has enjoyed a reputation for being highly competent, diligent and a person of the upmost integrity,” says Ms Adams. 

Mr Peden had been the Chief Electoral Officer in the Ministry of Justice, the statutory official responsible for the conduct of Parliamentary elections and referenda, before the establishment of the independent Electoral Commission in 2010. Mr Peden was appointed Chief Electoral Officer in the new Electoral Commission in 2010.

“The Chief Electoral Officer carries enormous responsibility and Mr Peden has made a valuable contribution during his tenure, particularly in ensuring a smooth transition of functions over to the Electoral Commission in 2010. I wish him well for the future,” says Ms Adams.

The process for a new appointment to the Chief Electoral Officer position will now commence.
