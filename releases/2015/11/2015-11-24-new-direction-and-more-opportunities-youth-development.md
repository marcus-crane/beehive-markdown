Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced changes for the Ministry of Youth Development (MYD) which will see significantly more youth development opportunities in New Zealand.

“These changes follow a review completed in August this year, and my desire to increase the number of youth development opportunities available to young people,” says Ms Kaye.

“There is a need for more clarity and purpose to the Ministry’s activities, and spending needs to be targeted where it will make the biggest difference.

“MYD has an annual operating budget of just over $2.9 million. It administers core funding of around $6 million for youth development opportunities for around 50,000 of New Zealand’s young people aged 12-24 years.

“To grow opportunities I intend to reprioritise $1 million, including from operational savings. I also intend to establish a partnership fund to co-invest this reprioritised funding, along with contributions of at least $1 million from philanthropic and business organisations.

“The new direction and additional investment of $2 million will in my view see the number of youth development opportunities increase from around 50,000 to 70,000 annually, with the overall funds targeting disadvantaged youth increasing from 18 per cent to 30 per cent.

“Looking ahead, the total number of opportunities could well exceed this, as the partnership fund is a mechanism to achieve greater cohesion between the Government and business and philanthropic sectors, and I expect ideas and initiatives to flow from it.

“The options are that a new Board or Charitable Trust will decide how money in the partnership fund is invested. The intention is to have representation from the business and philanthropic sectors on the Board or Trust.

“I have asked the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to consult with relevant stakeholders in early 2016 regarding the final governance model for the partnership fund.

“Work is now underway to put in place the capacity and capability needed for MYD. MSD is consulting with staff on a proposed structure to enable MYD to deliver on the new direction, including how it can best work with businesses and philanthropics to strengthen youth development opportunities.

“Although the final structure of MYD is still being developed, it will continue as a function within the Ministry of Social Development.

“Some MYD staff will be impacted by the changes, and I want to acknowledge that this will be a difficult time for them. MSD will provide appropriate support to those affected. The agency’s new arrangements will be in place by April 2016.

“I have seen first-hand the benefits of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds getting access to opportunities such as leadership and mentoring programmes. A small investment in ensuring more young people get these opportunities can change lives.

“I will also focus MYD on better recognising young people’s contribution and participation in areas such as volunteering, mentoring, leadership and sporting and cultural activities.

“I have been looking into greater civic participation for young New Zealanders.As part of this, the Ministry will investigate the delivery of a ‘Social Record’ that better recognises young people’s participation in youth development opportunities, the same way as academic and other educational achievements are recognised by employers.

“There are many businesses and organisations who see the value of, and are already investing in, opportunities to help young people acquire the skills and confidence they need to contribute positively to society as adults.

“It makes a lot of sense for MYD to maximise its resources by working with these organisations.

“We know that young people who are given the chance to develop skills such as leadership or be involved in mentoring and volunteering go on to lead more successful lives as adults.

“I believe we need to lift our expectations as a country of what young people can do.

“My vision is that all young New Zealanders, in addition to their academic achievements, also have access to youth development opportunities, whether that be leadership, mentoring, volunteering or sport and cultural opportunities.

“These changes are a big step forward that will create more youth development opportunities, ensure greater recognition of young people’s achievements and raise our expectations of what we can do as a country to encourage youth development.”
