Executive Director of the Auckland Investment Office John Duncan has been appointed Deputy Chair of the Housing New Zealand Board, Housing New Zealand Minister Bill English announced today.

“Mr Duncan brings financial transaction and investment skills as well as a good understanding of the public sector environment at both a national and local level,” Mr English says.

Two additional new Housing New Zealand board members have also been appointed Managing Director of Castalia Michael Schur and Former National Party MP Tau Henare.

Michael Schur is a public finance, infrastructure finance and procurement specialist with over 20 years’ international experience.

“Mr Schur brings a unique combination of public financial management and public private partnerships skills and experience to the board.”

Tau Henare, a former Minister of Māori Affairs, has a background in community development, early childhood education and union organisation and has extensive experience in public policy.

“Mr Henare will provide a community based perspective to the board. His understanding of Iwi, hapū and whānau dynamics will be of particular value,” Mr English says.
