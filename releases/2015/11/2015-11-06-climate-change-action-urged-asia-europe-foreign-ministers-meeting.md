Associate Foreign Minister Hon Todd McClay has reiterated New Zealand’s commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome to the upcoming Paris Climate change talks at the Asia-Europe Meeting Foreign Ministers Meeting (ASEM) in Luxembourg this week.

“Political momentum for the new climate change agreement to be concluded at COP21 in Paris is building,” says Mr McClay.

In his speech to the 53 European and Asian members of ASEM he said the Asia-Pacific region regularly experiences natural disasters where climate change is playing a role.

“New Zealand is doing its share as part of the global climate change response, with our pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

“However, we are also looking for action beyond the UNFCCC process. New Zealand is leading a coalition of governments calling for the elimination of inefficient subsidies to fossil fuels, and dozens of countries have undertaken reform in the past two years,” says Mr McClay.  

New Zealand is coordinator for the North East and South East Asian members of ASEM – a group that includes New Zealand, Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Kazakstan, Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan and Russia.

“Fora such as ASEM present an important opportunity to restate our case on climate change and other important regional and bilateral issues faces the world,” says Mr McClay.
