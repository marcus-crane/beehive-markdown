Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has officially launched the Whanganui Children’s Team, which will support 400 vulnerable children from Whanganui, Waiouru, Taihape and Bulls in the first two years.

Children’s Teams ensure that children with multiple and complex needs have a single point of contact and an individually-tailored and co-ordinated support plan, with agencies working together to provide the best outcomes for kids, so they don’t need state intervention.

“We need to ensure that at-risk children are getting the support they need early. That means working together across agencies, sharing information and keeping the child at the centre of everything we do,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Rather than adding more services, we are making sure children and families are accessing the support they need, when they need it and that they have one point of contact to help them navigate those services.

“At-risk children have a fundamental right to have their needs met and to be supported to live full and successful lives. Children’s Teams support vulnerable families so they can achieve this.

“I want to thank all those involved for their work establishing this team. I know that your hard work and determination will be instrumental in helping our vulnerable children,” Mrs Tolley says.

Children’s Teams have already been launched and are accepting referrals in Rotorua, Whangarei, Marlborough, Ōtaki/Horowhenua, Hamilton, Tairawhiti and Eastern Bay of Plenty. The Christchurch Children’s Team will be launched in December and Counties Manukau in early 2016.
