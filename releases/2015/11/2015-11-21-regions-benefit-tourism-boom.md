Figures out today show the positive impact tourism continues to have on regional economic growth, Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Regional Tourism Estimates for year ending March 2015 have been released today by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

“Tourism continues to go from strength to strength, and these latest figures show that it isn’t just the major tourist destinations that are benefiting,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Leading Regional Tourism Organisations (RTOs) were in Whanganui, Bay of Plenty and Christchurch, which saw domestic expenditure increase by more than 12 per cent over the previous year.

“Key regional economic growth areas like Northland and the Manawatu also posted impressive results, with expenditure increasing by $38 million and $57 million respectively.

“International expenditure was up by over 24 per cent in South Canterbury, Rotorua, and Queenstown RTOs, showing those markets continue to hold particular appeal for overseas visitors.

“2015 has been a big year for tourism, with New Zealand welcoming its 3 millionth visitor for the first time, and total tourism expenditure increasing by 10 per cent on 2014 to nearly $30 billion.”

Tourism now represents 17.4 per cent of our total exports, up from 15 per cent, and is our second largest export. Tourism is worth $10.6 billion, or nearly 5% of our GDP, and one in every 8 jobs is now directly or indirectly related to tourism.

The growth in tourism, along with success in other exports industries such as international education, ICT, wool and wine, is contributing to New Zealand’s increasingly diverse and growing economy.
