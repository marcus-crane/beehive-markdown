Partnerships between two New Zealand pilot training institutions and Viet Flight Training will help increase the number of pilots entering the burgeoning Vietnamese aviation market.

Eagle Flight Training and International Aviation Academy of New Zealand both signed agreements with the Vietnamese Flight Training Company to formalise their business partnerships.

“These agreements will enable the Viet Nam aviation industry to strengthen its training capabilities by drawing on the expertise of New Zealand’s world class pilot training schools,” says Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce, who witnessed the signings of the agreements.

International passenger traffic into Viet Nam is expected to grow 100 per cent over the next five years, making Viet Nam’s aviation industry the 3rd fastest-growing in the world for international passengers.

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation for our aviation industry and we are well positioned to help Viet Nam meet the growing demand of their air travellers. The agreements signed today show the commitment New Zealand has to collaborating with Viet Nam and working with them to share our knowledge, services and products to help build a world class Viet Nam aviation sector,” Mr Joyce says.
