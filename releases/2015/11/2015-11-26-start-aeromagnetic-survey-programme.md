Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges has announced that the Government’s latest programme of aeromagnetic surveys will begin soon in Nelson and Marlborough.

“The aim of these surveys is to build up comprehensive data on our minerals resources”, Minister Bridges says.

The aeromagnetic survey will build on the data gathered in recent surveys of Northland and the West Coast between 2011 and 2013.  A specially-equipped helicopter will gather magnetic and radiometric measurements – high quality data about the geology and structure of an area.

Once the survey is complete, it will take the data we have on New Zealand’s surface from aeromagnetic surveys to roughly 30 per cent of the country.

“While the rewards of minerals exploration are high, so are the costs.  The data we’re gathering is vital to encouraging investment.  Good data can tip the balance of investment decisions in our favour.”

The surveys are part of an $8 million Government investment in new data, allocated over four years in Budget 2014.  The majority of this is tagged for aeromagnetic surveys of Nelson, Marlborough, Southland and Otago to be completed by 2017.

“I am particularly pleased that local authorities have seen the value of collecting this data and are partnering with the Government on this project,” says Minister Bridges.

The survey areas have been extended to support local authorities interest in the data, which has applications for mapping geological hazards (such as fault lines), better understanding regional water resources, and providing information on climate, soil and geology to support local business.
