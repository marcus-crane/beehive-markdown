New Zealand and Viet Nam launched a new era in bilateral relations today which will see increased cooperation and trade between our two countries, Prime Minister John Key says.

Mr Key and Viet Nam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung made a series of significant announcements in areas including aviation, development and education following their meeting in Hanoi today.

“Today’s announcements demonstrate that New Zealand and Viet Nam are more connected than we have ever been,” Mr Key says.

“The opportunities our two countries offer each other are immense. Already every year New Zealand contributes to the education of thousands of Vietnamese students, and we buy hundreds of millions of dollars of Vietnamese produce.

“On top of experiencing our world-class education services, Viet Nam buys around half a billion dollars a year of New Zealand goods and services. It is already New Zealand’s fastest-growing export market in South East Asia but we are always looking for opportunities to do more together.

“So today we launched an ambitious programme aimed at ensuring our relationship continues to go from strength to strength.”

Today’s announcements include:

- An agreement to invest over $14m in new development initiatives in Viet Nam, including a food safety project, the expansion of a successful dam safety pilot, and an enhanced scholarship and short-term training scheme
- A Strategic Engagement Plan for Education to maximise links in international education, alumni and education policy
- Two other bilateral cooperation arrangements – in healthcare and aviation – which will see New Zealand expertise contribute to Vietnamese government institutions

“These initiatives will greatly strengthen what is an increasingly important relationship for both our countries.”

The announcements were made during a two-day official visit by Prime Minister Key to Viet Nam.
