Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says Customs has begun detailed work to determine the practical implications of options to streamline the collection of duty on low-value physical imports.

“Streamlining the collection of duty on low-value imports is about being fair and equitable to New Zealand businesses and workers by creating a level playing field with overseas suppliers,” Ms Wagner says.

“Several approaches to changing the de minimis and streamlining the collection of duty on import consignments have been developed.  These include moving to a value-based de minimis, reducing the de minimis and retaining status quo.

“Customs will now test these with key stakeholders before finalising proposals for public consultation in April 2016. This will ensure the Government can create a level playing field while not moving unreasonable cost or inconvenience on to consumers. No changes will be made before public consultation has taken place.

“Current costs for industry, future growth in low-value imports, and the timing and size of future efficiency savings, need to be fully understood.

“The challenge when developing options for the level of the de minimis is keeping the collection costs below or equal to the revenue collected.

“The growth in low-value goods is an international challenge and, as new automated processing technology develops, border agencies will become more able to streamline collection of duty on low-value imports,” Ms Wagner says.

Customs will consult with NZ Post, the Conference of Asian Pacific Express Carriers (CAPEC) and representatives of the retail industry and consumers to validate and improve modelling and gather more information.

**More information**

A low-value import is any imported good valued at $1,000 or less.

The de minimis is a threshold below which Customs does not collect duty. This is currently set at $60 – where the total in GST and tariff is greater than $60 the imported good becomes liable for duty.

A value-based de minimis is based on the value of the good, as opposed to the value of duty.
