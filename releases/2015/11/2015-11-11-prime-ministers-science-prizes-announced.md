Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the winners of New Zealand’s most valuable and prestigious annual science awards.

“The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes recognise researchers, teachers, students and communicators of the highest calibre, working in areas with real impact on New Zealand’s economy, environment or societal wellbeing,” Mr Joyce says.

The five prizes were established in 2009 and have total value of $1 million.

“These prizes seek to highlight the way science underpins innovation, helping to grow our economy and improve our productivity and international competitiveness,” Mr Joyce says.

“The National Statement of Science Investment launched last month has a focus on two pillars of success: excellence and impact. The recipients today demonstrate the impact that excellent science can have on New Zealand and our place in the world. 

“The Government is also focused on encouraging more young people and the general public to take an active interest in science. The award recipients are role models, educators and communicators, who all play a part in inspiring others.”

The prizes were presented by Prime Minister John Key at a ceremony at Te Papa today:

- The Prime Minister’s Science Prize ($500,000) – The University of Auckland Bone and Joint Research Group, led by Professor Ian Reid (University of Auckland)
- The Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize ($200,000) – Dr Alex Taylor, University of Auckland, for his work into the evolution of intelligence
- The Prime Minister’s Science Teacher Prize ($150,000) - Tania Lineham (James Hargest College)
- The Prime Minister’s Science Media Communication Prize ($100,000) - Dr Ian Griffin (Otago Museum)
- The Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Prize ($50,000) - Georgia Lala (Auckland Diocesan School for Girls).

The Prime Minister’s Science Prizes are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
