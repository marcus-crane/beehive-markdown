A successful, community-backed 1080 operation in Northland’s Warawara Forest points the way forward for more effective pest control in the region, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

With the support of local iwi Te Rarawa, Reconnecting Northland and the Northland Regional Council, DOC has carried out a successful aerial 1080 drop across 6608 hectares of forest, home to rare birds including the tiny rifleman.

“Due to the exceptionally steep and difficult terrain of Warawara – a similar problem in other parts of Northland – 1080 is the most viable way of controlling the pests which threaten the health of the forest,” Ms Barry says.

“It’s encouraging that Te Rarawa have recognised the need for 1080 and supported its use. Warawara is an example of what can be achieved with community engagement and conservation know-how cooperating to protect our at-risk flora and fauna.”

To reinforce the 1080 drop, which can kill up to 98 per cent of possums and more than 90 per cent of rats in a targeted area, a Community Pest Control Area has been set up to create a “ring of steel” around the forest, using trapping and bait stations.

“We recognise the pressing and ongoing need for effective pest control and I am hopeful we can build on the success of the Warawara relationship and begin similar partnerships across Northland as soon as possible.”

Rongo Bentson, Environmental Coordinator for Te Rarawa, says the project has been challenging but worthwhile.

“Coordinating a large-scale pest control strategy is an entirely new space for us, but everyone brings a unique skillset and the improved health of the Warawara is the top priority for all involved … we believe that if Warawara is healthy we are healthy and we’re working hard to restore the health of the Warawara now and forever.”

“DOC manages around 104,000 hectares of forest in Northland, with around 40,000 hectares controlled for possums,” Ms Barry says.

“It also targets stoats, rats, goats and other pests across tens of thousands of hectares of conservation land. In total, DOC spends $3.19 million controlling animal pests in the Northland region, with more than $2 million on top of that targeting weeds.”
