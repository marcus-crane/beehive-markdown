Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government is providing Canterbury DHB with an additional $16 million in funding.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that Canterbury DHB is well placed to continue to deliver high quality services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Canterbury has responded to the unique challenges as a result of the earthquakes with an internationally recognised integrated health system.

“We have been listening carefully to the concerns of the Board, and to get a full understanding, PwC was asked to carry out a financial review.”

The PwC review found that while the DHB has a stable financial position, the key drivers of future costs are in managing the hospital redevelopment and the operational consequences of the earthquakes.

PwC have recommended that the Detailed Business Case for the facilities redevelopment projects, and upon which future funding tracks are forecast, is reviewed and updated.

“This additional $16 million in funding for 2015/16 will mean that by the time the Detailed Business Case review is completed, the DHB will be in a better financial position from which to go forward,” says Dr Coleman.

“I have asked the Ministry of Health and Treasury to work with the DHB on the Detailed Business Case. It is important that the Government and the DHB have clarity on future forecasts of performance and position.

“This funding reflects Canterbury’s unique circumstances and the need to maintain momentum on the hospital redevelopment, earthquake repairs, and the delivery of high quality services to Cantabrians.”
