Acting Foreign Minister Todd McClay today expressed New Zealand’s deep disappointment at the Japanese Government’s decision that it will return to the Southern Ocean to undertake whaling this season.

“New Zealand is strongly opposed to whaling in the Southern Ocean. We call on Japan to take heed of the 2014 International Court of Justice decision and international scientific advice concerning their whaling activities,” Mr McClay says. 

“In early 2015, the International Whaling Commission’s Expert Panel issued very clear and unambiguous recommendations that Japan postpone the lethal components of its research proposal.  The Expert Panel requested Japan undertake further work on whether lethal methods are necessary to achieve its research objectives.

“The Panel’s clear message, which was echoed by a significant number of IWC scientists in June, was that Japan had not made the case for lethal research - and this remains the case. New Zealand’s long-standing and fundamental opposition to this practice remains unchanged. It is clear that Japan’s research objectives can be met using non-lethal means,” says Mr McClay.  

“In 2014 the International Court of Justice found Japan’s previous Southern Ocean whaling programme to be unlawful, as it was not for purposes of scientific research.

“We call on Japan to heed the Expert Panel’s advice and postpone any whaling this season. Our strong view is that Japan should at least afford the International Whaling Commission the opportunity to consider the proposal in 2016.

“We continue to actively pursue an end to Southern Ocean whaling, and are considering all options,” says Mr McClay.
