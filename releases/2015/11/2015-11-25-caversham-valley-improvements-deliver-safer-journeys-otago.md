Transport Minister Simon Bridges today opened the second and final stage of the Government’s $45 million Caversham Highway Improvement project in Dunedin.

About 25,000 vehicles a day use the stretch of highway that has been the focus of the Caversham Highway Improvement project, making it the busiest highway corridor south of Christchurch. The highway forms part of the main southern arterial serving Dunedin, Central Otago, Southland and Port Otago

Mr Bridges says the Caversham Valley project is one of the largest roading projects to be delivered in Dunedin in decades.

The first stage of the project opened in October 2012, providing a four-lane median divided route between Andersons Bay Road and Barnes Drive.

“The improvements made between Andersons Bay Road and Barnes Drive has already seen the flow of traffic improve on the main southern highway out of Dunedin.

“Today’s opening of the second and final $25 million section of the project will see roading improvements over a 1km section from Barnes Drive up Caversham Valley to Lookout Point.

“This stretch of improved highway will now be safer to travel on, allow traffic to flow more freely and provide more predictable travel times for motorists.

“The project has also benefited Dunedin’s economy, providing jobs and where possible used local contractors and suppliers.

“I’m also really pleased to see the extension to the existing shared walking and cycling path alongside State highway 1. The extension links to several pathways on the wider Dunedin cycle network meaning users can easily travel to a wide range of locations around the city. This will help make urban cycling a safer and more attractive transport choice for the region,” Mr Bridges says.
