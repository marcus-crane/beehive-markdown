The report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment Dr Jan Wright on sea level rise has been welcomed by Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith, who says it is a useful contribution to the public debate on planning for and adapting to climate change.

“Sea level rise is increasingly becoming a reality for the many New Zealanders who live along our extensive coastline and this report provides new evidence and expert commentary to inform the discussion about how we address the challenges,” Dr Smith says.

The report released today – *Preparing New Zealand for Rising Seas: Certainty and Uncertainty* – makes eight recommendations to the Government, including on improving the direction and advice given to local councils.

“The Government already has work underway in this area, with the Ministry for the Environment updating its guidance for councils on adapting to climate change. We are also planning changes to the Resource Management Act to make managing significant risks from natural hazards a matter of national importance and developing national direction on natural hazards,” Dr Smith says.

“We have seen with the experiences of communities in Kapiti and Christchurch that in dealing with the realities and costs of planning for future sea level rise, there is scope to improve guidance and direction from central government. It is critical that our communities and councils have robust evidence and analysis so they can prepare for the impacts of a rising sea on our coastal towns and cities.

“The Government agrees with the Parliamentary Commissioner that we need to take the time to consider the evidence and plan deliberately and well, rather than rushing ahead. This is particularly important when we are dealing with scenario planning, risk assessment and uncertainty. I have asked officials to carefully consider the findings of the report and its recommendations over the coming months. This report will help us provide clear direction and guidance as to how we mitigate the impact of climate change, while we also step up our efforts to limit emissions and address the root cause.”
