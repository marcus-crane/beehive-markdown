Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith today expressed his sadness at the passing of Dr Bill Ballantine.

“Bill was the father of marine conservation in New Zealand. Our 1971 Marine Reserves Act – an international first – was his brainchild, as was our first no-take reserve at Leigh,” Dr Smith says.

“He remained a forceful advocate for the protection of our marine environment and leaves behind a proud legacy. The first step that Bill persuaded us to take as a country 40 years ago has to be acknowledged as the seed for New Zealand’s strong reputation today as a world leader in the responsible use and management of our ocean environment.

“It was therefore particularly special that Bill was able to attend the event last month marking the announcement of the new Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary. The event also provided an opportunity to recognise Bill’s invaluable contribution.

“My thoughts are with Bill’s family and friends.”
