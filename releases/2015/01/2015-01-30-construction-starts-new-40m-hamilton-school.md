Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will turn the soil at a ceremony tomorrow morning to mark the start of construction of Hamilton’s new Rototuna Junior High School.

“Rototuna is Hamilton’s fastest growing community, and this new school reflects the Government’s commitment to ensure school capacity matches changing population trends,” says Ms Kaye.

The school, estimated to cost $40 million to build, will have capacity for up to 1,200 students from years seven to 10, and is due to open at the start of 2016.

“Like all new schools being built in New Zealand, Rototuna Junior High will provide fresh, exciting and modern learning environments.

“The way young people are taught has changed immensely and schools are now designed to support this new approach.

“Features of today’s schools include adaptable, open plan learning spaces and quality wireless connectivity. Rototuna Junior High will also have specialist music suites, visual and performing arts studios and recording studios.”

The school is being built to attain a 5 Star Green Building rating, and will harvest rainwater for non-drinking purposes, have high levels of insulation and maximum natural ventilation and lighting.

“With its fantastic facilities, Rototuna Junior High will be a great asset for the community and a great place of learning for all the kids who will go there from 2016 on.”

**Notes for editors**:

**Where is the school being built?**

The new school is on 11ha on North City Road, Rototuna.

**Who’s building it?**

The school was designed by Jasmax and will be built by Arrow International

**Why was the new school necessary?**

The school will serve the fast-growing community in Hamilton North, and provide good transition from several primary schools, including Rototuna, Te Totara, Waikato Waldorf, Horsham Downs, Gordonton and Puketaha, as well as the soon to open Endeavour School.

**What’s the 5 Star Green Building rating?**

This rating was developed by the New Zealand Green Building Council, a non-profit industry organisation which works to promote and accelerate more sustainable building practices.

**What is a modern learning environment?**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
