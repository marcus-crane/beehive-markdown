Conservation Minister Maggie Barry today announced a new Yealands Family Wines partnership with the Department of Conservation that will provide more than $100,000 over three years for conservation initiatives on and around the Queen Charlotte Track in the Marlborough Sounds.

“Winemaker Peter Yealands is renowned as a leader in sustainable wine production and his company’s values of environmental sustainability are reflected in its significant contribution to conservation on the Queen Charlotte Track and in Queen Charlotte Sound,” says Ms Barry.

“Yealands Family Wines will also be contributing to their local community in supporting this iconic Marlborough landscape and trail that is a regionally important tourist destination.

“The Queen Charlotte Track, with its stunning scenery and native wildlife, draws more than 16,000 people a year to walk or bike all or part of its 71-kilometre length,” says Ms Barry.

Yealands will provide $25,000 over each of the next three years plus a minimum $10,000 annually from proceeds of sales of its Eco wine range.

“This support will enable welcome improvements to the Queen Charlotte Sound environment and the Queen Charlotte Track, which is managed in a partnership between DOC, Marlborough District Council and the landowners whose private land the track traverses,” says Ms Barry.

“It is proposed the funding will be used initially to develop new track information signage that will tell the stories of the area’s history, flora and fauna, geology, predator-free islands and community conservation work with DOC, which includes wilding pine control and trapping of pests.

“Improvements to parts of the track are also proposed along with supporting community trapping programmes. As well as providing conservation benefits, these will enhance people’s enjoyment of the track and the area’s unique natural surroundings,” says Ms Barry.
