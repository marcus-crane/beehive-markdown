Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today congratulated the New Zealand Customs Service on the eve of its 175th anniversary of service protecting New Zealand’s border.

Customs was established on 28 January 1840 in Kororareka, Bay of Islands, and is New Zealand’s first fully-fledged government department.

“Customs, despite being the oldest, has also become one of the most tech-savvy government departments,” Ms Wagner says.

“In the early days Customs officers chased tobacco smugglers along rugged coastline and hunted down illegal whiskey distilleries.

“Today, Customs uses a full range of tools to do its job from world-leading technology such as SmartGate, hand-held drug analysers, x-rays, intelligence analysis tools, to highly-trained cash and drug detector dogs.

“But what has stayed the same is that well-trained and dedicated Customs officers are still at the heart of what they do.

“Last year, Customs processed a record 11.2 million arriving and departing travellers, processed 7.8 million import transactions, and collected $11.847 billion in Crown revenue.

“From the old days of opium, war, risqué books, importer scams and transistor radio smugglers, to today’s methamphetamine, counter-terrorism, objectionable material, fraud and money laundering – the targets have changed, however Customs’ focus and commitment remains the same.

“I wish Customs a successful 175th year of continued commitment and service at New Zealand’s border,” Ms Wagner says.
