Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced that the next round of applications for the Racing Safety Development Fund will open on 2 February 2015.

“The fund supports important projects around the country to improve racecourse health and safety standards. This has included improvements for safety running rails, containment fences, and grandstand repairs,” says Mr Guy.

A total of $296,404 will be made available from the fund this round with just over $700,000 having already been granted this financial year. All racing clubs and racing code bodies can apply.

“Racecourse health and safety is an important priority for the industry. This includes the health and safety of the racing animals, riders, spectators, and officials.”

New Zealand has about 150 active racing clubs and 70 racecourses.

On-line applications must be submitted by 31 March 2015.  Further information is available from: [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz) and [Racing Safety Development Fund - dia.govt.nz](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Racing-Safety-Development-Fund?OpenDocument)
