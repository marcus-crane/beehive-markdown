Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is calling for more sponsors to develop New Zealand’s future leaders by partnering with the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.

“Over the past fifty years, nearly 850 Fellowships have been awarded to New Zealanders with strong research projects that will develop the knowledge of their particular industry,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Churchill Fellows return to New Zealand with new perspectives and ideas for their profession, overseas networks and leadership abilities.”

“The impact of their work touches on all professions and industries, which has led to an increased interest in profession specific partnered Fellowships.”

Since 2013 the Winston Churchill McNeish Fellowship has allowed writers to immerse themselves in another culture. This year a partnership with the Hawke’s Bay Design Trust will award a fellowship for the advancement of New Zealand product and industrial design.

“Partnered Fellowships are a new direction for the Trust, and these two sponsorships show how well the Trust works in partnership for an industry specific Fellowship,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“I encourage any industries that wish to sponsor a Fellowship to get in touch with the Trust. A sponsorship costs just $5000- $7000 per year, and yet returns significant research results for industry as well as supporting talented New Zealanders.”

The Trust, via a secretariat at the Department of Internal Affairs, handles the paperwork, applications, knowledge co-ordination, and other administration.
