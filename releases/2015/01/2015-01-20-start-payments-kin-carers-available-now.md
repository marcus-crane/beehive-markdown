Applications are now open for the 2015 round of School and Year Start-up payments available to kin carers, Social Development Minister Anne Tolley confirmed today.

“The beginning of a new school year can be costly – this payment is available to help with pre-school and school-related costs such as clothing, school fees and stationery.

“Raising vulnerable children who’ve already had a rough start to life is hard work and these payments recognise the job grandparents and extended family members do raising children who come into their care, often because of the death of a parent or because of abuse or neglect.” Mrs Tolley says.

Payments are between $400 and $550, depending on the age of the child.

Last year around 6,500 carers were assisted, with School and Year Start-up payments of around $3.3 million.

“People who care for a child when their parents are unable to do so play an invaluable role – both in the life of the child and in New Zealand society'.

“We’re providing a bit of extra support so the children they are caring for have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to thrive, achieve, and belong.” Mrs Tolley says.

Applications opened on 12th January and are open through til the end of February. Applications can be made online at [http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/) or through a local Work and Income office.
