Government agencies are now able to access further savings when it comes to purchasing advertising media, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce announced today.

The Advertising Media All-of-Government (AoG) contract replaces the current Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) agreements with existing media vendors, and introduces an open-panel concept.  It widens government agency eligibility to include all agencies able to purchase from AoG contracts. 

“Under the new contract, government agencies will be able to access competitive discounts on advertising placement across a range of media channels,” Mr Joyce says. 

“The new contract opens up the opportunity for more government agencies to benefit from competitive discounts across potentially more vendors who have not previously had the opportunity to offer discounts to government agencies.

“In addition, the new arrangements mean that discounts will now apply to a wider range of government agencies, including district health boards and schools.”

AoG contracts have achieved significant benefits since their establishment, and participation by government agencies continues to grow with more than 740 agencies participating in at least one contract. 

To date, $176.9 million of savings has been achieved.  Total forecast savings over the life of all AoG contracts is $415.1 million. 

This new contract will operate alongside the existing Advertising Services contract and a new Design Services contract, which came into effect in December.
