Prime Minister John Key will travel to the United Kingdom, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Switzerland next week, attending meetings of the World Economic Forum and International Democrat Union.

In London, Mr Key will meet with Prime Minister David Cameron, Opposition Leader Ed Miliband, the Governor of the Bank of England and business leaders.

The Prime Minister will then travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina to Chair a meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Democrat Union and also meet with the President and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Mr Key will then attend this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, from 21 to 23 January.

“Davos is an ideal platform to engage with key international influencers, on a wide range of issues of global importance, as well as to meet bilaterally with international counterparts,” says Mr Key.

Trade Minister Tim Groser will also travel to Davos to attend Ministerial meetings and meet with Ministerial counterparts, as part of the World Economic Forum.
