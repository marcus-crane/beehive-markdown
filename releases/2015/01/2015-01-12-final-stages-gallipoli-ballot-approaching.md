Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says those offered passes in the third tranche of the Gallipoli 2015 ballot have just three days left to accept their place at this year’s Anzac Day commemorations.

The 194 successful applicants have until 11:59pm on 15 January to accept the offer of two attendance passes and confirm travel arrangements for themselves and their accompanying person. 

“It’s likely a small number of passes will become available to the wait list after the January 15 deadline,” Mr Foss says.

With limited time left to make travel arrangements, the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office is asking those on the wait list to confirm whether they would be in a position to accept reallocated passes in mid-January.

“We want to make sure as many people as possible are given the opportunity to attend the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings,” Mr Foss says.

Anyone with queries regarding their application should contact the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office by emailing [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz) or calling 0800 336 547.
