Government Communications Security Bureau Director, Ian Fletcher, is stepping down after three years in the role for family reasons, Minister Responsible for the GCSB, Christopher Finlayson, announced today.

“Mr Fletcher has been instrumental in the significant improvements that have taken place at the GCSB over the past three years, where he has led the implementation of the Kitteridge Review and increased the public openness and accountability of the organisation,” Mr Finlayson said.

“His tenure has also seen New Zealand’s national security enhanced with the approval and initial roll-out of the Cortex cyber security programme for the New Zealand Government and critical infrastructure organisations.”

Mr Fletcher has held senior roles in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand public sectors for over two decades, serving as a Chief Executive in all three jurisdictions. 

He is looking forward to pursuing other interests in due course.

“The last three years have seen significant change and improvements at the GCSB,” Mr Finlayson said. “The statutory review of the intelligence agencies, due to start shortly, will likely herald a further period of change.”

“Mr Fletcher has decided that opening the door for a new Director now means the same person can be involved in the review process, as well as in subsequent decision-making and implementation, rather than changing leadership mid-programme.”

“I thank him for his leadership of the GCSB and wish him all the best for the future,” Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Fletcher will finish in the role on 27 February. An acting Director will be appointed to act in the position from that date.
