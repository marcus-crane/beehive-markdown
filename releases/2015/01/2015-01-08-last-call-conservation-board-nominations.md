Associate Minister of Conservation, Hon Nicky Wagner today encouraged New Zealanders passionate about conservation to seek nomination for conservation boards, before nominations close on 20 January.

“Kiwis love to get out and about during the summer months. As well as enjoying our magnificent country, we are also passionate about looking after it,” Ms Wagner says.

“Serving on a Conservation Board is a great opportunity to become more involved in conservation in the community. Boards are the link between the community and the Department of Conservation, and represent the public’s interest in conservation at both a national and regional level.

There are 14 conservation boards with up to 12 members each: Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, East Coast/Hawke’s Bay, Tongariro/Taupo, Taranaki/Whanganui, Wellington, Chatham Islands, Nelson/Marlborough, West Coast Tai Poutini*,* Canterbury Aoraki, Otago, and Southland. The Boards meet four to five times a year.

“Conservation Board members bring a diverse array of knowledge and skills to conservation management and are an asset to the communities they represent.

“Conservation Boards work best when they reflect the rich diversity of New Zealand society, so I encourage New Zealanders from all walks of life, with an interest in conservation, to seek nomination,” Ms Wagner says.

Appointments will take effect from 1 July 2015, and will be for a term of up to three years.

Nominations for the Conservation Boards close 20 January 2015 at 5pm. Additional information and nomination forms may be obtained at [**www.conservationboards.org.nz**](http://www.conservationboards.org.nz)**.**
