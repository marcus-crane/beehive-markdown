Attorney-General, Christopher Finlayson, will represent New Zealand at the 70th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in Poland on 27 January, International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Mr Finlayson is accompanied by Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Hon Annette King, underscoring the importance of the commemoration to all New Zealanders.

“We must never forget the atrocities that took place during the Second World War,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Every year there are fewer Holocaust survivors and, as the Holocaust slips out of living memory, we must ensure their memories live on – unaltered and undoctored – for future generations.”

“Just as we recoiled at the horror of the events in Paris earlier this month, we must continue to condemn racism and anti-Semitism. This day serves as a stark reminder of a history that must never be repeated,” Mr Finlayson said.

Former Auschwitz prisoners, other Holocaust survivors and representatives from countries around the world will attend the main commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz in front of the Death Gate of Auschwitz II–Birkenau.

"Our thoughts are with the New Zealand Jewish community today as we pay tribute to the memory of the millions who suffered under the Nazi regime,” Mr Finlayson said.
