Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today officially opened a new facility for children undergoing cancer treatment in Christchurch.

“The new interim Child Haematology and Oncology Centre at Christchurch Hospital will help staff to deliver the best possible care for children undergoing cancer treatment,” says Dr Coleman.

“The new facility is double the size of the old unit, and it reflects the increased demand for specialist child cancer services for the South Island and lower half of the North Island. Around 60 children diagnosed with cancer each year are referred to the Canterbury service.

“These children require complex medical care and are often inpatients for long periods of time. Having fit for purpose facilities is vital. The new unit has 11 en-suite bedrooms with pull-down beds for caregivers, separate isolation rooms, a play area, an area for teenagers, and family spaces.”

The new facility replaces the existing unit which was set up 12 years ago. It will move into the new Acute Services Building as part of the $650 million Christchurch Hospital redevelopment project which is due for completion at Burwood in 2016 and Christchurch in 2018. The interim facility will be designed to accommodate other clinical services.

“Delivering better cancer services is a top priority. The Government has raised the bar for cancer treatment,” says Dr Coleman.

“Under the new national health target people with suspected cancer will get faster tests and treatment. From 1 October 2014, 90 per cent of patients are to receive their first treatment within 62 days of being referred urgently with a high suspicion of cancer by June 2017.”
