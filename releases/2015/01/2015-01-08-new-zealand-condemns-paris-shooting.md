Prime Minister John Key has strongly condemned the violent attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris.

“This horrific attack has reportedly left 12 people dead and others fighting for their lives,” Mr Key says.

“Our thoughts are with the families of those who have lost loved ones, those injured in this brutal attack, and the people of France.”

The French authorities have confirmed the shooting was politically motivated.

“The targeting of journalists going about their daily work is an attack on the fourth estate and the democratic principles of freedom of speech and expression, which must be strongly condemned.”

“We hope those responsible for this attack can be quickly apprehended and brought to justice for their crimes,” Mr Key says.

At this stage there are no reports of any New Zealanders caught up in the attack.

New Zealanders in Paris are advised to follow the advice of the local authorities and register their details at [www.safetravel.co.nz](http://www.safetravel.co.nz)
