Working-age Pacific people recorded the largest fall in work-ready jobseeker numbers over the last year, new statistics show.

The number of work-ready Pacific people receiving Jobseeker Support fell by 6.9% in the year to December, down by 404 to 5,485.

“This is good news for our Pacific community,” said Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga. “People exit the benefit system for a wide range of reasons, but the main one is because they are starting a job.”

The reduction in Pacific jobseekers during the last quarter has come at a time when the figures traditionally increase. Pacific people recorded a larger percentage decrease for the quarter and the year than other groups.  

The number of work-ready Pacific youth (aged 18-24) on Jobseeker Support fell by 2.6% over the last year. The largest decreases in Pacific people on the benefit were in the Auckland, Southern and Wellington regions.

“We begin 2015 in good shape.  The economy is expanding, unemployment is falling, wages are expected to rise and interest rates are staying lower for longer,” said Mr Lotu-Iiga. “These latest statistics show how hard working Pacific New Zealanders can make progress and realise the value that comes with paid employment.”

“This is positive for our families, communities and the country.  It also reflects that more young Pacific people are gaining qualifications and moving into sustainable, higher paying jobs”

These statistics follow on from figures released last year which showed more Pacific people were employed and unemployment dropped.
