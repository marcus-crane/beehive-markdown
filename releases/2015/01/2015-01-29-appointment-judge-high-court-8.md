Christchurch Barrister and Solicitor Gerald Hope Nation has been appointed a Judge of the High Court, Attorney‑General Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Justice Nation graduated with an LLB(Hons) from the University of Canterbury in 1974 and commenced work as a barrister and solicitor with Wynn Williams, where he had been employed as a law clerk for the previous year. At the end of 1975 he left Wynn Williams to travel overseas.

Justice Nation returned to Wynn Williams on his return to New Zealand in 1978 and was admitted to the firm’s partnership in 1979, subsequently being appointed the partnership’s Chair. He has remained with that firm to date, specialising primarily in dispute resolution, criminal defence and prosecution and relationship property, trust and estate litigation.

The new Judge will sit in Christchurch.
