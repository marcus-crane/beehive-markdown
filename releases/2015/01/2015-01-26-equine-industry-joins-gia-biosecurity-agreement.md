Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed a fourth primary industry to the GIA partnership today.

The New Zealand Equine Health Association has signed the Deed of the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) for Biosecurity Readiness and Response at the Karaka yearling sales today.

“This means the horse racing, recreational and breeding industry and the Ministry for Primary Industries can work together to manage and respond to the most important biosecurity risks.

“The equine industry is an important primary industry exporter with a strong international reputation. It supports almost 17,000 full-time jobs and contributes more than $1.6 billion to the New Zealand economy from both domestic and export activity.

“We are fortunate that our horse population is free of equine influenza – probably the industry’s most serious disease threat. However, we must be vigilant to maintain that status.

“I’m pleased the industry has recognised the value that GIA offers in terms of working together to maximise our collective strengths,” says Mr Guy.

New Zealand Pork, Kiwifruit Vine Health and Pipfruit New Zealand signed the GIA Deed in 2014.
