Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today released the 2015 Occupation Outlook report and mobile App, which allows students and their families to easily compare the job prospects and incomes of 50 different careers and help them make good study choices, both in tertiary education and at senior secondary school level.

"We know that New Zealand is quickly developing a more highly-skilled economy", Mr Joyce says. "That means it is more important than ever for students to consider carefully their tertiary study options with future career options in mind.  This free Occupation Outlook App provides all the crucial information to help make those career choices."

The third annual Occupation Outlook report and App brings together the latest information from employers, industries, the education sector and labour market analysts in an easy-to-use overview of job demand, likely income levels, and training requirements for each of the 50 different career options.

"There is no doubt that the demand for some types of work is growing more rapidly than for others, while demand for unskilled people is growing at a much lower level," Mr Joyce says.

"Access to high-demand higher-skilled occupations such as engineering and ICT that provide stimulating work and good incomes is often determined by the study choices young people make before they enter senior secondary school.  While not everyone wants to be an engineer, it is important that young people know all the options that are available and the subjects that lead to them."

The 50 occupations on the App are grouped under the industry pathways used in the Government’s Vocational Pathways programme: Construction and Infrastructure, Manufacturing and Technology, Primary Industries, Service Industries, Creative Industries, and Social and Community Services.  Included in this year's report are two special features on careers in the manufacturing and the primary industries.

“Job prospects in manufacturing are growing rapidly,” Mr Joyce says. “New Zealand’s traditional manufacturing industries, based on primary sector processing, are a vital part of the economy. However we are also growing a significant number of niche hi-tech manufacturers that are seeking skilled graduates at both degree and diploma level.

“Career prospects in the primary industries are another growth area, and a job in a primary industry offers many pathways and opportunities for specialisation.

"Whichever discipline that young people choose to study, it's important that they make the most of their tertiary education," Mr Joyce says.

"It is clear from the Household Labour Force Survey that those with qualifications are less likely to be unemployed - and that continues through their working lives.   For example the unemployment rate for people with a bachelors degree or higher in New Zealand is currently just 3.2 per cent, compared with 8 per cent for those people without any qualification."

The Occupation Outlook App includes several new features, such as improved search and share functions. It is available for unlimited downloads from the App Store for iPhones and iPod touch devices, and the Google Play store for Android devices.

The Occupation Outlook report is published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and draws on a wide range of information:

- Actual employment trends and other key statistics compiled by MBIE and Statistics New Zealand
- Expertise from Careers NZ, tertiary institutions, industry associations, industry training organisations, licence and registration boards, and other industry stakeholders
- Qualification completions and graduate income information from the Ministry of Education.
