A fourth round of passes to Anzac Day commemorations in Turkey were this week offered to those on the Gallipoli 2015 ballot wait list, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says.

The 131 successful applicants have until midday on 2 February to accept the offer of two attendance passes and confirm travel arrangements for themselves and their accompanying person. 

“I encourage anyone not in a position to travel to Turkey to decline their passes as soon as possible so they can be reallocated to the next person on the wait list,” Mr Foss says.

“We want to make sure as many people as possible are given the opportunity to attend the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.”

Attendance passes will be printed in February and delivered by early March.

With limited time left to make travel arrangements, it is possible a further reallocation may take place after the 2 February deadline.

Anyone with queries regarding their application should contact the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office by emailing [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz) or calling 0800 336 547.
