Justice Minister Amy Adams has today confirmed that judicial review proceedings undertaken by David Bain have been discontinued, following an agreement between the two parties.

“With the matter resolved, Cabinet can now resume its consideration of Mr Bain’s claim for compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment,” says Ms Adams.

In February 2013, at Mr Bain's request, Cabinet agreed that consideration of Mr Bain's application for compensation would be put on hold, pending determination of judicial review proceedings he had filed. Those judicial review proceedings have been discontinued by Mr Bain.

“This discontinuance does not resolve Mr Bain’s underlying compensation claim, just the separate judicial review process. I plan to discuss next steps with my Cabinet colleagues over the coming weeks,” says Ms Adams.

“While the details of the agreement are confidential, I can confirm that there was no contribution made towards Mr Bain’s compensation claim as part of this discontinuance.”

There will be a further announcement regarding the consideration of the application in due course.
