Prime Minister John Key has extended his condolences to the people of Saudi Arabia following the passing of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz. 

 

“King Abdullah was a leading figure in the Middle East, an advocate for Arab unity in an often divided region, and a strong voice for peace,” says Mr Key.

 

“He oversaw an unprecedented era of economic development in Saudi Arabia and under his rule the Kingdom has solidified its position as an economic and political force.

 

“His loss will be felt acutely by his family, the people of Saudi Arabia, and the wider Middle East.

 

“On behalf of the people of New Zealand I would like to extend our sincere condolences to the people of Saudi Arabia at this difficult time, and acknowledge the contribution King Abdullah made to his country and to global affairs.”

 

King Abdullah, who also held the title of The Guardian of the Two Holy Places, came to the throne in 2005. He has been succeeded by his brother, King Salman.
