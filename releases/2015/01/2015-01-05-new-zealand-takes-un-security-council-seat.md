Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed New Zealand taking up its seat as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

“New Zealand’s term on the Security Council will place us at the heart of international decision-making for the next two years,” Mr McCully says.

“The Security Council is currently considering some of the most pressing issues the international community faces, including; the dire humanitarian situation in Syria, ISIL, and Ebola.

“It’s been 21 years since New Zealand last served on the Security Council. We are ready to serve again and to provide and independent voice at the world’s top table.

“Importantly, we will seek to ensure that the perspective of small states is reflected in the workings of the Council,” Mr McCully says.

New Zealand’s term on the Council runs until 31 December 2016.
