Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says he has asked officials to conduct a review of the regulatory framework for small passenger services, such as taxis and private hire car services.

“The Government is a strong supporter of innovations that enable all New Zealanders and businesses in New Zealand, traditional or otherwise, to enjoy the benefits of new technology,” Mr Foss says.

“We aim to ensure New Zealand’s regulatory environment is both fit for purpose and flexible enough to accommodate new technologies.

“I understand a range of taxi companies and hire car services, including Uber, provide booking apps.  These apps are broadly compatible with the current law, provided there is a clear distinction between a taxi and a private hire service.”

Mr Foss says he met with a number of key players in both the taxi and private hire service industries late last year.

“There are a range of views that need to be taken into account and a number of implications to consider.  I have asked officials to conduct a review of the relevant regulatory framework, to be completed by mid-2015.”

Any change to legislation would include a consultation process.
