Foreign Minister Murray McCully is travelling to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to attend the 24th African Union Summit which runs from 26 to 27 January.  

“This Summit is attended by ministers from nearly all of the 54 African Union states and allows New Zealand to engage directly on issues like regional security, agricultural cooperation, and renewable energy,” Mr McCully says.

  “As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, New Zealand is committed to listening to all states on matters that come before the Council, and the AU Summit is a chance to hear directly from African leaders.

”  Following the African Union Summit, the Foreign Minister will visit Jordan, to discuss regional security issues.  

“New Zealand and Jordan are currently serving together on the Security Council. This visit provides an opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria, ISIL, and the Middle East Peace Process.  

“Jordan is seeing first-hand the impact the crisis in Syria is having on the wider region, and their perceptive on addressing this pressing humanitarian situation is particularly valuable,” Mr McCully says.
