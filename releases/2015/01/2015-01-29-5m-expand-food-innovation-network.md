Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced that Callaghan Innovation will invest almost $5 million over five years in a project that will expand New Zealand’s Food Innovation Network.

FoodSouth, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Canterbury Development Corporation (CDC), will use the funding to build a food innovation centre and pilot production plant at Lincoln University to support South Island food and beverages businesses.

“The FoodSouth facility will provide South Island-based food and beverage companies with a one-stop-shop range of product development services, expertise, and equipment to help accelerate the development of innovative high-value products,” says Mr Joyce.

“Callaghan Innovation was created to help Kiwi businesses succeed through innovation. Growing innovations into high-value exports in turn helps to grow our economy.”

The Food Innovation Network supports businesses through the product innovation process, from concept to commercial-scale manufactured product that is ready for market.

The new facility is one of four throughout New Zealand – along with Auckland’s FoodBowl, Palmerston North’s FoodPilot, and FoodWaikato in Hamilton - that make up the Food Innovation Network.

Callaghan Innovation is contributing $2.7m in capital funding and up to $400,000 a year in running costs over five years to the FoodSouth facility, with the CDC providing $200,000 a year. Site services and accommodation will be provided by Lincoln University.

The FoodSouth facility is likely to open in mid-2015.
