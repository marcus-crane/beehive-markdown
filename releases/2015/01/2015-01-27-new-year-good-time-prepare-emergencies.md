With many of us finishing our summer break and gearing up for the new work and school year, now’s the time to check that we’re prepared for an emergency, says Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye.

“The start of the year provides a great opportunity to sit down and develop your household emergency plan.

“Learn about the hazards in your area, figure out where you’ll meet if you can’t get home, decide who your emergency contacts will be and check what supplies you will need.”

Ms Kaye says the Wilberforce earthquake near Arthur’s Pass early in 2015 is a timely reminder that an emergency can happen anywhere at any time.

“Fortunately this quake was centred well away from a highly populated area, but as we know from the devastating Canterbury quakes, we won’t always be so lucky.”

Essential emergency supplies that every household should have include:

- enough non-perishable food and drinking water for at least three days (ideally, a minimum of three litres of water per person, per day)
- a first aid kit
- a torch, radio and spare batteries.

A portable getaway kit is also a good idea, in case you need to leave your home in a hurry.

Items in the getaway kit should include snack food, water, a first aid kit, wind/waterproof clothing, strong outdoor shoes and any other essential items your family or pets may need.

“In New Zealand, we’re at risk from all sorts of events, from floods and landslides to earthquakes and tsunami. 

“You never know when it might happen, so the key is to be prepared for the day when you may find yourself in an emergency situation.”
