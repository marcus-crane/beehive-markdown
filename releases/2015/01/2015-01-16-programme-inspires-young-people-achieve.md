Youth Minister Nikki Kaye says 100 young people have been selected to take part in this year’s Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, which kicks off in Auckland next week.

“This week-long programme is about fostering and celebrating the achievements of young people living in Auckland, who are facing and successfully managing challenges in their lives,” says Ms Kaye.

“During the week, everyone involved will get to take part in a range of workshops and activities.

“High-achieving New Zealanders, such as Willie Apiata VC, swimmer Sophie Pascoe and rugby sevens player Tyla Nathan-Wong will also be there, to inspire participants with their experiences and stories.”

Activities this year will include careers-focused workshops, white water rafting, a ‘market to table’ chef’s experience, a sustainability-themed day trip to Waiheke Island and a mud run at the Hobsonville Defence Force Base.

“This is a great way to recognise young people who’ve already taken big steps themselves to make positive changes in their lives.

“At the same time, it’s about giving them extra guidance and experiences, to inspire them to keep reaching for a better future.”
