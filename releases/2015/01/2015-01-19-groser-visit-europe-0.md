Trade Minister Tim Groser will today depart for Europe to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including a meeting of Trade Ministers to discuss the WTO. He will then visit Brussels, Paris and Ankara.

“The World Economic Forum is a unique opportunity for New Zealand to engage with some of the world’s top decision-makers on current issues across the economic and political spectrum, and their implications for New Zealand,” says Mr Groser.

In Davos, Mr Groser will also attend a meeting of Trade Ministers to discuss developments in the multilateral trading system and prospects for progress ahead of the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference scheduled for December 2015.

After Davos, Minister Groser will travel to Brussels to meet with incoming European Commissioners to press the case for a NZ-EU FTA. He will also travel to Ankara for bilateral meetings and to Paris to make a presentation to a gathering of French agri-business leaders.
