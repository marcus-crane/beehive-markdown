The opening of 19 new homes in Auckland today has been welcomed by Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett as an example of New Zealand’s growing social housing sector, which is seeing more people in need receiving housing support.  

Community of Refuge Trust’s (CORT) Mt Wellington development, built with a $3.2 million contribution from the Government’s Social Housing Fund, will see around 22 people on low-incomes supported into affordable and good quality housing.

“Yesterday the Prime Minister announced the Government’s plan for how we will provide more social housing for New Zealanders in need,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Developments like this Mt Wellington site are fundamental to building a strong social housing sector, and it’s fantastic to have these new units on board along with others being developed by community housing providers across Auckland and around the country.”

The income-related rent subsidy, which the Government yesterday committed to increasing to 65,000 by 2017/18, will ensure tenants moving into these new homes will pay an affordable rent, alongside receiving social tenancy services.

“This means people who would have otherwise struggled to find suitable accommodation now have access to housing that’s right for them and the support they need to meet their needs,” says Mrs Bennett.

Community housing providers across the country play a vital role providing wraparound services that help people in social housing with the challenges they face. This includes mental health support, budgeting advice, help with family violence, drug or alcohol issues, support into housing independence and many other services alongside safe and stable accommodation.

“Growing a successful social housing sector means more than simply building a house for every person and family in need. It is linking accommodation with wider support that backs families to lead great lives, no matter how tough their circumstances are,” says Mrs Bennett.  

“The goal of the Social Housing Reform Programme is supporting more New Zealanders in need with housing that meets their need, and as the Prime Minister outlined yesterday the Government is committed to achieving this, and making a difference where it’s most important.”
