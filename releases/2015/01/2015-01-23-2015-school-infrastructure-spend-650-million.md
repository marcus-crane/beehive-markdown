Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye says 2015 will see major school property developments as the Government invests around $650 million in maintaining, modernising and replacing buildings and infrastructure.

“A number of new schools will open in the next few weeks, and this year will see a continuation of the major redevelopment of existing schools,” says Ms Kaye.

The new schools include Ormiston Primary School in Flat Bush, Auckland; Endeavour School in Flagstaff, Hamilton; and Shotover Primary School, near Queenstown.

Significant redevelopment will be carried out at Otahuhu and Warkworth Schools, and a second public private partnership will commence involving two schools in Christchurch, one in Queenstown and one in Auckland.

Up to 240 extra classrooms will also be provided to schools with increasing rolls.

“Last year, the Government committed to accelerating new schools and major redevelopment in Auckland, totalling $350 million, and this will also be a major priority.

“It’s important we get ahead of demand to ensure there’s sufficient school capacity in our biggest city, and we’ve begun moving to acquire sites to meet the needs of Auckland’s rapid population growth.

“I expect to make further announcements about this and other school infrastructure developments during 2015.

“This Government is committed to ensuring school infrastructure around the country can support modern learning environments, to help bring about the best outcomes for students.”
