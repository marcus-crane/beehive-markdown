A record number of calls to essential services have been made by non-English speakers using the government’s interpreting service Language Line, says Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

Nearly 55,000 phone calls to Language Line were made by people who speak little or no English to communicate with government agencies, health providers, banks, insurance companies and utilities companies in 2013/14.

Language Line offers free and immediate access to interpreters speaking 44 languages. It started nearly 12 years ago and was opened to selected private sector organisations in mid 2013.

“Extending Language Line to the private sector has made it easier for new migrants and their families to integrate quickly and successfully into New Zealand life,” said Mr Lotu-Iiga.  “It also makes it easier for ethnic and migrant communities to do business here.”

A wide range of agencies have used Language Line’s qualified interpreters to help support people settling in New Zealand.

Utility companies such as Genesis Energy and Mercury Energy have accessed an interpreter on average 289 times a month over the last four months.

Non-English speakers have been better able to access the health sector through Language Line, including services such as family planning, rest home care, midwife services and Quitline. Helplines for services such as problem gambling, family violence and for victims of crime have also tapped into Language Line. Agencies such as the Real Estate Agents Authority, the Privacy Commissioner, the Banking Ombudsman and the Independent Police Conduct Authority have also used the service.

“The expansion of Language Line and its increased uptake underscores the value the Government places on New Zealand’s migrant and ethnic communities,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga. “We are committed to seeing every person in this country receive the information, advice and services they need to get ahead and make a better life for themselves and their families.”
