Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more support is being provided for newly qualified midwives.

“It is important that new mothers and babies receive high quality care across New Zealand,” says Dr Coleman.

The Midwifery Council and the New Zealand College of Midwives, with the support of Health Workforce New Zealand, have developed an enhanced mentoring programme as part of the Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme.

“The sector has worked together to develop an enhanced mentoring programme for new midwifes,” says Dr Coleman.

“Newly qualified midwifes will now benefit from extra clinical support, mentoring and supervision. The programme will help to increase graduates’ confidence, and help to assure families about the quality of care.

“It will be compulsory for newly registered midwifes practising in New Zealand, and the Midwifery Council will have a more defined role to support new midwifes. There will also be improved performance expectations and support for midwifes mentoring graduates.”

Health Workforce New Zealand has committed $2.77 million to support the programme.

The changes to the Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme will be introduced from 1 February 2015 to coincide with the start of the first new graduate midwife group.
