Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says more children than ever are benefiting from the free before school health checks.

“The B4 School Checks help to give children the best start at school by identifying and addressing any potential health or developmental problems at an early stage,” says Dr Coleman.

“In 2013/14 the programme reached 91 per cent of all four-year-olds, an increase of 11 per cent on the previous 12 months. Uptake of B4 School Checks was also 90 per cent among those living in high deprivation areas.  

“We want to see every family participate in the free before school health check. B4 School Check providers are working closely with other services such as early childhood education, and focusing on harder to reach communities, to encourage uptake.”

Introduced in 2008, the B4 School Check is the final core Well Child/Tamariki Ora check. Checks are provided free through a range of community health services and include hearing, eyesight, height, weight, and oral health assessments, as well as comprehensive health and development questionnaires.

Getting the check as close to four years as possible ensures families are able to connect with any additional support services they might need before their child starts school.

In the six months to the end of December 2014, 29,558 four-year-olds were screened nationwide, an increase on the 29,196 screened in the same period in 2013.
