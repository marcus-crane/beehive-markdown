Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry today paid tribute to the life of renowned architect Sir Ian Athfield KNZM, who has passed away aged 74.

“Sir Ian Athfield has played a major part in shaping modern New Zealand architecture and has made an enormous contribution to the city of Wellington he loved so much,” says Ms Barry.

“He was involved in many projects throughout New Zealand since the 1960s, most recently with his creative input to the Christchurch rebuild.

“I offer my condolences to his family, and it is a small comfort that he knew of his knighthood. He was one of New Zealand’s great characters and he will be missed.”
