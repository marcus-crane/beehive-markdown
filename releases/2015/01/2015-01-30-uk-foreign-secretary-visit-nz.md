Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the upcoming visit to New Zealand by Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Rt Hon Philip Hammond.

“New Zealand and the UK have an excellent relationship, underscored by strong political, defence, and trade links,” Mr McCully says.

“The UK is New Zealand’s fifth largest trading partner, and a key market for New Zealand lamb, fruit, and wine.

“New Zealand has recently commenced a two year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security and my talks with Foreign Secretary Hammond will also focus on areas where we can work constructively with the UK at the UN.

“This year is important in marking the centenary of the First World War. The related events are a chance to reinforce our historic bonds with the UK and jointly remember our shared sacrifice during that war,” Mr McCully says.

Foreign Secretary Hammond will be in New Zealand from 2 February to 4 February.
