Police Minister Michael Woodhouse has asked New Zealand Police to undertake a review of the public messages that underpinned the 2014/15 Summer Road Safety campaign.

"While I firmly support Police's zero tolerance for poor driving behaviour that can lead to death and injury on our roads, I also support the application of discretion as articulated in the 4kph summer tolerance used in fixed speed cameras and the vast majority of mobile devices," Mr Woodhouse says.

"I have received considerable public feedback that the speed tolerance message was confusing which has led to some strong public opinions.

“Police share my enthusiasm for clearly articulated safety messages that maintain public confidence and I want to be sure we have those messages clear. That is why I have asked that review be completed in time for any changes to be made before the Easter holiday period.

"While this is very much an operational matter for Police, I will be taking a close interest in ensuring the message about road safety is clear and unambiguous.

“It is important that the Police and public work together to ensure our roads are a safe place to be, especially over the summer while there are more people on the road.”
