Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss will visit Turkey this week to meet key officials and review plans for this year’s Anzac Day commemorations.

The 2015 service will mark 100 years since Anzac troops landed on the Gallipoli peninsula.

“New Zealand and Turkey share a strong relationship built on our shared history at Gallipoli,” Mr Foss says.

“I look forward to touring the peninsula and getting an update on what will be a large and historically significant event.

“With more than 10,000 people expected to attend the dawn service, it’s vital that New Zealand, Australia and Turkey work together to ensure the commemorations run safely and smoothly.”

Mr Foss will also visit Ankara to meet Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and National Defence Minister Ismet Yilmaz.

While there he will pay his respects to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, by laying a wreath at his tomb.

On the way back to New Zealand, in his capacity as Associate Immigration Minister, Mr Foss will visit Immigration New Zealand’s Shanghai office.
