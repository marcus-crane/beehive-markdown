Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has paid tribute to former Children’s Commissioner John Angus who died this week after battling illness.

“Dr Angus, who served as Commissioner for Children between 2009 and 2011, was devoted to improving the lives of New Zealand children,” says Mrs Tolley.

“Beginning his distinguished career as a social worker in Dunedin, Dr Angus rose through the management ranks of the country’s social welfare system focused on improving social policy and services for vulnerable children and their families.

“Even in retirement, Dr Angus continued to make a huge contribution with advisory work that included chairing a panel for complaints involving Child, Youth and Family as well as policy development on artificial reproductive technology.  He also played a major role in the development of the Green Paper and the subsequent Children’s Action Plan.

“A tireless advocate for the rights of children, Dr Angus believed firmly that children are not just junior members of a family but citizens of New Zealand in their own right. 

“This week, thousands of people who worked with John will be reflecting on his wit, dedication and hard work on behalf of kiwi kids.  Our thoughts and best wishes are with his loved ones including his wife Sally,” says Mrs Tolley.
