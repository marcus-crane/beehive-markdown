Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga will hold an evening community forum for residents of central Auckland tomorrow.

"The forums will give us opportunities to discuss the issues and challenges facing our ethnic communities," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"We will also focus on how we can help New Zealand move forward together economically, socially and culturally by working closely to inform government policy and practice.

"I want the forums to be a productive discussion on what we each want to achieve and any perceived barriers to us getting there," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand is seeing the benefits of ethnic diversity, not just economically but culturally as well. Our diversity continues to grow every year and ethnic communities are becoming more established, enriching our cultural landscape.

"I am looking forward to engaging with our growing ethnic groups of different cultures and faiths."

The forum is one of a series being held around the country. Between now and mid-July similar gatherings will be held in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Invercargill, Palmerston North and New Plymouth.
