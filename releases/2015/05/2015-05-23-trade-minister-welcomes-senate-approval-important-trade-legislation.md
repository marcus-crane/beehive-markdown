Trade Minister Tim Groser welcomes the approval of legislation by the United States Senate that would grant Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).

TPA would allow the President to propose trade agreements that the US Congress can either approve or reject, but not change. The Senate voted to pass the bill 62 to 37 with bipartisan support.

“The passage of TPA through the Senate is a welcome development, however the bill still needs to be approved by the US House of Representatives" says Mr Groser.

“I hope that next crucial step is completed equally successfully and that it enables the conclusion of a high-quality, comprehensive, 21st century TPP agreement in the coming months.”

“Trade agreements like TPP help open up markets for Kiwi exporters, and exports drive economic growth and create jobs for New Zealanders. New Zealand needs to keep negotiating free trade agreements to ensure a level playing field for our exporters”, says Mr Groser.

TPA will now proceed to be considered by the United States House of Representatives.
