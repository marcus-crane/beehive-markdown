Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry has welcomed a report highlighting the value of older workers to New Zealand’s economy – and identifying the discrimination many of them still face.

The Workforce Ageing Survey 2014 has found workers aged 50 and over are seen as valuable and hardworking by employers – regarded as more productive and better in a crisis.

2,631 employers and employees from Crown Entities and District Health Boards took part in the survey, a collaboration between the Office for Senior Citizens and the Human Rights Commission.

“Older people are key contributors to our economy. They are our skilled workers, mentors and leaders.” Ms Barry says.

“As the recent Report on the Positive Ageing Strategy showed, in our ageing society more and more older people are staying in the workforce past the age of 65. 22 per cent of over-65s are currently in some form of paid employment and this will rise to more than 30 per cent by 2036.”

Despite the advantages of older workers, the survey showed that few organisations have the structures in place to reap the benefits. This includes a lack of planning to recruit older people to the workforce.

Age discrimination also remains a problem in many workplaces. Around 40 per cent of older workers have experienced some form of age related discrimination in the last five years.

“This is unacceptable. Older people still want rewarding and challenging careers, and the skills they have are highly desirable for businesses,” Ms Barry says.

“We also want older people to be able to continue to work if they choose to. They are critical to the success and growth of New Zealand’s economy now and in the future.”

Older Kiwis represent a powerful market force which businesses and organisations should be prepared to cater for.

“By 2035, there will be 1.2 million New Zealanders over the age of 65 and they will have significant combined spending power in our economy.”
