Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the update of a successful anti-bullying guide, which incorporates suggestions from schools and boards of trustees.

“The 2015 edition of *Bullying prevention and response: A guide for schools* will help schools prevent and respond to bullying to keep students safe and give them the best opportunities to learn,” says Ms Parata.

“Happy, confident students are likely to stay in education longer and do better at school and later in life. I strongly encourage schools to make use of the 2015 guide, as part of their whole-school approach to student wellbeing.”

The guide was produced by the Bullying Prevention Advisory Group, which includes sector representatives and agencies and is chaired by the Secretary for Education Peter Hughes.

The updated guide includes an improved practical tool for schools to use when developing and reviewing bullying prevention and response policies, and more information on cyberbullying and digital technology, homophobic bullying, and students’ responsibilities in the context of bullying.

“Bullying is a serious issue that all schools face,” says Ms Parata. “It harms children and young people and contributes to poor education and life outcomes. This guide supports schools to create safe and positive environments that help improve student wellbeing.”
