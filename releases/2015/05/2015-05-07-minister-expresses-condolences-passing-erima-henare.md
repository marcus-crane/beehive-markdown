*Kua hinga te tōtara o Te Wao-nui-a-Tāne,*

*Ka tangi a Ngāti Hine, ka tangi te motu,*

*Ko te pou tokomanawa o te reo kua wahangū.*

*A tree has fallen in the great forest of Tāne*

*Ngāti Hine mourns, and the nation mourns with them,*

*The mainstay of the Māori language has been silenced.*

Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has extended her condolences to the family of Erima Henare who passed away suddenly, aged 61.

“Erima was a widely-respected Ngāti Hine leader. His prominence in Māoridom

and his extensive management and governance experience made him a valuable member of the Creative New Zealand Arts Council,” says Ms Barry.

Erima served on a number of other regional and national boards and committees, including the Waitangi National Trust Board, and both the Heritage New Zealand Board and Heritage New Zealand’s Māori Heritage Council.

He had been Chair of Te Taura Whiri i te reo Māori since 2006. He was also an executive director of Māori at Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, and he served as an advisor to Kingi Tuheitia.

“Erima’s sudden passing is a real loss to the culture and heritage sectors. I acknowledge the far-reaching contribution he made to our public service and to his people in no small part due to his personal qualities and ability as a gifted communicator.”
