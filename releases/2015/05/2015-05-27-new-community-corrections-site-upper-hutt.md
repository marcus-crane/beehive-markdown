Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially opened the refurbished Upper Hutt Community Corrections site.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the improvements will benefit staff, visitors and community-based offenders who report to the site.

One of the key features of the refurbishment is the reception counter that has anti-climb features and is overlooked by staff in an open plan work area for increased visibility and security. 

The $4.68 million refurbishment included extending the original building, upgrading security and technology and an improved community work area.

“The upgrades mean that this building is now a flagship Community Corrections site,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This fit for purpose site will assist the department’s goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”

A total of 27 staff work at Upper Hutt Community Corrections. The site currently manages 189 offenders on 320 sentences and orders including home detention and community work.

Corrections manages offenders to ensure they comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of reoffending, minimise their risk to others and help them become productive and contributing members of the community.
