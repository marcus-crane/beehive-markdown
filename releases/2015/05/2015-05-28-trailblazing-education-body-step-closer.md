“Today’s gazetting of the official start date for the Education Council (EDUCANZ) is another step along the path towards the creation of a trailblazing professional leadership body,” Education Minister Hekia Parata says.

The gazette notice confirms the Council will replace the New Zealand Teachers’ Council from 1 July 2015.

Ms Parata says the Education Council is the new professional and regulatory body for the teaching profession.

“It will work with the profession to champion new ideas and excellent teaching practice and provide inspirational education leadership in the same way as professional bodies in Australia, Great Britain and the United States do.

“The Council will be an independent body. It will be able to set its own agenda, commission its own research and lead public discussion on education issues. It will also, from 1 July, assume responsibility for all matters to do with the registration and disciplining of the teaching profession.

“New Zealand’s teachers, for the first time, will soon have a body dedicated to raising and strengthening their professional status. At least five of the Council’s members must be registered teachers with a current practicing certificate, so the profession will be well represented.

“I thank all members of the Teachers’ Council, past and present, for their dedication to making the teaching profession one that all New Zealanders can have confidence in. I particularly want to thank the council’s staff for their hard work to ensure a smooth transition to the new body. They have been the epitome of professionalism.

“I also want to thank the members of the EDUCANZ Transition Board who have worked so hard to establish the new professional body.” 

Ms Parata will shortly announce the members of the new EDUCANZ Council.

“Some 145 nominations were received for the nine Education Council positions. Our best educators want in. All are excited about the possibilities the Council offers to further improve our education system. This high degree of interest and support bodes well for the Council’s future,” Ms Parata says.
