The Crown and the Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority (Tūhoronuku IMA) have signed Terms of Negotiation and are ready to begin negotiating a Treaty settlement for the benefit of all Ngāpuhi, Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Tūhoronuku IMA is the mandated representative of Ngāpuhi, New Zealand’s largest iwi, for Treaty of Waitangi settlement negotiations.

"This is an important milestone for Ngāpuhi,” Mr Finlayson said. “We can now begin genuine conversations with hapū about their specific concerns and work towards a settlement that will provide all Ngāpuhi with a strong social and economic platform for the future.”

This announcement is particularly significant given that today also marks the 20th Anniversary of the signing of Tainui’s Treaty of Waitangi settlement.

“Tainui provides an excellent example of just what an iwi can achieve for its people post-settlement,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Terms of Negotiation set out the rules of engagement for the settlement negotiation, each party’s position on various issues and the broad scope of the negotiations.

“We cannot predetermine what final settlement will look like, however, it could include hapū-specific redress. The outcome depends on the interests and aspirations of Ngāpuhi themselves,” Mr Finlayson said.

“Cultural redress is as important as financial redress but can take longer to negotiate as it requires identification of regional and hapū-specific interests as well as finding a way to balance these with the broad interests of all Ngāpuhi.

“Tūhoronuku IMA has worked very hard to be inclusive and I urge all Ngāpuhi hapū to step up and have their say in the settlement negotiations. I expect their leaders to continue to show generosity of spirit and make sure all can be involved.”

Mr Finlayson confirmed that the signing of Terms will not interfere with the current Waitangi Tribunal inquiry into the Crown’s decision to recognise Tūhoronuku IMA’s mandate.

“I remain confident that the decision to recognise the mandate was correct. I look forward to the Tribunal’s report and will carefully consider its views, but in the meantime there is important and urgent work to be done,” Mr Finlayson said.

“We know that the North is one of the most economically deprived regions in New Zealand. We know that more Ngāpuhi live outside their rohe than within it because of the lack of opportunity there. We also know that Ngāpuhi have already waited too long for redress.”

The Waitangi Tribunal’s Te Paparahi O Te Raki hearing will continue while negotiations with Ngāpuhi are underway.
