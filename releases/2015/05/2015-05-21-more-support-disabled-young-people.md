Disabled students with high needs will receive more support to transition from school to adult life, Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner says.

Budget 2015 delivers an additional $16.3 million over the next four years for participation and inclusion services for students with disabilities leaving school and entering the Very High Needs Scheme.

“The extra support will make a difference to the quality of life for around 300 young people facing significant challenges,” Ms Wagner says.

“Students with high needs receive support from the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme while they are at school. This boost in funding to the Very High Needs scheme ensures these young people continue to receive wraparound support as they transition from school to adult life.

“People in the Very High Needs Scheme have a significant level of physical, intellectual or sensory impairment - or a combination of these - and have significant difficulties with learning, hearing, vision, mobility, language and communication.

“This programme’s value to these young people and their families is immeasurable. Over the next three years, 100 young people will enter the scheme each year.

“A growing economy means the Government can provide better support for these young people to help them to transition from school to adult life and to participate and contribute positively to their communities and society,” Ms Wagner says.
