Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the development of new measures of educational success to be used for both internal and external evaluation of schools.

The indicators have been developed by the Education Review Office in conjunction with key academic experts and make use of evidence from high-performing schools. They are being trialled over the next few months and will be formally adopted by ERO from July next year.

“The indicators reflect our deepening understanding of how schools improve and the role of evaluation in that improvement process,” says Ms Parata.

“They will improve outcomes for all students by assisting schools and ERO to identify the factors that make a difference in classrooms.”

The 26 indicators fall into six domains that have been identified as having the most significant influence on student achievement. They are:

- Stewardship
- Leadership
- Educationally powerful connections and relationships
- Responsive curriculum, effective teaching and opportunity to learn
- Professional capability and collective capacity
- Evaluation, inquiry and knowledge building for improvement and innovation.

Ms Parata thanked all those involved in the development of a resource that will lift performance across the education system.

“This resource shines the spotlight on what matters most in achieving excellence and equity for all students.”
