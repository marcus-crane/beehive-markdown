Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the recipients of the 2015 Youth Awards.

Winners will be presented with awards at a ceremony being held at parliament tonight.

“These awards recognise young people who’ve made outstanding contributions to their communities, as well as people who’ve supported or championed young people,” says Ms Kaye.

“This year I strengthened the awards by creating new categories, reflecting the large number of nominations received last year and interest in recognising people throughout society.

“Once again, we received a huge number of nominations. Around 160 people and organisations were nominated, and of these forty recipients will receive awards.

“There are eight award categories, which celebrate qualities such as leadership and recognise activities in areas including the arts, culture, sport and the environment.

“The winners include a group of university students building financial literacy skills in schools, and a group of kayakers educating young people about sustainability using kayaks made from recycled plastic bottles.

“Individual winners include a youth worker who organised youth camps for deaf young people, a 16-year-old volunteer firefighter, and a student who’s been capturing on video the stories of remaining World War Two veterans.

“A special category this year was the Anzac Youth Award, for young people who’ve helped recognise the centenary of the Gallipoli landings. The winners in this category include a group of college students who developed a virtual landscape of the Gallipoli battlefield, for use in an educational resource.

“Among the winners of the Youth Champion award is a teacher from South Auckland who’s been inspiring students to new levels of academic success.

“I’d like to make special mention of Gabby Devine, an outstanding young New Zealander who created an initiative to provide random acts of kindness to children with cancer.

“This included giving out boredom boxes, super hero capes and other treats, all the while undergoing treatment for cancer herself.

“Gabby was nominated for this award last month, but sadly passed away just recently. However, I’m pleased that Gabby’s family will be at parliament tonight to accept her award.

“I encourage people to read about the award recipients, who demonstrate there are many young New Zealanders contributing to their communities and inspiring others.

“In my view, there are many other young people making a difference too who we don’t always hear about.

“These awards are about recognising some extraordinary young people, but also taking a moment to reflect on the positive contribution that so many young New Zealanders are making.”
