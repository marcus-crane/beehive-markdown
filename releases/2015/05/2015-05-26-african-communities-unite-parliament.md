Today is a chance for all New Zealanders to join African communities around the world in celebrating Africa Day, Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-liga says.

Africa Day will be celebrated with an event involving a diverse range of ethnic groups at Parliament this evening.

“I am delighted to join with New Zealand’s African communities to mark this significant occasion,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Africa Day celebrates the efforts to help bring about an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa and our celebration of it is a way to build better understanding and closer relationships among our increasingly diverse population.”

Africa Day marks the 1963 founding of the Organisation of African Unity, now known as the Africa Union. Its 53-member states address the challenges faced by African nations including armed conflict, climate change and poverty.

African communities also organised activities and performances in Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington to mark Africa Day.

Statistics New Zealand figures show about 47,000 people of African ethnicity live in New Zealand.
