All frontline Corrections officers are to get new lightweight stab-resistant body armour, Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced.

As part of the Corrections Staff Safety Programme, 3,500 stab-resistant vests are to be rolled out to all frontline custodial staff from next month.

"While stabbing incidents involving frontline staff are low, it is a priority for our government to keep our Corrections officers safe," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"The new body armour is lighter, less bulky and more comfortable than our current stab-resistant body armour (SRBA).  The armour is also designed to be used in conjunction with on-body cameras which are being rolled out.”

The new body armour is designed for use in high-risk prison environments. The provision of personal-issue SRBA for all frontline custodial staff means all officers will have a vest available when they are working in these environments.

"Corrections officers work in challenging and often high-risk conditions. They keep the public safe and our prisoners secure," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

This investment builds on other initiatives already in place to improve the safety of Corrections staff.  These include the availability of batons in some circumstances, pepper spray and spit hoods.  Staff are also trained in de-escalation techniques and interpersonal and tactical communications skills.
