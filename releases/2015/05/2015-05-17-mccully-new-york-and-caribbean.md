Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York today for Security Council related meetings and then to Saint Lucia to attend the annual Caribbean Foreign Minister’s Meeting (COFCOR).

“In July this year New Zealand will take over the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council for the first time this term,” Mr McCully says.

“In New York I will meet with representatives from the five permanent members of the Security Council, and host an event focused on the issues faced by Small Island Developing States, in preparation for our presidency.

“The COFCOR meeting in St Lucia meeting is an opportunity to advance New Zealand’s cooperation with Caribbean sates, particularly in areas such as renewable energy, and seek the views of leaders and Ministers on the issues affecting the region.

“While in Saint Lucia I will visit the Soufriere geothermal area, where New Zealand has committed $1 million for a surface exploration programme to support development of the geothermal resource,” Mr McCully says.

The Minister will also formally open New Zealand’s High Commission in Bridgetown, Barbados during the trip.
