Changes that make it easier for Māori land owners to use and develop their whenua will be the focus of discussions at 23 regional consultation hui announced today by Māori Development Minister, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

Consultation has taken place throughout the review and proposed reform of Te Ture Whenua Māori. Māori landowners are now being asked to give feedback on the draft Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill to ensure it is workable and reflects their aspirations.

“The reform of Te Ture Whenua Māori is a landmark for Aotearoa New Zealand. It is essential that iwi, hapū and whānau Māori are informed and engaged in this reform,” says Mr Flavell. 

“It is the culmination of 40 years of advocacy by Māori for greater tino rangatiratanga over their whenua; whilst ensuring that land is safeguarded and retained as a taonga tuku iho for future generations.”

The review of Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 is part of a Māori land reform programme which also includes offering practical support for Māori land owners. A new $12.8 million Te Ture Whenua Māori Network was announced in the Budget last week. This network will support targeted initiatives to improve the productivity of Māori land over the next four years.

The consultation hui begin next week; Māori land owners can make oral and written submission on the Bill by 3 July 2015.
