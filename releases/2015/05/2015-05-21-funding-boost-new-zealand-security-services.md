The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Security Bureau will each receive new funding of $20 million over the next four years for essential security services, NZSIS and GCSB Minister Christopher Finlayson says.

The bulk of the funding will go towards recruitment and retention of critical staff, training, core IT and vetting services.

“The National-led Government is focused on managing New Zealand’s evolving security environment and on addressing responsibly the risks that the rapid rise of ISIL presents locally, regionally and internationally,” Mr Finlayson says.

The funding will also enable the strengthening of other core functions, such as information assurance and cyber security services to the Government and critical infrastructure organisations, counter-terrorism and domestic security.

The funding boost follows the Government’s investment in November 2014 of $7 million over two years to assist the NZSIS in responding to the foreign terrorist fighters’ threat.

“Our national security is something that affects all New Zealanders and in which we all have a stake,” Mr Finlayson says. “New Zealanders can be sure we are taking careful and responsible steps to protect their safety and security. The new funding in Budget 2015 will strengthen our ability to do so.”
