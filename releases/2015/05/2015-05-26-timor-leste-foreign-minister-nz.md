Foreign Minister McCully has welcomed tomorrow’s visit to New Zealand by Timor-Leste’s Foreign Minister, Hernani Coelho.

“New Zealand and Timor-Leste share a strong relationship based our on-going support for peace and security in Timor-Leste following their move to independence in 2002,” Mr McCully says.

“We cooperate closely on the global stage, including on UN issues. New Zealand strongly appreciated Timor-Leste’s support for our successful campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

“The visit is also an opportunity to discuss New Zealand’s $14 million development programme in Timor-Leste, which is focused on job creation in the private sector, education and skills training, and strengthening community policing,” Mr McCully says.

During his visit to Wellington, Minister Coelho will formally open Timor-Leste’s Embassy and lay a wreath at the Pukeahu National War Memorial in remembrance of victims of past conflicts.
