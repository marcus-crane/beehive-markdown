Investing $32 million of new operating expenditure in employment relations services over the next four years will help strengthen compliance with minimum employment standards, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

“Budget 2015 will increase the number of Labour Inspectors and strengthen education and information services to help manage and address breaches of employment law,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“This funding complements and provides the extra resources needed to support the package of measures I recently announced to clarify and strengthen enforcement of minimum employment standards, including tougher sanctions.

“While most employers are law-abiding, we are seeing growing incidence of serious and systemic breaches of employment standards such as the exploitation of migrants and other vulnerable workers.

“This is unfair on employees who work hard to support their families, and it damages the reputation of industry sectors here and offshore. It also means employers who are playing by the rules are undercut by employers who are breaching employment law.”

The extra funding over four years will be used for:

- Six more Labour Inspectors for Auckland, which will enable more investigations and enforcement actions in the region.
- Information and education services and campaigns. These will be funded to ensure information, guidance and advice to employees and employers is available, accessible and fit for purpose on current and new law.
- Ensure levels of service keep pace with demand.

“The Government is committed to protecting the integrity of our labour market and Budget 2015 delivers on that.”
