Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne is concerned at the use of untested and unapproved black-market psychoactive substances in the Auckland area, following recent reports of adverse reactions.

Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) test results suggest the substance in question may be MDMB-CHMICA, previously unknown in New Zealand, but responsible for numerous serious adverse effects reported overseas.

“This substance has contributed to, or been directly responsible for, at least 6 deaths in Europe and I am extremely concerned to hear that it has made its way to New Zealand.

It is precisely this sort of situation that a regulated market under the Psychoactive Substances Act was designed to avoid.

I want to reiterate that currently there are no approved psychoactive products, or licences to retail, and the distribution, sale and possession of them is illegal – end of story.

If people are aware of these, or any other psychoactive products being made available, they should contact Police to report it as soon as possible.”
