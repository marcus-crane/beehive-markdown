Composer Jack Body made an enormous contribution to the development and recognition of New Zealand music here and overseas, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

Mr Body, 70, died in Wellington on Sunday.

“An inspirational and talented composer and ethno-musicologist, he will long be remembered for his many diverse compositions, from the music for the TV series *Close to Home* to the award-winning *Pulse* which won the 2002 New Zealand Music Award for Best Classical CD,” Ms Barry says.

“He drew inspiration from other world music, particularly the Asia-Pacific region, and inspired others to broaden their musical interests and embrace new sounds and new ideas.

“Significantly, Jack Body received an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Award just prior to his death; Icon Awards are limited to 20 living artists. He had previously been made an Arts Foundation Laureate and was the first laureate to also receive an Icon Award.

“I extend my condolences to his friends and family.”
