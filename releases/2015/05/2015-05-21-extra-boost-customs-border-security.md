Budget 2015 invests an extra $4.7 million of operating funding over four years to fund extra officers to screen departing international passengers for security threats such as terrorism and drugs, Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says.

This initiative is part of a range of measures in Budget 2015 to improve security at the border, involving Immigration, Customs and Biosecurity.

“The officers will use the targeting techniques that Customs currently applies to arriving international passengers to identify departing passengers of interest who are unknown to security agencies or not on an international watch list,” Ms Wagner says.

“Customs officers will take appropriate action at the border before a person of interest leaves the country. This could include stopping them for questioning or alerting other authorities in New Zealand or abroad.

“Extended-risk screening for departures will complement the existing automated and face-to-face passport checks, and the alert system already in place, and will provide an additional source of intelligence.

“The aim is to counter potential terrorist activity, maintain New Zealand’s low risk status and contribute to international efforts to combat terrorism,” Ms Wagner says.
