Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says Road Safety Week 2015 will focus on some of our most vulnerable road users — children.

“This year’s theme — *Look out for kids —* is a reminder to all road users to slow down and take extra care around schools, parks and playgrounds,” Mr Foss says.

“Very young children are especially vulnerable on our roads, especially when walking or cycling.  In the car, appropriate child restraints are a must. 

“Too many children and young people die on our roads. We all have a role to play in keeping them safe.

“I’m pleased to see a variety of organisations getting involved in Road Safety Week, including NZ Police with ‘Giant Walk’ events in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Hastings.”

Road Safety Week starts tomorrow and ends May 10.

It is promoted by road safety charity Brake NZ with the support of the NZ Transport Agency, NZ Police, Auckland Transport and sponsor QBE Insurance.
