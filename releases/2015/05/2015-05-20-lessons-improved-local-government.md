The first ever survey of how ratepayers view the performance of their local government is being welcomed by Local Government Minister Paula Bennett.

The inaugural New Zealand Local Government Survey, released today, is part of Local Government New Zealand’s (LGNZ) ongoing work to lift performance across the sector.

Results show public satisfaction with local government is generally good but that its reputation for providing value for ratepayers’ dollars needs improvement.

“Ratepayers quite reasonably expect the best from their local decision makers, especially when it comes to tackling fundamentals like infrastructure development and resource management.

“New Zealand is experiencing strong levels of economic growth both in our cities and regions, and local government has a crucial role to play in supporting this progress.

“This survey is quite clear about the areas local government is doing well in, and where improvements can be made. I’m pleased that the sector is engaging with communities and putting local views first.

“The Government will continue to work with LGNZ to ensure local government is focused on delivering better value for ratepayers,” Mrs Bennett says.
