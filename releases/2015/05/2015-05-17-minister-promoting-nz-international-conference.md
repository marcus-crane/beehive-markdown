The Energy and Resources Minister, Simon Bridges, is travelling to Melbourne today to promote New Zealand as an exploration destination to some of the world’s largest petroleum companies.

The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association’s (APPEA) annual conference is Australia’s largest petroleum conference and is attended by thousands of delegates, including a range of New Zealand businesses and government agencies like New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals (NZP&M) and GNS Science.

“Australia is one of the most important markets for our petroleum sector. Australian exploration and production companies have a strong presence in New Zealand and the majority of crude oil produced domestically is currently exported to Australia for refining,” Mr Bridges says.

“The APPEA conference is an excellent opportunity to share knowledge, see the latest technological advances in petroleum exploration and promote New Zealand as an investment destination.”

As well as visiting the New Zealand Pavilion at the conference, which is hosted by NZP&M and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Mr Bridges will be speaking at a networking function.

“The Government takes a mixed and balanced approach to our energy future that sees us pursuing opportunities in both renewable and non-renewable energy.

“We are a world-leader in renewable energy generation but the role of oil and gas should not be discounted. It is our 4th largest export, creates thousands of highly skilled, well-paid jobs and earns significant royalty revenues for the Government. This is used to pay for essential infrastructure and services like hospitals, schools and police.

“With 17 underexplored petroleum basins in our EEZ, there are real opportunities to realise greater benefits for New Zealand,” Mr Bridges says.

The event runs from 17th to 20th May.
