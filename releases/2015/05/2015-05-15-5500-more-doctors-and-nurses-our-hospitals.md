Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a record number of doctors and nurses are working in District Health Boards across the country.

“Our dedicated health workforce is making a difference to the lives of New Zealanders day in and day out,” says Dr Coleman.

As of 31 March 2015 there were 7,648 doctor and 22,092 nurse full-time equivalents employed by DHBs – that’s 1,718 more doctors and 3,768 more nurses compared to 2008.

This includes 986 more senior doctors and 970 more senior nurses.

A copy of the latest workforce report is available on the Ministry of Health’s website.

“While many other countries are freezing or even reducing health funding, we are committed to protecting and growing our public health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Health funding has increased every year under this Government and once again Health is expected to receive the largest share of new funding in Budget 2015 when it is released later this week.”
