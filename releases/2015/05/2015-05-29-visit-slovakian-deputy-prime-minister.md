Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed a visit to New Zealand by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Slovak Republic , Miroslav Lajčák.

“Mr Lajčák’s visit is the first by a Slovakian Foreign Minister since 1999 and it is an opportunity to reaffirm the friendship between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

“Our meeting today will cover a range of regional security issues, including the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, and New Zealand’s first five months on the UN Security Council.

“New Zealand will also raise our ambition for a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, of which the Slovak Republic is a member,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Lajčák arrived in New Zealand on Thursday 28 May and departs later today.
