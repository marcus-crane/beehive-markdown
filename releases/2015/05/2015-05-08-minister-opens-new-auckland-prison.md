The official opening today of the Auckland South Corrections Facility marks a new era in the management of prisoners and a focus on rehabilitation, Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“As well as keeping the community safe the new prison will allow prisoners from Auckland to live closer to their families.  Maintaining these bonds will help these men reintegrate better into their communities on release,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Auckland South Corrections Facility (ASCF) is the first public private partnership (PPP) between Corrections and the SecureFuture Consortium. 

The SecureFuture consortium includes Fletcher Construction, Serco and Spotless Facility Services who have been contracted to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the prison over the next 25 years.

“Our government aims to reduce reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017 and while we are heading in the right direction we are aware that more needs to be done.

“ASCF has a strong focus on rehabilitation and reintegration and I am confident that its operators will deliver on the targets that have been set in those areas,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Serco brings with it experience in the prison management sector and new innovations. Corrections has worked incredibly hard with Serco to ensure the prison meets the needs of the New Zealand Corrections environment.”

Serco will operate the prison and local businesses have stepped up to help train prisoners and get them qualifications. Placemakers, Envirowaste and Cabins to Go have invested in the prison and by doing this they’ll be investing in our prisoners too.

“As a result these men will get training, qualifications and a better chance of getting work on release. This will be good for the men, their families, their communities and employers,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The new prison will do things differently and the operator will share any best practice with public prisons.”

ASCF has been New Zealand’s biggest building project over the past two and a half years and Fletchers has built ASCF ahead of time and on budget.

3500 people worked on the project during the construction phase with around 1500 being form the local area.  279 long term positions have also been created.

The prison receives its first prisoners on May 18 and in the months ahead the will reach a muster of 960 men.
