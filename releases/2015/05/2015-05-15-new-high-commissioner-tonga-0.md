Foreign Minister Murray McCully has today announced diplomat Sarah Walsh as New Zealand’s new High Commissioner to Tonga.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with Tonga, based on a population of more than 60,000 Tongans resident in New Zealand, development cooperation, and our shared interest in regional issues,” Mr McCully says.

“Our High Commissioner in Tonga is responsible for overseeing our $28 million aid programme, which has a focus on renewable energy, education and training, private sector development, and policing.

“New Zealand is also involved in supporting reconstruction in the Ha’apai Islands following Cyclone Ian in 2014,” Mr McCully says.

Mrs Walsh held the role of Acting High Commissioner to Solomon Islands until early 2014, and was previously the New Zealand Aid manager in Timor-Leste.
