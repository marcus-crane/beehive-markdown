Trade Minister Tim Groser will today depart for Mexico to attend the 2015 World Economic Forum (WEF) Latin American meeting from 6-8 May.

The forum will be attended by many leaders, particularly from around the Americas, with the overarching purpose to observe how Latin America can secure its long-term economic growth and social development.

“Mexico has made a number of reforms in areas such as education, energy, fiscal and telecommunications legislation – which are already creating new opportunities,” says Mr Groser.

“This is a unique opportunity for New Zealand to engage with some of the world’s top economic decision-makers on how we should respond to the shifts now taking place in the world economy, and the potential benefits for New Zealand.

“It will also be a chance to set a renewed agenda and discuss how to enhance and take advantage of the new generation of Latin American investments and transformational projects.

“It’s worth noting that three countries in Latin America - Mexico, Peru, and Chile are already members of the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations,” says Mr Groser.

Mr Groser will also meet with a range of Latin American counterparts in the margins of the WEF meeting.
