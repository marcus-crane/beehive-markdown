Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell have tonight congratulated Mangaroa Station, this year’s Ahuwhenua Trophy winner.

Mangaroa Station was presented with the 2015 Ahuwhenua Trophy BNZ Māori Excellence in Farming award at an awards dinner tonight in Whanganui.

“The owners of Mangaroa Station set a fantastic example to other Māori landowners of what can be achieved through ambition and hard work,” says Mr Guy.

“They’ve created a successful family-run farm and sustainably developed their land for future generations.”

Mr Guy says he’s pleased to be in Whanganui tonight, the area of focus for a regional growth study that is currently underway.

“As part of the wider Regional Growth Study programme, the Government is looking at investment opportunities available in the Manawatu-Whanganui region, the significant employment opportunities, and the crucial role that Māori, iwi and hapu can play in its growth,” says Mr Guy.

“Growth in this region will be key to growing New Zealand’s economy as a whole.”

Minister Flavell says the Ahuwhenua Trophy competition is a great way to celebrate the significant contribution Māori make to New Zealand’s economy.

“These awards allow us to share Māori success stories and lift the profile of Māori agribusiness,” says Mr Flavell.

The Ahuwhenua Trophy competition, which is now in its 82nd year, celebrates excellence in farming and the pursuit of innovation and new approaches by Māori farmers committed to tapping the full potential of their holdings.

“We congratulate Mangaroa Station and all the finalists for their commitment to lifting the profile of Māori agribusiness and growing New Zealand’s primary industries,” says Mr Guy.
