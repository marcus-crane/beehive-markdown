Trade Minister Tim Groser will depart tonight for Boracay, Philippines to represent the New Zealand Government at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) on 22-24 May.

APEC Trade Ministers will be focusing on the Philippines theme of “building inclusive economies” through specific work streams on: regional economic integration, fostering SME participation in the global economy, developing human capital and building sustainable communities.

The meeting will also be progressing a study to explore the opportunities and challenges involved in the potential Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.

“The MRT Meeting will provide the opportunity to promote practical and trade facilitating measures that will help New Zealand SMEs to more easily enter markets in the region. These are important issues for New Zealand exporters”, Mr Groser says.

While in Boracay, Mr Groser will also hold a series of bilateral meetings with counterparts from APEC member economies to discuss bilateral and regional trade issues.
