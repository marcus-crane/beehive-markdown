Prime Minister John Key today offered his congratulations to David Cameron on his re-election as British Prime Minister.

"I have sent David Cameron a brief message of congratulations, and hope to talk to him on the telephone over the next few days.  I will also be writing formally to him on behalf of the New Zealand Government," says Mr Key.

“The United Kingdom is one of our most important partners. The trade and economic links between our two countries are strong and long-standing, and we have shared interests in a range of areas including defence, security, the arts and sport.

“I have enjoyed working with David Cameron during his first term as Prime Minister and look forward to working with him in the coming years.”
