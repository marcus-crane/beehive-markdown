Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand is sending engineering personnel to Nepal to help assess the damage caused by the Anzac Day earthquake.

“The Nepalese Government has requested assistance from New Zealand experts with damage assessments of critical public infrastructure, including government buildings and hospitals,” Mr McCully says.

“Four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening, have volunteered their time and they are en route to Nepal.

“This of group engineers will be in Kathmandu for a week, and, in addition to undertaking damage assessments, they will also help determine whether a larger contingent of 10-12 engineers is required.

“This later deployment would be for three months and would focus on assisting with stabilisation and retrofitting of damaged buildings.

“Providing engineering expertise is a practical way to contribute to the relief effort and New Zealand is well regarded in this area,” Mr McCully says.

To date New Zealand has provided $2 million in financial assistance to Nepal following the 25 April earthquake.
