Prime Minister John Key has welcomed news that New Zealanders will have a chance to see the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo live in Wellington.

The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo today announced that it will return to Westpac Stadium for the second time in its 65-year history, as part of the New Zealand Festival in 2016.

The Tattoo will showcase the talents of 1200 military and cultural performers from around the world, including our own kapa haka group, and winners of Te Matatini, Te Whānau a Apanui, and will include a moving tribute to our Anzac soldiers.

“I am delighted that so many New Zealanders will have the chance to experience such an iconic event right on their doorstep,” Mr Key says.

“The first time the Tattoo was held in New Zealand in 2000 it was a sell-out, with 78,000 people attending — 74 per cent from outside of Wellington.   It remains the single biggest non-sporting event ever held at Westpac Stadium.

“It’s events of the scale of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo that help to put New Zealand in the international spotlight, and showcase our country as a welcoming and world-class events destination,” Mr Key says.

“That’s why the Government is working hard to help attract and grow high-quality major events around the country that deliver economic, social and cultural benefits, and promote New Zealand to the world.

“I want to thank the New Zealand Festival, and Tattoo Chief Executive and Producer, Brigadier David Allfrey, who have worked to bring this exciting event to New Zealand.”
