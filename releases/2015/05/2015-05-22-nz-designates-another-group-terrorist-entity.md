New Zealand has designated another terrorist group, Egypt-based Ansar Bayt al Maqdis, under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, Prime Minister John Key announced today.

“These designations help implement our international obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 aimed at preventing the activities of terrorists,” says Mr Key.

“The group has committed various terrorist acts, including the indiscriminate killing of civilians.

“As a result of this designation, any assets the groups may have in New Zealand, either now, or in the future, will be frozen. It will also be a criminal offence to carry out property or financial transactions with them. 

Forms of support, such as fundraising and recruiting or harbouring terrorists, are criminal offences in New Zealand, regardless of whether a group is designated as a terrorist entity or not.

“These designations are not a response to domestic terrorist threats in New Zealand and nor are they influenced by New Zealand’s relationship with other countries. However, they do form part of our Government’s support against terrorism activities,” says Mr Key.

“Our ability to designate terrorist entities not listed by the United Nations is an important counter-terrorism measure. Our Government is determined that New Zealand not be used to support terrorist activities.”

To date, New Zealand has designated under UN Security Council Resolutions 1267/1989 and 1988 over 400 terrorist groups and individuals listed by the United Nations, and the group designated today brings the number of terrorist entities not listed by the UN to 20.

Details of the designations process and the statements of case supporting the designation of these entities can be found on the New Zealand Police website [http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities](http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities)
