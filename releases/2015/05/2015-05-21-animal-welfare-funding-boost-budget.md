A $10 million package over four years will further strengthen New Zealand’s animal welfare systems, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says.

“New Zealand already has a strong reputation for animal welfare,” Mr Guy says.

“However, the expectations of consumers and society are constantly changing and our farming systems are continually evolving,” he says.

“This investment will support changes in the new Animal Welfare Amendment Act, which passed into law this month. These changes have made animal welfare obligations clearer, more transparent and easier to enforce.

“They will also ensure New Zealand is well placed to maintain its strong reputation and world class animal welfare system into the future,” Mr Guy says.

The new funding will go towards:

- Developing new regulations through the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee.
- Improving compliance and enforcement capability.
- Managing the welfare of animals in a civil defence emergency.

“Our primary sector makes a critical contribution to our economy. New Zealand earns around $25 billion a year by exporting animal products such as meat, milk and wool. Our global reputation as a safe food producer depends on us continuing to produce animal products within strong animal welfare standards.

“Some of this funding will go towards creating targeted education that ensures the right people know what is required of them. As well as strengthening the Ministry for Primary Industry’s enforcement of animal welfare requirements, the investment will also contribute to the SPCA’s work in animal welfare. In particular, it will further support its compliance function.”
