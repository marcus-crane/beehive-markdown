Today’s opening of the first Government-led anchor project building ushers in a new era for Christchurch and how people move around the city, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

The $53 million Bus Interchange is designed to be a user-friendly transport hub for a new Accessible City – where reduced speed limits and the redesign of central city streets will make it easier and more enjoyable for all forms of travel.

“After all of the work that has followed the launch of the central city Blueprint in 2012, including land purchases and demolitions, consenting, design and construction, to be at the point of opening a fantastic new facility like this is a great moment for Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The Interchange is stylish and user-friendly, with airport-style passenger lounges that will ensure people can wait for their buses in comfort and protected from the elements. It has also been designed with a real emphasis on safety and sustainability.”

“Having an attractive facility like this is crucial if we want to attract more people to public transport.”

“In terms of the anchor projects, we have seen the new Hagley Cricket Oval opened and celebrated during the Cricket World Cup, and others like the Avon River Precinct and Justice and Emergency Services Precinct well advanced. The Bus Interchange is something the people of Christchurch can use every day and experience how far we have come.”

Bus services began operating out of the new Interchange for the first time this morning. Initially half of the 16 bus bays will be operational and about half of the passenger lounge area.

The remainder of the Interchange, including some retail areas and a bicycle lock-up area for cyclists, will open this Winter.

“The arrangements are still being worked through for the retail areas, but there will be a good mix of offerings, including food and convenience options for commuters.

“The work on improving transport in Christchurch doesn’t stop with the completion of the Bus Interchange. The work on public transport, roading projects and parking will continue, and will benefit everyone who travels around the city.”
