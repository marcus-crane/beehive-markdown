New Zealand women are continuing to strive for leadership success but there’s still more to be done, Minister for Women Louise Upston says.

Ms Upston has welcomed the results of the 2014 gender stocktake of state sector boards and committees, showing 41.7 per cent of female representation on these boards, up slightly from 41.1 per cent in 2013.

“We’ve made some great strides in encouraging women to take leadership roles in the state sector, but we can do even better. The Government’s goal is to have women make up 45 per cent of state sector boards, and I’m confident we can reach that goal.

“Having women at the board table isn’t just about numbers. It’s about better decision making, organisational resilience and the economic and productivity gains that come from gender balance in leadership.”

Ms Upston said both public and private sector employers should think about encouraging the next level of leaders to broaden the leadership pipeline.

“A key way women can become empowered in the workplace is through making the most of their leadership skills and potential. By identifying, supporting and encouraging young women leaders to reach their goals, we will see more women in higher levels of leadership.

“I’m encouraging leaders in business and in the community to think about those with potential waiting to be unlocked. These are the women who have the skills, talent and drive to get to the top, and who can inspire others along the way.

“Women can also be encouraged to use resources such as the Ministry for Women’s My Board Strengths tool to find out the steps they can take to become board-ready.”
