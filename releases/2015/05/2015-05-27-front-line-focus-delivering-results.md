The latest public sector staff capping report shows the Government’s commitment to providing better front-line services and keeping back-office numbers down is paying off, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

“Across the board, the Government has set out a plan for a public service that puts New Zealanders first, ensuring taxpayers’ dollars are being spent on services that deliver real results for those most in need.

“Back office numbers climbed by close to 10,000 to over 45,000 under the previous Government, while families and businesses carried the cost with little to show for it,” says Mrs Bennett.

Currently set at 36,475 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions within core government administrative roles, the cap was introduced in 2008 and reset at the present lower level in 2012.

The latest half-yearly report shows a decrease of over 300 FTE positions since the end of 2013. Overall, numbers are 368 under the present cap and 2,752 below the original 2008 cap.

“The cap supports the Government’s work to deliver improved frontline services, alongside our Better Public Service targets, and ensures unnecessary bureaucratic growth doesn’t stifle an economy that grew 3.5% last year,” Mrs Bennett says.

“In addition to delivering more teachers, doctors and nurses, we’re also changing the culture of the public service to look at problems through the eyes of the New Zealanders, not institutions in Wellington.”
