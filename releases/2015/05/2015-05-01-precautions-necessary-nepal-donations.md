Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is warning New Zealanders to be alert for unscrupulous people who exploit the public’s generosity following the earthquake disaster in Nepal.

“New Zealanders’ swift response to the appeals set up to provide assistance to victims of the Nepalese earthquakes has been incredible. It is a real tribute to New Zealand’s generosity and sympathy for those facing a terrible disaster,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“However experience shows that although the vast majority of fundraising is genuine, the public should be mindful of people fundraising fraudulently.

“I encourage New Zealanders to donate to well-established registered charities that have the experience and infrastructure needed to provide disaster-relief assistance.

“This way you can be sure that your donation is going directly to the people in Nepal who have been affected by the earthquake, and that your contribution is making the greatest possible difference,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Simple precautions only take a few minutes:

- Check whether collectors are wearing an ID badge
- Ask a collector for the charity’s registration number, and check that against the charity’s entry on the online Charities Register at [www.charities.govt.nz](http://www.charities.govt.nz)
- Ask the collector for more information - a fundraiser should be able to explain the work of the charity and how your donation will be used.
- Fundraising materials should display the charity’s name, registration number and a landline contact number - be wary of those that list only a mobile number or email address.
- If in any doubt, contact your preferred charity directly to make a donation.
