Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says North Harbour Stadium is well placed for the start of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup.

“The FIFA U-20 World Cup gets underway tomorrow with New Zealand taking on Ukraine in the first game,” says Dr Coleman.

“The tournament is a great opportunity for Kiwis to see the next generation of global football superstars.

“With a global TV audience of 170 million, the FIFA U-20 World Cup places New Zealand at the centre stage of world football for the next three weeks.”

52 matches will be played in Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“The Government has contributed $5.5 million to the tournament,” says Dr Coleman. “Over 7,000 visitors are expected, including 800 players and support staff and 100 media, benefiting our economy and regional host cities.”

“The four new playing fields built in Whangarei, and upgraded pitches in Hamilton and Christchurch, will also have lasting benefits.”

Dr Coleman is attending Saturday’s Kick Off Show and opening game at Auckland’s North Harbour Stadium.

Kiwi fans can get behind the Junior All Whites by going along to the games and wearing white to show their support. Fan sites in each host city will feature musical and cultural performances, as well as football demonstrations.

The Junior All Whites will also play USA and Myanmar in the first round. For further information head to: [www.fifa.com/nz2015](http://www.fifa.com/nz2015).
