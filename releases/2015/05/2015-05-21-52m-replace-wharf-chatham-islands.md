A critical lifeline for one of New Zealand’s most remote communities is to be completely rebuilt as a result of new funding in Budget 2015, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne says.

The Waitangi Wharf on the Chatham Islands will be replaced in a three-year construction project costing up to $52 million in capital funding from 2015/16 to 2017/18, sourced from the Future Investment Fund.

“The investment will enhance economic development opportunities for the Chatham Islands and strengthen community resilience in the face of tough conditions,” Mr Dunne says.

“This contingency funding will significantly improve this community’s infrastructure, which is vital for economic development and quality of life on the islands.

“The wharf is the only cargo-handling facility for essential supplies, including diesel for the electricity grid and fuel for the air services. The existing wharf is a structural risk and needs to be replaced within five years.

“This investment will enable more efficient port operations, encourage future economic growth, and sustain a lifeline for the community,” Mr Dunne says.
