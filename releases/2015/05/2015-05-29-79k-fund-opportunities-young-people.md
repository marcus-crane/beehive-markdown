Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that four recipients will receive a total of $79,000 funding under the Opportunities for Young People fund.

“This funding comes from the Youth Enterprise Fund, which supports organisations providing hands-on learning opportunities for young people to develop entrepreneurial skills.

“The Opportunities for Young People fund recognises that many young people are themselves coming up with projects that are creating social and environmental change, and these projects are worthy of support in their own right.

“The funding I’ve announced today will help over 100 young people benefit from initiatives aimed at fostering e-learning opportunities, teaching entrepreneurial skills to disadvantaged youth, addressing bullying and embracing Maori and Pasifika philosophies to tackle social issues.

The four successful recipients are:

- Future E, from Howick, Auckland
- FNF Youth Leaders, from Paeroa
- 2Face Production, from Lower Hutt
- Victoria Community Entrepreneurial Initiative, from Nelson.

“It never fails to amaze me how many young people there are who are passionate about creating opportunities to better themselves, their peers and their communities.

“This week we recognised many of these outstanding young people at the 2015 Youth Awards in Wellington.

“One of the successful recipients of Opportunities for Young People funding, 2Face Production, was also a Youth Award group winner, so it’s great to be able to provide funding to support the impressive work that they and other young people are doing in the community.
