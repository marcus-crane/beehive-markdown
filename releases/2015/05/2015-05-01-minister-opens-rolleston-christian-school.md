Education Minister Hekia Parata today officially opened Rolleston Christian School, located in the fastest growing Territorial Authority in New Zealand.

“Rolleston Christian School will relieve the pressure on existing schools in the urban area and will offer parents the option to send their children to a school that fits with their philosophical and religious beliefs,” says Ms Parata.

“We know that children learn best when they are in a learning environment that they feel comfortable in and I am committed to making sure that we have an education system that caters to the diverse needs of all New Zealand children.”

Ms Parata says the school was opened on time and currently has capacity for 150 students. Stage Two of the development will bring the capacity to 300.

“The modern learning environment that Rolleston Christian School offers will reflect the needs of 21st century students and contribute to the drive we’re making to raise the educational success of Kiwi kids,” says Ms Parata.

In response to the population growth in Rolleston, three more schools have been approved for establishment – West Rolleston Primary School is scheduled for opening in 2016, and Rolleston Secondary School and a new primary school are both scheduled for opening in 2017.
