A Bill to provide greater clarity and freedom to the way Radio New Zealand operates passed its second reading in Parliament today.

Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams says the Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill will see the broadcaster receive an updated and more flexible charter.

“The term “commercial-free” is being added into the charter for the first time and the Bill will clarify that this applies to Radio New Zealand’s services, while allowing RNZ to pursue new opportunities that do not detract from these services. This revised charter also gives the multi-media broadcaster the impetus to take advantage of the most effective means of delivery to reach its audiences,” Ms Adams says.

“We have already seen this in Radio New Zealand’s response to the fast-paced changes in technology with live streaming and downloadable podcasts including video,” Ms Adams says.

“While there has been a decline in listenership across traditional platforms, over the last twelve months RNZ’s online audience has grown significantly as their multi-media strategy is implemented.”

For example:

- In 2013/14, 3.5 million podcasts were downloaded.
- In 2013/14, radionz.co.nz page views reached 21 million and over 2014 unique users of the website grew by over 50 per cent.
- In 2013/14, regular user of the RNZ mobile app grew by almost 62 per cent.
