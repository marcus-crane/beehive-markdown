New Zealanders frustrated with loopy rules and regulations will have more time to submit to the Rules Reduction Taskforce, Local Government Minister Paula Bennett says.

“Given the success of the process, I have decided to extend the closing date for submissions from 1 June to 15 June 2015 to ensure as many people as possible can have their say,” says Mrs Bennett.

The Taskforce, co-chaired by Jacqui Dean MP and Michael Barnett, has held 46 well-attended community meetings around the country and heard from a mixture of property owners, businesses, tradespeople, and councils. A further 657 submissions have been received online.

“People quite rightly feel that there are too many costly rules that are unnecessarily bureaucratic and there isn’t enough flexibility in their application.

“One example came from a man who was told the gaps between his fence palings were too small and had to be 25mm, even though he had three large dogs and it would create a risk for small children putting their fingers through.

“Fundamentally, the Taskforce is finding that there has been too much emphasis on enforcement, and not enough on how rules affect people.

“I’m pleased more New Zealanders will have an opportunity to talk about the rules and regulations that are costing them time and money,” Mrs Bennett says.
