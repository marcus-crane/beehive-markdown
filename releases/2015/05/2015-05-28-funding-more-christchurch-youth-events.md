Christchurch youth councils will be creating fun and exciting events this winter as a result of a funding boost from the 2014 Winter Chill programme, Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says.

“Winter Chill was a huge success with young people creating over sixty diverse and imaginative events which were attended by thousands across the city. I’m pleased that we can celebrate youth week by ensuring that youth-focused events will continue in the city this winter,” Ms Wagner says.

“Events such as the Broods concert, Rowley’s Got Talent and supporting initiatives such as the North Projects art gallery were just some of last year’s Winter Chill activities.

“These events aim to provide opportunities to help young people to connect and contribute positively to the community during Christchurch’s recovery.

“I look forward to seeing all the great work the youth councils will do in planning fun and exciting events for young people throughout Christchurch,” Ms Wagner says.

The three youth councils receiving funding are the Christchurch Youth Council, Selwyn Youth Council and Waimakariri Youth Council.

Winter Chill was made possible with a $150,000 contribution from the Ministry of Youth and Social Development’s Canterbury Youth Initiatives Fund and Fletcher Building. The remaining $7,000 is going to youth councils for events in 2015.
