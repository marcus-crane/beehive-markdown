Justice Minister Amy Adams has opened a two-day conference which will look at how restorative justice can be used to better support victims of family violence.

The *Family Violence, the Law and Restorative Justice Conference* began at Parliament today.

Ms Adams says addressing family violence in New Zealand is a priority for the Government.

“New Zealand’s rate of family violence is simply unacceptable.  Almost 50 per cent of all homicides are a result of family violence and many victims are re-victimised even when a protection order is in place,” says Ms Adams.

“Restorative justice is one of the ways to provide support to victims and reduce reoffending. Research indicates it’s among the most cost effective justice sector interventions for reducing reoffending and improving victim outcomes.

“Family violence is often characterised by isolation and secrecy. The inclusion of wider family support in restorative justice allows the wider community to acknowledge the impact and support change,” says Ms Adams.

“Providing stronger responses to family violence is a priority and I’m working with other justice and social sector Ministers to make a real difference. 

“Last year Prime Minister John Key announced a package of initiatives including the extension of the National Home Safety Service, a review of the Domestic Violence Act and the establishment of a Chief Victims Advisor.

“This Government is committed to reducing family violence and this package takes a comprehensive, integrated and long-term approach, which will enhance our response to victims, child witnesses and perpetrators,” says Ms Adams.
