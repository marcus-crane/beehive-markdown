New Zealand’s global connections will be strengthened by its Presidency of the International Transport Forum (ITF) in Germany this week Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Mr Bridges leaves today for the annual summit in Leipzig, Germany. In his role as Presidency Minister, Mr Bridges will speak at the opening event, chair ministerial sessions and meet with transport ministers from across the ITF’s 54 member countries.

“The summit brings together key international players in transport and transport-related sectors, and provides a unique platform for exchanges on policy issues,” Mr Bridges says.

“New Zealand’s distance from markets amplifies the effects of decision making elsewhere, which is why building positive international connections at this level is important. This year’s summit theme of transport, trade and tourism is particularly relevant to New Zealand.”

“Building stronger connections with international markets can help boost our productivity and stimulate innovation,” Mr Bridges says.

As well as fulfilling New Zealand's Presidency role, Mr Bridges will specifically be working to capture the benefits of technology innovations and intelligent transport systems, as well as working to achieve greater liberalisation in aviation rules and air services for New Zealand.

As speakers at the summit, the chief executive of Auckland Airport, Adrian Littlewood, and the chief executive of the Lyttelton Port of Christchurch, Peter Davie, will provide a New Zealand perspective. A range of transport-related businesses will be showcasing their brand and products on a New Zealand exhibition stand.

Topics covered at the summit range from the role of transport in sustainable tourism growth, to the impact of new trade patterns for maritime transport.
