Prime Minister John Key has acknowledged the sudden passing of Ngati Hine leader Erima Henare.

Mr Henare was the son of the late Sir James Henare and Lady Rose Henare, and held a number of public and iwi leadership roles.

He was the chairman of the Maori Language Commission, executive director of Maori at the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, a member of the Waitangi National Trust Board, and an adviser to the Maori King, Tuheitia Paki.

“I am saddened to learn of Mr Henare’s passing,” says Mr Key.

“Mr Henare will be a great loss. He was a great Maori leader and a passionate advocate for the revitalisation of Maori language.

“I enjoyed catching up with him at Waitangi each year in his role as a member of the Waitangi National Trust. 

“My thoughts are with Mr Henare’s family and friends at this time.”
