*Ērima, e te pou o Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori. Ko koe tērā e kawe nei tō tātou reo ki tōna taumata i a koe e tū ana ki runga i ngā marae o te motu, otirā ki roto i te Whare Pāremata hoki.*  

*Tēnei te tangi atu ki a koe, i whakatauira mai rā koe i te rerehua o tō tātou reo i ngā tōpito o te motu, otirā ki te ao whānui.*

*Kua tūkoki te waka, kua pakaru te tākere, kua riro te titītai, te tūruki, kua mōnonehu te iwi. Tēnei mātou te iwi Māori e tangi nei mōu e kara e!*

Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell acknowledges the passing of Ērima Henare as “a huge loss to te ao Māori”.

“Ērima was an eloquent statesman who led people through his extensive knowledge of tikanga, te reo Māori and his wise assessment of how the Māori world is continuing to evolve.

“He will be greatly missed for his knowledge and his leadership,” says Mr Flavell.

*Ērima Henare* (Ngāti Hine, Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Wai, Ngāti Kuri, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāi Takoto, Te Aupouri, Te Rarawa and Ngāti Whātua) was the Chairperson of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori and has a long association with the public service including being a regional director of the Te Taitokerau office at the former Department of Māori Affairs.

“He held a number of civil service roles across a number of sectors including te reo Māori, education, and the Waitangi Tribunal,” said Mr Flavell.

Mr Henare was also an executive director at Open Polytechnic of New Zealand, a member of the Waitangi National Trust Board, and a trusted adviser to the Māori King, Tūheitia Paki.

Mr Henare is survived by his five children, including MP for Tamaki Makaurau Peeni Henare and many mokopuna.

*Korokī te manu i te ata, korokī te manu i te pō, e hoki koe, e kara ki te kāinga, ki te papa o ōu tupuna, kia whakaekea ai koe e te tini, e te mano, tangihia ai mōu kua riro ki te pō.*
