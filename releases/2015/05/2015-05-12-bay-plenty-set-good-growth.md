The Bay of Plenty region and its industries could grow substantially thanks to its resource, population, location and climate advantages, a newly published report reveals.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today released the Bay of Plenty Regional Growth Study, which shows that the region has a number of natural advantages and is well placed to attract further investment, raise incomes and increase employment.

“This study provides a detailed summary of the opportunities for the Bay of Plenty’s future,” Mr Joyce says. “It outlines the potential of the primary sector, manufacturing and tourism industries in particular to grow the region.

“It is an independent report that was produced after extensive discussions with stakeholders in the Bay of Plenty community. The report highlights how the Bay of Plenty can build from an already strong platform of collaboration between industry, research organisations, iwi and local and central government.”

The study shows that the region’s natural assets, climate, and increasingly innovative population offer growth opportunities in the forestry, pastoral farming, aquaculture and horticulture sectors, Mr Guy says.

“It underscores the importance of water management, and that a better range of quality training programmes and pathways to work will see the region retain and attract more young people.”

The study is part of the Regional Growth Study Programme, which has been commissioned by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).

“The Regional Growth Study Programme seeks to pinpoint and prioritise significant economic opportunities to improve outcomes in selected regions and therefore throughout New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

The programme builds on the East Coast Regional Economic Potential Study that was released in April 2014. The Northland Growth Study was released in February 2015, and a further study is currently under way in the Manawatū-Whanganui regions.
