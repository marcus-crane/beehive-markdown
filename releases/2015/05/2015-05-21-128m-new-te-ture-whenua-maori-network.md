The new Te Ture Whenua Māori Network, which will help Māori land owners improve the productivity of their land, will be supported by $12.8 million in the Budget, Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says.

The network complements the current reform of the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act.

“Significant tracts of Māori land remain under-utilised and improving its performance and productivity will provide benefits to its owners and the wider New Zealand economy,” Mr Flavell says.

This four-year operating funding will support targeted initiatives to improve the productivity of Māori land in areas such as Northland, East Coast, Bay of Plenty, Manawatū and Whanganui.
