Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming a trial of a rental vehicle Code of Practice to inform visiting drivers and improve safety for all road users. 

In March, the leaders of 25 rental vehicle companies agreed to develop the Code to help address concerns over the safety of visiting drivers.

One of the Code’s key elements is an assessment of drivers’ experience. The assessment process will be trialled by a number of rental vehicle operators next month.

“I’m pleased to see this Code moving forward so quickly.  Any action or commitment to improve the safety of road users will help save lives,” Mr Foss says.

Under the Code, rental vehicle operators will also commit to providing more pre-arrival information on New Zealand driving conditions and sharing information with their competitors.

Mr Foss says the Code builds on a large amount of work already underway, including the Visiting Drivers Signature Project (VDSP).

“The Government continues to work closely on the VDSP with a number of departments and organisations, including Ministry of Transport, the New Zealand Transport Agency, Police and local government.

“New Zealand’s road toll is still far too high.  This Code is another initiative that will help build a safe system for all road users, including the increasing number of overseas visitors choosing to explore our country by car.

“I have asked transport officials to support the Tourism Industry Association (TIA) where possible and monitor the Code’s progress.”    

TIA and the Rental Vehicle Association aim to have the Code of Practice finalised by October and in place for summer.
