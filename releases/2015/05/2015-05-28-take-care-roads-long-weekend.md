Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is reminding all road users to take extra care travelling over Queen’s Birthday weekend.

“This week we’ve had our first blast of wintry weather — a timely reminder to drive to the conditions,” Mr Foss says.

“Rain, snow and ice can make the road a treacherous place.  As always, I urge drivers to take care out there.

“The message remains the same: drive sober, slow down and buckle up.  It could be the difference between life and death.

“Motorcyclists and pedestrians are particularly vulnerable in poor weather.  Motorcyclists should ride at an appropriate speed and, with darker mornings and evenings, pedestrians should make sure they’re visible, particularly when crossing the road.”

The official holiday period for Queen's Birthday weekend begins at 4pm Friday 29 May and ends at 6am Tuesday 2 June.
