The Budget provides $2.1 million of new operating funding for rangatahi Māori suicide prevention, Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell says.

“It recognises the need within Māori communities to address the high rate of suicide among our rangatahi and to reduce its tragic consequences,” he says.

“The causes of youth suicide are complex and varied. This fund will contribute towards taking a Whānau Ora approach to reducing youth suicide.”

Suicide is a significant issue for New Zealand communities and particularly for Māori communities. The most recent figures for 2011 show the Māori rate was 1.8 times higher than the non-Māori rate, with 108 Māori suicide deaths.

The suicide rate in 2011 was 36.4 per 100,000 Māori youths, 2.4 times higher than the suicide rate of 15.1 per 100,000 among non-Maori youths.

Mr Flavell says the statistics show suicide among young Māori requires urgent and immediate action.

“This funding will help identify and support community-led initiatives aimed at building whānau resilience and target communities with identified need where we can have the greatest impact.”
