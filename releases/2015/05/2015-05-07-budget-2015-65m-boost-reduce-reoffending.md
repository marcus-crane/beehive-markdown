The government will invest an additional $6.5 million in 2015/16 in both new and existing initiatives to help reduce prisoner reoffending, Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“Breaking the cycle of imprisonment and reoffending is a key focus of this Government. That’s why we set the ambitious and challenging goal of reducing prisoner reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“A 10 per cent reduction in reoffending has already been achieved since mid-2011 by measures including preparing offenders for employment, expanding rehabilitation programmes, tackling alcohol and drug abuse and connecting offenders with support networks after release. 

“This reduction means 1766 fewer reoffenders and 7064 fewer victims of crime. This is a significant achievement and now more needs to be done to reach the target,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The extra operational funding in Budget 2015 will allow the Government to:

- Extend the Out of Gate prisoner reintegration programme’s work with non-governmental organisations that have proven ability and effective connections with local communities.
- Lift participation rates of offenders in rehabilitative programmes that will make a difference in their lives, the lives of their families and to our community.
- Create opportunities for those serving community-based sentences through life skills programmes such as literacy and road safety.

“Some crimes feature heavily in repeat offending, such as family violence and driving offences. Alcohol and drugs are often a factor,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Better access to rehabilitation treatment, housing, education, alcohol and drug interventions, violence prevention courses, driver licence support and drink drive/road safety programmes will all help to reduce repeat offending.”

For example, results from the Out of Gate programme show that for every one percentage point drop in reoffending, there is a benefit of $5.5 million to the justice sector and wider social sector. The programme therefore has a potential net benefit of up to $44.5 million in future avoided costs. 

“This initiative is about investing the Correction Department’s resources more effectively and working smarter within the organisation and with other agencies, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The funding will come from the Justice Sector Fund.
