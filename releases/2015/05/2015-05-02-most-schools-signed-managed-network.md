Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye are delighted that most schools in New Zealand have now signed up to use the government-funded Managed Network.

“More than 95% of schools have registered to use the Managed Network, which will give them fast, reliable internet and uncapped data,” says Ms Parata.

“This is about enabling schools to make the most of digital technologies, to give young people the skills and confidence they need to succeed in an ever-changing world.

“The government is investing more than $200 million in this project, so that all state, state-integrated and partnership schools can have uncapped internet access funded by the Crown.”

Ms Kaye says the project continues to run well ahead of schedule.

“It’s great that the sign-up is so high, but we’re also pleased that actual connections are running ahead of schedule,” says Ms Kaye.

“The original goal of connecting 700 schools by the end of 2014 was achieved five months early. Now, just four months into 2015, more than half a million students and teachers from nearly 1,600 schools are connected to the Managed Network to support learning.

“This is an important investment for the government, because we believe all young people should have access to high-quality internet connections for learning, wherever they live and go to school.”

***What is the N4L Managed Network?***

The N4L Managed Network provides participating schools with fast, reliable internet complete with uncapped data, web filtering, network security services and helpdesk support.

Because it’s centrally managed, schools don’t need to support their own internet connection and related services, reducing ICT complexity and costs.

***About N4L***
