Budget 2015 builds on the Government’s success in reducing crime and ensures New Zealand Police is fit for the future with new operating funding of $164 million over the next four years, Police Minister Michael Woodhouse says.

This demonstrates the Government’s commitment to maintaining visible, active and hard-working Police that deliver more effective frontline policing and crime prevention to keep our communities safe.  

“Police’s focus on the Prevention First strategy is continuing to show excellent results for New Zealanders, with fewer victims and a 22 per cent drop in recorded crimes over the past five years,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Police are focused on meeting the needs of victims. By using the latest technology they can deploy resources in the right places at the right times, build valuable partnerships with communities and partner agencies to address the causes of crime.

“Increased foot patrols in our communities, combined with frontline staff being equipped with the latest mobile technology, have allowed the Police to be more visible and deliver over half a million additional frontline hours each year.

“Budget 2015 enables the Police to continue efforts to ensure that New Zealanders feel safe and stay safe wherever they live.”

The new funding will also enable Police to develop the next phase of Policing Excellence, focusing on continued improvements in the way the service operates to provide more effective frontline policing and crime prevention.
