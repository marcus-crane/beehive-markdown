Consultation on a report highlighting the importance of whānau and the community in preventing violence has been completed with positive results.

Following the February launch of the Ministry for *Women’s Wāhine Māori, Wāhine Ora, Wāhine Kaha: preventing violence against Māori women* research report, Minister for Women Louise Upston held hui in Taupo, Kaikohe, Invercargill and Te Puke to gather feedback on the report’s findings.

“It was a privilege to listen not only women in these communities, but also whānau and service providers,” Ms Upston said. “Strong patterns in discussions arose showing a multi-faceted approach to finding solutions is needed to keep Māori women and their families free from violence. 

“These solutions cover a range of issues including boosting access to education, employment, health, and programmes that address men’s behaviour. Groups have asked for more active partnership models with local providers as well as highlighting some great local initiatives that can be replicated and rolled out in other regions.”

Ms Upston said the Government will now continue to work with whānau, particularly within the frameworks of E Tu Whānau and Whānau Ora to prevent violence against Māori women and more broadly, to prevent family violence.

“We are tailoring existing work to better support whānau into sustainable employment through education and training. I have asked the Ministry for Women to work with education providers and businesses to encourage whānau-friendly and flexible work policies which will assist in reducing violence.”

Collaboration will also continue with the Family Violence Ministerial Group and government agencies involved in the primary prevention of violence.
