Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says Southland is fast becoming a hub for the nation’s energy efficiency activities and he believes this can play a vital role in growing Southland’s economy, with benefits for the rest of New Zealand.

“Southland is home to some exciting energy efficiency projects, it’s great to see local industry is adopting a progressive approach to developing sustainable and economic energy options.”

On a visit to the region today, Mr Bridges met with local businesses and council representatives for an update on the Wood Energy South programme, a joint initiative between the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) and Venture Southland.

The Government last year committed $1.5 million of funding over three years to support the programme, which aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by facilitating the switch in heating fuel sources from coal to wood.

“Wood energy is a renewable fuel that in many situations can be used instead of coal or gas. Every Southland business that makes the switch is supporting the local economy as well as making a more environmentally friendly choice, which can only have a positive impact on the region.”

As part of his visit, Mr Bridges met with the Niagara Sawmill, which is celebrating its 80th year of operation.

“Southland’s forestry and wood processing industry generates over 300,000 tonnes a year of potential wood fuel that could be cost-effectively used for industrial and commercial heat processes.

“Southland has an abundance of renewable resources in its own backyard, so I’m delighted that an experienced local company like Niagara will continue its legacy by strengthening the region’s supply of wood boiler fuel.”

The Minister was on hand to witness the signing of a new energy management collaboration agreement between EECA and Alliance Group Limited, one of the world’s largest processors of sheep meat, with exports to over 60 countries.

“I’m very pleased to see Alliance Group take this initiative.  Meat processing is an energy-intensive operation, so greater efficiency reduces carbon emissions as well as the company’s bottom line, making it more sustainable both financially and environmentally.”

Mr Bridges also visited HW Richardson Group, an Invercargill-based heavy vehicle transport business that has signed onto EECA’s Heavy Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Programme.

The company, which operates 850 trucks nationwide, last year set an ambitious target of reducing fuel consumption across its business by 10% annually which equates to nearly 2 million litres. This will be achieved through improved fuel data management, speed and idling management, tyre and vehicle maintenance and purchasing more efficient vehicles in future.

To date seventeen fleets from the Group, operating 410 trucks, have started implementing these initiatives.

“As the Minister of both the Transport and Energy portfolios, I’m delighted by HW Richardson’s comprehensive programme to address energy efficiency and driver safety. Based on progress so far, I am confident the company will become another of Southland’s energy efficiency success stories.”
