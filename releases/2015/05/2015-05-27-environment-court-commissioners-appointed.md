Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today announced the appointment of Hon Kate Wilkinson of Christchurch and the reappointment of Ms Kathryn Edmonds of Wellington as Commissioners of the Environment Court, both for a five year term.   

Hon Kate Wilkinson was a lawyer for 26 years prior to entering Parliament in 2005. As a lawyer she was involved in property, commercial and corporate areas of law. She was Minister of Conservation from 2009 to 2013 and was responsible for the Government’s conservation aspects of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). She was also involved in meeting the Crown’s obligations to Māori in Treaty settlement processes.

Commissioner Edmonds was first appointed a Commissioner of the Environment Court in 2005. She completed her second term earlier this year. Prior to joining the Court, Ms Edmonds practised as a solicitor and headed the environmental division of a large consultancy firm.

The Environment Court considers applications and appeals made under the RMA and has wide ranging jurisdiction under the Act. It also has significant jurisdiction under other legislation.
