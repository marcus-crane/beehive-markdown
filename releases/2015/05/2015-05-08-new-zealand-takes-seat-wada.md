Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman will travel to Montreal next week to represent New Zealand and Oceania at the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) Executive Committee.

“New Zealand athletes have an enviable reputation for being free of doping and we are committed to the global fight against doping in sport,” says Dr Coleman.

“Inclusion on WADA's Executive Committee is an opportunity for New Zealand to play a greater leadership role in the area of anti-doping.”

The Executive Committee is a 12-member panel which controls the world's most significant guidelines against drugs in sport. This includes maintaining the list of prohibited substances and methods.

New Zealand and Australia have an informal agreement to rotate a seat on the Executive Committee, alternating between one year for New Zealand and two for Australia. New Zealand last held the seat in 2012.

“Taking up this seat is timely as it comes off the back of New Zealand being the first of ten countries to sign the 2015-2018 International Anti-Doping Arrangement (IADA) earlier this year.

“The IADA focuses on the sharing of information and expertise with the aim of further developing anti-doping policies and programmes to be shared with WADA.”

The Executive Committee will meet on 12 May. Dr Coleman will also represent Oceania at the Foundation Board meeting the next day.
