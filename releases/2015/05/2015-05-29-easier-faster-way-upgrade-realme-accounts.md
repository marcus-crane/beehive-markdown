Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Dunne says thousands of New Zealand online passport renewal applicants now have an easy, fast way to get a RealMe verified identity and access a range of online services.

“With a tick of the box, New Zealanders can verify their identity with RealMe when [they renew an adult passport online](http://www.passports.govt.nz/Adult-passport-renewal---form) and already more than 1200 customers have done so, more than half of those eligible, since the launch of the service at the weekend.

“Customers can use a RealMe verified identity to open bank accounts with BNZ and TSB, enrol to vote with the Electoral Commission and more. Students are able to use a RealMe verified identity when they apply to StudyLink for allowances and loans.

“Adult passport renewal online customers are required to have a RealMe login and it is a simple step to upgrade their RealMe account to a RealMe verified identity using the passport photo they submit as part of their application, at no extra cost. Up to 400,000 adults renew their passport every year, 150,000 of them use the world-class online renewal service annually”, says Mr Dunne.

“*RealMe* is a core component of the Government’s drive to deliver better, faster online services.

“The Electronic Verification Act was introduced in 2012 to allow people to prove their identity electronically to public and private providers, using *RealMe as* a secure, trusted, consent based online identity verification service. Once a customer has verified their identity they will no longer need to supply paper identity documents to prove who they are.

Banks and finance companies can use *RealMe* to meet the requirements for electronic identity verification set out under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism legislation.

*“RealMe* is another example of the Government making life easier for New Zealanders. A *RealMe* verified identity is a secure, trusted, consent-based online identity. I look forward to more organisations signing up to this innovative service in the near future”, says Mr Dunne.

More information about the *RealMe* services is available at: [http://www.realme.govt.nz](http://www.realme.govt.nz)

RealMe is an initiative from the New Zealand Government and New Zealand Post.

**Notes:**

A **RealMe login** lets you access multiple online services with the same username and password. The service is designed to protect your privacy and security, so you can confidently use your RealMe login in many places, saving you from remembering lots of different logins. 

A **RealMe verified** **identity** account goes further than a simple login. By verifying your identity once by applying online when you renew your adult passport or by online application and taking a trip to your local New Zealand Post retail outlet, you can use your RealMe verified identity at participating organisations to prove who you are online many times.
