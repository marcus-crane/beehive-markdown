A further increase in the proportion of students achieving NCEA has been hailed by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

Since provisional NCEA results were issued in January the percentage of students achieving the all-important NCEA Level 2 qualification has risen from 87.1 percent to 88.3 percent as a result of reconsiderations and reviews and the late reporting of results for internally-assessed standards.

Ms Parata says the proportion of students achieving NCEA Levels 1 and 3 has also risen.

The final results, issued by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, also show that in 2014 the proportion of students achieving NCEA rose for both males and females, all ethnicities and across all decile bands.

“The results demonstrate that the Government’s unrelenting focus on raising achievement for all students is paying dividends,” Ms Parata says. ‘However, there is still more to be done to lift those lagging behind, especially Māori and Pasifika students, students from poorer families and students with special needs.

“Education is the passport to a better future and we are determined to help all young New Zealanders achieve their potential,” she says.

**Notes:** Participation-based data assesses the performance of students who enrolled for sufficient credits to gain an NCEA level certificate. Roll-based data relates to all students on the roll as at 1 July. The above figures draw on participation-based data.
