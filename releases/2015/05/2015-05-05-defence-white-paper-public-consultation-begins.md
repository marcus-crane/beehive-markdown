Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee welcomes the beginning of the public consultation process for the 2015 Defence White Paper, calling for New Zealanders to seize this opportunity to influence defence policy.

The White Paper, which is intended to be published before the end of the year, will be the blueprint for how the Government plans to address the security threats, challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand over the next 25 years.

It will outline the roles and tasks that the Defence Force should undertake in responding to these challenges, as well as the capabilities and resources it needs to carry out its roles and tasks effectively.  The Government last published a Defence White Paper in 2010.

“I encourage New Zealanders to take part in the consultations from 5 May to 22 June, as it’s important that a diverse range of perspectives inform New Zealand’s defence policy and planning,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The White Paper has implications for all New Zealanders.  It’s not just about what capabilities we buy, it’s about how we look after and advance our national interests.

“That’s why it’s important for New Zealanders to take this opportunity to contribute to the Government’s defence policy from 2015 onwards.

“By making a submission, New Zealanders will be able to share their views on how the Defence Force can best protect New Zealand and advance our interests overseas.”

**Notes:**

**What is the Defence White Paper 2015?**

The Defence White Paper will be the blueprint for how the Government plans to address the security threats, challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand over the next 25 years.

It will outline the roles and tasks that the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) should undertake in responding to these challenges as well as the capabilities and resources it needs to carry out its roles and tasks effectively.

**Why is the Government holding public consultations for the Defence White Paper?**

Public consultations are being undertaken to ensure a diverse range of perspectives inform New Zealand’s defence policy and planning from 2015 onwards.

**How can I take part in the public consultation process?**

There are three ways you can participate:

- Complete submission forms on the NZDF Intranet (for NZDF personnel only) or on the Ministry of Defence’s website ([www.defence.govt.nz](http://www.defence.govt.nz)).
- Download and send completed submission forms either by email to [DWP15@defence.govt.nz](mailto:DWP15@defence.govt.nz) (for the general public) or by Freepost to: Defence White Paper 2015, Ministry of Defence, P.O. Box 12703, Wellington 6144.
- Take part in public consultation sessions being organised with universities, think tanks and veterans’ associations across the country. The schedules of these sessions will be on the MOD website, and disseminated through the media, the NZ Returned and Services’ Association, the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs and the Defence Industry Association.

**How can NZDF personnel have their say?**

NZDF military and civilian personnel can make submissions using the internal consultation process.  The submissions will go to the Defence White Paper Project Team via NZDF channels.

Use of the internal consultation process ensures that members of the NZDF do not breach DFO 13/2006, which regulates public statements about defence matters by members of the NZDF. 

The Chief of Defence Force has authorised the use of the internal process as the sole means for NZDF submissions to ensure there are no unauthorised releases of official information and the conventions governing the relationship between the NZDF and the Government, and between members of the NZDF and command, are not inadvertently breached.

**How long is the public consultation process?**

The public consultations will be undertaken for about seven weeks from early May to 22 June 2015.

**What are the key issues on which public input is being sought?**

The Government is seeking input on the following issues:

- the major threats or challenges to New Zealand’s security now and in the future
- the changes in the international environment, including the relations between states, non-state actors and international institutions, that will affect New Zealand’s interests and what this might mean for the NZDF
- the roles that the NZDF should perform to keep New Zealand secure and advance our interests abroad
- the emerging security challenges that New Zealand is likely to face in its immediate territory, including its Exclusive Economic Zone, Continental Shelf, the territory of the Realm Nations and the Ross Dependency
- how the Government should prioritise the Defence Force’s efforts between ensuring New Zealand is secure, supporting the security and stability of our allies and partners, and contributing to international peace and security globally
- how the NZDF should operate as part of the all-of-government effort to protect and advance the nation’s interests
- the Defence Force’s role in contributing to New Zealand’s national resilience to unforeseen events and natural disasters
- the NZDF’s role in the development of New Zealand’s youth
- the military capabilities the NZDF needs to carry outs its roles effectively, now and in the future.

**The Government last issued a Defence White Paper in 2010.  Why is it necessary to publish another White Paper?**

A new White Paper is necessary because the international environment has changed in the last five years.  This means that the Government needs to reassess its defence policy priorities and update the defence capability plan.

Given the shifts in the international environment, the Government is keen to listen to the public’s views on where, how and to what extent they think New Zealand should contribute to international peace and security efforts.

**What kind of Defence Force does New Zealand currently have?**

New Zealand has a highly professional and well-trained defence force.  The NZDF supports the work of a range of other New Zealand government agencies in addressing challenges to domestic security, including counter-terrorism, maritime surveillance and response to natural disasters.

The NZDF also plays an important role in advancing New Zealand’s interests regionally and internationally.  In the Pacific, it supports the Government’s efforts to support Pacific Island states and provides humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the wake of natural disasters.

The Defence Force continues to participate in United Nations and other multinational operations, from South Sudan to Korea, reinforcing New Zealand’s commitment to collective security and the international rule of law.

Such operations form a major part of the Defence Force’s role over the past two decades, with around 400 personnel deployed around the world at any given time.

**How will submissions be used?**

Information received through the public consultation process, including personal information, will only be used for the purposes of developing the White Paper.  Following completion of the consultation process, a summary report outlining key themes emerging from the public submissions will be published.

Submitters should note that as a public agency, the Ministry of Defence is subject to the Official Information Act 1982.  Copies of submissions received will normally be made available on request, and the content of some submissions may be cited in reports.  Any request to withhold information on the grounds of confidentiality or for any other reason will be determined in accordance with the Official Information Act.

**When will the Defence White Paper be published?**

The Government intends to publish the White Paper before the end of 2015.  A summary of submissions outlining the key themes and messages emerging from the public consultations will be published following completion of the consultation process.

**If I have further questions about the public consultations, who can I contact?**
