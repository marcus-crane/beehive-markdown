Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson travels to New York today to attend the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Open Briefing on foreign terrorist fighters.

“New Zealand, along with many members of the international community, is facing complex issues related to the radicalisation, recruitment and travel of foreign terrorist fighters,” Mr Finlayson said.

Lithuania is chairing the Briefing that will assess the progress made towards implementing Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014), which specifically addresses foreign terrorist fighters.

The Briefing will also build on the work that took place at the Countering Violent Extremism Summit held in Washington earlier this year.

“We welcome the UNSC’s continuing leadership on this matter and look forward to working with the international community to identify best practice measures,” Mr Finlayson said.
