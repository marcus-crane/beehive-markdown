Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the formal start of a new Primary Growth Partnership (PGP) programme involving the deer industry.

“’Passion2Profit’ is a seven year programme which aims to deliver economic benefits of $56 million per year in additional industry revenue by the end of the programme,” says Mr Guy.

“The partnership between Deer Industry New Zealand (DINZ) and the Ministry for Primary Industries will set the groundwork for major improvements in the production and marketing of New Zealand venison.

“The programme will help the industry overcome a key challenge from its over-reliance on markets where demand is seasonal and not in step with our own venison supply.

“It will brand and position New Zealand venison as a luxury red meat sold year-round in new markets. 

“The programme will also help farmers to adopt systems and technologies to enable them to deliver the venison that markets want, and when they want.”

“It will bring together producers, processors and marketers of venison, who represent 95 percent of the venison produced in New Zealand.”

A total investment of $16 million has been secured for Passion2Profit, with MPI contributing almost $7.4 million and the balance coming from Deer Industry New Zealand and its commercial partners.

“It’s encouraging to see broad support for this programme from the wider deer industry,” says Mr Guy.

The programme’s contract was formally signed today by MPI Director-General Martyn Dunne and DINZ Chief Executive Dan Coup.

**About the Primary Growth Partnership**

- The PGP aims to boost the value, productivity and profitability of our primary sector through investment between government and industry. It provides an essential springboard to enable New Zealand to stay at the forefront of primary sector innovation.
- Government and industry are co-investing $720 million over time into 20 PGP programmes (2 completed, 17 underway, and one undergoing contract negotiation).
- Decisions on which programmes are approved are made by the independent Investment Advisory Panel (IAP).
- PGP programmes are generally long-run programmes of five to seven years’ duration and are subject to oversight and monitoring by an independent panel IAP and MPI.
- Monitoring requirements include programme steering groups, quarterly progress reporting, annual plans, financial audits, and progress reviews, along with evaluation of the overall programme.  Government funding is only released to programmes on receipt of invoices for work completed in accordance with programme plans.
