Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry says the latest SuperGold business recruitment campaign has achieved its aim of signing up more health professionals and lawyers.

The campaign ran over March and April and resulted in more than 650 new businesses offering discounts. Among them are 60 dental practices and more than 40 legal firms around the country.

Around 70% of these new businesses have come from outside of the main centres.

“There is now even more opportunity for SuperGold Card holders to save money when they are considering setting up legal documents like updated wills and appointing trusted people to have Enduring Power of Attorney,” Ms Barry says.

“I want the SuperGold Card to be more useful for our older people. I would like it to have a special focus on attracting businesses in traditional health categories that look after the eyes, ears and teeth, as well as legal services.”

From humble beginnings in 2008, there are now more than 8000 businesses represented by 12,500 outlets offering discounts for SuperGold Card holders.

More than 200 businesses offering hearing, dental and legal services across the country provide a discount, as well as around 275 optometrists.

“An ageing population means it makes good business sense to join the SuperGold programme as a way of reaching out to this ever growing group of older New Zealanders,” Ms Barry says.
