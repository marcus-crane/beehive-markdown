Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated Joshua Hansen on being awarded this year’s Prime Minister’s Award for Academic Excellence.

The former Westlake Boys’ High School student was presented the award by Prime Minister John Key at the NZQA Top Scholar Award ceremony held at Parliament today.

“This award is presented annually to the New Zealand Scholarship student who showed the highest overall level of academic excellence,” says Ms Parata.

“I’d like to congratulate Joshua on being recognised for his outstanding achievements with this award, which is the top academic accolade secondary students can aim for.”

Joshua received seven New Zealand Scholarships, including five Outstanding Scholarships and a Top Subject award.

“He also demonstrated himself to be an all-rounder with strong leadership qualities and represented his school on an official tour to Europe to commemorate World War One.

“Joshua is an example of what can be achieved through hard work and a drive to succeed, and I wish him all the best for the future.”

Joshua is currently studying towards a conjoint Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of Arts in French and History at Victoria University of Wellington.

Ms Parata also presented 10 Premier Awards at the ceremony and 35 Top Subject Scholar Awards were presented by NZQA board member Murray Strong.

Recipients are recommended to NZQA by an expert panel of academics. More information is available on the NZQA [website](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/about-us/news/2014-nz-scholarship-results-now-available/).
