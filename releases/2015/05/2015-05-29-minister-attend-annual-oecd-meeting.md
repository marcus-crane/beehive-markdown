Trade Minister Tim Groser will represent New Zealand at the OECD’s annual Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) and Forum in Paris from 2 – 4 June.

“The forum and MCM is an opportunity for ministers to discuss a range of global challenges faced by many countries such as high unemployment, social inclusion, and low economic growth,” says Mr Groser.

“Themes at this year’s forum will invite discussion on how we can assist to address these issues through investment and innovation, trade and improving the business environment.”

“Trade is an important mechanism to help achieve sustained and inclusive growth and as a panel participant in the trade and investment session, I will have the opportunity to share New Zealand’s views and position on these issues.”

In the margins of these meetings there will be the customary informal meeting of selected WTO Trade Ministers. Mr Groser will meet with counterparts to press New Zealand’s case for an FTA with the European Union.

Both events bring together government ministers, international experts, and key academic, business, and civil society figures.
