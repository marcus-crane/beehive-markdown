Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for Singapore to join his counterparts at the 14th annual Shangri-La Dialogue.

“The Shangri-La Dialogue is a major regional security-focused meeting, bringing together Defence Ministers from around the Asia-Pacific,” Mr Brownlee says.

As well as attending dialogue sessions, the Minister will hold a number of bilateral meetings with counterparts from a range of countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States of America.

“New Zealand has a long history of active defence engagement in the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Events like the Shangri-La Dialogue provide an opportunity for the countries of the Asia-Pacific to develop a common understanding of the region’s major security challenges and how best to tackle them.

“With the vast majority of New Zealand’s imports and exports transiting through the Asia-Pacific our country has a very real stake in the region’s security.

“A stable and secure Asia-Pacific region underpins our economic prosperity and development.”

Around 30 countries are attending the 14th annual Shangri-La Dialogue.  The Minister will be accompanied by Secretary of Defence Helene Quilter, and Chief of Air Force Air Vice Marshal Mike Yardley.
