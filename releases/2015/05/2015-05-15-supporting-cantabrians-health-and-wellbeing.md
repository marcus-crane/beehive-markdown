Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says the Community in Mind Shared Programme of Action, being launched today, will ensure the remarkable resilience of Canterbury communities continues.

“Recovery from natural disasters is not just about bricks and mortar. We know from international experience that people need support over time to recover their health and wellbeing,” Ms Wagner says.

“There are many exciting initiatives taking place across Canterbury to support people’s health and wellbeing. These include Community Support Groups, school-based Positive Behaviour for Learning, the Leadership in Communities Project, the Summer of Fun events and the ‘All Right?’ campaign.”

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority co-ordinates the Shared Programme of Action, with the individual actions managed by each group.

“The Shared Programme of Action performs the important role of bringing together each of the organisations, agencies and community groups involved.

“A big-picture approach means these individual initiatives can be linked and work together. As new programmes begin, they can see what has gone before them and build on those successes.

“Through the Shared Programme of Action, the Government aims to improve community and individual resilience, deliver positive outcomes and support Cantabrians as they lead their own recovery,” Ms Wagner says.

The Shared Programme of Action implements the Community in Mind Strategy, which was launched last year.
