The Minister of Civil Defence, Nikki Kaye, has thanked communities and agencies in the Wellington and Bay of Plenty regions for the way they’ve responded to flooding, landslides and a tornado.

The Wellington region, including the Kapiti Coast and Hutt Valley, received torrential rain for much of yesterday, and last night a tornado struck Mount Maunganui.

“The Wellington region in particular faced significant disruption, and it was heart-warming to see how people reached out to support each other, for example by opening their homes to stranded commuters.

“Our deepest sympathies go out to the family of the elderly gentleman who lost his life.

“While no states of local emergency were declared, Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) operation centres were activated to help coordinate and support local responses.

“CDEM offices, councils, emergency services, transport operators, schools and many others worked together to respond as best as possible in the conditions, and to keep the public informed.

“Over the past 24 hours, I have spoken with Mayors in the Wellington and Bay of Plenty regions to thank them and ensure they have the support they need.

“After events such as these, local authorities’ CDEM teams review their arrangements and look for lessons learned, and it’s my expectation that will happen in this situation.

“Today a range of people and agencies will be involved in responding to any further incidents and helping with the clean-up.

“Some schools remain closed in the Wellington area, and Ministry of Education officials are working to ensure repairs to the wind-damaged Mt Maunganui Intermediate school can get underway quickly.

“Yesterday’s events are a message for all of New Zealand. Winter is coming and we need to be prepared.

There will be more storms, and our household emergency plans need to allow for that.”

Some tips to help prepare include making sure that you have:

- A household emergency plan for when you’re at home and other places. Think about what you would do if you couldn’t get home from work, your children are at school or other family members can’t travel.
- Emergency supplies at home, in case you have to stay there. Keep enough water and food at home for three days, along with a battery-powered radio and batteries. Also, think about how would you cook and keep warm if the power went out.
- A getaway bag at work. This should at least have shoes you can walk in, water, easy-to-carry food, wet-weather clothes and a battery-powered radio.
