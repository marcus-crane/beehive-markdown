Coordination between agencies has seen the Crown continue to reduce its property footprint and pay less for office space, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Property Management Centre of Expertise (PMCoE) today released the fourth Crown Office Estate Report showing the Government is making good progress creating more effective, flexible and agile workplaces.

“Since 2011, the total Crown Estate footprint has reduced by 121,433m², with the last year showing an overall reduction of 55,514m² – the equivalent of over seven rugby fields,” Mrs Bennett says.

“People don’t live their lives the way our institutions so often frame them, with different departments or agencies working separately from one another.

“Across the board, we are breaking down the silos that have held the public sector back from being positioned to provide the outstanding services modern New Zealand needs and expects.” 

The PMCoE’s focus on helping agencies to work together and save taxpayers money has led to more than 18 agencies working together on co-locations last year, better optimising the Crown Estate.

“We are still on track to reduce the cost of property holdings by around $110 million by 2023, by reducing the office space we take up and becoming more efficient in how we use that space,” says Mrs Bennett.

“Putting it another way, over the next 10 years the Government is on track to free up space equivalent to the size of the Reserve Bank Building.

“PMCoE’s efforts have also seen a reduction from $6,840 to $6,668 in the average total cost per person across Government. While modest, this represents tangible savings to New Zealand taxpayers.”
