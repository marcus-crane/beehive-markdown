Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Government has approved a new specialist mental health facility for Counties-Manukau DHB.

“The Government is committed to investing in world-class mental health facilities,” says Dr Coleman.

“That’s why we’re investing $23.6 million into the development of a new acute mental health unit at Middlemore Hospital.

“The new 76-bed unit will replace the existing 52-bed acute mental health facility, Tiaho Mai.

“It will be a modern, purpose-built unit which will better support both patients and staff, and allow the provision of up-to-date acute mental health services.

“The increase in the bed capacity will also allow the DHB to better handle a forecast growth in demand for acute services over the next 15 years.

“The vast majority of New Zealanders who access mental health services will continue to be successfully helped by community-based services, but for those who are in need of acute care this new unit will be a substantial improvement.”

The new unit will cost $53.6 million in total, with $30 million being funded by the DHB. The new facility is expected to open from August 2018.

The Government has increased funding for mental health and addiction services from $1.1 billion in 2008/2009 to over $1.3 billion in 2013/14.
