Budget 2015 provides an additional $218.6 million investment in the justice sector over the next four years, Justice Minister Amy Adams says.

The increase in operating funding enables the sector to continue working to further reduce the impact of crime on New Zealand families.

Reducing the causes and impact of crime is a key priority for the Government, Ms Adams says.

“The justice sector has made outstanding strides in meeting two of its four Better Public Services targets faster than expected and in reducing crime to a 35-year low. But there is still more we can do to improve public safety and help ensure New Zealand families feel safe in their homes and communities,” she says.

The $218.6 million funding over four years across the justice sector includes:

- Justice and Courts: $40 million.
- Police: $164 million.
- Serious Fraud Office: $8.1 million.
- Corrections: $6.5 million from the Justice Sector Fund.

The $40 million in Justice and Courts will fund targeted areas to improve services and drive efficiencies to deliver better outcomes for New Zealanders.

In 2015/16, $10 million of this has been allocated to the Investing in Justice programme, initiatives relating to the Harmful Digital Communications Bill, establishing a Chief Victims Advisor and helping build the Christchurch Justice and Emergency Services Precinct.

“This is a significant investment in these agencies, which are continuing to work hard to deliver value for money for taxpayers, including reinvesting and reprioritising spending within baselines.

“The justice sector is an excellent example of government agencies working closely together to coordinate policies and drive better public services for New Zealanders and their families,” Ms Adams says.
