Foreign Minister Murray McCully and a Parliamentary delegation will travel to the Cook Islands next week to meet with Prime Minister Puna and mark the final stages of the $20.5 million Cook Islands Solar Project.

“This year we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Cook Islands’ self-government and the special relationship between New Zealand and the Cooks,” Mr McCully says.

“We will meet with Prime Minister Henry Puna to discuss arrangements for the anniversary, regional issues, and our development assistance to the Cook Islands.

“The delegation will also travel Penrhyn and Manihiki by NZDF C-130 to formally open New Zealand funded renewable energy projects, hold talks with local leaders, and take part in the annual Joint Ministerial Forum,” Mr McCully says.

The Minister will be accompanied by the Rt Hon Winston Peters, David Shearer MP, and Pacific Economic Ambassador Shane Jones.
