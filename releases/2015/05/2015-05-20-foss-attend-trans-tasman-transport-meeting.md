Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss will represent the New Zealand Government at the third Transport and Infrastructure Council meeting in Sydney this week.

Mr Foss will join representatives from Australia’s federal, state and local governments to discuss a range of transport issues.

“This is an excellent opportunity for New Zealand to learn from the challenges and experiences of our close neighbour,” Mr Foss says.

“I’m interested in finding out more about Australian initiatives to improve heavy vehicle safety, including ways to address heavy vehicle driver fatigue.

“I’m also keen to share examples of our transport policy, including the recent vehicle licence reform.”

While in Sydney, Mr Foss will meet officials from Transport for New South Wales to discuss road safety issues.
