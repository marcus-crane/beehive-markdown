Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed a visit to New Zealand by Mr Hu Chunhua, Politburo Member of CPC Central Committee and Party Secretary of Guangdong Province.

“The China relationship is a rapidly growing and wide-ranging one, covering trade and economic matters but also political and cultural ties,” Mr McCully says.

“Following President Xi’s visit last year and the agreement by leaders to characterise the relationship as a comprehensive strategic partnership, Hu Chunhua’s visit reaffirms that the relationship between New Zealand and China is in excellent shape.

“The visit will provide a further opportunity to emphasise New Zealand’s commitment to building on trade and economic links with the Guangdong region, particularly in areas of business cooperation, fostering investment and film cooperation, education and tourism links,” Mr McCully says.

During Party Secretary Hu’s 3-day visit he will meet with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister McCully and the Economic Development and Māori Development Ministers.
