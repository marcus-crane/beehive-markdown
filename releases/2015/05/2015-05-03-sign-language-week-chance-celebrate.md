Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner encourages people from all walks of life to celebrate, communicate and connect with New Zealand’s Deaf Community during the upcoming New Zealand Sign Language Week.

“New Zealand Sign Language Week is a chance to celebrate one of our three official languages, and one that is used by over 20,000 New Zealanders every day,” Ms Wagner says.

“Hundreds of events have been arranged across New Zealand, including tours of art galleries and museums, comedy festival shows, and talk shows – all of which will be facilitated by a NZSL interpreter.

“There will also be over 800 free NZSL taster classes run in schools, businesses and healthcare facilities.

“I am looking forward to attending the NZSL In Action Awards on Saturday night, where businesses, schools, community leaders and individuals will be recognised for their contribution to NZSL over the past 12 months.

“I would like to congratulate Deaf Aotearoa and the many community groups, businesses, schools and individuals who are making this week possible,” Ms Wagner says.

New Zealand Sign Language Week runs from 4-10 May. Further information about New Zealand Sign Language events can be found here: [www.deaf.org.nz/nzslw-2015-events](http://www.deaf.org.nz/nzslw-2015-events)
