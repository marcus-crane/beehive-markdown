Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew today announced two new appointments and a reappointment to the Families Commission (operating as Superu – Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit) Board.

“Len Cook and Hon Dame Tariana Turia have been appointed to the Superu Board, and will bring valuable skills and experience to complement the existing Board members,” Mrs Goodhew says.

Mr Cook has acted as an expert advisor to the Superu Board since 2013 and is a specialist in the use of statistics and social science research.

Dame Tariana was the former co-leader of the Maori Party. During her time in Parliament she held a number of ministerial roles, including serving as the first Minister responsible for Whānau Ora.

Mr James Prescott has been re-appointed as a member of the Board for a further term of 12 months, and Mr Cook and Dame Tariana have been appointed as new members for a period of three years.

“Superu received approximately $9 million in Crown funding in 2014/2015 to improve New Zealand’s social research infrastructure, and to ensure that there is an increased use of evidence to support robust social policy”, says Mrs Goodhew.
