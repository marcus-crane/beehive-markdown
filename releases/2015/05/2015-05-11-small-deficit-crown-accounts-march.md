The Crown accounts for the nine months to March 31 posted a deficit of $358 million, smaller than the $1.2 billion deficit forecast by Treasury in December, Finance Minister Bill English says.

The smaller deficit primarily reflects tax revenue coming in $844 million higher than forecast.

Corporate tax was $545 million higher than forecast, customs and excise duties were $129 million higher and other individuals tax was $357 million above forecast. As in previous months, this was partially offset by GST being $201 million lower than forecast – in part driven by very low inflation leading to lower than expected consumer spending.

“Although tax was ahead of expectations, these figures underscore the difficulty in forecasting the difference between two large numbers,” Mr English says. “Treasury consider that around $400 million of the variance was the result of tax being paid earlier than expected – rather than an ongoing increase in the tax take.

“Treasury’s latest forecasts have tax for the 2014/15 year lower than forecast at Budget 2014, primarily due to lower inflation which currently sits at 0.1 per cent in the year to March.”

The Government continues to control its own expenditure, with core Crown expenses in the year to March coming in $127 million below forecast.

Core Crown expenditure for 2014/15 is now expected to be $4.1 billion lower than forecast in 2011, when the surplus target was first set.

“We’re getting on top of spending, but lower inflation, while good for households and businesses, means Treasury’s Budget forecasts will show a small deficit for 2014/15,” Mr English says.
