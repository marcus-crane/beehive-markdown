Climate Change Issues Minister Tim Groser today called for public submissions on New Zealand‘s post 2020 climate change target.

In December countries will meet in Paris to establish a new climate change agreement. Ahead of the Paris conference, countries are expected to announce the action they will take to curb climate change.  All countries have been asked to put forward a national target to reduce harmful emissions after 2020.

“New Zealand wants to set a target which is environmentally credible and reflects our particular circumstances.  But we also need to consider the possible impacts and costs to our economy,” says Mr Groser.

“Increasing our commitment after 2020 will be a big challenge, as nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from agriculture and 80 per cent of our electricity already comes from renewable sources. The easy gains have already been made.  But we are expected to make a fair contribution to combating this global problem.”

“To understand what’s important to New Zealanders as we consider our national contribution, the Government has today issued a public discussion document. It poses questions for people to consider as they think about making their submission.”

The discussion document, and a range of other information, can be found on the Ministry for the Environment’s website at [www.mfe.govt.nz/climate/consultation](http://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate/consultation).  Submissions close at 5.00pm on Wednesday 3rd June. 

Public meetings and hui will be held across the country, Mr Groser said.
