Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is urging smokers to make this Sunday the day they quit for good.

The theme of World Smokefree Day 2015 on Sunday is “It’s about whānau”.

“World Smokefree Day is an excellent opportunity to encourage whānau and friends to get behind those who want to quit smoking to improve their health and the health of those around them,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

New Zealand has made real progress in reducing smoking rates over the past few decades. Progress has been slower for Māori and Pacific people. The overall number of adult daily smokers is 15.5 per cent (550,000) but for Māori the figure is 37 per cent (167,000) and for Pacific people 23 per cent (45,000).

“While we are still focused on bringing down the overall smoking rate, we need to redouble our efforts in cutting the smoking rates for Māori and Pacific people,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Ask your loved ones and your friends to quit. It is never too late to reap the health benefits of becoming smokefree. Set an example for your children and grandchildren. This Sunday provides the perfect opportunity.”

Mr Lotu-Iiga will be supporting World Smokefree Day activities on Sunday at Mt Smart Stadium where the NZ Warriors take on the Newcastle Knights.

Quit Buses will be stationed outside the stadium to encourage those fans thinking about giving up smoking to take that first step.

“Come and visit the Quit Bus on Sunday before you go into the stadium and see how the staff can help you to become smokefree. I will be there to cheer on both you and the Warriors,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The Quit Buses are funded as part of the Pathway to Smokefree 2025 Innovation Fund and provide smoking cessation and support services in the Greater Auckland region.
