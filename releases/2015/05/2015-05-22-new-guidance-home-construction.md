Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith today released at the Certified Builders’ Association conference in Christchurch new guidance on the standards of work expected for key aspects of new home construction.

“These quality measures are needed alongside our other initiatives to increase housing supply and affordability. There is a risk with the build rate up from 14,000 to 25,000 homes per year that standards will slip. We are investing in record numbers of new building tradespeople and tightening up on standards to ensure we get both the quality and quantity of new homes that New Zealand needs,” Dr Smith says.

“This new resource provides clarity for builders and homeowners on the standards of work expected. It complements the new consumer protection requirements that the Government introduced on 1 January. These regulations provide for a defect period of 12 months with an obligation to remedy. This guidance gives better information on what constitutes an acceptable level of workmanship.”

The *Guide to tolerances, materials and workmanship in new residential construction* covers roof and wall cladding, windows and doors, flooring, wall and ceiling linings, cabinets and benchtops, plumbing, drainage and electrical fittings.

“The guidance covers common areas of dispute, like what degree of slope on a floor is reasonable or when a crack in a driveway is unacceptable. It will help resolve problems more quickly by giving clarity about what tolerances are acceptable,” Dr Smith says.

The guide has been written with advice and consultation from the building and construction industry, and represents currently accepted standards.
