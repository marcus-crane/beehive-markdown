Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest quarterly health target results show the shorter stays in emergency departments target has been met for the first time.

“DHBs are continuing to improve their performance on the Government’s health targets,” says Dr Coleman.

“Across the country over 250,000 New Zealanders were admitted, discharged or transferred from an emergency department within six hours. Achieving the 95 per cent target for the first time is a significant achievement.

“The number of patients presenting to emergency departments continues to increase. In quarter three, 4,481 more people attended an emergency department compared to the last quarter.

“Reaching the target is a tribute to all the staff working within emergency departments and DHBs. We know that emergency departments only work well when the rest of the hospital is working well too.”

The improved access to elective surgery and the hospital component of the better help for smokers to quit targets were also met:

- 96 per cent of smokers in hospitals were offered advice on how to quit.
- DHBs delivered 7,997 more elective surgical discharges than planned.

“DHBs remain focused on reducing waiting times for elective first specialist assessments and treatment,” says Dr Coleman.

“The extra $98 million for elective surgery in Budget 2015 will provide more New Zealanders with timely surgery. The Government is committed to continuing to deliver increases in elective surgery.”

The results also show good progress on other targets, including:

- The more heart and diabetes checks target increased to 88 per cent.
- The primary care component of the better help for smokers to quit target increased to 89 per cent.
- The new faster cancer treatment health target increased to 67 per cent – this is the second time this target has been reported.
