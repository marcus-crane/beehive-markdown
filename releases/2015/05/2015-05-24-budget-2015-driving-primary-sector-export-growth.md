The Government will invest $7.5 million over two years in developing key skills and systems to help boost exports across the primary sector, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says.

This investment focuses on key initiatives that will help deliver greater economic growth, including:

- Identifying new farming systems and processes.
- Building international consumer trust in New Zealand products.
- Identifying and prioritising opportunities to increase investment, employment and incomes in the primary sector.
- Encouraging more people to get involved in the primary industries.

“As international markets become more competitive and our products become more sophisticated, it is crucial New Zealand’s primary industries skills keep pace,” says Mr Guy.

“We know the primary sector needs an additional 50,000 jobs by 2025, and we will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Education on raising awareness of these career paths. The 20% increase in funding for agriculture at tertiary level in Budget 2015 is also an important step.

“The Government will also invest in identifying new farming systems and processes that improve financial, animal welfare and environmental performance. This is on top of $10 million in new funding announced in the Budget for animal welfare.

“Additional funding will help to improve the OVERSEER nutrient management tool, which is an important tool for setting and managing within environmental limits. It helps farmers and growers to improve their productivity, reduce nutrient leaching into waterways, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The funding is part of a plan to significantly improve OVERSEER over the next 3 years.

“We are also investing in work to authenticate our goods by making products harder to counterfeit and building consumer trust in New Zealand products. This is about supporting the efforts of the sector to capture more value further up the supply chain,” Mr Guy says.

Mr Guy made the announcement today at the official opening of new facilities at The Olive Press in Greytown, Wairarapa.
