Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has today announced the appointment of the independent panel which will advise him on the Defence White Paper 2015.

This follows the announcement on 5 May that the public would have the opportunity to provide their views on the White Paper.     

The four members of the Panel are:

- Mr Brian Roche, Chairperson of the Advisory Panel and Chief Executive Officer of the NZ Post Group
- Hon Dr Wayne Mapp, a Member of the Law Commission and former Minister of Defence
- Mrs Corinne Haines, Managing Director of Trimble Navigation New Zealand Ltd
- Rear Admiral (Retired) David Ledson, Chair of Maritime New Zealand and of the National War Memorial Advisory Committee and a former Chief of Navy

“I’m pleased to have assembled this experienced and qualified panel that bring to the White Paper a range of highly relevant skills covering the business, political, defence, and organisational areas,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The panel will critically evaluate the options and recommendations coming out of the White Paper process and provide me with their views.

“They will also provide the independent assurance I need to have confidence in the White Paper when it is given to me at the end of this year by Defence officials.”

The Advisory Panel will also be able to advise the Minister on White Paper matters which he may request them to consider.
