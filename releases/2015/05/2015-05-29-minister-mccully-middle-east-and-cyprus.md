Foreign Minister Murray McCully departs on an official visit to the Middle East and Cyprus this weekend.

Minister McCully will be meeting with leaders and senior Ministers in Egypt, Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories and Cyprus, as well as Arab League officials in Cairo. 

“New Zealand will begin our presidency of the United Nations Security Council in July, and matters relating to the Middle East and the on-going situation in Cyprus will be on the agenda,” Mr McCully says.

“This visit will ensure New Zealand is well-placed to engage on the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), having heard directly from the relevant parties in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.

“In 2016 New Zealand and Egypt will serve together on the Security Council. In Cairo discussions will focus on mutual security concerns like Syria, and ISIL, as well as gaining an Egyptian perspective on the MEPP.

“My visit to Cyprus will give me the opportunity to hear from some of the key players on the Cyprus question and to encourage progress in the negotiations, which have recently resumed,” Mr McCully says.
