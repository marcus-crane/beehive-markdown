Prime Minister John Key has congratulated Their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, on the birth of their second child, a girl.

“On behalf of the people of New Zealand I would like to congratulate Prince William, Catherine and Prince George on this wonderful news.

“This is a very special time for any family. The Duke and Duchess are excellent parents and I am sure Prince George will adore his new little sister.”

Mr Key also extended his congratulations to The Queen and Prince Phillip, and The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, on the arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family.

New Zealand's official gift to the Royal couple will be a selection of woollen baby items from Hutt Valley company, Stansborough, including a pelt teddy bear.

“I wish Prince William, Catherine, Prince George and the Royal Family all the very best,” says Mr Key.

A 21 gun salute will be fired from Point Jerningham, Wellington to celebrate the birth.
