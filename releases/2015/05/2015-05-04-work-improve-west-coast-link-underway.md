Work is being done to improve a section of road vital for linking the South Island’s West Coast with Christchurch, says Transport Minister Simon Bridges.

Construction starts today on the State highway 73 Mingha Bluff realignment near Arthur’s Pass.

“This $22 million project will significantly improve the safety of locals and visitors travelling between Christchurch and Greymouth, and will also improve efficiency for business and freight,” Mr Bridges says.

Mingha Bluff is one of five critically important regional State highway projects which are being funded through the Government’s Accelerated Regional Roading Programme with up to $80 million in Crown funding.

Before the commitment of additional funding was made last year, the realignment project was unlikely to begin until after 2020.

The five projects are:

- Mingha Bluff (work starts today).
- Akerama Curves Realignment and Passing Lane in Northland (enabling works underway, construction starting soon).
- State highway 35 Slow Vehicle Bays in Gisborne (major works completed last month).
- Normanby Overbridge Realignment in Taranaki (first sod turned in March).
- Kawarau Falls Bridge in Otago (construction to begin later this year).

Through this programme, the Government has committed a further $132 million for the investigation and possible completion of nine additional regionally important State highway projects.
