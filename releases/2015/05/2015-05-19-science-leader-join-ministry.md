Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed the appointment of Dr David Wratt QSO as Departmental Science Advisor to the Ministry for the Environment.

“Dr Wratt is one of New Zealand’s most preeminent scientists, with international standing and a distinguished 30-year career in climate and meteorology. His wealth of experience will make a strong contribution to supporting the Ministry in its work advising the Government on environment issues,” Dr Smith says.

Dr Wratt will provide advice on science directly to the Secretary for the Environment, and will be responsible for ensuring the science that is produced and procured by the Ministry is of the highest quality. He will also have a role in supporting the development of cross-government science policy and research initiatives such as the National Science Challenges.

“This is the first science advisor to the Ministry since it was established 27 years ago. The appointment reflects the Government’s Bluegreen agenda of wanting to strengthen New Zealand’s environmental policy with greater input from science. If we are to make progress on difficult issues like climate change, water quality, air quality, biodiversity and improved oceans management, we need the very best of scientific advice,” Dr Smith says.

“The Environmental Reporting Bill I am currently taking through Parliament creates a new requirement on the Ministry and Statistics New Zealand to provide New Zealanders with an ongoing picture of the state of our environment. Dr Wratt will play an important role in ensuring the reports produced under the new legislation are based on good science.”

Dr Wratt sits on the Bureau of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and is Emeritus Climate Scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), as well as Adjunct Professor at both Victoria University of Wellington’s Climate Change Research Institute and Curtin University’s International Institute of Agri-Food Security.

“Dr Wratt will be working with the Government’s Departmental Science Advisor Network, convened by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Professor Sir Peter Gluckman, to ensure science effort across Natural Resource Sector agencies is aligned, efficient and fit-for-purpose. I congratulate Dr Wratt on his appointment and I look forward to his contributions,” Dr Smith says.

Dr Wratt has been appointed to the role on a part-time, fixed term basis and commences on 15 June.
