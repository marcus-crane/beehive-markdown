Biosecurity funding will be boosted by $24.9 million over four years, in addition to $2 million of capital funding, to increase our border capabilities, Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says.

“New Zealand has a world-class biosecurity system but there will always be a need for improvement. This investment will help future-proof our system to deal with the constantly changing demands of modern biosecurity,” he says.

“The funding will be used to expand New Zealand’s ability to detect pests and diseases, stop risk at the border and deal with risk offshore.”

The new funding will be used for a range of new biosecurity initiatives, including:

- Improving New Zealand’s import health standards to ensure they continue to keep pace with changing science and focus on our highest priority risks.
- Greater auditing of other countries’ systems to ensure they are compliant with New Zealand’s unique biosecurity requirements.
- Expanding our biosecurity detector dog capacity to manage risk at the border.
- Introducing more x-ray machines to allow for faster screening of increasing passenger volumes.

“This funding will supplement the recently-launched Biosecurity 2025 project, which will provide a clear direction for the biosecurity system and identify any changes or improvements needed over the next 10 years,” Mr Guy says.

This announcement is part of a range of measures in Budget 2015 to improve security and services at the border, involving immigration, customs and biosecurity.
