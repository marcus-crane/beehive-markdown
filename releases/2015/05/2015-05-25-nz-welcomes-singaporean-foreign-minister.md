Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomes Singaporean Foreign Minister Mr K Shanmugam to New Zealand.

“This year we mark 50 years of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Singapore, and the 50th anniversary of Singapore as a state,” Mr McCully says.

“2015 is also the 40th Anniversary of New Zealand’s relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Singapore is a founding member.

“Singapore is an important regional partner for New Zealand and our sixth largest trading partner - with two-way merchandise trade valued at more than $3 billion.

“There is huge potential to further develop the economic links between our two countries, as evidenced by the recent code-sharing agreement between Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines, and our talks will have a strong focus on how we can boost trade,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Shanmugam is in New Zealand until 26 May. This is his first visit to New Zealand as Foreign Minister.
