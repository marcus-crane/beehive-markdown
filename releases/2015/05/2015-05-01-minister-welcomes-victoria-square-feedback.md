Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner welcomes the public feedback received on Victoria Square and says the community’s ideas will help shape the future of the popular public space.

“More than 2100 people have shared their thoughts and ideas in writing on what they want to see for Victoria Square. The Square is well loved and many people have great memories, we want to ensure these memories can continue,” Ms Wagner says.

“In addition to the more than 2100 people who have provided written views online, on feedback forms and in video messages, there have been many others who have given their views face to face.

“We are taking note of everyone’s comment, compiling all of the feedback and will be coming back to the community in a few months to seek further input.

“The people of Christchurch have made it clear how important they consider Victoria Square to be and it is heartening to see so many people taking the time to let us know their thoughts,” Ms Wagner says.

Victoria Square is a part of the new Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct. More information can be found [ccdu.govt.nz/victoria-square](http://ccdu.govt.nz/projects-and-precincts/te-papa-otakaro-avon-river-precinct/victoria-square-market-place).
