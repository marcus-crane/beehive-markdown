Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee and his counterpart the Rt Hon Michael Fallon, Secretary of State for Defence, have signed a joint statement on defence cooperation between the United Kingdom and New Zealand at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore. The statement reflects findings from a review of the defence relationship.

“The joint statement reflects the depth and significance of the defence relationship between our two countries,” Mr Brownlee says.

Both Minister Brownlee and Secretary Fallon agreed that the statement is an important affirmation of the close defence relationship that we already enjoy. It also commits to continue improving our defence cooperation.

“The statement sets out strategic objectives for our future defence activities,” Mr Brownlee says.

This includes improving cooperation through personnel exchanges, cooperation on capability development and operating together in a number of theatres.

“New Zealand’s defence relationship with the United Kingdom is important and historic. There is value in reviewing what we do to make sure it is fit for purpose.”

Rt Hon Michael Fallon, Secretary of State for Defence said: “The UK has long-standing historic ties with New Zealand and closely aligned values and culture. We are also important Defence partners with an active exchange officer programme and shared operational experience.

“This statement is an important affirmation of this close relationship; it formalises our mutual commitment to continue improving existing areas of defence cooperation and has given our engagement structure by setting out strategic objectives for our future defence activities.”
