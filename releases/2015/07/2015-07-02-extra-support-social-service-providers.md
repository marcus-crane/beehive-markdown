Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced that a further $4.3 million in funding for capability development support has been provided to a range of social service providers.

Eighty-eight providers and collectives which deliver services to vulnerable New Zealanders have benefited from the funding.

It supports organisations to achieve better results by working together and building stronger systems for governance, planning and financial management.

Over 750 grants, totalling $27 million, have been awarded to providers since the capability funding was introduced in 2012.

“We understand how important it is that providers are focused on delivering the right services to improve the outcomes for our most vulnerable people,” says Mrs Tolley.

“This funding supports organisations to build their capability in a number of ways, including better assessment of client requirements, looking at the effectiveness of the services provided, and tailoring services so that they are more responsive to the needs of their clients.

“We are completely focused on ensuring that we get the best possible results for at-risk children, young people and adults.

“Over the next three years, as part of our new Community Investment Strategy, MSD will work with providers to help them transition to contracts that are results-focused and evidence-based, so that the $331 million that the taxpayer invests in this sector has the maximum impact on improving lives.”
