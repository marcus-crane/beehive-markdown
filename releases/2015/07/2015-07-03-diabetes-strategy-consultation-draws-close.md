Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says work is progressing towards a long term strategy to help people living with diabetes better manage their health.

“Diabetes is one of our biggest health challenges. It is estimated around 250,000 New Zealanders are living with the disease,” says Dr Coleman.

“We know that people with diabetes do better when they are active participants in their own care, supported by family.

“That’s why we want to ensure people get the integrated support they need to help manage their own health away from hospitals and closer to home.”

The five-year diabetes strategy will focus on achieving the best outcomes for people with diabetes and address the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes.

The strategy will link in with the Government’s initiatives in this area, including the Healthy Families NZ programme which encourages good lifestyle choices, and the Green Prescriptions programme.

The draft strategy has been out for consultation since June with key health sector bodies, service providers and people with diabetes. Consultation closes on 10 July. The Ministry of Health aims to introduce the new strategy later this year.

"Early intervention is a feature of the national diabetes services, thanks in part to the more heart and diabetes checks health target,” says Dr Coleman.

“In the last five years health providers have carried out record numbers of heart and diabetes checks – around 1.1 million.”
