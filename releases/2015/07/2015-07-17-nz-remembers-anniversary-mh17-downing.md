Foreign Minister Murray McCully says the thoughts of all New Zealanders are with the victims of the MH17 tragedy and their families on the first anniversary of the flight going down.

“New Zealand joins with other countries in remembering those aboard MH17 today,” Mr McCully says.

“The downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight in the eastern Ukraine cost 298 lives, including one New Zealand citizen and one New Zealand resident.

“In the immediate aftermath of the crash NZ Police provided assistance with disaster victim identification to help ensure the bodies of the victims could be returned to their families. We were also at the forefront of calls for a thorough investigation.

“One year on we remain committed to ensuring there is accountability for the MH17 incident.

“We are working with other affected countries, including Security Council members, to reach agreement on a way forward that can bring justice for MH17’s victims and their families,” Mr McCully says.
