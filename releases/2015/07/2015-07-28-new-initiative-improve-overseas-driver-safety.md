A new online training module will help ensure visiting drivers stay safe on New Zealand roads, Ministers Paula Bennett and Craig Foss say.

*Driving in New Zealand* provides overseas travel agents with information about New Zealand road rules and conditions.

“Tourism New Zealand has cleverly packaged together all the relevant safety information, in seven languages, and is offering it free of charge to any overseas travel retailers,” Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

*“*This training module builds on a large amount of work already underway, including the multi-agency Visiting Drivers Signature Project, a Code of Best Practice for rental companies, a Chinese-language safety guide and improvements to road infrastructure,” Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss says. 

“Providing information directly to travel agents is yet another way to spread our road safety message. 

“After completing the training, agents will be able to provide sound advice to anyone considering a self-drive holiday in New Zealand.  This will be particularly valuable when people are thinking about their itineraries and working out how much time they’ll need to spend driving.”

“New Zealand has many unique, sometimes challenging roads, especially around popular tourist destinations in the South Island,” Mrs Bennett says. 

“We want to make sure overseas visitors have a safe and enjoyable time here, and that New Zealanders feel more certain they are sharing the road with confident, informed drivers.” 

“I also urge visiting drivers to take advantage of the information available to them, including online at drivesafe.org.nz,” Mr Foss says.
