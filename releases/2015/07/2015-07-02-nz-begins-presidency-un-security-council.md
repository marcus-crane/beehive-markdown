Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the start of New Zealand’s month-long Presidency of the United Nations Security Council in New York.

Mr Key says New Zealand is committed to making its mark on the Council, and our first stint as President will allow us to build on the contribution we’ve made over the past six months.

“As President, New Zealand will have a central role in guiding Council consideration of key international security issues,” says Mr Key. 

“New Zealand will use the Presidency to draw attention to issues we highlighted during our campaign for a place on the Council.

“A particular focus will be the peace and security challenges confronting Small Island Developing States, including many of our Pacific neighbours.

“Such states rarely have the opportunity to be heard on the range of challenges they face, so we are ensuring the meeting on this issue will be open to all UN Members so they can address the Council themselves.”

Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to New York during July and will chair the Council for this event.

“We will also look to further efforts to jumpstart negotiations on the Middle East Peace Process and focus on bringing more transparency to the way the Council deals with the issues it is confronted with.” 

The Council will also remain focused on dealing with global crises, such as the conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya.

New Zealand is six months into a two-year term on the Security Council, and will serve as President again in 2016.
