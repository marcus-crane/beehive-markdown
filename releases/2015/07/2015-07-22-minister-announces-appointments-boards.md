Transport Minister Simon Bridges says he is pleased to announce appointments to two transport-related boards.

Grant Lilly has been reappointed as a board member of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) until 30 April 2017.

“Grant has been on the Board since 2011 and has a background in the airline industry, tourism and travel sectors. As well as his commercial skills, he brings financial, strategy and business performance skills.

“He has extensive governance and leadership experience and his familiarity with the aviation sector’s regulatory environment is a great asset to the Board,” Mr Bridges says.

Mr Bridges has also announced the appointment of three new members to the Oil Pollution Advisory Committee (OPAC) which advises Maritime New Zealand on oil spill matters.

Martin Burley (representing the oil distribution industry), is General Manager, Operations at Coastal Oil Logistics Limited.

Richard Wells (representing the New Zealand fishing industry) is employed as a Fisheries Specialist by the Deepwater Group and Annabel Young (representing the shipping industry) is the Executive Director of New Zealand Shipping.

“These new members bring with them the experience of their organisations and industries in marine oil spill responses which will be of great benefit to New Zealand and its maritime environment,” he says.
