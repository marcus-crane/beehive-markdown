Customs Minister Nicky Wagner announced today that from 6 July traders can go online to register and manage their own information and client and supplier code applications through the Trade Single Window.

“For brokers, the ability to go online reduces what is currently a 24-hour turnaround during business hours down to minutes, any time of day or night, in many cases,” Ms Wagner says.

“This major milestone comes at the same time as the number of inward border transactions through the Trade Single Window passes 2 million.

“The Trade Single Window is a great example of how Customs is making trade easier while maintaining New Zealand’s border security.

“Traders are coming on board to use Trade Single Window and save time and money.

“Many are strong supporters of the Trade Single Window and are attending workshops around the country over the next month to receive training in the online system.

“The steady increase in inward border transactions since Trade Single Window opened in August 2013 shows traders are progressively coming on board to benefit from improved response times and reduced transaction costs.

“The next major milestone on the horizon is the introduction of all remaining transaction types and advanced technology for managing risk and intelligence,” Ms Wagner says.

In June, around 60% of all inward border transactions and 100% of outward transactions were processed via Trade Single Window.
