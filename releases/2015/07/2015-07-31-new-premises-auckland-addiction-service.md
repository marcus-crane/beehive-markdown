Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened the new premises for Auckland’s Odyssey House alcohol and drug treatment service.

“Addiction issues affect not only the individual but also their family and friends. Providing quality and timely mental health and addiction services has been a priority for this Government,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is important that we have world-class addiction treatment facilities, dedicated, passionate staff and supportive communities.”

Last year Odyssey House helped more than 3,200 adults, youth and children through its seven treatment centres and its range of community programmes.

Odyssey House has a staff of more than 140 specially trained professionals supporting people with drug and alcohol issues to turn their lives around.

Odyssey House's new purpose built premises in New Lynn will accommodate the Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court team, as well as assessment and admissions. The building will also include a new public café which will provide work opportunities for clients.

“The café, which is due to open later in the year, is an innovative venture which will give clients practical work skills to help support themselves and their families,” says Dr Coleman.

Initially around 20 at risk youth will be trained at the café each year, this is forecast to reach 100 people as the business grows.

The Government has increased funding for mental health and addiction services from $1.1 billion in 2008/09 to more than $1.3 billion in 2013/14.

In 2014, more than 158,000 New Zealanders engaged with a mental health and addiction service and 91 percent received their care in the community.
