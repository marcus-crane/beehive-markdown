Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new clinical guidance will help reduce the harm caused by unnecessary treatments for men with low-risk prostate cancer.

“Delivering better cancer services is a priority for the Government. We are working hard to ensure patients receive faster access to cancer treatment,” says Dr Coleman.

The new clinical guidance released today focuses on the use of active surveillance to manage men with low-risk prostate cancer.

“We know that prostate cancer often has a slow rate of growth for many men. This means it could be a long time before treatment is advised,” says Dr Coleman.

“Men who are on active surveillance are closely monitored through an individualised care plan which includes regular tests, scans and biopsies.

“This means their urologist can determine whether the cancer is progressing and if treatment should be introduced.

“The new guidance will help standardise care across the country as it sets out who should be considered for active surveillance, and when they should move to other management options.

“We want to support men with low-risk prostate cancer to live healthy independent lives and avoid the harm caused by unnecessary treatments.”

The new guidance has been developed by the Ministry of Health and the Prostate Cancer Working Group. This group includes specialists, researchers and patient advocates. A copy is available on the Ministry website.
