Education Minister Hekia Parata has initiated a second round of consultation over the future of Raukokore School, Te Kura o Ōmaio and Te Whānau-a-Apanui Area School in Western East Cape.

“I have made an interim decision that the three schools should close and a new Year 1 – 13 state school should open in January next year to address concerns about the sustainability and quality of education in the area,” Ms Parata says.

The proposal arises out of engagement with the community since 2013.

“Following discussions with the community, rūnanga, schools and local whānau, the Education Ministry has advised me that a new single and more modern school would achieve better educational outcomes for the children of the area, strengthen education governance, and improve school leadership.”

As of March, Raukokore School, a Year 1–8 school, had a roll of 12 students.  Te Kura o Ōmaio, also a Year 1–8 school, had a roll of 13 and Te Whānau-a-Apanui Area School, a Year 1–13 school, had a roll of 80.

Ms Parata, who advised about 200 people of her interim decision at a public hui at Te Kaha yesterday evening, says there will be no changes in the region until after careful consideration of the second round of consultation feedback.

“I want to thank the school’s boards and their communities for all of their engagement and feedback. The numbers who attended last night’s meeting showed how committed people are to doing their best for their kids.

“School closures are never welcomed, but all of those who attended recognised the need to raise student achievement.

Submissions on the second round of consultation close on 21 August 2015.
