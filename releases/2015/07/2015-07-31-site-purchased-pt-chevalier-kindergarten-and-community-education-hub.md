Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the site of a new Community Education Hub in Pt Chevalier, Auckland, which will incorporate the relocated Pt Chevalier Kindergarten.

“The Ministry of Education has purchased land for $2.8 million at 90-94 Walmer Road in Pt Chevalier to house the new hub,” says Ms Kaye.

“This is an innovative solution that will free up land at Pt Chevalier school, where the kindergarten is currently located, and provide much needed outdoor space for the school’s growing role.

“At the same time, it ensures the relocated kindergarten is less than one kilometre from its existing site, and will also enable a range of complementary community services to be offered to local families from a single, convenient location.

“The Government is pleased to have been able to provide this solution which is a win for both the school and kindergarten, and at the same time will deliver value-added benefits to the community.

“The Auckland Kindergarten Association, which runs Pt Chevalier Kindergarten, will survey local residents to find out what services they’d like the new hub to offer. Potential services could include things like after-school programmes, health services, budgeting advice and parenting programmes.

“I applaud the Ministry of Education and others involved in this project for thinking outside the square.

“This is an exciting time for education in Pt Chevalier. The school can now plan for growth using the whole of its site, and the kindergarten can look forward to new facilities and continuing to be a valued part of the education pipeline for local children.

“Construction of the new hub is scheduled to begin before the end of this year, and be completed by late 2016. I’m confident the end result will be facilities that the community will be proud of.”
