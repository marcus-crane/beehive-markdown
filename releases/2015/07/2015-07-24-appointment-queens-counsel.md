Three lawyers have been appointed Queen’s Counsel this year, Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC announced today.

They are:

- Margaret Casey from Auckland;
- Mark O’Brien from Wellington; and
- Richard Boast from Wellington.

“The appointment to the rank of Queen’s Counsel recognises independent advocates who have excelled at the highest level of law,” Mr Finlayson said.

“The appointment of three Queen’s Counsel this year marks a return to more typical appointment numbers after two years of increased numbers due to the absence of appointments from 2008 to 2012.

“Of particular note is the appointment of Richard Boast who has been appointed under the Royal prerogative in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to the law and in particular the legal history of New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said. 

Appointments of Queen’s Counsel are made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Attorney-General and with the concurrence of the Chief Justice.
