Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss will today present a pin and certificate of appreciation to Hawke’s Bay ‘Land Girl’ Tiny (Helen) White.

During World War II, Mrs White and more than 4000 other New Zealand women volunteered for organisations such as the Women's Land Service.

“These women, commonly referred to as Land Girls, took up the roles of the men sent overseas — they worked on farms and in other essential industries,” Mr Foss says.

“Many of these women had grown up in cities or towns and were not used to this kind of physical labour.

“It’s incredibly important that the contribution of Mrs White, and the thousands of other Land Girls, is recognised and remembered.

“It’s my privilege and honour to present Mrs White with a pin and certificate of appreciation today in recognition of her service.”

Mr Foss says anyone who served with the New Zealand Women’s Land Service, and who would appreciate recognition, should contact Veterans’ Affairs on 0800 483 8372 or visit the Veterans’ Affairs website: [www.veteransaffairs.mil.nz](http://www.veteransaffairs.mil.nz)
