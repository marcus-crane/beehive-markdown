Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced the appointment of a Youth Advisory Panel to ensure the voices of children are included in the review into Child, Youth and Family (CYF).

The panel includes eight young people, aged 15 to 23, all of whom have had experience with state care. The panel was chosen with the assistance of the Office of the Children’s Commissioner (OCC).

“I have made it clear that I expect a redesigned CYF to be more responsive to the needs of the child, rather than focused on administration and bureaucracy. The perspectives of the Youth Advisory Panel will be an essential ingredient in getting the final design of the future CYF right,” Mrs Tolley said.

“These young people have an important perspective on state care and are highly motivated to share their experiences to change the way we care for our most vulnerable into the future.”

“I have met with the Youth Advisory Panel and have seen their passion to achieve better outcomes for children and young people in state care, it’s vital the expert panel considers the voice of children as part of their review,” Mrs Tolley says.

The Youth Advisory Panel will work closely with the Expert Advisory Panel appointed in April to lead a complete overhaul of CYF to ensure the agency delivers the best possible results for vulnerable children and their families.

“In addition, I have appointed Peter Douglas to the Expert Advisory Panel. Mr Douglas is Chief Executive of Te Ohu Kaimoana Māori Fisheries Trust and was previously a Social Worker and Principal Māori Advisor in the Ministry of Social Development,” Mrs Tolley says.
