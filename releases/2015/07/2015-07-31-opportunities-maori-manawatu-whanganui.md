The Manawatū-Whanganui region has significant potential for growth, and this includes making greater use of Māori land, a new report on the region has found.

Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell says the *Manawatū-Whanganui Growth Study: Opportunities Report*, published today, highlights a range of opportunities that can directly benefit Māori and the region.

“The report says there are around 190,000 hectares of Māori freehold land in the Manawatū-Whanganui region. Finding ways to increase the productivity of this land will bring significant benefits – the report identifies mānuka honey, sheep and beef farming and tourism as ways to do this.

“The current reforms to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act will empower Māori land owners to take more control of the use of Māori land.

“In addition, the new Te Ture Whenua Māori Network that I announced recently will assist in finding ways for Māori land owners to improve the productivity of their land. The network will be supported by a $12.8 million fund to explore, among other things, options for dealing with ratings and landlocked land issues” says Mr Flavell.

“The Government is committed to lifting Māori economic development – that’s why Crown and Māori have entered into an economic growth partnership - *He kai kei aku ringa* – which provides a blueprint for a productive, innovative, and export-oriented Māori economy. 

“There is a real opportunity in the Manawatū-Whanganui region to lift employment, productivity and incomes, and I’m determined to make the most of that opportunity."
