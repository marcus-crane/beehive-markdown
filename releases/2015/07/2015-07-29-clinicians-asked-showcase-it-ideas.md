Health Minister Jonathan Coleman is encouraging clinicians to submit their innovative ideas to improve health services. 

“Each year the Clinicians’ Challenge generates a whole raft of innovative ideas that have exciting potential to improve patient care,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Clinicians’ Challenge encourages health professionals to find ways technology can solve problems they face in their day to day practice, as well as making a difference to the health of New Zealanders.

“Effective use of information and technology solutions can also enable patients to be more involved in their own healthcare, and can ensure clinicians have access to a fuller range of information, helping to improve patient care.”

Last year’s winners of the Clinicians’ Challenge were a team from Nelson Marlborough DHB who developed Emergency Department at a Glance - a dashboard system with real-time information for managing a patients’ journey through an ED.

This year’s Clinicians’ Challenge has two categories - for a new idea yet to be developed, and an innovative system or application already developed that is having a positive impact on patient care.

The winner in each category will receive a grant of $8,000. The results will be announced at the 2015 Health Informatics New Zealand conference in October.

The Clinicians’ Challenge is a joint initiative by the National Health IT Board and Health Informatics New Zealand. Entries can be submitted at [www.hinz.org.nz](http://www.hinz.org.nz) until 14 September.
