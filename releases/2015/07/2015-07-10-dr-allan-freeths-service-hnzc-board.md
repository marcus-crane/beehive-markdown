Housing New Zealand Minister Bill English says the Government has appreciated the sound leadership and commitment of outgoing Housing New Zealand Corporation chair, Allan Freeth.

Dr Freeth is departing his role at HNZC at the end of the month to become Chief Executive of the Environmental Protection Authority.

“Dr Freeth is well known across New Zealand’s business, cultural and public sectors. His years of experience in leadership roles and his mix of commercial and policy skills have been important at the helm of the HNZC board, at a time of significant changes for the organisation,” Mr English says.

The Government is committed to progressively improving the quality and increasing the quantity of accommodation that is available for low income tenants and HNZC will continue to have the key role in the provision of social housing in New Zealand.

The search for a new chair has commenced.
