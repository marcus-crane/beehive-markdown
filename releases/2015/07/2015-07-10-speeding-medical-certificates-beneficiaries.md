Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman and Social Development Minister Anne Tolley say GPs can now lodge work capacity medical certificates electronically, replacing time-consuming paper certificates.

“It is important to ensure coordinated care for patients and to develop stronger links between services”, says Dr Coleman.

“Work capacity medical certificates contain information about a person’s medical condition, capacity for work, how long they are expected to be unable to work and their ability to undertake work related activities.

“It is important for patients that this information is passed from the GP to the Ministry of Social Development as quickly and accurately as possible.”

The Ministry of Social Development receives over 400,000 Work Capacity medical certificates each year.

GPs across the country are now able to use the integrated secure communication portal HealthLink, replacing the current paper based system.

“These certificates can now seamlessly be sent from the doctor’s office to MSD,” Mrs Tolley says.

“This change reduces administration for GPs and the number of visits beneficiaries need to make to Work and Income as they will no longer have to deliver their medical certificate in person.

“This is a great example of the health and social welfare sectors working together to make dealing with government simpler and less time consuming.

“This reflects our focus on increasing online interactions with government, as part of the Government’s Better Public Service targets.”
