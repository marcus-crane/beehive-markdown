Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially opened the refurbished North Shore Community Corrections site in Glenfield.

The refurbishment of the site is part of a five-year nationwide programme to make Community Corrections sites more secure and better equipped to help offenders turn their lives around.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the improvements to the North Shore site will benefit staff, visitors and community-based offenders who report there.

The $1.9 million refurbishment included upgrading security, technology and more space for programme delivery and training for community-based offenders.

“We want each Community Corrections site to meet local needs and provide community-based services under one roof,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This fit-for-purpose site will also help with our government’s goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.”

Corrections employs 70 staff at North Shore Community Corrections.

The site manages more than 960 offenders on 1200 community-based sentences and orders, including home detention and community work.

Corrections manages offenders to ensure they comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of reoffending, minimise their risk to others and help them become productive and contributing members of society.
