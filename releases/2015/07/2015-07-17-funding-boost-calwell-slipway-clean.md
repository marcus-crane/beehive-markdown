The Government is contributing $200,000 towards the design of a clean-up of the Calwell Slip in Port Nelson, contaminated from copper and tributyltin from ship maintenance operations in the 1970s.

“This project is a partnership between the Government, the Port company and Nelson City Council to contain these historic contaminants and protect the wider port and Nelson Haven,” Environment Minister Dr Smith says.

“Clean-ups of this sort are notoriously difficult as evidenced by the major problems in dealing with contamination at Mapua last decade. This site is not as serious, but still ranks as the fourth-highest priority for the Government’s Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund.

“I am confident the lessons of Mapua have been learnt and that this clean-up will be managed in a considered and professional way. This grant will go towards the next phase of work of a detailed investigation of design. Further consideration will be given to funding the remediation when this phase is complete.

“The Calwell Slipway clean-up will involve stabilising the contaminated seabed sediments using a similar technique to the one successfully used during remediation of the Tui Mine.

“This is a joint project between the Government, Port Nelson Ltd and Nelson City Council. The Government funding announced today represents approximately 50 per cent of the total project costs, with Port Nelson also providing funding of $200,000. The funding and joint commitment of the Government, the Port, and the council to the Calwell Slipway project reflects its high priority.

“I’m encouraged by this joint commitment to remediation work on the Calwell Slipway as it will deliver real benefits for the Nelson environment.”

The Government’s Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund provides funding to regional councils to assist with the investigation, remedial planning and remediation of contaminated sites that pose a risk to human health and the environment. To date, $42.5 million has been invested to clean-up sites around the country.
