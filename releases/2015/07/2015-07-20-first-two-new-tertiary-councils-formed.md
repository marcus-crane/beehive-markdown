Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has announced the first two tertiary councils to be established under changes to the Education Act.

Te Wānanga o Aotearoa and the University of Canterbury are the first university and the first wānanga respectively to change their constitutions to reflect the legislative changes passed by Parliament in February to provide smaller, more skills-based councils.

“Reducing council size, increasing membership flexibility and ensuring all members have relevant knowledge, skills or experience will better enable universities and wānanga to respond quickly and effectively to the modern day challenges of tertiary education,” says Mr Joyce.

Mr Joyce has announced seven ministerial appointments to the new councils, all of whom served under the old larger council model. 

“The reappointment of a number of council members in recognition of the high-quality governance they have been providing to these institutions,” Mr Joyce says.

“I also wish to recognise the valuable contribution made by outgoing council members and to thank them for their service.” Mr Joyce says.

The appointments and reappointments of council members are:

- Te Wānanga o Aotearoa: the reappointment of Kathie Irwin and Rea Wikaira as members, and the appointment of former council appointee Richard Batley as a member,
- The University of Canterbury: reappointment of Bruce Gemmell, Tony Hall, Sue McCormack, and Catherine Drayton as members,

In addition to the above appointments, a new appointment has also been made to the combined WelTec Whitireia Polytechnic Council. Jacqueline (Jackie) Lloyd has been appointed as a council member.
