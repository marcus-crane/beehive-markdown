Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has congratulated the DHBs which have taken home half of the annual public service awards, including the prestigious Prime Minister's award.

“It is great to see DHBs being recognised for their leading edge work,” says Dr Coleman.

“I would like to congratulate the team at Waitemata DHB for their award and the massive effort of Canterbury DHB which received four awards and the Prime Minister’s award.

“Behind each of these awards is a team of talented, passionate people who choose to work in health. They have dedicated themselves to providing outstanding public services for their communities.”

Organised by the Institute of Public Administration New Zealand, the annual Public Sector Excellence Awards recognise and reward outstanding performances and achievements in the New Zealand public sector.

The awards were presented at an event in Wellington last night.

This year the awards attracted 75 entries from a large range of organisations including government departments, district health boards, Crown agencies, local government and tertiary education organisations.

**Details of the awards won by Waitemata and Canterbury DHB:**

Waitemata DHB won The Justice Sector award for Integrity and Trust for a programme which measures performance against the organisation’s values through feedback from patients and visitors and uses these insights as a driver for change.

Canterbury DHB won four awards, including:

- The Treasury Award for Excellence in Improving Public Value through Business Transformation. This was for the Canterbury Clinical Network which has led the transformation of health services through their patient-centric, clinically-led alliance approach. This initiative was also awarded the Prime Minister's award.
- The Victoria University of Wellington School of Government Award for Excellence in Public Sector Engagement. This was for the 'Heading to hospital - Plan your trip!' campaign to inform Cantabrians about the closure of onsite parking at Christchurch Hospital, and the establishment of a new Park & Ride scheme.
- Joint winner of the State Services Commission and Leadership Development Centre Award for Improving Performance through Leadership Excellence. This was for the Canterbury Health System's '8' programmes, Xcelr8, Collabor8 and Particip8 which develops leaders across the Canterbury Health System.
