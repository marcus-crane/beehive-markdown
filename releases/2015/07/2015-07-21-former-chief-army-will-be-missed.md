Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has paid tribute to Major General Louis Gardiner, who died on Saturday.

Major General (Rtd) Gardiner was Chief of Army from 2006 to 2009, and held other significant New Zealand Defence Force roles including Commander Joint Forces, New Zealand Defence Adviser to Australia and Land Component Commander.

Mr Brownlee says Major General Gardiner, who was an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, is a loss to his country as well as his many friends, colleagues and family.

“Without exception Major General Gardiner worked alongside his colleagues to ensure everyone’s contributions were brought to the fore.

“His time and service overseas included the challenging environments of Somalia and East Timor.

“On behalf of the New Zealand Government I sincerely express deepest condolences to Major General Gardiner’s family, and my thanks for sharing their husband and father in the service of his country.”
