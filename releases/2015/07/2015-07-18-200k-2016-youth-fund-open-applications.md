Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today opened applications for Youth Fund 2016, which makes $200,000 available for community projects led by young people.

“This fund is unique because it supports projects designed and led by young people themselves, either working alone or in partnership with youth organisations,” says Ms Kaye.

“As well as benefiting their communities, this helps young people between the ages of 12 and 24 develop decision-making and leadership skills.

“Young people make up the panels that assess applications and decide where funding goes, making this a completely youth-led initiative.

“The previous year’s Youth Fund supported 44 successful projects, many of which gave young people a say in the development of youth plans for their communities. Others helped young people learn about their rights and responsibilities so they can participate fully as citizens in their communities.

“The projects have seen young people involved with helping to run cultural learning centres; planning the refurbishment of a youth space to use for homework, workshops and community events; and assisting young people with intellectual disabilities make the transition from school to adult life.

“We shouldn’t underestimate the value to our country of investing in young leaders, especially through projects where they’re leading the way in solving problems in their communities, or giving other young people opportunities to serve.”

Funding is available for amounts up to $7000, with applications closing on Thursday 10 September 2015.
