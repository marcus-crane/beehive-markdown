Over the last few days, video footage has emerged which apparently shows prisoners at Mt Eden Corrections Facility fighting and engaging in other activities that are banned inside New Zealand prison facilities.

An internal investigation into these events is being carried out by Serco, which runs the remand facility.  Police have also been advised and may conduct their own investigation.

“This behaviour of prisoners is unacceptable and I have asked Corrections to carry out a robust and thorough review of the incidents.  Today I am announcing the terms of reference for that review,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I have also asked the Chief Executive of Corrections to widen the scope of this review to address other allegations related to violence and the use of cell phones in other prisons that have come to light recently.”

The Chief Inspector of Corrections will now run a two-stage review.   The first phase of the review will be completed by the end of August and phase two by the end of September.

Phase one will look at the circumstances surrounding the incidents posted to social media and whether there are organised prisoner fights at MECF.

The investigation will pay particular attention to the last three months to determine whether this type of activity is widespread across the site or limited to specific units, whether management or staff knew of it, what they did about it and what measures have been taken to restrict contraband.

“I also expect recommendations to come out of it to strengthen controls, standards and operating procedures if warranted,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The second phase will review the adequacy of controls designed to address prisoner violence and access to cell phones in other New Zealand prisons.

“To ensure an independent view of this process The Office of the Ombudsman has been invited to monitor and review the investigation.  Full cooperation will be afforded to the Ombudsman’s investigator, who may also independently report on any matter concerning the incidents or its subsequent investigation,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I have already put Serco on notice over the incidents at MECF.  I will be meeting with Serco senior management this week and I am expecting a positive and strong response from the company in resolving these issues.”
