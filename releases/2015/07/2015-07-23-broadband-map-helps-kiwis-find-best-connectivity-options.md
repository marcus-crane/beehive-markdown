Communications Minister Amy Adams today launched a new online map that will allow New Zealanders to source the best broadband options available to them at their home or business.

“Access to fast speed internet is a critical enabler for the economy. Kiwis are now looking to have access to information anywhere, anytime and anyhow,” Ms Adams says. 

“Our UFB and RBI programmes are charging ahead and this map gives New Zealanders a one-stop shop where they can go to find out what services are available to them at their address and how they can connect.”

Ms Adams said the map would also display when ultra- fast broadband or rural broadband coverage would be going to a particular area. A connection into each premise can then be requested from a Retail Service Provider. 

The broadband map has been provided by the NZRS Ltd, the service delivery subsidiary of InternetNZ.

“NZRS Ltd has worked closely with service providers around the country to source the most comprehensive data set of broadband coverage in New Zealand.

“They’ve also committed to keeping the data on the broadband map current and are continuing to work with network operators to close any information gaps that still exist,” Ms Adams says.
