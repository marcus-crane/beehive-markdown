The Māori Development Minister is pleased to announce that Dr Wayne Ngata has been appointed as the new Toihau of the Māori Language Commission.

“Dr Ngata (Te Āitanga ā Hauiti, Ngāti Ira, Ngāti Porou) has served as a Commissioner in the past alongside the previous Chair Erima Henare who passed away suddenly almost two months ago.

“I am pleased that he will build on Erima’s legacy and bring his extensive knowledge of te reo Māori and the education sector to this important role,” says Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

Professor Rawinia Higgins and Charisma Rangipunga have also been appointed to Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori for three years. They are first-time commissioners on the Crown entity responsible for the promotion and development of Te Reo Māori.

"I’m thrilled that all three of these language experts have agreed to their appointments,” says Mr Flavell.

Minister Flavell said imminent changes proposed in the new Māori Language Bill will require strong leadership by the Board.

“The new appointees collectively possess an excellent combination of skills and experience to undertake the roles and responsibilities required for Te Taura Whiri te Reo Māori.”

The three appointees will join current members, Awanuiārangi Black and Hinurewa Poutu on the Board.

“I wish to thank Dr Poia Rewi, Dr Ruka Broughton and Dr Kātarina Edmonds for their service and time on the Board. They have provided a solid base for the next board to build on,” says Mr Flavell.
