A former government minister and a former TVNZ reporter are among the new faces in the council that advises Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

Nine Pacific professionals and leaders have been selected to sit on the Pacific Peoples Advisory Council for a three-year term from July 1. They replace the former council of 11 members, whose term has ended.

The new council will focus on education, employment, entrepreneurship and economic development issues.

“The council’s advice is an important factor in improving the wellbeing of our growing Pacific population,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Within two decades, one in five children will be of Pacific descent. Creating more success for Pacific people is vital to the well-being of our country.”

The council members are paediatric surgeon Kiki Maoate (chairman), lawyer Ali’muamua Sandra Alofivae, Fonua Ola chief executive Kathleen Tuai-Taufoou, senior public servant Fepulea’i Margie Apa, former TVNZ journalist and Pasifika Education Trust member Sefita Hao’uli, accountant Caren Rangi, Allianz NZ chief executive Eugene Elisara, former Pacific Affairs minister and Victoria University assistant vice-chancellor Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and Pacific consultant Fa’amatuainu Tino Pereira.

The members have been chosen for their combined expertise in the education, economic development, employment and entrepreneurship sectors.

“The members’ backgrounds and strong networks in Pacific communities mean they are well-placed to provide informed and intelligent advice on issues affecting Pacific people,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The council has been in place since 1984 to advise the minister of the day on issues relating to the social, cultural and economic welfare of Pacific people in New Zealand and to help information-sharing between Pacific communities and the minister.
