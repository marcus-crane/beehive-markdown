Foreign Minister Murray McCully chaired a meeting of the United Nations Security Council today that endorsed last week’s historic nuclear deal between Iran, the Five Permanent (P5) members of the United Nations Security Council, and Germany.

“The Council adopted a resolution that makes the agreement legally binding and sets out steps towards its implementation,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand hopes this agreement can form the basis for building trust and opening a new chapter of cooperation in the Middle East.

“Getting to this point would not have been possible without constructive engagement on all sides.

“A number of steps remain before the agreement can be fully implemented. These include EU and US Congressional approval, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification of the commitments made.

“We urge all parties, and in particular Iran, to approach implementation with the same positive intent and good faith that led to the agreement being concluded.

“The sanctions against Iran will be terminated after IAEA verification is finished,” Mr McCully says.
