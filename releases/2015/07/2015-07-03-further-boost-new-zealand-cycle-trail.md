The Government is investing nearly $400,000 in six new projects to enhance and maintain the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail, Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key announced today. 

“This is the second round of funding available through the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund and brings the total investment under the fund so far to $1.36 million,” says Mr Key.

“Priority has been given to proposals that aim to improve the safety and quality of the Great Rides – the premier rides on the New Zealand Cycle Trail. Three of the successful applications are for repairs to sections of trail that have incurred storm damage.

“The Cycle Trail is a significant tourism asset and it is vital that individual trails are maintained to the highest possible standard so that riders continue to have a safe and enjoyable experience.”

Mr Key says the number of people using the trail is continuing to increase.

“The latest data shows around 125,000 people used the New Zealand Cycle Trail in the month of January, compared to 97,000 in January 2014. 

“The trails which saw the biggest increase in users over the month of January were the Hawkes Bay Trails up from 19,500 to approximately 26,000, the Waikato River Trail up from 3,300 to approximately 4,400 and Tasman’s Great Taste Trail up from 8,600 to approximately 9,600.”

The Government has set aside $8 million over four years to help maintain and enhance the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail. Nearly $1 million was invested in thirteen projects in December.

The six projects to receive funding in this funding round are:

- Tourism Waitaki (Canterbury)  $66,575
- Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust (West Coast) $165,910
- Central Trails Trust  (Otago) $10,744
- Tasman District Council (Nelson/Tasman) $67,500
- Queenstown Trails Trust (Otago) $58,774
- Motu Trails Charitable Trust (East Coast) $25,134

The next funding round will be in August.
