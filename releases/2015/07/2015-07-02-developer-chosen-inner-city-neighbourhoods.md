Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has welcomed the appointment of a preferred development partner for an exciting new era of inner city living in Christchurch.

After a rigorous tender process, Fletcher Residential has been confirmed as the preferred developer to work with the Government on the $800 million East and North Frame residential precinct, providing around 940 new townhouses and apartments accommodating up to 2200 residents.

Fletcher Residential has provided the Government with concept images for the proposed developments across the East and North Frames, broken down into three distinct areas of housing, and supported by small-scale commercial development and community facilities.

“Fletcher Residential has presented an exciting vision of what this new inner city neighbourhood might look like in the years ahead,” Mr Brownlee says.

“It will deliver a mix of housing to encourage people at all stages of life to live in the central city.

“There are a whole lot of reasons for people to want to live in these new neighbourhoods, with an expanse of green public space through the middle of the Frame and one of the world’s largest outdoor family playgrounds.

“All this will be only a short walk to the commercial heart of Christchurch and various precincts the central city has to offer.

“Lifting the resident population of the central city will not only add more vibrancy and activity, it will help businesses in the area to flourish.” 

If the development agreement is confirmed later this year, Fletcher Residential will progressively purchase seven hectares of land in the East and North Frames – between Manchester and Madras Streets, from just north of the Avon River down to Lichfield Street – to develop the housing.

Construction will be spread over eight or nine years, with the first homes expected to be complete within 18 months of a development agreement being signed.  That final agreement is expected to be signed by the end of November this year.

“Fletcher Residential will set the prices when the homes go onto market, but most are likely to be within a range of $400,000 and $900,000 – providing opportunity for a range of living situations,” Mr Brownlee says.

“The first thing people will see will be the development of the public spaces in the East and North Frame by the Government from later this year.”
