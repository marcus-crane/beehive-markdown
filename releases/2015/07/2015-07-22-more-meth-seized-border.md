Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today congratulated Customs on the high number of drug seizures at the border over the past six months, which has kept up to $246 million of methamphetamine off New Zealand streets.

“Customs made 1660 drug seizures between January and June 2015. Of these, 252 seizures were of methamphetamine or precursors, adding to more than half a ton – 510 kg – of meth-related products,” Ms Wagner says.

“The methamphetamine seized at the border over six months would have a street value of up to $141 million. The 369 kg of precursors seized could have produced another $105 million of methamphetamine.

“The global drug trade harms communities and families, which is why the Government has committed to combatting the trade through our whole-of-government Methamphetamine Action Plan.

“Intercepting drugs at the border is a vital part of this and Customs will continue to work in partnership with Police to identify and take down criminal operations as part of the cross-agency approach. We are also working closely with international agencies to stop drugs before they are exported.

“Drug concealments are sophisticated and constantly changing, but we are holding ground with street prices of methamphetamine remaining stable since 2011.

“Thanks to the dedication and skill of our Customs officers as well as the action of law enforcement agencies here and overseas, this significant amount of harmful drugs has been kept off our streets,” Ms Wagner says.

The remaining 1408 seizures consisted of smaller quantities of a range of drugs including class c analogues, cannabis, ecstasy and controlled and prescription medicines that were found mainly through mail or air cargo.
