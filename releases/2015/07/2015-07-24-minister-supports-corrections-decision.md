Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says he supports Corrections’ decision to take over the management of Mt Eden Corrections Facility.  

“The safety and security of staff and prisoners is paramount,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Following a new allegation yesterday, I am pleased that Corrections chief executive Ray Smith has made the decision that Corrections will take over the running of the facility for the immediate future. 

“I acknowledge MECF is a difficult prison to run because of its remand status and transient prisoner population but it is important that the public has confidence in our prison system.

“I believe this is a necessary step while the investigation into the allegations at Mt Eden Prison is underway,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
