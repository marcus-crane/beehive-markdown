Foreign Minister Murray McCully says the Security Council’s renewal today of the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus comes at an important time for the island.

“There are strong signs of progress in Cyprus towards resolution of this 50-year-old dispute and this is testament to the leadership being shown by both parties,” Mr McCully says.

“The resumption of talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, facilitated by the United Nations, on reunification of the island is a very promising step on the road to lasting agreement.

“As Security Council President, New Zealand's priority has been to ensure the renewal of the UN mission’s mandate contributes positively to the process.

“The Security Council has welcomed the positive momentum and commitment expressed by Cypriot leaders to work towards a comprehensive settlement as soon as possible.

“New Zealand encourages Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, and the UN Special Envoy for Cyprus, to continue their determined efforts to bring an end to division and instability on the island,” Mr McCully says.
