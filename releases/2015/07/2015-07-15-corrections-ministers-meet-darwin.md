Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga will meet his Australian state counterparts this week to discuss how current policies and practices are working in the Australasian prison system.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will attend the three-day Corrective Services Ministers conference in Darwin from today.

He will join state Corrections and Justice ministers to discuss how policies and practices such as working prisons and vocational and education training are creating positive change in prisons in both countries.

The ministers will also tour the new 1048-bed Darwin Correctional Centre which has been designed to give male and female prisoners better rehabilitation and reintegration opportunities through practical education and employment programmes.

“The New Zealand government recognises that education and work skills are key to the successful rehabilitation of our prisoners. Employment reduces welfare dependency, hardship and the likelihood of reoffending,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“That is why New Zealand Corrections is focused on improving prisoners’ access to education and vocational training programmes and creating a comprehensive working prisons system.

“I am keen to see first-hand the results Australian states are achieving in their own Corrections facilities using similar approaches.”

The ministers will also share information on a wide range of issues that impact on Corrections services nationally and internationally and the challenges they face.

Mr Lotu-Iiga will be accompanied by Corrections chief executive Ray Smith.
