Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Samoa to attend Horticulture New Zealand’s annual Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) conference.

Mr Woodhouse will deliver the key note address to conference delegates.

During the visit, Mr Woodhouse will also visit Poutasi village to view sustainable community and business projects developed by RSE workers.

“I’m delighted that Horticulture NZ took up Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi’s invitation to hold this year’s conference in Samoa,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“It presents a wonderful opportunity for employers and officials to see first-hand the development that the RSE scheme has enabled in Samoa.”

Mr Woodhouse will be overseas 8 – 10 July and will also be part of the Prime Minister’s delegation to attend the All Blacks vs Samoa rugby game.
