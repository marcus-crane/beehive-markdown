Today’s Better Public Service (BPS) update showing the Government is on track to achieve its goal of lifting the proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA  Level 2 is a tribute to the hard work and professionalism of teachers and principals, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“The update shows that between 2013 and 2014 the proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA Level 2, or an equivalent qualification, rose from 78.6 per cent to about 81.1 per cent. Over the past three years the percentage has risen by 6.8 percentage points.

“The results mean thousands more of our students are leaving school every year equipped with the skills they need to undertake further education or training.

“However, there is still work to be done to ensure no kids get left behind, particularly Māori and Pasifika whose achievement rates are growing fast but who started from a lower base.

Ms Parata say the Government is also intensifying its efforts to achieve its BPS target of having 98 per cent of children starting school having previously participated in early childhood education.

In the 12 months to March 2015 the ECE participation rate grew from 95.9 per cent to 96.1 per cent.

“We are seeing strong growth in participation rates for priority groups,  but the final 2 per cent is the biggest challenge as this represents the hardest to reach children who are least likely to engage in ECE, but most likely to benefit from it.”

Ms Parata says the progress made towards both targets highlight the benefits of the Government setting itself ambitious goals.

“We are learning to work better across agencies and to make better use of data to target resources. The results are making a difference to kids’ lives.”
