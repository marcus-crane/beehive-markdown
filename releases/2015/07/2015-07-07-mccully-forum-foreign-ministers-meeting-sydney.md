Foreign Minister Murray McCully will travel to Sydney later this week to attend a meeting of Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers.

“This meeting is an important opportunity for Ministers to discuss international issues that affect the region,” Mr McCully says.

“This includes considering regional approaches to disaster response, which is particularly relevant following the damage caused by Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu.”

Minister McCully will also have one-on-one meetings with a number of his regional counterparts, and the President of Nauru, Mr Baron Waqa.

“New Zealand is taking the reports coming out of Nauru very seriously and this meeting is an opportunity to pass on our concerns and discuss our contribution to the justice sector in light of recent events,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully departs for Sydney on Thursday 9 July.
