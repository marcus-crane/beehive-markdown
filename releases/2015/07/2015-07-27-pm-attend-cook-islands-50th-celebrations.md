Prime Minister John Key will lead a delegation to Rarotonga next week to celebrate the Cook Islands’ 50th anniversary of self-government in free association with New Zealand.

“Fifty years ago, New Zealand and the Cook Islands entered into a unique bilateral relationship,” says Mr Key. 

“We welcome the opportunity to celebrate that and to reflect on an important partnership that is based on our shared values, history, and the positive contribution that Cook Islanders make to New Zealand.”

Mr Key will meet with Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna and take part in the official Constitution Day Ceremony which will feature a traditional welcome and flag raising ceremony.

The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Pacific Peoples Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga, Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs Todd McClay, Maori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell and Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne. 

Also in the official party are Opposition Leader Andrew Little, New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters, and a number of MPs from National, Labour and the Green party. 

The delegation will depart on the morning of August 4, returning the evening of August 5.
