The Bay of Plenty’s biggest roading project ever, the $455 million Tauranga Eastern Link (TEL), has been officially opened by Prime Minister John Key and Transport Minister Simon Bridges today.

The 21 kilometre, four-lane TEL is one of seven Roads of National Significance (RoNS) identified by the Government as being crucial to building New Zealand’s economy, and is the second to be completed because of the priority the Government places on capturing the benefits it will bring.

It includes seven bridges, the country’s biggest roundabout, a new 6.8 kilometre cycleway and one of the largest public art pieces currently on display in New Zealand – a 130 metre long pa sculpture.

Work started on the project in November 2010 and, following today’s ribbon cutting ceremony, it will open to traffic on August 3 – five months ahead of schedule.

Mr Bridges says it will bring the Bay of Plenty much closer together and, in doing so, will significantly boost growth through trade and travel in the region.

“Getting our products out into the global marketplace efficiently is key to New Zealand’s international competitiveness and, therefore, prosperity in the Bay of Plenty.

“This high-spec highway is a game-changer that will support economic development and growth, boost industry and jobs, and improve safety.”

The TEL will shorten journey times and drive down the cost of transport.

“By improving links between production centres and the port, we can improve our international competitiveness.

“This road will support regional growth by opening up parts of the Western Bay to residential and commercial development and will ensure the Eastern Bay is also better connected to the city and wider region.

“It is a prime example of the Government’s focus on funding infrastructure that will drive New Zealand’s economic and social success,” Mr Bridges says.
