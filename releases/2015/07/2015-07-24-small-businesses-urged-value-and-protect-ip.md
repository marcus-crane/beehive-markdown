Small Business Minister Craig Foss is welcoming an online initiative to help small businesses better understand and protect their intellectual property (IP).

“Business.govt.nz and the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) have teamed up to produce easy to understand advice on the importance and value of secure IP,” Mr Foss says.

“Protecting your IP can be the difference between your business succeeding or failing. It’s about safeguarding the time, money and effort you’ve put in to stay ahead of the competition, attract investors and generate profit.”

Mr Foss says protecting IP is not just an issue for big business and need not be expensive. 

“Business.govt.nz is a free, easily accessible hub of information and tools for the benefit of all small businesses.  This new advice, including an infographic, explains why, when and how small businesses should consider IP and what they can do to protect it.

“Information like this helps ensure New Zealand businesses continue to innovate, grow and thrive at home and abroad,” Mr Foss says.
