Statistics Minister Craig Foss says a new infographic celebrating 150 years since Wellington became the capital shows how far the city has come.

“Wellington was chosen as the capital city by three Australians 150 years ago.  A lot has changed since then and Statistics NZ has been able to track that change through the data it collects,” Mr Foss says.

“Wellington really is the ‘coolest little capital’ but 150 years ago it was seriously little — with a population of just over 7000 people.

“Statistics are more than just numbers; they can chart change, record history and be a tool for decision making.   This fantastic new infographic is a great visual record of our progress.”
