Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew leaves for Vietnam today to meet with Vietnamese government and business leaders to promote our trade and agriculture relationship.

The trip ties in with the 40th anniversary of the bilateral relationship between New Zealand and Vietnam, and follows the signing of the Food Safety Cooperation Arrangement between both countries in March this year.

“This Arrangement outlines areas of cooperation such as sharing food safety information and agricultural trade laws, simplifying trade certification and collaborating on research and post-graduate education,” says Mrs Goodhew.

During her visit, Mrs Goodhew will meet with Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, Minister of Health Mme Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat to discuss future food safety cooperation between New Zealand and Vietnam. This will include witnessing the signing of a cooperative work programme setting out how the Food Safety Cooperation Arrangement will be implemented.

“Vietnam has one of the fastest economies in the Asia-Pacific region,” says Mrs Goodhew. “Last year Vietnam received more than $430 million in primary products exports.

“As a food producing nation, New Zealand has a wealth of knowledge and expertise to share with Vietnam.

“Our primary products are seen as being of high-quality and safe, our food safety and assurance systems are seen as world-leading, and our agricultural expertise is recognised across the Vietnamese Government.

“New Zealand’s commitment towards working constructively with Vietnam in food safety and agricultural matters will further strengthen the already strong ties that exist between our two countries.”

Mrs Goodhew will be overseas from 26 July to 31 July.
