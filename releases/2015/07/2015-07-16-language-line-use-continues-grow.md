More than 1000 people a week are now using the telephone interpreter service Language Line, Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

Over the last year, almost 56,500 phone calls were made to access Language Line, which allows non-English speakers to communicate with organisations across the public, private and not for profit sectors confidentially and free of charge.

“Being able to communicate clearly with key services such as health, education and housing and organisations such as banks and power companies helps with successful settlement for people from refugee and migrant backgrounds and with our established ethnic communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“The steady increase in calls to Language Line in the last year reflects our society’s increased diversity. To support an inclusive, well-connected and prosperous nation, it is vital that all people have access to essential information, advice and services.”

The most frequently accessed public service agency in the last year was Inland Revenue.

“The Language Line service will continue to develop its reach into the private and NGO sectors over the coming year, further supporting new migrants to settle in New Zealand and helping established residents overcome any language barriers,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Language Line operates through the Office of Ethnic Communities and offers clients of participating agencies free interpreting in 44 languages. More than 100 organisations offer the service.

Since it began in 2003, more than 440,000 calls have been made to Language Line, with Mandarin, Samoan and Korean the most requested languages for translation.
