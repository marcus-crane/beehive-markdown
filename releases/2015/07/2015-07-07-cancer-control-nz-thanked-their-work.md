Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has thanked Cancer Control New Zealand for their work over the last ten years.

The independent Ministerial advisory committee is being disestablished as its role has been superseded by the progress made in improving cancer services for New Zealanders.

“Cancer Control New Zealand’s advice was necessary ten years ago when there was limited planning and investment in cancer services, and a lack of central clinical leadership,” says Dr Coleman.

“I would like to thank the members of Cancer Control New Zealand for their contribution.  I know that a number of the committee members will continue to provide independent advice and clinical leadership through their other roles in the national cancer programme.

“Delivering better cancer services remains a top priority for the Government. We have made significant progress since 2008 and patients are getting better faster cancer care. We have invested $63 million on the faster cancer treatment programme.

“The new 62-day faster cancer treatment target puts the lens right across the cancer pathway. It is a key focus of the NZ Cancer Plan which sets out the activities that need to happen over the next three years to ensure patients receive even better faster care.”

Cancer Control New Zealand, which has eight members, will finish on 8 August 2015 when most of the board appointments expire.

The Palliative Care Council, which is a subcommittee of Cancer Control New Zealand, will continue as an advisory committee to the Ministry of Health.
