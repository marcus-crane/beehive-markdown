Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a $3.7 million redevelopment for Lepperton School in North Taranaki.

“This is a significant redevelopment that will address multiple property issues at the school in one coordinated project,” says Ms Kaye.

“A number of existing buildings have weather-tightness issues and the school is also experiencing ongoing roll growth.

“The redevelopment will see old buildings that are in poor condition replaced with seven brand new teaching spaces. Master-planning will also allow for an eighth space to be built to accommodate further roll growth if required.

“As with most major school redevelopments, the focus will be on creating modern, flexible learning environments that excite and inspire students to learn and achieve.

“Flexible learning spaces can be reconfigured as necessary, and provide a more collaborative working environment that can accommodate current and evolving teaching practices.

“Design work on the Lepperton School redevelopment will start once consultants are engaged.

“I expect construction to start later in 2016, with the new buildings available for use in 2017.

**Notes:**

**About Lepperton School**

Lepperton School, which opened in 1870, is a decile 9 primary school with a roll of around 165 students.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
