Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced the appointment of Jared Mullen as the Deputy Chief Censor of Film and Literature for a three-year term.

“Mr Mullen brings experience in organisational change management and a good understanding of the role of the Deputy Chief Censor and the Classification Office. His senior management experience in the public sector will be of great benefit to the Classification Office.”

“The Deputy Chief Censor supports the Chief Censor in protecting New Zealanders from material likely to cause harm while balancing the important right to freedom of expression”, says Mr Dunne.

Mr Mullen has held the position of Associate Deputy Chief Executive, Social Policy and Knowledge at the Ministry of Social Development since November 2012. Prior to this he held a number of senior roles at the Ministry of Justice.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification is an independent Crown entity, established under the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 to examine and classify publications, including films, videos, books, magazines, sound recordings and computer files.
