Twelve senior executives and business owners have been given the opportunity to attend the world’s most prestigious business schools after receiving Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce says the scholarships will allow our smartest executives to expand their international expertise, and are designed to grow business skills to help make New Zealand firms more internationally competitive.

“The scholarships offer recipients the chance to study at the world’s best business schools. They provide an opportunity to learn international best practices in management and leadership.

“The knowledge gained from the world’s top business schools by our senior executives will benefit the companies they return to.”

This is the sixth year the scholarships have been awarded. Recipients will study at a range of top international institutions such as Harvard Business School, INSEAD (The Business School for the World), and the London Business School. 

The study programmes range from 4 weeks to 20 months and funding covers up to 50 percent of course-related costs.

“Our distance from overseas markets and the size of our economy can be a challenge to firms wanting to enter international markets,” Mr Joyce says.

“The scholarships will help to develop valuable networks and the global mindset of our business leaders. Ultimately, this will help to grow our economy and make New Zealand businesses more internationally competitive.”
