Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed an agreement between the Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Educational Institute Te Riu Roa on how schools will work together to lift student achievement.

The agreement follows discussions between the Ministry and NZEI on collaboration between schools that will target educational challenges and improve teaching and leadership practices.

“I’m delighted with this agreement and want to thank all those who have worked over many months and who share my commitment to making sure every child can reach their full potential.

“This agreement follows one reached with secondary unions and represents a clear way forward for schools to work in communities, helping build on the progress already made to share knowledge and best practice among teachers and principals.

“We know that the quality of teaching and leadership are the most important in-school factors when it comes to education. It’s great that both primary and secondary unions will be involved in the work to make this happen,” says Ms Parata.

As a result of the agreement with the NZEI, communities of schools will expand to Communities of Learning which will include the pathway from early childhood on through to tertiary options. 

Communities of Learning will be funded as part of the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative, announced in 2014.

NZEI will be taking details of the agreement to its members this week.
