Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says an electronic decision support tool will help GPs improve the diagnosis and management of patients who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.

"We know TIAs can be a precursor of a more severe stroke so early identification and making the correct treatment decisions is vital," says Dr Coleman.

“An individual's chance of having a stroke can be greatly reduced if risk factors are identified and well managed, such as having their blood pressure checked, stopping smoking, exercising regularly and improving weight management.

“This new tool will help ensure patients receive appropriate and potentially lifesaving interventions more quickly and at the same time reduce unnecessary hospital admissions.

“It will also encourage effective and timely investigation and appropriate referral, and reduces unnecessary consultations and tests.”

The tool, which will be rolled out nationally, was launched at Capital and Coast District Health Board in Wellington today.

It is underpinned by clinical research and has been trialled in 56 GP practices across the country where it showed improved outcomes for patients and reduced treatment costs.

Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in New Zealand. The National Stroke Network has also identified prevention of stroke as a high priority in 2015/16.

This new tool is part of the Government’s commitment to protect and grow our public health services, supported by the extra $400 million being investing into the health sector.
