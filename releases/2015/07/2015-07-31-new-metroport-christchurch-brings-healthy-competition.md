The opening of the new Metroport Christchurch will drive competition and innovation between ports in Canterbury, Transport Minister Simon Bridges says.

Metroport Christchurch, the Port of Tauranga’s new inland port, is a freight hub based in Rolleston and offers freight operators another option to receive, pack and distribute containerised cargo as if it were a seaport.

“This new inland port has rail and road connections, giving cargo owners an efficient hub to move goods around Canterbury, and to and from PrimePort Timaru.

“This will enhance competition between the ports of Lyttleton and Tauranga and will likely mean improvements in port productivity and customer service.

“Improving freight logistics is an important part of ensuring ongoing economic growth. Metroport Christchurch will consolidate cargo and efficiently move it to seaports,” Mr Bridges says.

Facilities offering these services are important, particularly in light of the Ministry of Transport’s recent Future Freight Scenarios Study which illustrates the trend towards larger ships and fewer ports. Lowering domestic freight costs will further add to the benefits gained from larger ships.

“The Government is committed to ensuring freight moves quickly, efficiently and safely in and around New Zealand. Inland ports such as Metroport Christchurch will help make this happen,” Mr Bridges says.

Minister Bridges officially opened the Metroport in Rolleston today.
