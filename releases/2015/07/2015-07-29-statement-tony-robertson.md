Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced that an independent review will be carried out of Corrections’ monitoring of Tony Robertson following his release from prison in 2013.

“I have decided the family of Blessie Gotingco and the public need some independent assurance about Corrections’ part in the handling of the Robertson case,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Although this is an isolated incident, the public need to have confidence that they are safe in our communities and that is why I  want an independent review of the action taken in relation to Robertson’s oversight after he was released from prison.

“I am seeking advice on what form the review will take and who will lead it. It is my intention to discuss this at Cabinet on Monday,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
