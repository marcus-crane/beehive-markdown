Education Minister Hekia Parata encourages all New Zealanders to celebrate and engage in Māori Language Week (Te Wiki o te reo Māori).

“Māori Language Week is a chance for New Zealanders to celebrate our indigenous language and participate in one of the many events happening around the country that showcase Māori culture,” says Ms Parata.

This is the 40th year of Māori Language Week and the theme is *Whāngaia te reo ki ngā Mātua – Nurture the language in parents.*

“Māori language and culture is an important part of who we are as a nation so it’s great to see parents from all backgrounds expressing a desire for their kids to have more exposure to it,” says Ms Parata.

“We’re seeing Māori language and culture becoming more and more visible in classrooms across New Zealand. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of kids learning te reo as a subject at school grew from around 133,000 kids to more than 147,000.

“I encourage everyone to take part in Māori Language Week and to use the language in their homes, work places, classrooms and communities.”

Māori Language Week runs from 27 July – 2 August 2015.
