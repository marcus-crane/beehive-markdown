ACC Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the reappointment of three directors to the board of crown company FairWay Resolution Limited.

“These reappointments will give the company continuity of leadership and balance in terms of diversity, skills, experience and geographical representation.

“Peter Blades has been reappointed as Chair, a role he has fulfilled since his original appointment in July 2011. Peter has an accounting and finance background with Chief Executive experience and has held numerous directorships, including a current role on the board of Wellington Regional Council Holding Co Ltd.

“Deputy Chair Anita Chan QC is a barrister and solicitor and was appointed as Queen’s Counsel in June 2014. Anita was originally appointed as a director of FairWay in July 2011.

“Tarun Kanji was appointed to the FairWay board in August 2014 to add his extensive managerial and commercial governance experience. Tarun’s initial appointment was made during the pre-election period of restraint and has now been extended.

“These three appointments have been made for periods of between eighteen months and three years, to allow for optimal phasing of future board appointments.”

FairWay provides independent, formal reviews of ACC decisions, and has also been providing support and expertise to ACC to help it improve early resolution services.

“It’s positive that over the last few years, the number of reviews lodged has between decreasing steadily, from around 10,000 a year to 6,000 a year.

“This has been achieved through flexibility in dispute resolution, and better communication between ACC and people about decisions that affect them.

“ACC has also had positive results from an early resolution trial, to help people participate in alternative dispute resolution before going to a review hearing.”
