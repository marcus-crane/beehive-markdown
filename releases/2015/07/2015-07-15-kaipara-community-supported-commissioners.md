Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston says she is pleased good progress is being made in Kaipara.

In April, Ms Upston announced the three Commissioners appointed to the Kaipara District Council in 2012 would be re-appointed for a further year. The Council will now have an election in 2016, in line with triennial general elections for all local authorities.

“The Commissioners are continuing their good progress in the governance of the Kaipara district and I am confident they will hand over a well-functioning, efficient council at the next local elections in 2016.”

Visiting the region this week, Ms Upston said she was impressed by the collaboration between the commissioners and local groups which was leading to a range of opportunities in the community.

“I was lucky to meet with a number of Northland organisations - the Mangawhai Endowment Trust, Mangawhai Museum, Maungaturoto Residents Association and Dargaville Arts Association.

“I was impressed by the great work that these groups are doing in their communities, using their creativity to help make each of their towns vibrant and inclusive places. Their positive feedback about their experiences with the Commissioners was also great to hear first-hand.”

Since their appointment in 2012, the Commissioners have been working to address the Council’s issues and improving its performance. This includes rebuilding the relationship between the Council and the communities in Kaipara.

“It is clear that there is widespread support for the Commissioners in the district and they have made significant progress in their work. It’s also pleasing to see the planning that is well underway for the transition to full democracy and elections next year,” Ms Upston said.
