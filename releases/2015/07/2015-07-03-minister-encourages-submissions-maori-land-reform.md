While the consultation hui on the exposure draft of the Ture Whenua Māori Bill have now been completed, there is still a month to go before submissions close on 7 August.

“I’d like to thank those people who were able to attend the hui. This landmark legislation will have a significant impact on all Māori land owners so I encourage tāngata whenua to make a submission,” says Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

Mr Flavell says information on the website of Te Puni Kōkiri has been updated to cover many of the concerns raised at the hui held around the country.

“I’m committed to getting this legislation right. It is unusual for an exposure draft of any piece of proposed law to go out to the public before being introduced in to the House.

“The changes to the current law are designed to empower Māori land owners and make it easier for them to make decisions about their land,” says Mr Flavell.

Once the submissions close, the Ture Whenua Advisory Group will give their independent advice and a report to the Minister. The bill is due to be introduced in to the House by the end of this year.
