Prime Minister John Key welcomes today’s announcement that the Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall will visit New Zealand in November.

This will be the second joint visit for Their Royal Highnesses to New Zealand.

The Prince and The Duchess last visited in November 2012 to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

“We agreed then that future visits should occur more regularly than in the past, to build on the close and special links between New Zealand and Their Royal Highnesses.”

“I am delighted to welcome them both back to New Zealand,” says Mr Key.

This will be the second Royal visit to New Zealand this year, following the very successful visit of Prince Harry in May.

“I’m sure New Zealanders will be excited to hear that Their Royal Highnesses are returning, providing another opportunity to meet members of the Royal family here in New Zealand.”

Details of the programme will be released in the usual way once confirmed.
