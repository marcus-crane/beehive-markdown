Minister Responsible for Novopay, Steven Joyce has today announced two reappointments to the board of Education Payroll Limited.

Dame Patsy Reddy has been reappointed for one year as the Chair of Education Payroll Ltd, the company established in 2014 to operate the schools payroll. Murray Jack, former Chair of Deloitte New Zealand, will also serve another year on the board.

"Both Dame Patsy and Mr Jack have, provided strong leadership and guidance to date to enable stabilisation of the education payroll," says Mr Joyce.

Together with the appointment of former Education Payroll Ltd CEO Ms Cathy Magiannis earlier in the year, the company has a strong group of directors to work on the strategic direction of the new company. 

Education Payroll Limited (EPL) was formed following a decision to transfer ownership and management of the schools’ payroll service from Talent2 to a new government-owned company.

“Payroll performance continues to improve, with all pay periods in the past twelve months recording an error rate of less than 0.25 per cent, well below the 0.5 per cent acceptable error rate as defined by the Novopay technical review. However there is still work to be done and further improvements underway. These include addressing the current project to improve the management of leave for education staff." says Mr Joyce.

Mr Joyce thanked both Dame Patsy and Mr Jack for their service to date and looks forward to continuing to work closely with them.
