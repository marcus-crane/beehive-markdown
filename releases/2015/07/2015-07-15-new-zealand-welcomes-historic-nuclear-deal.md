Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed news that agreement has been reached on a nuclear deal between Iran, the Five Permanent (P5) members of the United Nations Security Council, and Germany.

“Over the last eighteen months negotiators have been working to secure an agreement that will increase international confidence in the nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” Mr McCully says.

“This agreement is a positive development for regional stability in the Middle East and will allow for further progress to be made in the relationship between New Zealand and Iran.

“New Zealand commends all parties to the negotiations for staying the course and concluding this important deal.

“As the current President of the United Nations Security Council, New Zealand will do what it can to expedite any necessary Security Council action, and we call for the agreement to be implemented as soon as possible,” Mr McCully says.
