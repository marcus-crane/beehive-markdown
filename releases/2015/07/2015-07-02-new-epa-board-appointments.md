Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith today announced the reappointment of Dr Kevin Thompson as deputy chair of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) board and the appointment two new members, Dayle Hunia and Geoffrey Thompson, to the board.

“I am pleased to reappoint Dr Kevin Thompson as deputy chair. Kevin is an experienced engineer and manager who brings a wealth of experience to the EPA board including strategic management, technical leadership and experience growing and transforming organisations. He is skilled in governance and organisational change and growth, and has in-depth knowledge of New Zealand’s environmental management system,” Dr Smith says.

“The two new appointments I am also announcing today bring additional skills to the board, covering resource management and tikanga Māori, as well as strategic and legal expertise.

“Dayle Hunia is from Whakatane. She has 20 years’ experience in strategic leadership, strong knowledge of the Māori perspective and tikanga Māori, and is a certified Environmental Commissioner.

“She has worked for many years in Māori business development, environmental strategy, communication technologies and project management. She has a proven track record of implementing positive change across a range of commercial and social entities while successfully building and maintaining networks.

“Geoffrey Thompson has an eminent legal background and is now a consultant with a focus on commercial investment, particularly in the forestry industry. He has strong experience in business governance, central government, environmental planning and practice. He is based in Waikanae, near Wellington, where he has farmed for 35 years.”

Ms Hunia and Mr Thompson join Dr Thompson and the other EPA Board members: Kerry Prendergast (chair), Tim Lusk, Nicki Crauford, Gillian Wratt, and Kura Denness.

“The EPA board is responsible for the governance of the Authority, which administers applications for major infrastructure projects and the Emissions Trading Scheme, in addition to managing the environmental impact of specified activities in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone, and regulating new organisms, hazardous substances and chemicals,” Dr Smith says.

“The combined experience of the board’s new and existing members provides a strong blend of experience to oversee these activities.”
