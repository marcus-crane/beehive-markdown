Work on construction of the Margaret Mahy Family Playground is underway to be complete in time for the Christmas holidays this year, says Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner.

City Care and JFC Limited have been awarded the main work contract to construct the playground and its surrounding park. This work includes installation of the playground equipment as well as the paving, lighting, seating and landscaping for the greater park area and Armagh Street.

“The playground will be an exciting space for children to play in and explore. Features include a four-metre wide slide, double flying fox, water features and interactive equipment which highlights the natural qualities of the Canterbury Plains and Port Hills,” Ms Wagner says.

“A key feature of the playground is the story arc which features elements from Margaret Mahy and Elsie Locke’s stories, as well as Ngai Tahu narratives and imagery.

“The team has started the early work of preparing the site and people can expect to see playground equipment being installed from September. Remediation work to remove any hazardous material from previous land uses has been completed.

“The playground is about one third of a 2.5ha block bound by Ötäkaro/Avon River, and Manchester, Madras and Armagh streets. The ideas that children put forward in the Amazing Place competition underpin the developed design for the playground.

“This exciting new playground will not only bring children into the central city, it will be a space for the whole family with picnic areas as well as food and beverage outlets,” Ms Wagner says.
