Foreign Minister Murray McCully says the failure of the Security Council to adopt a resolution seeking to establish an international tribunal to provide accountability for the downing of flight MH17 is deeply disappointing.

“New Zealanders were among the 298 people lost over Ukraine in July 2014 on flight MH17 and we strongly support accountability for this tragedy,” Mr McCully says.

“As President of the United Nations Security Council we have been working closely with Australia, Malaysia, the Netherlands and others to get the best possible outcome for the victims and their families, including co-sponsoring the resolution which would have established an international tribunal.

“While Russia had foreshadowed it was likely to veto the resolution, it’s still disappointing that we were not able to reach agreement on a way forward. The victims of this tragedy and their families deserve better.

“An independent report on the cause of this tragedy is expected in the coming months. New Zealand will continue to push for accountability for the downing of flight MH17, alongside other affected countries,” Mr McCully says.
