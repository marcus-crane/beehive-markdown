More than 500,000 New Zealanders have signed up to take part in New Zealand ShakeOut, our national earthquake drill at 9.15am on 15 October, says Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This is a great start. Our goal is to have at least 1.5 million people signed up for the drill, so eleven weeks out we’re a third of the way there,” says Ms Kaye.

“During the drill, New Zealanders will drop, cover and hold to practise the right actions to take during an earthquake.

“I encourage everyone to sign up for ShakeOut.  We want as many people as possible taking part, from individuals and families to schools, shops, businesses and other organisations.

“ShakeOuts are held in other countries, including the US, Canada and Japan, but our previous drill in New Zealand in 2012 had the largest participation rate of any ShakeOut anywhere.

“We want to show once again that we’re world leaders in earthquake drills, to improve our preparedness as a nation.

“New Zealand is prone to earthquakes, so we all need to take responsibility and know how to get through.

“By signing up on the ShakeOut website, you can get information on the right actions to take before, during and after an earthquake. There are also resources to help you promote and engage others in ShakeOut, such as posters, web banners and colouring pictures for kids.”

Ms Kaye this morning opened the 2015 New Zealand Disaster Communications Conference in Auckland.

This two-day conference is run by Emergency Media & Public Affairs (EMPA), an international organisation dedicated to promoting effective communications in emergencies.

“During my address this morning I spoke about the importance of information to help people understand hazards, manage risks and take appropriate action in an emergency.

“ShakeOut is a great example of an innovative way to engage people in preparing for a potential emergency. So if you haven’t signed up yet, jump online and sign up now.”
