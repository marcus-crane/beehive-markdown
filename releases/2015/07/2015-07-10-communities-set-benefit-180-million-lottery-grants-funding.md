Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board, Hon Peter Dunne today announced $180 million of Lottery funding is being made available to support communities throughout New Zealand.

“The Board is pleased to be able to focus the 2015/16 allocations on providing support to groups and organisations undertaking vital work within the community, with over $94 million being allocated to the core Lottery Distribution Committees.

“Last year, core Lottery Distribution Committees funded over 3000 requests, providing significant funding into the community sector.  By focusing allocations for 2015/16 on core distribution committees, we are aiming to maximise the support for community based organisations” says Mr Dunne.

Further support for World War One Commemoration projects has also been provided for 2015/16, in addition to the $22 million which has previously been allocated over the last three years to commemorate this significant anniversary.

“I am very proud for the Board to be able to contribute to making the commemoration of the First World War a success.  The allocation for 2015/16 will enable projects which recognise the many different aspects of the war, from telling New Zealander’s stories to being able to commemorate those who lost their lives, to be funded.

“The Board will continue to support arts, culture and sporting initiatives through funding of over $84 million to the three statutory bodies supported by the Board: the New Zealand Film Commission (including Nga Taonga Sound and Vision), Creative New Zealand and Sport New Zealand” says Mr Dunne.

A full breakdown of the 2015/16 allocation is below:
