Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed a report showing that Trades Academies are delivering “overwhelmingly positive outcomes” for students.

The report is from the Education Review Office which reviewed 15 of the 24 academies operating across New Zealand.

The academies, introduced in 2011, are designed to increase retention rates, raise NCEA Level 2 achievement rates and smooth the transition from school to further education, training and work.

Ms Parata says she is delighted with the findings of the ERO report. “It shows that what we hoped would happen when we introduced Trades Academies has happened.

“Academies have improved the motivation, attendance, self-esteem and achievement rates of students who were at risk of disengaging from the system.

“ERO also found that students participating in academies are becoming more resilient and learning to manage their time and solve problems.

“Reported comments from students like ‘you know, I’m really good at something after all; thought I’d be a farm worker –not a manager’, and ‘just came here for a day off school, realise it’s opening doors now and is worth it,’ show the impact academies are having on re-energising and refocusing students on the importance of learning and achievement,” says Ms Parata.

**Notes:**

New Zealand’s 24 Trades Academies cater for more than 5000 students and Budget 2015 provided for 300 more students per year from the beginning of next year.

Trades Academies are partnerships between schools and tertiary institutions. They can be delivered at schools or institutions or a combination of both.
