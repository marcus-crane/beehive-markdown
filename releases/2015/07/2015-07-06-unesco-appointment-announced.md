Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the appointment of Dr Arapata Hakiwai to the New Zealand National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

The commission is the main channel of cooperation between New Zealand and UNESCO which is responsible for fostering cooperation between nations in the areas of education, science, culture, social science (including peace and human rights) and communication and information.

The commission manages New Zealand’s relationship with UNESCO, maintains activities in support of the UNESCO mandate and provides advice to the Government on UNESCO matters.  

Ms Parata says she is delighted Dr Hakiwai, the Kaihautu (Māori co-leader) at the National Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, has agreed to take up the position. He is highly-regarded and possesses a wealth of knowledge of the cultural sector, both within New Zealand and internationally.”

Dr Hakiwai replaces Derek Lardelli who has stood down from the role.
