Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today paid tribute to former Chief Justice of New Zealand, Sir Ronald Davison GBE, CMG, QC, who died last week aged 94.

“Sir Ronald was a highly respected New Zealander who made a significant contribution to law and justice system reforms,” Mr Finlayson said.

Sir Ronald had a distinguished career as a barrister, which was recognised when he was made Queen’s Counsel in 1963. He was Chief Justice for 11 years from 1978 to 1989. During his retirement, Sir Ronald went on to head a number of inquiries, including the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters relating to Taxation (also referred to as the Winebox Inquiry).   

“I appeared before Sir Ronald many times and will always remember his thoughtfulness and courtesy,” Mr Finlayson said. “On behalf of the Government, I would like to express my sincere condolences to Sir Ronald’s wife Jacqueline, his children and the rest of his family.”
