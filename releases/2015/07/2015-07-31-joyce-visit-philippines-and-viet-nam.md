Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce departs for the Philippines and Viet Nam on Sunday to commemorate the 40th anniversary of New Zealand’s relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

“The ASEAN region is our fourth largest trading partner. As one of our closest major markets, it is crucial that New Zealand builds strong relations right across the region,” Mr Joyce says. “Emerging economies like the Philippines and Viet Nam offer incredible potential for New Zealand businesses.”

Mr Joyce will meet with various Kiwi businesses in the Philippines, and host an awards event to mark the 40-year anniversary of New Zealand’s  partnership with the ASEAN region.

“More than 40,000 Filipinos call New Zealand home. These growing personal links are having a dramatic effect on all aspects of our two countries’ relationship. There are big increases in student numbers and tourists coming to New Zealand from the Philippines, and there are an increasing number of Kiwi businesses entering the Philippines market.”

In Viet Nam, Mr Joyce will meet political leaders to discuss trade, investment and education connections.

“This is an important year for New Zealand and Viet Nam. Alongside our 40th anniversary with ASEAN, we are also celebrating 40 years of relations with Viet Nam.”

Mr Joyce and Education Minister Pham Vu Luan will host a second education forum in Ha Noi following Minister Luan’s visit to Auckland University of Technology in March. A fashion event in Ho Chi Minh City will showcase New Zealand’s creative and innovation education sector in Viet Nam and highlight the growing ties between education institutions in both countries.

Mr Joyce will also attend a ceremony for graduates of the Bachelor of Computing and Information Sciences course that is jointly delivered by AUT University and the University of Science, Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City.

More than 2000 Vietnamese students studied in New Zealand in 2014, and several New Zealand universities partner with local universities in Viet Nam.

Mr Joyce returns to New Zealand on 8 August.
