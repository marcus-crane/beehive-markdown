Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner today announced the first 14 grants for community projects from the newly established New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) Fund.

“The Fund was established to support projects that promote and maintain New Zealand Sign Language, one of New Zealand’s three official languages,” Ms Wagner says.

“NZSL is crucial to many people’s ability to communicate and participate in their communities. It will be exciting to see how the NZSL Fund helps to strengthen the language and make a difference to the lives of the thousands of New Zealanders who use it every day.

“There were 43 applications for funding received for this round, from 29 organisations. Fourteen projects have been approved from this round, and will receive a total of $900,000 funding.

“There are a variety of innovative projects being supported including further development of the NZSL Online Dictionary, online NZSL teaching resources and a Deaf Short Film Festival.

“Many projects have an e-focus with tools such as online videos and interactive features, accessible on mobile devices. This will enable more children and families to access NZSL in the home,” Ms Wagner says.

Earlier this year Deaf Aotearoa received $350,000 from the Fund to support NZSL Week 2015. Applications were reviewed by the New Zealand Sign Language Board followed by the Office for Disability Issues.
