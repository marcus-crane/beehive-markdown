The Government will grant up to $100,000 to enable the West Coast’s Old Ghost Road cycle trail to be completed this year, Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry announced today.

The Government is working with the Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust, the Buller District Council and Development West Coast on the 85km trail, which will connect the ghost town of Lyell in the Buller Gorge to Seddonville township.

“The Old Ghost Road cycle trail is an excellent example of collaboration between central and local government and the community,” says Mr Joyce.

“As well as government funding of $3.39 million through the New Zealand Cycle Trail project, the trail has benefited from volunteer track building programmes and a successful crowd funding campaign that raised around $100,000.  The cycle trail has attracted huge support from the local community as well as from tramping clubs and mountain biking clubs throughout the country.  

“Completing the last few kilometres in the mid-section of the trail will deliver a high-quality tourism asset and attract more visitors, create jobs, and boost economic growth in the region.”

Ms Barry says the cycle trail has the potential to be a world-renowned mountain bike ride for advanced riders.

“The Trust and its volunteers have been instrumental in the Trail development to date. They have put in a significant amount of effort getting to where we are now. The heritage and natural beauty of the Old Ghost Road have the potential to make it a real drawcard for the Coast, and with this injection of capital we can finish the trail and help the community realise its ambition,” says Ms Barry.

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will manage contractual obligations with the Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust and funding will be conditional on completion of the cycle trail.

Mr Steven Joyce has spent two days visiting the West Coast. He has met with Buller Mayor Garry Howard, Westland Mayor Mike Havill and Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn.

Yesterday Mr Joyce and Mr Kokshoorn visited the site of the Taramakau Road/Rail Bridge.

“The Government confirmed funding for a new two-lane road bridge beside the existing bridge in last week’s release of the National Land Transport Programme. Construction of the two-lane bridge will commence late next year.”
