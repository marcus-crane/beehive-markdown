Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders are using online services, Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Kiwis are doing more of their government transactions digitally; by March this year, an average of 45.8 per cent of measured government service transactions were completed digitally – up from 30.4 per cent when measurement started in June 2012”, says Mr Dunne.

“More than 400,000 Kiwi adults have renewed their passport online since the November 2012 launch of the service. Next year that number will grow even faster when first time adult passport applicants using a RealMe verified identity and child renewals can apply online.

“More than 50,000 people have a RealMe verified identity, evidence of identity online. Customers can use a RealMe verified identity to open bank accounts with BNZ and TSB, enrol to vote with the Electoral Commission, transfer money using NZForex and more. Students are able to use a RealMe verified identity when they apply to StudyLink for allowances and loans.

“It’s just a tick of a box to get a RealMe verified identity when you renew your adult passport online. Take-up rates are exceeding expectations with almost half of those eligible choosing to get a RealMe verified identity.

“More than 75 per cent of babies born in New Zealand are registered online, since the launch of the Birth Registration Online service earlier this year. Parents can also apply for an Inland Revenue (IRD) number at the same time.

“Good progress is being made towards the Government's target that an average of 70 per cent of New Zealanders' most common transactions with government will be completed in a digital environment by 2017.

"We'll meet the target if digital services continue to get less complicated in the eyes of New Zealanders – for example, through integrating government services that make sense to people's lives. Internal Affairs is leading a piece of work to make it easier for parents to find the information and services they need online when a child is born, saving parents time.

"It should be so easy to deal with government digitally that most people choose digital over other transactions such as office counters, phone or post. At the same time, services should always be high quality and meet people's needs.

"People want to get their business with government sorted quickly, accurately, and easily so they can get on with doing the things they want to do”, says Mr Dunne.

The Department of Internal Affairs, through the Better Public Services Result 10 Programme, measures digital uptake of ten of the most common government services, including adult passport renewals, filing an individual tax return, applying for Ministry of Social Development financial assistance, paying for vehicle licenses, and paying a Police fine.
