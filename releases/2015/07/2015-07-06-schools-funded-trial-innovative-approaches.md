Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced the successful applicants for a new $10 million fund to encourage innovative teaching practices.

“I’m delighted with the quality of the 39 projects that have won funding in the first round of the Teacher-led Innovation Fund worth a total of about $2.6 million,” says Ms Parata.

“It’s part of our $359m Investing in Educational Success initiative and allows schools to put their bright ideas into practice and share them across schools.

“This is an exciting time for the more than 75 schools that are taking part in this first round. Several early childhood services are also involved.”

Projects include:

- A programme to help students with dyslexia with their reading, based on insights from neurological research
- A project targeting gifted and talented Māori and Pasifika boys
- A programme to change teaching practices so students become more active learners
- ‘Flipped’ classrooms where class time is used flexibly to encourage students to be enquiring and test their skills.

“Not only are these projects important for the schools involved, but other schools will be able to learn from their successes.

“Schools whose applications were unsuccessful have received feedback and are encouraged to re-apply when the next round opens in November,” says Ms Parata.

Schools allocated the funding will start on their projects from July 1.
