The regeneration of Christchurch will be the city’s focus for the next five years as local leadership progressively takes control of the rebuild, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says.

“We will work closely with councils and other local stakeholders to progressively pass governance and management of the rebuild to the Canterbury community,” Mr Brownlee says.

A new Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill will replace the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, which expires next April.

While some of the CER Act’s powers are still required, the progress of the recovery means many are no longer relevant.

The fresh legislation will enable a new organisation similar to an urban development authority, which we propose to call Regenerate Christchurch, to implement the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan.

“It is evident that the community wants a significant step-change in our approach to this rebuild,” Mr Brownlee says.

“We agree the time is right, as does the advisory board led by Dame Jenny Shipley, which was tasked with looking at options for Christchurch’s management once the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act expires.

“The advisory board’s recommendations were clear that a new direction is now required to capitalise on the groundwork that has been laid.”

As has previously been signalled, some functions carried out by CERA will transition to other appropriate Government agencies.  Some of CERA’s functions will transfer into a business unit within the Department of Prime Minster and Cabinet.

Mr Brownlee says these changes will happen progressively between now and April next year, at which time the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority will officially wind up.

The new organisation will have primary responsibility for the development within Christchurch’s four avenues and delivery of the Crown’s major projects and precincts in the central city.

“We are currently setting up an establishment board which will have a specific focus on ensuring there is greater commercial discipline in their delivery,” Mr Brownlee says.

“A crucial part of the board’s work will be seeing the new entity works in tandem with the Christchurch City Council for the good of the city’s future development.

“Rebuilding the city remains one of the most ambitious projects in New Zealand’s history.  We can’t be afraid to take stock and change direction if need be, and I believe the organisation we are developing will be the vehicle to drive that new focus for the central city redevelopment.”

The proposed changes are explained in detail in the Draft Transition Recovery Plan, which will be released today for public submission by CERA acting chief executive John Ombler.

Mr Brownlee says the way ahead for Christchurch is through collaborative management of the rebuild.

“Regeneration is the focus now.

“It is time to look ahead to the long-term success of the rebuild in order to continue growing confidence in greater Christchurch.”
