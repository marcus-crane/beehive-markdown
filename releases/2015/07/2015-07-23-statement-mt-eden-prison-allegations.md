Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga was this afternoon advised of fresh allegations involving Mt Eden Corrections Facility.

These allegations have been outlined in a media statement from the Department of Corrections.

“I expect to receive advice from Corrections Chief Executive Ray Smith about the options available to address the situation,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I will not be making any further comment until I have received and considered this advice.”
