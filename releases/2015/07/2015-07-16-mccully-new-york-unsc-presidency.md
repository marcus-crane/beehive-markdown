Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York this weekend to support New Zealand’s Presidency of the United Nations Security Council.

“As the current President of the Security Council, New Zealand chairs all Council meetings and has a central role convening the Council’s work on major international security issues,” Mr McCully says.

“Next week Middle East issues will be high on the Council’s agenda, including the recent agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany. This historic accord is a positive outcome for the region and we will do all we can as President to help implement the agreement.

“Much of the agenda for the month is determined by international events, such as the security challenges in Syria, Libya, and Yemen, but we do also have an opportunity to raise issues that are of particular importance to New Zealand and our region.

“On 30 July New Zealand will be hosting an Open Debate on the security challenges faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This will encourage the Council to consider these issues and will also provide an opportunity for SIDS from the Pacific, Caribbean and other regions to have their views heard by the Security Council directly,” Mr McCully says.

Minister McCully will also meet with the UN Secretary General, other senior United Nations advisers, and a number of Ministers and Permanent Representatives.
