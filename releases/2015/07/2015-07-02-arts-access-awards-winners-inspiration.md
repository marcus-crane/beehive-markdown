Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry and Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner congratulate the winners of the eighth annual Arts Access Awards for their work in providing access to the arts.

“The Arts Access Awards celebrate the individuals, community groups and organisations that provide opportunities for people with limited access to engage with the arts, both as audience and artist,” Ms Barry says.

“It was a very impressive occasion, and a reminder of the vibrancy and diversity of the creative arts sector.”

“The Awards also celebrate the achievements of New Zealand artists with a physical, sensory or intellectual impairment, as well as artists who experience mental illness,” Ms Wagner says.

“The supreme award, the Arts Access Accolade, was awarded to Neil Cox of the Isaac Theatre Royal. Neil and his team have ensured that all people, regardless of mobility, can access the arts following the Theatre’s fully accessible $40m rebuild.

“The creativity, imagination and commitment that each of last night’s winners have shown to the arts, to disabled people, and to their communities serves as an inspiration to all New Zealanders,” Ms Wagner says.

The winners were: Everybody Cool Lives Here Trust, Active, Waikeria Prison, Auckland Live, Artsenta, Pati Umaga, and Mary Ama and the Pacific Mamas.

Arts Integrated, Northland Regional Corrections Facility, Auckland War Memorial, Pablo’s Art Studio and Michael Krammer received highly commended citations for their work.
