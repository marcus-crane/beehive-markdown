Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) on 25 years of service to education.

“Soon after its inception NZQA garnered international attention when it established one of the first qualifications frameworks in the world, a framework that related all qualifications to each other and provided students with a variety of pathways to gain qualifications.

“This was a stunning democratisation of education qualifications and opened the possibility of anyone, anytime, seeking to improve their education success. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement is a sophisticated yet simple record of a specific student’s particular achievements.”

“Today NZQA is continuing to innovate. Just this week it announced that 13,000 students will participate in a trial of computer-based maths assessments in September,” says Ms Parata.

“The organisation, which came into being 25 years ago today, has played an important part in helping New Zealanders develop knowledge and skills and having those recognised in a systematic way. I applaud NZQA’s ongoing work to ensure New Zealand’s qualifications are accepted as credible and robust both nationally and internationally.

“This work has been adopted as a blueprint for a number of other countries and has earned NZQA an enviable international reputation.

“I wish to place on record my thanks to staff and former staff and current and past Board members.”
