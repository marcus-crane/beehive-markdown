Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye will today open innovative new learning environments for students and teachers at two Auckland schools.

“Today I will open Bayfield School’s new teaching and administration block and Mt Eden Normal School’s four new classrooms,” says Ms Kaye.

“These are exciting times for our schools as we look to the future and provide spaces that will foster and enhance collaborative teaching and learning.

“Bayfield School, with a roll of 384, will benefit from a $12 million redevelopment that includes 12 new teaching spaces, as well as a new library, staff facilities, administration area and music suite.

“Work is still underway on the school’s new hall, which is due to be completed next month. Landscaping will also be carried out to create new links between redeveloped and existing areas.

“Bayfield School and community had a tough time recently with asbestos issues. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the board, principal and school through this period. It’s a special day for the community to be opening these buildings today.

“Mt Eden Normal School’s new $1.4 million four-classroom block raises the school’s roll capacity from 692 to 799.

“The current property plan for the school includes upgrading more of its existing teaching spaces to meet new learning space standards.

“All of these new classrooms will have a flexible layout. It’s important that we provide innovative infrastructure so that staff and students can continue to teach, learn and achieve to high standards.”
