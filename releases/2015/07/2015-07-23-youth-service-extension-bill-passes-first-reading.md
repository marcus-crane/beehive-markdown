Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says a bill extending the successful Youth Service to better support 19 year old parents and other unemployed 18 and 19 year olds at risk of long term welfare dependence has passed its first reading.

Youth Service provides intensive wrap around support for young people, getting them help with paying bills, budgeting and parenting, and supporting them into education.

“Youth Service is proving to be very successful for those young people currently enrolled in the service, which is why we’re extending it to at-risk young people under 20,” Mrs Tolley says.

“We want to help these young people realise their potential and help them back into education or find a job so they can go on and lead productive and fulfilling lives rather than struggling on a benefit.

“For many young people this means they will be able to receive Youth Service support for longer, helping them into education, training or work, and a more successful life.”

At the end of March, 86.5 per cent of the young people enrolled in the Youth Service were engaged in education, training or work-based learning. Just over half of those who left the Youth Service remained independent from benefits three months after leaving the programme.

“The programme gives them the chance to become successful, while also reducing future benefit costs for taxpayers. It is estimated that for every dollar spent on the Youth Service, the long-term financial liability to New Zealanders reduces by $2.53,” Mrs Tolley says.

“By giving these young people the little extra support they need to stay off a benefit, we are helping them get ahead, gain skills and experience, and lead successful lives,” Mrs Tolley says.

At the end of June, there were 13,231 young people enrolled in the Youth Service.
