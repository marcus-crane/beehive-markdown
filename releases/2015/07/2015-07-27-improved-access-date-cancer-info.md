Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new national cancer information strategy will benefit patients, clinicians and researchers.

“Access to high quality and reliable cancer information is important,” says Dr Coleman.

“Currently information is collected and stored by a range of health professionals which makes it challenging to get a comprehensive view of a patient.

“While progress has been made in joining information across DHBs, until now there has been no national approach.”

The New Zealand Cancer Health Information Strategy provides a five-year framework for changes to the way cancer clinical data and patient information is collected and stored.

Released today, the strategy will ensure information is consistent and accessible across the country and help to inform future investment in cancer health information-based initiatives.

“Delivering better cancer services is a priority for the Government. We have made significant progress since 2008 and patients are getting better faster cancer care,” says Dr Coleman.

“This strategy will help support the faster cancer treatment programme which the Government has invested $63 million. It is also linked to the NZ Cancer Plan which sets out the activities that need to happen over the next three years to ensure patients receive even better faster care.”

The strategy has been developed by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with cancer care clinicians and patients. It will be implemented gradually with the initial focus on improving cancer information around ethnicity and multi-disciplinary meetings.
