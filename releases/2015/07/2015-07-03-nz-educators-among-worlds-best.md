New Zealand’s teaching profession is amongst the most highly trained, best qualified, and most experienced in the world, Education Minister Hekia Parata says. 

The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) asked teachers of Year 7 to 10 students from 34 countries about their schools and their work.  In New Zealand, more than 2,800 Year 7 to 10 teachers from 163 schools took part.

“The survey shows our educators are well qualified and well trained,” says Ms Parata. “For example, 99 per cent of New Zealand teachers have completed a teacher education or teacher training programme compared to 90 per cent of their overseas counterparts.

“The survey also showed that 97 per cent of our teachers had participated in at least one professional development activity in the previous 12 months, compared to an average of 88 per cent in the countries surveyed,” says Ms Parata.

“Our principals are also some of the world’s most experienced. The typical New Zealand principal has spent an average of 12 years as a principal, and has 26 years teaching experience. This compares to the international average of 9 years as a principal and 21 years teaching experience.”

New Zealand Year 7 to 10 teachers work an average of 44 hours a week, according to the survey. That is one hour more than the average in Australia, four hours less than the average in Singapore and six hours more than the international average.

The average class size for Year 7 to 10 students in New Zealand is 25, one student more than the international average, and 11 less than the average in Singapore. 

“Teachers feel more valued here than teachers in many of the countries surveyed,” says Ms Parata. “Our teachers are also more likely to believe that they can help their students value learning and think critically.

“Our educators’ hard work is making a difference to the lives of many of our children and young people. New Zealand’s parents and students are fortunate to have such a dedicated teaching profession,” says Ms Parata.
