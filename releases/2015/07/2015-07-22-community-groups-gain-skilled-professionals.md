Applications open today for community groups to gain a skilled professional free of charge to work in their organisation for up to a year says Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew.

The Community Internship Programme funds the employment costs for community groups to hire specialists to help them on a specific project for one year part-time, or up to six months full-time.

“Often, community groups don’t have the resources to have someone on staff that can develop a marketing plan, for example, or who has the skills to enhance their technology systems so they run more efficiently,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“This programme allows people to take time out from their regular work without being out of pocket, and makes a huge difference to community organisations who desperately need specialist help with certain projects.”

To apply, community groups need to identify an area for development, locate an appropriately skilled professional to achieve the outcomes, and gain approval from the person’s employer to be involved in this scheme.

Applications open on 22 July and close on 16 September. Successful internships can begin early in 2016.

**Background:**

**Community Internship funding from 2014:**

Last year, seven internships were awarded; two in Canterbury, one each in Waitotara, Palmerston North, Hutt Valley and Wellington, and one for a nationwide project.

**Canterbury:** Funding from the programme in 2014 has allowed the Canterbury Men’s Centre to employ Shelley Johnson of the Alcohol Drug Association to enhance their support for male victims of domestic violence.

Nathan Moncrieff from the Canterbury Earthquake Temporary Accommodation Service of the Ministry of Social Development is supporting the Canterbury Communities’ Earthquake Recovery Network with the management of the In the Know Hub.

**Palmerston North:** Mary-Jane Ngamate Pritchard of Te Horowhenua Trust is helping Volunteer Resource Centre Manawatu & Districts to expand its services in the region. The internship will develop marketing strategies and engage and train volunteers, to prepare a solid base for opening VRC Horowhenua.

**Hutt Valley:** Julia Basillie, a Ministry of Health Development Manager in Disability Support Services, will support Life Unlimited to develop a framework setting up and supporting locally owned community initiatives aimed at ensuring the Hutt Valley is a place where disabled people can live their lives, as they choose, in their communities. 

**Wellington:** Terrace Villa’s Gavin Redmond will oversee a major capital redevelopment for the Wellington Boys’ and Girls’ Institute. The internship will allow opportunities for disadvantaged youth to take an active role in the redevelopment of the headquarters. There will also be opportunities to identify mentorship possibilities between the two groups.

**Waitotara:** Massey University ecological economist Dr. Marjan van den Belt is helping Te Kaahui O Rauru to map natural resources and plan work with the Department of Conservation to manage the Waitotara Conservation Area.

**Nationwide project:** Kathy Lys, a System Integration Programme Manager with the Ministry of Health, will research, collate and analyse data to develop a National Respiratory Strategy for The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand.
