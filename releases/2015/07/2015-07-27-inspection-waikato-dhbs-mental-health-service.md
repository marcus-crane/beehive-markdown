Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says there will be an inspection of Waikato DHB’s mental health services.

“We want the public to have high confidence in the quality and safety of Waikato DHB’s mental health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Following discussions with the Director General of Health, Chai Chuah, and the Director of Mental Health, Dr John Crawshaw, it has been agreed that a formal inspection of Waikato DHB’s mental health services will be carried out.

“This inspection will be undertaken by the Ministry of Health’s Director of Mental Health in accordance with his legislative powers under the Mental Health Act.”

Dr John Crawshaw will be assembling a small team who will support him in this inspection, with work commencing this week. The inspection and subsequent report back is expected to take up to eight weeks.

**Notes:**

The inspection will be carried out under Section 99 of the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992.
