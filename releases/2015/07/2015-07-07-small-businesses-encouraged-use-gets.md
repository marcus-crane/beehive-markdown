Small Business Minister Craig Foss is encouraging small businesses to utilise the Electronic Tender Service (GETS) — a free web-based service for information on New Zealand Government tender opportunities.

“Small business owners who want to be part of the Government procurement process often don’t know how to go about it — registering with GETS is a great place to start,” Mr Foss says.

“The Companies Office recently begun including GETS information in its annual return correspondence to New Zealand companies. The same information is also going to all newly incorporated companies.

“I understand small business owners are very busy people with a number of pressures on their time. GETS is a free service that allows them to find business opportunities without leaving their office.

“I strongly encourage all small businesses to sign up to GETS to ensure they’re aware of the latest opportunities in their area of expertise or region.”

GETS is designed to promote open, fair competition in the New Zealand Government market. For more information visit: [www.gets.govt.nz](http://www.gets.govt.nz)
