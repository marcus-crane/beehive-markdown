Prime Minister John Key has today acknowledged the passing of respected businessman and philanthropist Sir John Todd.

Sir John chaired the Todd Corporation from 1987 to 2011. He was also a leading patron of the arts and chairman of the charitable Todd Foundation.

Sir John was knighted for his contributions to business in 2012, and was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2009.

“I am saddened to hear of Sir John’s passing. He was a highly respected and admired businessman who helped turn the Todd Corporation into one of New Zealand’s most successful companies.

“Sir John also dedicated a lot of his time to charity work with the Todd Foundation, which focuses on helping children and families.

“It was a privilege to have known him.  My thoughts are with Sir John’s family and friends at this time.”
