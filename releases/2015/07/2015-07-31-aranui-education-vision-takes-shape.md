Education Minister Hekia Parata today planted a mānuka tree at the Aranui Community School site to mark the official start of construction.

The Year 1-13 co-educational school is located at the current Aranui High School site on Shortland Street in Christchurch. It will open in January 2017, following the closures of Aranui High School, Aranui School, Avondale School and Wainoni School.

Ms Parata says that Aranui Community School will be the first of its kind in the Christchurch region.

“Through collaboration and the sharing of resources, Aranui Community School will provide high-quality education in innovative learning environments that will benefit the students and the wider community,” says Ms Parata.

“Christchurch’s education sector has come a long way in the last four years and is on track to having one of the most modern schooling networks in the country that will help build a brighter future for the communities.”

Aranui Community School is one of four being built under a public private partnership (PPP) between the Ministry of Education and the Future Schools Partners consortium. It will have an initial capacity for 1,100 students and future expansion capacity for 1,800 students.

A satellite of Ferndale Special School will be co-located on the Aranui Community School campus and will provide special education for secondary age students.
