Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the five millionth KickStart breakfast since the Government expanded the programme will be served this week.

“KickStart has served five million breakfasts across the country since the Government expanded the programme in 2013,” Mrs Tolley says.

“There has been a 45 per cent increase in the number of schools taking up the programme since the expansion, with 109,170 breakfasts now served every week.

“As students head back to school this week it’s pleasing to know breakfast is available to those students who need it, to ensure they have a good start to every school day.”

An investment of $9.5 million over five years has seen the programme expanded from two to five mornings per week and to include all primary and secondary schools that want or need it, regardless of decile.

“The majority of schools are also reporting improvements in general health and wellbeing (85 per cent), concentration (78 per cent) and behaviour (66 per cent),” Mrs Tolley says.

“This is another fantastic example of the Government, communities and the private sector working together to ensure children have the best possible start we can give them.”
