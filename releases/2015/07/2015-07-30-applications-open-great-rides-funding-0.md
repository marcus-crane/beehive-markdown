Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has announced further funding is now available to maintain and improve the premier rides on the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

Applications are now open for the third round of funding available through the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund ­**—** a Government initiative to maintain and enhance the quality of the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“The Government is investing $8 million over four years to help maintain the quality of the Great Rides, the premier rides on the New Zealand Cycle Trail,” says Mr Key.

“Nearly $1.4 million has already been approved for 19 projects, which include the installation of safety barriers, storm damage remediation and surface enhancements.”

The Government is investing around $50 million in the New Zealand Cycle Trail which showcases New Zealand’s diverse landscapes.

“The number of people using the trails is continuing to increase,” says Mr Key. “More than 125,000 people used the New Zealand Cycle Trail in January, compared to 97,000 in January 2014. 

“This funding will help ensure that the trails are maintained to the highest possible standard and that users continue to have a safe and enjoyable experience.”
