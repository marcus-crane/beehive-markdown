Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says a multi-media competition for year 13 students will help ensure the bravery and sacrifice of New Zealand troops during the Battle of Passchendaele is not forgotten.

“The Battle of Passchendaele was one of New Zealand’s most deadly conflicts during World War I.  Many of those killed were of a similar age to the students eligible for this competition,” Mr Foss says.

“On just one day, 12 October 1917, more than 845 Kiwi men were killed and more than 2700 wounded.  Eight days earlier, on 4 October 1917, more than 320 were killed during the capture of Gravenstafel Spur.

“I encourage anyone in year 13 to research this battle, consider what it means to go to war — especially at such a young age — and help New Zealand remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.”

The competition is open to all year 13 students attending a New Zealand secondary school.  Entries, which close on 18 September 2015, may be submitted as writing, poetry, film, art, music or other media.  The overall winner will receive a $2000 education grant.
