Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes the announcement of the All Blacks 2016/2017 home schedules – featuring a 10-match tour from the British & Irish Lions in 2017.

“Following on from the ICC Cricket World Cup and FIFA Under 20 World Cup, sport in New Zealand is on a high,” says Dr Coleman.

“The NZ Lions 2017 Series is another opportunity for New Zealand to show that we are an excellent host of major international events.

“More than 20,000 Lions supporters visited in 2005 and the 2017 tour is expected to attract a similar number, but visiting rugby fans won’t be the only ones to benefit from the schedule announced by New Zealand Rugby today.

“The economic impact of the 2005 Lions tour was felt across the country, and this looks set to be repeated with a 10 matches to be played across New Zealand.”

Following seven home Test matches for the All Blacks in 2016, the 10-match Lions tour will dominate the 2017 rugby calendar.

Starting with a match in Whangarei, the Lions will also play matches in Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

Other features of the schedule include a three Test series against Wales in 2016 and a Bledisloe Cup Test match for Dunedin in 2017.

Further details, including ticket information, are expected to be announced towards the end of the year.
