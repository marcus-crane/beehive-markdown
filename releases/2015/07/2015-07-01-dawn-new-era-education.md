Today marks a new era for teachers as the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand opens its doors, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The nine–member council officially takes over responsibility for teacher registration and disciplinary matters from the Teachers Council today, but it has a wider brief than the body it replaces.

“In addition to serving as a gatekeeper, we want the council to raise standards and the status of the teaching profession because research tells us that the quality of teaching and school leadership are critical factors in raising achievement for all students,” says Ms Parata.

The council is chaired by highly-regarded Auckland principal Barbara Ala’alatoa and includes eight other leading educationalists, all but one of whom emerged from an exhaustive public nominations process.

“I am delighted with the calibre of the council members and expect the new body will make a major contribution to education in the coming years,” Ms Parata says.

“Teachers are too often society’s unsung heroes.  I want their contribution to be recognised and more of our best and brightest to regard teaching as an attractive career option.”

Ms Parata says she understands the council members have already met and work will begin soon on a strategic plan.

“Around 105,000 teachers have already had letters informing them of the differences between the two organisations.  Teachers will notice changes over time, but not immediately.

“Once again I want to thank the Teachers Council and its staff for their professionalism during a time of change.”
