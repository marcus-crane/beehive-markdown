Improving the focus on supporting vulnerable New Zealanders’ individual needs has led to more people getting access to social housing, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The June 2015 Social Housing Register quarterly figures, released today, show the number of applications on the register has decreased by 1,299 from the June 2014 quarter to 4,541 – a 22% decrease.

“I am pleased to see more people being housed, but also acknowledge that we need to continue working hard to ensure vulnerable New Zealanders have access to social housing,” says Mrs Bennett.

The Ministry of Social Development (MSD), Housing New Zealand, and Community Housing Providers are more intensively working to match people to houses that suit their need, with the number of housing offers made and accepted increasing to 1,590 in the June 2015 quarter, compared with 1,522 in the June 2014 quarter.

Better interaction by MSD with clients ensures that social housing is not the default option, as in many cases there are other sustainable private options that are suitable.

“Since May 2015, five case managers have been providing intensive case management for work-ready beneficiaries on the social housing register, because we know that improving people’s income through work removes a key barrier to getting private housing.

“Tenancy reviews of those paying market rent and able to sustain private accommodation makes more homes available for those more in need. So far 150 households have moved into the private market and 11 tenants have purchased their own homes.

“We’ve also paid out around $380,000 in Housing Support Products to 204 people, providing assistance for things like their bond, moving costs, and letting fees.

“While it is pleasing to see the improvements this quarter, we are working hard to improve the supply of social and affordable housing to ensure even more New Zealanders get access to housing that suits their needs,” says Mrs Bennett.
