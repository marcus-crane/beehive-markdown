Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says he is seeking assurance following the arrest of a person who has been employed until recently as a psychiatrist at Waikato DHB and is suspected to have carried out identity fraud.

“Allegations of this nature are a serious concern. My first action has been to seek assurance over patient safety,” says Dr Coleman.

“I am also seeking assurance from both the Waikato DHB and the Medical Council of New Zealand over the recruitment process they followed in employing this individual.

“I will be meeting with the Director General of Health tomorrow to continue discussions on this matter.”

Waikato DHB, with support from the Ministry of Health, is currently reviewing all patient files the individual has been involved in during his employment as a psychiatrist. At this stage, 25 patients have been identified as needing further follow up.

The individual claimed to have worked and trained overseas prior to his employment at Waikato DHB.

Any doctor coming to work in New Zealand must meet the high threshold set by the Medical Council of New Zealand.

As with all overseas recruits this individual was under supervision. The individual was stood down after his supervisor raised concerns over his competence and performance.

Anyone with concerns should phone 0800 50 50 50 or email: mentalhealth@waikatodhb.health.nz
