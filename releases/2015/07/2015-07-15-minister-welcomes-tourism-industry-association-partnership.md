A new partnership between the Department of Conservation and New Zealand’s largest tourism industry organisation will benefit both our natural environment and the economy, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

The partnership will see DOC work with the Tourism Industry Association to promote tourism on conservation land and beyond across the country.

“Tourism is our second biggest industry, worth around $24 billion, and our unique and spectacular natural environment is a major drawcard for international visitors, which is yet another good reason to look after it.” Ms Barry says.

“DOC is at the heart of tourism in this country, safeguarding and providing access to our natural and historic heritage. It makes sense for DOC and TIA to work towards shared goals through a formal agreement.”

Both parties will work closely together on five goals: communication, building relationships, ensuring compliance, promoting each other’s interests and growing conservation efforts around the country.

The partnership has been developed after last year’s successful DOC/TIA Tourism Connection Forums.

“The forums found DOC needed to simplify some of its processes and help enable growth in the industry which benefits conservation. This formal agreement is a significant step towards achieving that goal.”

The agreement was signed today by DOC director-general Lou Sanson and TIA chief executive Chris Roberts.
