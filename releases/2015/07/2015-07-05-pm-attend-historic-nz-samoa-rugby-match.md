Prime Minister John Key will join Samoa Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi to witness the first All Blacks - Manu Samoa test match to be played on Samoan soil. 

“Samoa and New Zealand enjoy a special relationship, including a shared love of rugby, and I am delighted to be attending this historic event,” Mr Key says. 

“This visit provides an opportunity to not only recognise this huge occasion for Samoa, but also to build on talks Prime Minister Tuilaepa and I had in Apia last year on a range of political and economic issues.”

PM Key and PM Tuilaepa will hold talks in the morning, before visiting the Apia Waterfront — a project being developed with New Zealand’s support — to officially open a playground on the site. 

They will then meet local business representatives at a networking event hosted by Samoa’s Chamber of Commerce and the Small Business Enterprise Centre. The event is an opportunity for New Zealand and Samoan business people to promote trade and to strengthen and build on business partnerships.

The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Sport and Recreation Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman, Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse, Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, and Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne. 

Also in the official party is Opposition Leader Andrew Little, New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters, and a number of MPs from National, Labour and the Greens. 

The delegation will depart on the morning of July 8, returning the same day.
