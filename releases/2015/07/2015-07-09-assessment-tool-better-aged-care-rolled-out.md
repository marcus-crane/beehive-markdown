An assessment tool for use in the residential aged care sector has been rolled out across the country, Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

The project has trained 2511 registered nurses in the use of the interRAI Long Term Care Facilities assessment.

The standardised assessment tool is designed to improve the care of older people in residential care facilities, with nurses able to create tailor-made care plans for residents.

New Zealand was the first country to embark on a national rollout of the interRAI home care assessment. This rollout of interRAI to the aged care sector complements earlier interRAI home care work.

“This is a significant achievement. I would like to congratulate the nurses and facility managers involved in reaching these training targets,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The introduction of interRAI is a government initiative carried out in partnership with district health boards and the aged care sector.

“It shows a real commitment to improving the quality of care of the elderly in New Zealand,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

It is a requirement that all aged care facilities use interRAI as their primary assessment for care planning from 1 July, 2015.

Planning is now underway for an integrated home care and residential aged care interRAI service.

The interRAI project means that for the first time, New Zealand will have detailed statistical information about the needs of older people in care.
