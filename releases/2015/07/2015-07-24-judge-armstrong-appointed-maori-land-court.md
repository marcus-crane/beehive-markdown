The Māori Development Minister, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, has announced the appointment of Judge Miharo Armstrong of Te Whānau-ā-Apanui to the Māori Land Court.

Judge Armstrong was temporarily appointed last year, upon the retirement of Judge Andrew Spencer from the Court, to assist with the workload of the Māori Land Court and the Waitangi Tribunal.

“Judge Armstrong has sat primarily in Te Taitokerau, and has proven to be a valued member of the Court bench. He has gained the trust and respect of Māori landowners, Māori Land Court staff and his peers”, says Mr Flavell.

As well as extensive experience in the Māori Land Court and the Waitangi Tribunal, Judge Armstrong is also experienced in other areas of law appearing before the District Court, High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.
