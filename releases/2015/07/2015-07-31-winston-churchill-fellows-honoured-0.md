Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is congratulating the fifteen New Zealanders who were honoured today at an awards ceremony for Fellows of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.

"Since 1965 over 840 New Zealanders have taken up this unique opportunity to travel abroad to carry out research that will be beneficial to their profession,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“These Fellows return with fresh perspectives and new ideas which they are able to apply in New Zealand and which benefit our communities greatly.

“The Fellows we are celebrating today have researched topical issues for New Zealand such as social enterprise and social housing, workplace resilience after a natural disaster, and sustainable management of freshwater.

“This year the Trust will have been supporting New Zealanders to study inspiring topics for fifty years, giving them an opportunity to become leaders in their chosen fields of study.”

Today’s awards were hosted at Government House by Official Secretary Mr Greg Baughen on behalf of trust patron, His Excellency, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, Governor-General of New Zealand.
