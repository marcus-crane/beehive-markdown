The initialling of the deed of settlement for Taranaki Iwi yesterday heralds an important milestone in the reconciliation journey between the tribe and the Crown.

The redress for the raupatu treaty claim includes an agreed historical account of the land confiscations, Crown acknowledgement and apology, $70-milion of financial redress and the return of 29 sites of cultural significance.

“This is a significant step for Taranaki tūturu, it goes some way to salving the deep wounds carried by several generations following the land confiscations, murder and imprisonment of their tūpuna.

“It is a particularly painful chapter in our story as a nation and it has taken considerable courage to get the settlement to this point,” says Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

The deed will now go out to members of Taranaki Iwi for ratification.

Redress for Parihaka is not included in the deed of settlement however the deed does establish Kawe Tūtaki (the Parihaka Working Group) which will make recommendations on how the Crown can support the whānau of Parihaka to achieve their aspirations.

The working group which is chaired by former Māori Party Co-leader Tariana Turia will submit a report to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Māori Development later this month.

“Along with Hon Chris Finlayson, I look forward to receiving the recommendations from Kawe Tūtaki,” says Mr Flavell.
