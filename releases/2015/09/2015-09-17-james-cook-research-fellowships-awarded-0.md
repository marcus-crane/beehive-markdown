Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced the recipients of this year’s James Cook Research Fellowships, which are awarded to researchers recognised for leadership and sustained excellence in their field.

The four 2015 Fellows will each receive up to $200,000 over two years to undertake fulltime research.

“The James Cook Research Fellowships are highly sought after by our more experienced researchers,” Mr Joyce says. “They are intended to advance scientific and technological knowledge, and to enhance the international reputation of New Zealand researchers.

“Excellent research provides a platform for innovation and economic growth. This year’s Fellows have the potential to produce outstanding research that will bring real benefits to New Zealand.”

The new Fellows are:

- Biological Sciences – Professor Marti Anderson, Massey University, for research entitled: “New multivariate statistical models of ecological communities: estimation, power and prediction.”
- Social Sciences – Professor Jennifer Hay, University of Canterbury, for research entitled: “How experience shapes words and words shape grammar.”
- Health Sciences – Professor Antony Braithwaite, University of Otago, for research entitled: “A strategy for targeting the cancer-associated protein YB-1 as a novel cancer therapy.”
- Engineering Sciences and Technologies – Professor Geoff Chase, University of Canterbury, for research entitled: “The (unknown) role of arterial mechanics in sepsis and shock (TRAMS).”

James Cook Fellowships are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

Final decisions are made by the James Cook Research Fellowship Selection Committee and informed by independent assessment panels.
