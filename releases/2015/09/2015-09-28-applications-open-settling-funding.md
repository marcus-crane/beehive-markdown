Not-for-profit organisations working directly with refugees and recent migrants can apply for Settling In funding from today, Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced.

The Settling In fund is a contestable funding round administered by the Office of Ethnic Communities to help local communities support the successful integration and participation of people from refugee and migrant backgrounds. 

“Our government recognises the value of New Zealand’s cultural diversity. It is committed to providing the capability and capacity-building support to enable our migrant and refugee communities to successfully settle here,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“It is important that we support our community organisations to identify settlement challenges and determine the best solutions at a grassroots level.”

The Office of Ethnic Communities works with public, private, non-governmental organisations and ethnic communities to develop integrated, resilient communities that recognise the social, cultural and economic advantages of a diverse nation.

Applications for Settling In funding are welcome until 30 October from New Zealand based not-for-profit organisations.
