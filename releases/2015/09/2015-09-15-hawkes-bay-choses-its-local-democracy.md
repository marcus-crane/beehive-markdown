Hawke’s Bay residents’ decision to keep their current local government structures shows the value of letting communities decide, Local Government Minister Paula Bennett says.

It was announced today that voters in the Hawke’s Bay have chosen not to amalgamate the Napier, Hastings, Wairoa, Central Hawke’s Bay and Hawke’s Bay regional councils.

“I have consistently said that it is up for communities to decide what they want local democracy to look like in their towns and cities,” Mrs Bennett says.

“No matter what the structure is, New Zealanders’ expectations of local government are quite clear. They want their local leaders to focus on promoting strong regional growth, spending ratepayers’ money wisely, and provide outstanding customer service.

“This has been a hard fought campaign by those both in favour and against amalgamation, and I hope the region comes together to focus on creating more growth and opportunities.”
