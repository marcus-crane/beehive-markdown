Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says following the 8.3 earthquake in Chile, it’s important people listen to national warnings issued in New Zealand by the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM).

“In these situations, a national tsunami panel, which includes a team of experts, advises MCDEM on any potential threat to New Zealand.

“In the last couple of hours there have been several meetings of the panel, and a tsunami warning marine and beach threat has been issued for East Cape, Chatham Islands, Coromandel and Banks Peninsula.”

People in these areas should follow this advice:

1. Stay out of the water (sea, rivers and estuaries, including boating activities)
2. Stay off beaches and shore areas
3. Do not go sightseeing
4. Share this information with family, neighbours and friends
5. Listen to the radio and/or TV for updates
6. Follow instructions of local civil defence authorities.

“It’s important people follow messages issued by MCDEM and not overseas warning centres, as MCDEM provide official warnings and information for New Zealand.

“You can keep up to date via the radio and TV, or by going to [www.civildefence.govt.nz](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz).

“The National Crisis Management Centre in Wellington has been activated to monitor this situation, and I’m receiving regular briefings.

“The tsunami warning remains in place until a cancellation message is issued by MCDEM.

“As reports come through of the potential impact of the earthquake in Chile, our thoughts are with everyone affected.”
