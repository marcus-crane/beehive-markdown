Prime Minister John Key will join an expected 160 other leaders from around the world at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.

Participation by world leaders and heads of state during Leaders’ Week is expected to be higher this year than usual due to the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and the fact it marks the 70th anniversary of the UN.

“This will be my first trip to the UN since New Zealand’s election to the UN Security Council and the presence of so many world leaders will provide an opportunity to discuss with them New Zealand’s Security Council priorities as well as other issues including the TPP negotiations,” Mr Key says.

The Prime Minister will attend the opening of the 70th General Assembly on September 28th and deliver New Zealand’s statement in the general debate on 1 October.

He will also attend President Obama’s leaders’ summit on countering ISIL and violent extremism.

“ISIL is a global threat and requires an international response,” Mr Key says.

“New Zealand is already playing its part in the fight against the terror-group and this will provide the opportunity to participate in further discussions on the ongoing conflict.”

While in New York Mr Key will hold a number of formal and informal meetings at the UN, as well as with the New York business community, including delivering a speech to the Asia Society.

He will also attend events to promote New Zealand business and tourism links.
