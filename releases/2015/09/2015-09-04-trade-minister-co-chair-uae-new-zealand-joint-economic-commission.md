Trade Minister Tim Groser departs Saturday 5 September for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, with meetings planned to strengthen the wider trade and economic relationship in both countries and to promote the finalisation of a free trade agreement with the Gulf states.

A key feature of the visit will see Mr Groser co-chair the fifth meeting of the UAE-New Zealand Joint Economic Commission in Abu Dhabi alongside Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri, UAE Minister of Economy.

“New Zealand has a deepening trade and economic relationship with the UAE, which is now our largest trading partner in the Gulf,” says Mr Groser.

“The Joint Economic Commission meeting provides a useful opportunity to take stock of this relationship and to look at further areas where we might expand these linkages.

“I will also be discussing how best to progress the GCC-New Zealand FTA, an issue on which the UAE has been a strong supporter, as well as how we can build further successful government-to-government partnerships in the UAE.

“In Qatar, I will engage with key Qatari leaders in promoting partnership projects on food safety and road safety, and the Air Services Agreement that has been concluded with Qatar.”
