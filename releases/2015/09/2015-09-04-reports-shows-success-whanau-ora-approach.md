An analysis of research and monitoring results from the first four years of Whanau Ora (2010-2014) indicates positive gains for whānau when their needs are placed at the centre of service delivery.

The results are captured in a report, ‘*Understanding whānau-centred approaches’*, to be released next week.

The report shows that placing the needs of families at the centre of service delivery is successful in achieving both immediate and long-term change for whānau. This includes whānau previously considered to be hard to reach.

The research shows that conventional service delivery may be hard to reach, rather than whānau themselves.

The report examines the range of ways whānau-centred approaches were implemented across Whānau Ora collectives; the main barriers and enablers to these approaches; the impacts on whānau and the implications for Whānau Ora as a wider social sector approach.

The research has been peer reviewed by Professor Emeritus Sir Mason Durie, senior researcher Dr Fiona Cram and the Ministry for Social Development Social Policy Evaluation Research Unit.
