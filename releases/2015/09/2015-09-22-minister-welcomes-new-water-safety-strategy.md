Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has welcomed the launch of the New Zealand Water Safety Sector Strategy 2020.

“While the number of drownings has tracked downwards over recent years, we had a bad start to 2015. As at 30 June there have been 62 drownings, compared to 45 last year,” says Dr Coleman.

“Sadly drownings are largely preventable. Although the rates have declined, this summer was a strong reminder that there is still plenty of work to do educating Kiwis about water safety.

“The strategy sets out the water safety sector’s plan to work collectively over the next five years to achieve greater impact on reducing the drowning toll.

“The document represents a significant milestone, as it’s the first time all water safety organisations have united to take practical and collective action on this issue.

“A key focus for the sector will be working together to deliver the social and cultural changes that will result in New Zealanders being safer in the water.”

The strategy has been developed collectively by Water Safety New Zealand, ACC, Coastguard Boating Education, Coastguard New Zealand, Maritime New Zealand, New Zealand Recreation Association, Surf Life Saving New Zealand, Swimming New Zealand and WaterSafe Auckland.
