Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee leaves today for an official visit to China.

“The New Zealand – China defence relationship has grown in recent years, and I look forward to engaging with representatives of the Chinese military on how that might continue,” Mr Brownlee says.

“I also look forward to gaining a greater understanding of China’s views on a number of regional and global issues.”

Mr Brownlee will visit Beijing, where he will give a speech to the National Defence University, and pay a call on General Fan Changlong, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

He will also meet General Chang Wanquan, Minister of National Defence, before travelling to Chengdu, and the Chengdu Military District, where he will meet with commanders and visit a military base.

In addition, he will meet the Governor of Sichuan province, and visit a memorial park which commemorates the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.
