Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated UNESCO on making a difference to lives both locally and internationally at an event at Parliament this evening marking 70 years since its establishment.

“UNESCO’s aim to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science and culture is one that all Kiwis can and do aspire to,” says Ms Parata.

“New Zealand lived up to its reputation for forward-thinking when it became the second nation to sign UNESCO’s constitution and confirm its commitment to build peace through dialogue.

“Young people are a focus of UNESCO’s work whether it is supporting the development of educational resources for New Zealand communities, fostering the expertise of teachers in the Pacific, or encouraging youth leadership further afield.

“Education plays a key role in UNESCO’s mandate, as demonstrated in the Beeby Fellowship. It is awarded in partnership with the New Zealand Council for Educational Research so teachers and researchers can develop innovative resources.

“I congratulate UNESCO on the work it has done in education over the past 70 years for young people in New Zealand and around the world. Access to quality education is a fundamental human right and the passport to a brighter future.”
