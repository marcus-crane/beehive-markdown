Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, has announced the appointments of three new members to the Waitangi Tribunal.

Dr Hauata Palmer, Derek Lardelli and Bill Wilson QC will join the Tribunal along with 13 other members who have also been reappointed.

“I am confident the new members will work well with the reappointed members as they continue their work across the motu and will give continuity to the high calibre work of the Tribunal.”

In addition, Minister Flavell said he was pleased to confirm the reappointment of Chief Judge Wilson Isaac as the Chairperson of the Tribunal.

“Chief Judge Isaac has been at the helm since 2009, and has provided invaluable leadership to the Waitangi Tribunal. His ability to maintain confidence with key groups involved in the Tribunal process and his extensive knowledge acquired as Chairperson is respected and important to the claims hearings,” Mr Flavell said.

Ērima Hēnare was also acknowledged for his commitment to the Waitangi Tribunal following his passing earlier this year. Mr Hēnare was appointed to the panel in 2014 and brought a depth of skill to his role says the Minister.

“Ērima was an acknowledged authority on traditional and modern history – both Māori and non-Māori – and held a number of public, advisory and educational sector posts. His contribution was greatly valued.”
