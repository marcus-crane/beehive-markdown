More vulnerable New Zealanders will be able to access emergency housing when they need it, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Government will invest $2 million in non-government organisations (NGOs) in Auckland for a short-term emergency housing response to help address the shortage of emergency housing places.

“Emergency housing is for people who urgently need somewhere to stay, and the sooner we get people housed the sooner we can work to move them into stable, long-term housing and address other needs they may have like employment or education,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The Ministry of Social Development has 99 places registered on its Auckland emergency housing database, but very few vacancies at any time.

“While this announcement will provide extra support to some of those most in need, further announcements about long-term solutions including responses to the needs of other towns and cities will be made in the next few months.”

Today’s announcement builds on a $500,000 cash injection for emergency housing providers and a wider review of the sector that was announced by Mrs Bennett in January 2015. As part of the review, the Government has been working closely with NGOs and councils.

The short-term response in Auckland is based on the Government-funded emergency housing service in Christchurch which saw two NGOs contracted to provide short-term housing.

Run by specialist providers, up to an extra 120 emergency housing places a year will be available for families and individuals. They will be provided support to move into sustainable, independent housing.

The $2 million will be available for contributions towards the capital cost of refurbishing existing properties or new builds if required, as well as for ongoing operational costs like accommodation and providing wraparound support services.

The Auckland short-term response will be implemented in partnership with Auckland Council which has set aside $250,000 in each of the next two years for emergency housing providers.
