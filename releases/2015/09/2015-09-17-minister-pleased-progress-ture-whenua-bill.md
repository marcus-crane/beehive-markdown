Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, says officials and the Ture Whenua Advisory Group are progressing well with fine-tuning the draft of the Ture Whenua Māori Bill.

“This reform is the most significant review since Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 so it’s critical that we get it right.

“Consultation on this complex law started in 2013 and we received almost 400 written submissions from stakeholders and Māori land owners following the release of an exposure draft of the Bill earlier this year”, he says.

Mr Flavell says there is a lot of misinformation emanating from some quarters “which is largely politically motivated”.

“Māori land owners are the drivers behind this Bill and I am absolutely committed to ensuring that their desire for greater control over Māori-owned land is achieved while ensuring it is protected.

“At the core of this Bill is the ability for Māori land owners to make decisions easier and faster about their own land so they can fulfil their aspirations and those of their whānau”, says Mr Flavell.

There have been almost 200 laws and amendments concerning Māori land over the past 150 years and this is the first comprehensive reform after years of tinkering.

“The Ture Whenua Advisory Group and officials are working carefully through the wide range of feedback received on this important piece of legislation. They will continue to meet with stakeholders to test this Bill before it is introduced in to the House next year.”
