Revenue Minister Todd McClay says Labour finance spokesman Grant Roberson is trying to have his cake and everyone else's too over his position on fair property taxation legislation currently before parliament.

The objective of the Bright-line Bill, which is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee, is to improve compliance with the current land sales rules in the Income Tax Act.

The current land sales rules can be difficult to enforce, particularly when they are based on a person’s ‘intent’ to make a capital gain on a property transaction.

“Mr Roberson's protests are hollow as Labour has been most vociferous about property speculation, particularly in the Auckland market, but has offered up little in the way of a solution beyond having a swipe at foreign investors.

“They know it is good tax policy and should be supporting it if they want any credibility as a party interested in fairness,” says Mr McClay.

The main feature of the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill is a proposed new “bright-line” test, which will require income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property purchased and sold within two years, with some exceptions.  The exceptions include the sale of an owner’s main home, inherited property, or the transfer of property in a relationship settlement.

“We are committed to ensuring fairness in the tax system and everyone pays their fair share of tax.

The Bright-line test in one of a suite of initiatives aimed to calm the Auckland property market, which include;

- Requiring all non-residents, and New Zealanders buying and selling any property other than their main home, to provide a New Zealand IRD number as part of the usual land transfer process with Land Information New Zealand.
- In addition, all non-resident buyers and sellers must provide their tax identification number from their home country, along with current identification requirements such as a passport.
- to ensure that our full anti-money laundering rules apply to non-residents before they buy a property, non-residents must have a New Zealand bank account before they can get a New Zealand IRD number.
- A withholding tax to help ensure overseas property speculators meet both existing tax requirements and those of the new test is proposed for 2016.

“We have also provided $29 million of extra funding to Inland Revenue to specifically target property speculation.

“This will take Inland Revenue’s total budget for work in this area over the next five years to $62 million. In return this is expected to generate around $420 million of additional tax over the next five years,” says Mr McClay.
