On the fifth anniversary of the first major earthquake to hit Christchurch, Education Minister Hekia Parata has paid tribute to the work of everyone involved in education in greater Christchurch.

“The huge progress since the 4 September 2010 earthquake is a testament to the spirit, determination, hard work and commitment of everyone concerned,” says Ms Parata who is in Christchurch today.

“No one could have imagined the impact of the earthquakes that began five years ago today. I’m enormously proud of the way schools, communities, parents and students have stuck together in the face of such disruption and trauma. And the stalwart resilience they have continued to show. Nga mihi."

Ms Parata says it’s particularly heartening that student achievement has continued to rise despite all the challenges and difficulties.

“I want to thank teachers, principals, boards of trustees, early childhood education staff, parents and whānau for all that they’ve done to make sure that the learning of our young people has remained at the forefront.

The Government is investing $1.137 billion in rebuilding, repairing or remodelling 115 schools. Already two new schools have opened at Pegasus Bay and Halswell and construction of nine others is underway.  In addition the five new schools created from the merger of 11 schools have emerged with refreshed identities and the three secondary schools which had their year levels extended are now catering for Year 7 and 8 pupils.

“By the end of this work, the vast majority of teaching spaces will be modern environments that support the very best in teaching and learning.

“From tough times, a stronger education community is emerging to improve the learning and outcomes for all young people.”
