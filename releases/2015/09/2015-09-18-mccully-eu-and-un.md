Foreign Minister Murray McCully departs tomorrow for Brussels, and the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

“The EU is New Zealand’s 3rd largest trading partner with two-way trade totalling more than $19.5 billion,” Mr McCully says.

“While in Brussels I will meet with senior EU representatives, to discuss New Zealand’s aspirations for a free trade agreement with the EU, the refugee crisis which is currently facing the region, and our joint partnership for Pacific development.

“In New York I will represent New Zealand at the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers meeting, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group meeting and the UN Sustainable Development Summit, as well as supporting New Zealand’s participation in the United Nations General Assembly,” Mr McCully says.

En-route to Brussels Minister McCully will take part in activities to support New Zealand’s Rugby World Cup campaign in London and attend the All Blacks versus Argentina match in his capacity as Associate Minister of Sport.
