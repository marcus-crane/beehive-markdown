The Minister of Trade Tim Groser says the signing of an open skies air services agreement with Qatar will provide improved air links between our two countries and the wider countries of the Gulf.

The Minister signed the agreement for New Zealand today during his visit to Qatar.

“Qatar is at the centre of one the world’s most dynamic regions for international air travel.  The opportunity now exists for Qatar Airways to serve New Zealand and this would be a welcome development,” says Mr Groser.

“Doha serves as a growing hub through which visitors from many regions have the potential to travel to New Zealand, and through which New Zealanders can access the wider Middle East, Europe and Africa.

“An air services agreement with Qatar strengthens New Zealand’s international connectivity and can help build upon the record 3 million visitors that came to New Zealand in the past year,” says Mr Groser.
