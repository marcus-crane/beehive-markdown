Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says a proposed new museum, hosting the Ravenscar Collections of art, sculpture and antiquities will bring visitors to Christchurch city.

“The Ravenscar House Museum is a welcome new development for Christchurch. This significant collection of New Zealand art will be housed in Christchurch’s Cultural Precinct and will attract visitors to the city,” Ms Wagner says.

“I would like to welcome and acknowledge the generosity of Jim and Dr Susan Wakefield. Their proposal to build a house museum and exhibit their collection is a gift that will benefit future generations of Cantabrians and New Zealanders.

“The collection, which includes notable works by Colin McCahon, Rita Angus and Charles Frederick Goldie, will complement Christchurch’s arts scene, including the Christchurch Art Gallery, the Centre of Contemporary Art, Canterbury Museum and the upcoming Ōtākaro Avon River Art Trail.

“The new house museum will enhance Christchurch’s reputation as a destination for the arts,” Ms Wagner says.
