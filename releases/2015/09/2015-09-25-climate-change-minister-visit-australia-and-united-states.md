Trade Minister Tim Groser will travel to Australia and the United States important talks on international climate change and regional trade agreements.

Mr Groser will first meet Australian Environment Minister Greg Hunt in Melbourne today to discuss domestic climate policies following Malcolm Turnbull’s appointment as Prime Minister and his Cabinet re-shuffle.

He will then travel to the USA to take part in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in New York, where the world’s 17 largest economies discuss international negotiations for a new climate change agreement.  New Zealand is regularly invited to the Forum as a special guest.

“While New Zealand is not one of the major economies, our ideas and contributions to the negotiations are highly valued,” says Mr Groser.

“These Ministerial meetings are particularly important ahead of the Paris climate conference in December, as they will have a significant influence on the shape of the final outcome.

New Zealand will also participate in a meeting of Trans Pacific Partnership chief negotiators starting on 26 September in Atlanta.

Should negotiators make sufficient progress resolving outstanding issues, including dairy market access, to warrant ministerial engagement, Mr Groser intends to travel to Atlanta to meet other trade ministers.
