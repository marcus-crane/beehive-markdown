Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges has reappointed Dr Brent Layton as chair of the Electricity Authority and Susan Paterson and Elena Trout as members.

The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity established in November 2010 to replace the former Electricity Commission. 

It is responsible for governance and regulation of the electricity market and its objective is to promote competition, reliable supply, and the efficient operation of the electricity sector for the long term benefit of consumers.

Mr Bridges says the reappointments, each for five years, retain valuable governance experience and leadership within the Authority. 

“All three members have been on the Authority since its establishment in 2010.  Under their stewardship the electricity market has become well-functioning and more competitive, ensuring a secure supply of electricity to businesses and households.”

Mr Bridges says the Authority is in the midst of a substantial work programme, much of it still related to the outcomes of the 2009 Ministerial Review of Electricity Market Performance, as well as associated amendments to the Electricity industry Participation Code 2010. 

“Stability in the governance and leadership of the Authority at this time will avoid disruption to this work programme,” he says.

There are five members of the Authority, the other two being David Bull and Hon Roger Sowry.
