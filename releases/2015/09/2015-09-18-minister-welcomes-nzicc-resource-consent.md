Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today welcomed the decision by Auckland  Council to grant a resource consent for the New Zealand International Convention Centre (NZICC).

“This is another important milestone for the building of the International Convention Centre," Mr Joyce says. "The decision means that SkyCity can now prepare to commence construction on what will be a very impressive new facility for Auckland and New Zealand.

“The NZICC will drive a significant increase in tourism expenditure in the city and around New Zealand through the estimated 33,000 additional convention delegates and $90 million annual increase in delegate expenditure that it is expected to bring each year.

“It will create an estimated 1000 jobs during construction, 800 permanent new jobs, and an increase in GDP of $49 million per annum. It will ensure that New Zealand is able to compete effectively with Australia and Asia to attract high-value business visitors from across the Asia-Pacific region.

"Importantly, it will be completed without a direct financial contribution from government or taxpayers."

SkyCity will invest at least $430 million in the NZICC, and says it could spend in the range of $450 million to $470 million.
