Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming the multi-agency approach to increasing safety for visitors on our roads after meetings with mayors and other members of the Visiting Drivers project group.

“Meeting with the project group was a good opportunity to hear first-hand about the initiatives that are already underway, as well as those planned for the upcoming summer season,” Mr Foss says.

“Local and regional councils are joining with central government agencies, tourism and rental vehicle organisations and associations. They recognise that there is no single solution but by working together, much can be achieved.

The meeting with the working group follows a visit Minister Foss had last Friday to Queenstown where he discussed with Mayor Vanessa van Uden visiting driver initiatives in that region.

More information about New Zealand road rules and conditions is now available than ever before. Visitors have access to information when they are researching and planning their trip to New Zealand, in-flight, at rental vehicle and accommodation providers, and when here on our roads.

The NZ Transport Agency, along with local councils, is continuing to improve road infrastructure and signage.

“Additional ‘tourist direction arrows’ have been painted on approximately 750 km in the Otago region. This is on top of the additional arrows painted on 200 km of the network that I announced in March,” Mr Foss says.

Other road and roadside improvements planned are 15 courtesy signs installed throughout Otago and Southland to encourage slower drivers to let traffic pass. More signs for rest stops and pull over areas, safety barriers, guardrails and rumble strips will also be installed throughout summer.
