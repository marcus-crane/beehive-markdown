Land Information Minister Louise Upston has welcomed today’s passing of the Reserves and Other Land Disposal (ROLD) Bill in Parliament.

ROLD Bills make non-controversial changes to land status such as Crown land, reserves and land held for public or private purposes. In essence this legislation works to tidying up small issues that do not warrant their own legislation.

“This particular Bill deals with a number of iconic New Zealand locations including the Dunedin Octagon, Mahinepua Bay reserve, Taieri Airport, and more,” Ms Upston says.

“It has wide-ranging community interests at its heart, and has been long-awaited by many people throughout the country.

“As such, the passing of the Bill today will be welcomed by community groups and individuals up and down the country as it gives recognition to their rights to use the specified land.”
