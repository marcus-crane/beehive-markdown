A year on from the General Election, the National-led Government is delivering on its commitment to help all New Zealanders get ahead, says Prime Minister John Key.

“Our careful management of the books has meant we’ve been able to introduce new policies to support New Zealand families,” says Mr Key.

“We have extended free doctor’s visits and prescriptions to children aged under 13, extended paid parental leave, reduced ACC levies and we’re increasing benefit payments. 

“We are helping young New Zealanders into their first home through our HomeStart programme, and by working with local councils to free up more land faster through Housing Accords.

“We are continuing to invest heavily in health and education. Kids are staying in school longer and leaving with higher qualifications, while in health we are delivering more elective operations and spending more on hospice and palliative care.

“Families are also being helped by an economy which is continuing to grow. There were over 49,000 new jobs created in the nine months to June 2015 and the average wage is up $1500.  The services sector – which includes tourism – has seen 35 months of straight growth.

“We are continuing to back New Zealand businesses by rolling out ultra-fast broadband, investing in infrastructure and in research and development, and negotiating free trade deals, such as the TPP.

“We remain firmly focused on rebuilding Christchurch.  We’ve completed the first of the anchor projects, 75 per cent of key infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, has been repaired, and we are making good progress on the red zone properties.

“Like all New Zealanders, we have a shared interest in building a strong economy that provides opportunities for Kiwi families and businesses to get ahead here in their own country.”
