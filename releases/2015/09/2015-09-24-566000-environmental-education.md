Efforts to inspire young people to get involved with protecting New Zealand’s natural world will benefit from $566,000 of funding announced today, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

“Six significant environmental education projects will receive the money from the Community Conservation Partnerships Fund,” Ms Barry says.

“It is vital for the future of conservation in this country that we’re able to support organisations that are doing great work and encourage the next generation to enjoy, value and protect our natural world.”

The money will enable the expansion of several successful education and outreach programmes, as well as the beginning of new ones. Networking between different groups involved will also be supported.

“Involving children from an early age in conservation is an investment in lifelong awareness of our unique environment,” Ms Barry says. “Contact with nature inspires creativity, lifts achievement and can deliver tangible benefits for young people and their communities.”

The six groups receiving CCPF funding are:

**Kids Greening Taupō** - $65,000 to involve children in the wider Greening Taupō urban restoration project.

**Fiordland Conservation Trust** - $66,066 for Kids Restore The Kepler, a programme which encourages youth involvement in conservation around the Kepler Track and Te Anau.

**Mountains to Sea Conservation Trust** - $240,000 for a national programme to raise awareness of marine and freshwater management issues.

**Kelly Tarlton’s Marine Wildlife Trust** - $100,000 to expand the reach of its mobile marine education programme targeting low-decile and special needs schools.

**Wellington Marine Conservation Trust** - $75,000 to increase the number of schools able to access its education programmes.

**New Zealand Association of Environmental Education** - $20,000 for a conference bringing together local government, community groups, schools, non-government organisations and young people promoting environmental education.
