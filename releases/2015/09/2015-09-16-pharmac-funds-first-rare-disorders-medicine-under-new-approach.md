Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes Pharmac’s decision to fund Icatibant, the first rare disorders medicine funded as a result of its new approach for rare disorders medicines.

Pharmac identified up to $25 million over five years for funding a rare disorders contestable pilot. 28 proposals from eight suppliers emerged from Pharmac’s request for proposals from suppliers.

“It is great to see the first rare disorders medicine being funding as a result of Pharmac’s new process to enhance access to rare disorders medicines,” says Dr Coleman.

“Pharmac’s decision to fund Icatibant, a treatment for the rare blood disorder hereditary angioedema, will mean that patients can get treatment closer to home as the medicine can be self-administered.

“Currently people with the condition have to go to hospital if they have a swelling attack. With an injection they can take themselves, sufferers of this disorder will be able to live a more normal life. Around 25 patients are likely to meet the access criteria for Icatibant.

“Providing access to medicines for very small groups of patients is a shared responsibility. It is encouraging that so many suppliers have engaged with Phamac to develop new funding options.

“I look forward to more negotiations being concluded by Pharmac over the next few months so that New Zealanders can gain benefits from these medicines.”
