Veterans will soon find it easier to claim their recreational travel concession, Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says.

From December 7, eligible veterans can claim up to $200 per year for travel costs by filling out a statutory declaration, rather than keeping track of numerous receipts.

“This change, part of the new Veterans’ Independence Programme, is about making it easier for those who’ve served our country to access the support they need,” Mr Foss says.

Receipts will still be required for travel by public transport, air, or for claims of more than $200 per year.

“It’s important to note there is no change to eligibility — veterans who currently receive this support will continue to do so,” Mr Foss says.
