Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced three new appointments to the Library and Information Advisory Commission (LIAC).

“I am pleased to announce that I am appointing Brian Morris, Dr Judith Johnston and David Reeves for three-year terms. I believe their wealth of experience will be of great benefit to LIAC”, said Mr Dunne.

“I am also reappointing Carolyn Robertson and Helen Tait for further three-year terms. I am appreciative of the strong contribution these members have already brought to LIAC”.

“I have promoted Sharon Dell to the role of Chair. I am grateful for her willingness to step into this role.”

“LIAC’s role is to advise me on the latest developments and opportunities within the library and information sector. I consider that it remains well placed to handle the challenges ahead.”

Mr Dunne thanked the outgoing members Don Hunn, Haneta Pierce and Brian Flaherty for their expertise and contribution.
