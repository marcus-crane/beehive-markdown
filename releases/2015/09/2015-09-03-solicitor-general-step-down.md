Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson QC has thanked Solicitor-General Michael Heron QC for three years of outstanding service to the Crown, following Mr Heron’s decision to step down from the role.

“When Mr Heron was appointed Solicitor-General in 2012, he indicated he would serve at least three years in the role,” Mr Finlayson said. “His family has remained in Auckland and he has decided it is time to return home. He has agreed to stay on until a successor is appointed.”

“During his three years in office Mr Heron has overseen significant reform of the Crown Law Office, the Crown prosecutions system and the Government Legal Network. He leaves Crown Law in a very strong position,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Solicitor-General is both Junior Law Officer of the Crown and Chief Executive of the Crown Law Office. The State Services Commission will now manage the appointment process for a new Solicitor-General.
