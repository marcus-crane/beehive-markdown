Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is pleased to announce the outcome of the Community Development Scheme funding round for 2015/16.

“Twelve communities throughout New Zealand will receive $80,000 each year for three years from the Scheme for their community projects,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Each of these communities are facing different challenges they want to overcome for their local population.

“Many of the projects are in isolated or rural areas, where social cohesion and access to community services is a key concern, others have wider project outcomes such as community revitalisation.”

“Each community has diverse aspirations they want to achieve through this scheme. I am looking forward to hearing about their achievements over the following three years.”

A wide variety of community-specific projects are planned, supporting very individualised needs. See attachment for the full list and details.
