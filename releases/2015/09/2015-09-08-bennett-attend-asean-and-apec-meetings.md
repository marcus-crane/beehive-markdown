Associate Finance Minister Paula Bennett leaves today to visit Indonesia and the Philippines for a range of meetings promoting strong regional ties in Asia and the Pacific.

In Indonesia, the Minister will be guest of honour at the NZ-ASEAN 40th Anniversary Awards event where she will present awards to seven Indonesians who have significantly contributed to deepening New Zealand’s relationship with Indonesia and the ASEAN region. 

“Indonesia is an important political, trade and economic partner for New Zealand. It is our 13th-largest trading partner, with total goods trade exceeding NZD$1.7 billion annually,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We have co-operated on a range of bilateral, regional and global issues not only in trade and economic areas, but also in defence and security, environment, education, and tourism.

“The visit will reaffirm New Zealand's long-standing and friendly relationship with Indonesia and I am looking forward to exchanging views on regional economic developments.”

Minister Bennett will also attend the APEC Finance Minister’s meeting in Cebu, Philippines from 10 -11 September.

“This will be an opportunity to talk to my counterparts about the most pressing economic and financial issues facing countries in the region, and to share New Zealand’s approach towards these matters,” Mrs Bennett says.

This year Ministers will launch the Cebu Action Plan, which provides a Roadmap towards a more Financially Integrated, Transparent and Resilient, APEC Community.

While in Indonesia, Minister Bennett will also officially open Fonterra’s new packing and blending plant in Cikarang, West Java, the company’s largest investment in ASEAN in a decade.
