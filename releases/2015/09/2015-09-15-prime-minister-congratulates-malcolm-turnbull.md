Prime Minister John Key has today congratulated Malcolm Turnbull on winning the leadership of the Australian Liberal Party and has acknowledged outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

"I will call Mr Turnbull today to offer my congratulations," says Mr Key.

“Australia remains New Zealand’s closest bilateral partner. We enjoy close ties in all areas of our relationship, including in the trade, economic, defence and sporting areas, and I am looking forward to working with Mr Turnbull to advance that.

"I would also like to acknowledge the positive relationship I have had with Tony Abbott. He has been a good friend to New Zealand. He has visited twice this year and our discussions have always been productive.

"I am confident that the close relationship between New Zealand and Australia will continue under Mr Turnbull’s leadership."
