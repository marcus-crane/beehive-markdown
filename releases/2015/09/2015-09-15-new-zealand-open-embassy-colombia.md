Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that the Government intends to open a new Embassy in Bogota, Colombia.

“Colombia is an increasingly important partner for New Zealand, as it is strategically at the top of South America and has one of the strongest performing economies in the region,” Mr McCully says.

“With a population of over 46 million and solid growth there are numerous opportunities for New Zealand businesses in Colombia, particularly in areas such as education and investment.

“Having a dedicated New Zealand presence on the ground in Bogota will help to support the development of strong business links, particularly investment in Colombia’s agri-business and dairy sectors.

“The Embassy will also serve as a base for a New Zealand agencies with interests in Colombia, such as NZTE and Education New Zealand.

“The decision to open an Embassy reflects the Government’s desire to deepen New Zealand’s relationship with Latin American partners, particularly as Colombia is a key member of the Pacific Alliance, along with Chile, Mexico and Peru.

“The new Embassy aligns well with the Government’s Business Growth Agenda commitment to broaden our market base, particularly through the Asia-Pacific region.  We have a clear plan to strengthen our relationships in South America and South East Asia in particular, to benefit our exporters and trade generally,” Mr McCully says.

The Embassy will be New Zealand’s fifth post in Latin America and will be established in 2016.
