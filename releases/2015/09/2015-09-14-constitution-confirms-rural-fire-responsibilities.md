Associate Minister of Local Government Louise Upston has today announced the signing of the Pumicelands Constitution, confirming rural fire authority responsibilities for a number of offshore islands in the Bay of Plenty.

“Offshore islands that will now be administered by the Pumicelands Rural Fire Authority (RFA) include the Tūhua/Mayor and Motiti islands, as well as the Whakaari/White and Moutohorā islands,” Ms Upston said.

“The Pumicelands Constitution document will guide the governance and operation of the RFA, and includes rules on how the zone operations groups should work.”

Under the Local Government Act 2002, the Minister of Local Government is the territorial authority for offshore islands in the Bay that are not part of a local authority’s district. This responsibility, which includes managing rural fire, was delegated to the Associate Minister of Local Government in October 2014.

“Rural Fire responsibilities include delivering rural fire services, undertaking research and training, and management.

“The White and Moutohorā islands, for instance, are often visited by tourists and researchers. Motiti has a resident population and Tūhua is also regularly visited and is a Department of Conservation bird sanctuary. Providing effective rural fire services to these islands is important for ensuring safety,” Ms Upston said. 

**Notes:**

Since 2003, two offshore islands were administered on the Minister’s behalf by the Western Bay Moana Rural Fire Authority (WBM-RFA), comprising Western Bay of Plenty District Council, Tauranga City Council, the Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Department of Internal Affairs.

In July 2015, the rural fire districts for the central North Island, including that administered by the WBM-RFA, were amalgamated by Gazette Notice into an enlarged rural fire district, called the Pumicelands RFA. This is in line with the National Rural Fire Authority’s objective to amalgamate and reduce the number of RFAs in New Zealand, which the Government endorses.

The Pumicelands RFA includes a further two offshore islands.
