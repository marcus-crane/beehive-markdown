Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a new inland container terminal in Whanganui will help boost regional growth by improving transport connections for importers and exporters.

Mr Bridges officially opened the Direct Connect Container Services terminal today.

“Today’s opening is the successful result of a partnership between public and private companies, with the collaboration of Government-owned KiwiRail also.

“It’s a real regional success story, showcasing the importance of national and local businesses working together to support regional economies,” he says.

“The Government’s recent Manawatu-Whanganui Growth Study identified key areas of opportunity that would benefit from better transport connections.

“We’ve responded by helping the region attract investment and grow jobs by supporting good freight logistics.”

Imported goods moved via the terminal include raw materials, packaging and machinery, while exports include meat, dairy, wood products and other finished goods.

Mr Bridges says Direct Connect Container Services is already creating jobs and investment in the region by boosting trade and transport infrastructure.

The terminal employs a 40-tonne container lifter provided by CentrePort.
