The Productivity Commission’s latest report on social services in New Zealand will be a valued input into the Government’s ongoing programme of public sector reform, Finance Minister Bill English and State Services Minister Paula Bennett say.

The Commission found there are significant opportunities to improve the support given to the most vulnerable New Zealanders.

“The Government agrees with the Commission’s analysis of the weakness in our current social delivery systems,” Mr English says.

“These issues are why the Government has an ongoing programme of social services reform which focuses on better understanding customers with complex needs and changing public services and accountability to improve their lives.

"The introduction of National Standards in schools, Health Targets, the Investment Approach in welfare, Better Public Service Results and more recently the Social Housing Reform Programme are all focused on getting better results from large scale social spending.”  

“We asked the Commission to undertake this review because we expect the public sector to continually do better in supporting the most vulnerable in our society,” Mrs Bennett says.

“It is clear that further, ongoing change is needed.

“These aren’t easy issues to deal with – so the Government will be carefully considering the Commission’s recommendations. But this report provides a useful road map to drive further improvement.”

The Government will respond formally to the Productivity Commission’s recommendations in due course.
