Eight new properties being opened today show the importance community organisations play in housing vulnerable New Zealanders, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Accessible Properties opening in Miramar today will see at least 16 people housed in eight brand new two-bedroom units. Four have been designed specifically for those with particular accessibility needs.  

“It’s great to open these new homes because they’re a good example of what modern, tenant-focused social housing looks like in New Zealand,” Mrs Bennett says.

The Miramar units are eight of 26 being built by Accessible Properties in the Wellington region with assistance from the Government’s Social Housing Fund. Nationwide, it has 147 completed units with 45 under development.

The Government currently subsidises just over 270 tenancies with Community Housing Providers, with this figure expected to grow substantially over the next few years. Just last week, three households were matched with a Community Housing Provider.

“Through the Government’s Social Housing Reform Programme, we are supporting community ownership and encouraging a more diverse supply of social housing that will house more people while they need it in properties that suit their needs,” says Mrs Bennett.
