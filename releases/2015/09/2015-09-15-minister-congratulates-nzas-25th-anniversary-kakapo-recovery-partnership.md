New Zealand Aluminium Smelter’s 25 years of partnership with DOC has helped to bring the kakapo back from the edge of extinction, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

“When NZAS joined with DOC and Forest & Bird there were only 49 kakapo left in the world. Now, a quarter of a century later, there are 125 and early indications point to a good upcoming breeding season,” Ms Barry says.

“NZAS has committed more than $4.5 million to Kakapo Recovery and its employees have put in more than 1100 days of volunteer work on the offshore islands where the kakapo live.”

During NZAS’ involvement New Zealand’s kakapo recovery efforts have become a world famous and world class conservation programme, a success epitomised by the global fame of Sirocco, DOC’s official Spokesbird.

“Kakapo still have many challenges to overcome. Bringing a species back from the brink of extinction is something all New Zealanders can be proud of, but the journey is not over yet,” Ms Barry says.

“I would like to thank NZAS for its 25 years of commitment to that journey. Together with DOC and Forest & Bird, it has played an integral role in kakapo conservation.”
