Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee says proposals are now being sought from design firms interested in being part of the development of Christchurch’s Metro Sports Facility.

Tenders have today been released on the Government Electronic Tenders Service (GETS) website seeking proposals for architectural design services and multi-disciplinary engineering design services for the key anchor project.

“After last month’s announcement with the Christchurch City Council confirming the funding parameters for the facility, including an increase in funding from the Crown, this is another important step towards creating a multi-generational asset for sport and leisure in Christchurch,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Together with the council, we have confirmed the components that will serve everyone from learners to elite competitors, and now we want to identify the best equipped design firms to work with to ensure we develop a top-class indoor facility.”

Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel says it is important that the design reflects the community’s desire for a high quality sports and recreation facility in the central city.

“The design has to encourage and motivate as many people as possible to keep physically active and engaged. We've never had a better opportunity to get this right,” Ms Dalziel says.

The agreed funding for the facility will include components such as an indoor aquatic hall with a 79 metre, 10-lane competition pool and seating for a minimum of 1000 spectators, various other pools, including hot pools and hydroslides, nine indoor courts for sports such as netball and basketball, and retractable seating for a minimum of 2500 spectators.

There will also be a dedicated base for High Performance Sport New Zealand, and spaces for fitness and other activities.

The Government has already purchased most of the land required to develop the facility on a central Christchurch site spanning over 70,000sqm between Moorhouse Avenue, Stewart Street, St Asaph Street and Antigua Street.

Responses to the Requests for Proposal published today are due by Friday, 30 October.  It is expected that the design work for the Metro Sports Facility will commence in the fourth quarter of this year.

The project team will work with sports stakeholders through the design process.

Further tenders around Early Contractor Involvement on design and construction are expected in the coming months.  The intention is to have some of the facility open to the public in 2019, and the remainder in 2020, but efforts will go into shortening those timeframes where practicable.
