The search is underway to find some of the country’s highest achieving Pacific young people.

The 2015 Prime Minister's Pacific Youth Awards offer the chance to highlight the success of young Pacific people in New Zealand.

“Our government recognises that the Pacific community are one of the largest and youngest populations in New Zealand. Making sure they thrive is crucial for the country’s economic and cultural future,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“The Prime Minister’s Pacific Youth Awards, established in 2010, recognise and reward high-achieving young Pacific New Zealanders who have potential to make a big contribution to New Zealand.

“Young Pacific people have so much to offer in many ways and I encourage them to apply for these awards,’’ says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

The five award categories are:
