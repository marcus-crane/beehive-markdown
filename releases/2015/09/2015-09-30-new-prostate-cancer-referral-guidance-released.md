Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says new guidance will help primary care practitioners provide men and their families with consistent and culturally appropriate information on prostate cancer testing and treatment.

“Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men in New Zealand. Around 3,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year and 600 die from the disease,” says Dr Coleman.

“Men currently receive variable advice about prostate cancer testing and treatment. This new guidance will help primary care practitioners have an informed discussion with patients who have prostate related concerns.

“The guidance is a useful tool to ensure that information is consistent and culturally appropriate across the country. It will enable men to make informed decisions about whether they should be tested.”

The Prostate Cancer Management and Referral Guidance has been developed by the Prostate Cancer Working Group, with input from the wider health sector. 

The guidance is part of a suite of resources being developed under the Prostate Cancer Awareness and Quality Improvement Programme. New guidance was released in July on the use of active surveillance to manage men with low-risk prostate cancer.

The new resources will include an electronic support tool to further help men’s decision-making around testing and treatment, improved patient information for men and their families, guidance on the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer, as well as guidance on managing advanced prostate cancer.
