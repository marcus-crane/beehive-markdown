Block Offer 2016, the Government process for awarding oil and gas exploration permits, is underway, Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says.

“Consultation now begins with iwi and local authorities in the areas being proposed for onshore and offshore exploration,” Mr Bridges says.

“This is an essential first step in the Block Offer process.  The feedback from these groups ensures that any areas of sensitivity are carefully considered before the tender round is finalised.”

Consultation will take place on four proposed offshore areas and one proposed onshore area, covering a total area of around 537,000 square kilometres.

Schedule 4 areas (including national parks and marine reserves) and World Heritage sites are excluded from the Block Offer process.

“I have also instructed officials to begin engagement and information-sharing with iwi, hapū and local authorities in Southland.  Following this process, I will consider including parts of onshore and offshore Southland in future Block Offers beyond 2016.

“Successive Block Offers have shown that operators are looking for long-term opportunities in a mix of mature and frontier acreage, which New Zealand has to offer.  We will continue to seek investment from experienced and capable operators.”

The consultation period for Block Offer 2016 runs from today until 30 October 2015.  The final tender area will be announced in March next year.
