Ensuring housing developed on Crown land in Auckland includes provision for social housing will ensure more vulnerable New Zealanders can get access to warm, modern properties, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says. 

Building and Housing Minister Nick Smith announced today that the Crown land Development Programme will proceed at pace and the intention is that 20 per cent of homes developed will be new social housing.

“I’m thrilled with this progress because it is another important part of our wider Social Housing Reform Programme that is improving social housing by focusing on tenants and their particular needs,” Mrs Bennett says.

“I have been listening to New Zealand’s Community Housing Providers and the message is clear that they are eager to continue their growth. This announcement gives them more opportunities to grow their portfolio and provide more innovative ways of caring for vulnerable tenants.

“The Government is working hard to address Auckland’s housing supply challenges, and we’re ensuring our most vulnerable aren’t forgotten as the city grows.”

Details including on which Crown land sites the social housing will be built will be worked through as a part of the Development Programme.
