The importance of keeping our Pacific languages alive will be highlighted during Tuvalu Language Week, Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

The theme of Tuvalu Language Week, which begins today, is *Tau gana ko tou Iloga – Language is your Identity.*

“The idea of the theme is to empower and encourage the Tuvalu people to hold on to their language and culture,” Mr Lotu-liga says.

“The proportion of Pacific people speaking their languages is declining so it is important that we support communities to keep their languages and their cultures alive.

“Our Tuvalu communities add richness to New Zealand with their vibrant culture and language and this week is a chance to celebrate and experience the Tuvalu way of life,” Mr Lotu-liga says.

More than 3500 Tuvaluans live in New Zealand and almost half this number was born here. Just over 65 per cent of the Tuvalu population here speaks Tuvalu.

The 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week in October.
