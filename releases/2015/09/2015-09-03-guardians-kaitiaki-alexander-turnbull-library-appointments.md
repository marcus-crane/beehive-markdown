Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced three new appointments to the Guardians Kaitiaki of the Alexander Turnbull Library.

The Guardians role is to advise the Minister on key matters associated with the operation of the Alexander Turnbull Library.

“I am pleased to announce that I am appointing Dr Aroha Harris, Dr Sydney Shep and Dr Jock Phillips for three-year terms. I am privileged to have the opportunity to bring together such a well-qualified group of skilled people to continue the work of the Guardians Kaitiaki”.

“I am also reappointing Helen Tait for a further three-year term. I am appreciative of the strong contribution Ms Tait has brought as Chair of Guardians Kaitiaki”. 

“These new appointments bring a greater focus for the Alexander Turnbull Library on next generation libraries, digitisation, and developments in wider access to information."

Mr Dunne thanked the outgoing members Dr Raewyn Dalziel, Robyn Kamira and Dr Paul Tapsell for their expertise and contribution.
