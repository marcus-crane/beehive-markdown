Two Hauraki Plains College students have won the top prizes in a competition commemorating World War I by designing a garden featuring a cross sculpture and a mural painted by art students, Education Minister Hekia Parata announced today.

Cam Loft and Cheyenne Ballantine were presented with First Prize in the Year 11-13 category and the Outstanding Community Engagement Prize in the Secondary category for the *Their Stories, Our Stories* school competition in a ceremony today at Parliament.

“The competition asked students to create an artefact that made a connection with the New Zealand stories of WWI,” says Ms Parata.

“Cam and Cheyenne worked together to design a unique garden in the heart of their school, with each part of the garden representing different parts of WWI, including the Gallipoli landing.”

The Year 13 students engaged and led their school in the construction of the garden and its features which include the cross sculpture, mural and surrounding fence built by building and construction students. 

“The garden is something that the school and community can enjoy for many years to come and also serves as the legacy that Cam and Cheyenne are leaving for their school,” says Ms Parata.

18 entries were awarded prizes out of 148 entries submitted, with the top prize valued at $880.

“I’d like to congratulate all the winners. Their entries reflected a huge amount of research, creativity and hard work, and honoured the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders who fought in WWI 100 years ago,” says Ms Parata.
