Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga is challenging smokers to give up next month during ‘Stoptober’.

About 5000 people signed up to stop smoking last October and organisers of Stoptober are hoping to double that number this year.

This is the second year that the Stoptober programme has been run, with government support. Once participants sign up through the [website](http://www.stoptober.nz/), they are provided with support to become smokefree.

This can include counsellors meeting smokers individually to encourage them to stop, as well as providing access to stop smoking therapies.

“The theme of ‘*Stopping Could be the Start of Something’* holds true for those who give up. We know that 15 years after quitting, the risk of coronary heart disease reduces to the same as for people who have never smoked,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“We want our loved ones to be as healthy as they can be and to reach their full potential. This is why I am encouraging smokers to take advantage of Stoptober and make this the month they change their lives for good.”

Stoptober is funded through the Pathway to Smokefree 2025 Innovation Fund which was established by Budget 2012 and which receives $5 million a year.

The fund supports innovative approaches to reduce smoking among Māori and Pacific people, pregnant women and young people.

“New Zealand has made real progress in reducing smoking rates but we want to do even better,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Our government remains committed to its aim of making New Zealand smokefree by 2025.”
