Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has announced the Government is investing in five new projects to help grow the tourism sector in New Zealand.

“Tourism is New Zealand’s second largest export earner and has a crucial role in growing our economy.  The industry is in great shape and we want to keep that momentum going,” says Mr Key. 

Through the Tourism Growth Partnership Fund, the Government is investing $1.1 million in five new projects across New Zealand.

The projects are:

- $124,000 to the Ngai Tai Ki Tamaki Tribal Trust to create Te Haerenga, a guided tour on the islands of Rangitoto and Motutapu.

<!--THE END-->

- $290,000 to Tourism Waitaki Limited to develop a heritage tour through Oamaru’s Victorian Precinct.

<!--THE END-->

- $47,600 to the Raglan Mountain Bike Club to promote all year round adventure activities in Raglan.

<!--THE END-->

- $390,000 to Pacific Destinations - Institute of Golf to deliver world class golf experiences.

<!--THE END-->

- $280,000 for Tourwriter - Mobile Itineraries Project to create an App to help visitors manage their bookings and discover targeted activities.

This funding is on top of the $1.5 million announced last week to help promote direct flights from Guangzhou, China to Christchurch.

“We want to attract more visitors to New Zealand and we can do this by identifying and responding to new market opportunities and looking at what additional products and services we can provide.  I am really excited about the range of projects we are helping fund in this round,” says Mr Key.

The Tourism Growth Partnership is a contestable co-investment fund that allows the Government to work in partnership with the tourism industry.

Under the Tourism Growth Partnership, the Government has made $8 million per year available to support projects that will create new opportunities and help overcome barriers to growth in the tourism sector.  

The Government has now invested $10.5 million in 20 projects.
