Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has reacted to stories claiming numbers were to be slashed by releasing its people projections for the next four years, which show civilian numbers unaffected and hundreds more uniformed roles added.

Mr Brownlee and the Defence Force have moved quickly to scotch suggestions there was any planning for wholesale job cuts, but nonetheless media stories have still appeared claiming otherwise.

“Sadly these incorrect stories have unnecessarily caused widespread unease among Defence staff,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As you’d expect, when people hear their jobs are being axed, it’s upsetting. But there are no such plans, and the Defence Force has reassured all their people of that fact.

“It’s disappointing that information provided under the Official Information Act which categorically ruled out significant civilian staff cuts were, for whatever reason, ignored.”

Mr Brownlee released Defence’s four-year planning projections which, while still subject to normal Budget approval processes, shows a stable civilian workforce and the addition of hundreds of new uniform positions.

“It’s a positive time for our Defence Force, with growth matched to investment in new or upgraded capabilities as we head for our goal of enhanced combat capability by 2020.  It’s disappointing that such an inaccurate picture was presented in the past 24 hours.

“The NZDF is a large, complex organisation that is always looking for quality people to carry out the roles expected by the Government.  We have, for example, been running a series of new television advertisements to attract new recruits, and we have many vacancies on the Defence careers website.”
