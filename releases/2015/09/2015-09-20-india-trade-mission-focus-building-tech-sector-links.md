Communications Minister Amy Adams leaves for India today to lead a New Zealand CleanTech business delegation.

The Minister will visit Bangalore for business and state government meetings before travelling to New Delhi for the Renewable Energy India Expo. In Delhi the Minister will also meet senior Indian Ministers.

“This visit is an opportunity to enhance trade and business links between India and New Zealand while showcasing our innovative technology in the CleanTech and renewable energy sectors,” Ms Adams says.

“India is our tenth largest export destination with two-way trade in goods and services totalling $1.9 billion in the year to March 2015. India is also our sixth largest market for service exporters and there are growing opportunities for innovative technology suppliers.

“New Zealand is a natural partner for countries looking for innovative assistance and advanced technology to harness and realise renewable energy and clean technology opportunities, and environmental management.”

Ms Adams will be accompanied by Dr Mike Allen, Special Envoy for Renewable Energy and Executive Director of Geothermal New Zealand.

The New Zealand trade delegation includes Astrolab, CarbonScape, Solar Bright, Pacific Rubber Recycling, Environmental Management Services, ESG Asia Pacific, Windflow Technology Ltd, Gallagher Fuel Systems, Greenhouse Capital, Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development, and Callaghan Innovation.

The delegation will be in India from 21 to 25 September.
