Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened the new premises for Framework Trust in Otahuhu, Auckland.

Framework is a not-for-profit organisation contracted by the Ministry of Health to provide services to people with mental health and disability issues.

“The Government is committed to providing high quality mental health and disability support services,” says Dr Coleman.

“More and more people are now receiving services specifically tailored to their individual needs and in their location of choice.

“Organisations like Framework play a key role in supporting some of our most vulnerable people to access vital opportunities for education, employment and recreation.

“Framework’s services have a considerable impact, helping to improve the health and wellbeing of their clients. Since 2005 over 5,000 people have used Framework’s services. In the past year their WorkFocus service has placed 247 people into employment.

“With 126 staff supporting almost 1,000 clients across greater Auckland, the move to new premises will enable Framework to expand its training services.”

Framework evolved in the 1980s in response to the development of community based mental health and disability support services.

It provides specialist services for life skills and day activity programmes tailored to an individual’s needs. Current programmes include work placement, voluntary work opportunities and support to access tertiary education.

Framework receives $5.5 million a year in funding from the Ministry of Health/DHBs and $1.5 million from the Ministry of Social Development.
