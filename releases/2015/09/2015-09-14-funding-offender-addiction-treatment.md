Corrections will spend $8.63 million over three years to develop and deliver a drug and alcohol post-release programme to help offenders break their addictions and reduce reoffending, Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has announced.

“Drug and alcohol abuse is a major driver of crime. Two-thirds of prisoners have substance abuse problems and more than half of crimes are committed by people under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Often this is a major factor in their reoffending,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Our government is committed to reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017. Breaking the link between substance abuse and offending is crucial if we want to reduce the number of people in prison.”

There is a range of drug and alcohol treatment programmes available inside prison. However, there is limited post-release support to maintain the life changes prisoners make.

“It is important they keep the motivation to stay free from substance abuse once they leave prison,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This Justice Sector funding will enable Corrections to better support offenders to maintain an alcohol and drug-free life after their release into the community.”

The programme will begin next year.
