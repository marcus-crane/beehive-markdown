Prime Minister John Key has announced that Peter Hobbs will be New Zealand’s newly appointed Trade Commissioner to Papua New Guinea.

Mr Key made the announcement today after he officially re-opened the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Office in Port Moresby.

“Papua New Guinea is the largest economy in the Pacific region and it is growing fast. It is New Zealand’s second largest trading partner in the Pacific, and there are already a number of New Zealand firms active in Papua New Guinea,” Mr Key says.

“The re-establishment of a Trade Commissioner position in Papua New Guinea reflects the strong interest by New Zealand companies in the Papua New Guinea market.

“The opportunities in Papua New Guinea are significant and we hope that with the support of NZTE more New Zealand businesses will take up the challenge of doing business here.

“Having a Trade Commissioner on the ground in Papua New Guinea will be particularly important in the lead up to APEC in 2018 which Papua New Guinea is hosting,” Mr Key says.

The Trade Commissioner will based at the New Zealand High Commission in Port Moresby.
