The Te Kawerau ā Maki Claims Settlement Bill passed its third and final reading today, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced.

When enacted, the bill will give effect to the deed of settlement which Te Kawerau ā Maki and the Crown signed on 22 February 2014.

Te Kawerau ā Maki is an iwi of the Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) region. Its historical grievances include detriment caused by extensive Crown land purchases in the three decades following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.  Reserves that had been set aside for Te Kawerau ā Maki were never protected and were alienated from tribal control. Te Kawerau ā Maki was rendered landless.

“The passing of this bill is one of the final steps in settling the grievances of Te Kawerau ā Maki and is significant as a further step toward the settlement of historical claims across Auckland,” Mr Finlayson said.

“The settlement also provides for Te Kawerau ā Maki to purchase 86 percent of Riverhead Crown Forest Licence land which will be a significant commercial asset for the iwi.

“While the Crown can never fully compensate for the wrongs of the past, this settlement will enable Te Kawerau ā Maki to focus on developing a strong cultural and economic future,” Mr Finlayson said.

The settlement includes cultural, financial and commercial redress of $6.5 million (which will be used to purchase Riverhead Forest and land at Te Onekiritea Point (Hobsonville). A contribution of $300,000 will support the establishment of a Te Kawerau ā Maki marae. Other cultural redress includes the vesting of nine significant cultural sites to the iwi.
