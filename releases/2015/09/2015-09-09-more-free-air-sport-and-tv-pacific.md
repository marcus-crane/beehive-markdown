Prime Minister John Key has today launched a new broadcasting initiative that will see more New Zealand television content and sports coverage provided to the Pacific free of charge.

“The Pacific broadcasting project will see up to eight hours of high quality content a day made available to Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Niue, Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea,” Mr Key says.

“A range of broadcasters, production houses, and rights holders have come together to support the initiative which will provide more viewing options for Pacific people. 

“Given the Pacific’s love of sport we are particularly pleased that a number of sports rights holders, including SANZAR, have given their support to the project.

“The coverage will include free-to-air access to selected Super 15 matches, Rugby Championship Tests and ITM Cup matches, as well as news, documentaries and entertainment.

“As part of the project, New Zealand will also support Pacific broadcasters with additional technical assistance and training to help create more local content.

“This initiative will significantly increase the amount of content available to Pacific audiences, and will help showcase New Zealand productions in the region,” Mr Key says.

The following organisations have committed to providing content at no cost to participating Pacific countries: TVNZ, Prime, MediaWorks, Parliament TV, Māori Television, SANZAR and Setanta Asia, Radio New Zealand, South Pacific Pictures, Showdown Productions, Lippy Pictures, Top Shelf Productions, Leftfield, Screentime Productions, North Reef Productions, NZ Cricket, Sky Television, NZ Rugby, and Basketball NZ.

The first broadcasts are expected to begin in early 2016. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide approximately $400,000 a year in additional funding to support the initiative.
