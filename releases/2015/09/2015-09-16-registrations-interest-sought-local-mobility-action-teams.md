Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says work is progressing well on the development and delivery of the new Local Mobility Action Teams.

The Government invested $6 million in Budget 2015 to create community based multi-disciplinary early intervention teams for the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal conditions like arthritis.

“There are many people with arthritis where early intervention in a community setting is appropriate. It can deliver improvements in diagnosis, self-management, education, exercise and pain management,” says Dr Coleman.

“Registrations of Interest are now being sought for the development and delivery of the first tranche of the new Local Mobility Action Teams.

“The first Teams, which will be led by local clinical champions, are expected to be up and running early next year.

“These Teams will make a real difference to patients and their families, helping to improve patients’ quality of life and avoiding unnecessary hospital visits.

“We want to see a greater focus on prevention and earlier intervention through initiatives like this delivered in the community.”

The Teams will work with a range of community health services, including GPs, dietitians and physiotherapists. There will also be appropriate links with hospital services such as rheumatology, orthopaedic and pain services.

The composition and focus of the Teams are likely to vary across the country, depending on the needs of each local community.

An Expert Advisory Group, which includes specialists in rehabilitation, exercise, nutrition, orthopaedics, rheumatology, physiotherapy, pharmacology and general practice has been established.

The Group, led by rheumatologist Dr Peter Jones and Associate Professor Peter Larmer, recently met to plan the next steps towards the development and delivery of the new Teams.

The period for Registrations of Interest from the sector closes on 25 September.
