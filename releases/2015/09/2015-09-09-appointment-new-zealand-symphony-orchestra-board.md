Clare Murray of Christchurch has been appointed to the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra board, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry confirmed today.

“Clare Murray has extensive experience of music and arts governance and brings that knowledge and business acumen to this important role,” Ms Barry says.

“A strong supporter of the arts in Canterbury, Mrs Murray has been a trustee and chair of the Christchurch Arts Festival. I am sure she will make a significant contribution as the NZSO enters an exciting phase in its history.”

“This appointment until 31 July 2018 replaces retiring board member Roger Taylor, and my sincere thanks go to him for his contribution and commitment to the board.”
