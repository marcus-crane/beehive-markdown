The first funding round of the Afforestation Grant Scheme will see 5819 hectares planted throughout New Zealand, says Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew.

The Afforestation Grant Scheme is a $22.5m programme to help establish about 15,000 hectares of new forest plantations over the next six years.

“Under the first round of funding the total area applied for covered 9044 hectares, far exceeding our expectations,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“The successful applications cover 5819 hectares of forest, and farmers and landowners will receive support worth $7,565,347 through this scheme.”

Every application was assessed against a set of eligibility criteria and included a detailed technical forestry assessment.

“As a result of the new planting, which will begin during winter 2016, our regions will see increased erosion control, water quality and less environmental impact following flooding.”

The next funding round will open in April 2016 for planting in winter 2017.
