Suffrage Day is the perfect opportunity to celebrate how far New Zealand women have come since they won the right to vote in 1893, Minister for Women Louise Upston says.

“While it is 122 years since New Zealand women have been able to exercise their democratic rights, we can still be proud of brave Kiwi women like Kate Sheppard whose tireless work broke down social barriers.

“We’ve got the lowest gender pay gap in the OECD for full-time employment, more women than ever are in paid employment and women are achieving tertiary qualifications at a greater rate than men.

“Because of Kate and her brave suffragists, we live in a country that is at the forefront of the fight for equality.

“But it’s not just about equality. It’s about equal choice, equal opportunities, equal expectations and being valued equally. There is more that can be done to improve the lives of New Zealand women and girls.

“We can actively encourage girls to participate in education and training in high growth and high demand industries.  As parents, friends and role models we can encourage girls to train in maths and science subjects and consider a wider range of career options, including construction and ICT.

“We can also grow and develop our future women leaders through mentoring and sharing the stories of inspiring women leaders. 

“The next generation of women leaders can show New Zealand leading the way, just as the suffragists did in 1893. They fought hard for world-leading change and their legacy benefits not only women, but also their families, our communities and our country,” Ms Upston said.
