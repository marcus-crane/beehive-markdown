The Crown has signed a deed of settlement with Taranaki Iwi settling all their outstanding historical Treaty claims at Pukeiti Gardens, Taranaki, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Christopher Finlayson announced today.

Taranaki Iwi is one of eight iwi of the Taranaki region. The Waitangi Tribunal has described Taranaki claims as some of the most significant in the country. Crown breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi in Taranaki included warfare that involved loss of life, scorched earth tactics, imprisonment, raupatu, disempowerment and the Crown’s unprecedented actions at Parihaka.

The settlement includes financial redress of $70 million, along with the vesting of 29 sites of cultural significance to be vested in Taranaki Iwi. This includes a joint vesting of Ngā Motu/Sugar Loaf Islands with Te Ātiawa. Taranaki Iwi also has deferred right of selection for two years over 29 commercial properties, and a right of first refusal over Crown-owned land in their rohe.

“We can never fully compensate for the past wrongs the people of Taranaki endured,” Mr Finlayson said. “However, this settlement provides the basis for Taranaki Iwi to develop a much stronger future, and for a new relationship with the Crown based on genuine partnership.”

The Crown, Taranaki Iwi and Parihaka also established the Kawe Tutaki Working Group in December last year, in recognition of the serious historical grievances suffered at Parihaka. Chaired by Dame Tariana Turia, Kawe Tutaki reported to the Crown in July 2015 recommending ways the Crown can renew its relationship with Parihaka and provide support to Parihaka to achieve its aspirations. The Crown is now considering how it will respond to Kawe Tutaki’s report.

“Today’s deed signing is an important step towards moving away from historical grievance and into a much better future for Taranaki Iwi,” Mr Finlayson said.
