Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that a further $120,000 is available to young entrepreneurs under the Opportunities for Young People fund.

“This funding will go to young people to support projects they’ve developed that are aimed at creating social or environmental change,” says Ms Kaye.

“Opportunities for Young People funding comes from the $2 million Youth Enterprise Fund. This fund was launched in December last year, to support organisations offering hands-on opportunities for young people to help them develop entrepreneurial skills.

“Through the many young people I meet, it’s clear they’re coming up with fantastic ideas for projects themselves which are well worth supporting in their own right.

“We recognised this in May this year, when we announced $79,000 of funding direct to young people under the Opportunities for Young People Fund.

“That funding went to young people working on great projects, from online Mandarin lessons to a local intranet network to enhance learning opportunities for disadvantaged youth.

“I’m pleased to announce this further funding today, which coincides with the start of the Festival for the Future in Auckland.

“This event draws together young people from around the Pacific to explore 21st century challenges, and develop ideas and skills to tackle these challenges through creativity, innovation and social enterprise.

“The festival is organised by Guy Ryan, 2015 Young New Zealander of the Year. Previous recipients of Opportunities for Young People funding and Youth Awards will also be attending.

“Ministry of Youth Development staff will be there, too, to explain the funding support available and how to apply.

“I expect we’ll see great ideas come out of the festival, and we may be able to help some of the young people attending turn their ideas into reality.”
