Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will host Australian Defence Minister Hon Kevin Andrews in Auckland tomorrow for the annual Australia New Zealand Defence Ministers’ Meeting.

The Ministers will discuss a range of regional and international security issues, including our respective responses to the fight against Da’esh and future capability projects.  Wider programme events include a tour of the military base at Devonport.

“I am looking forward to talking with Minister Andrews on a number of important, topical issues,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Australia is our closest security and trade partner and it is important that we stay closely in touch on key international defence and security issues.”
