​The Government’s relentless focus on reducing crime is delivering outstanding results, with the number of people appearing in court continuing to fall.

Justice Minister Amy Adams today welcomed two sets of Conviction and Sentencing statistics covering both adult and youth offenders for the year ending June 2015.

“The figures show that the number of adults charged in court has decreased by 36 per cent since its peak in 2009/10 – down 5 per cent in the last year,” says Ms Adams.

This puts the number of adults in court at the lowest levels since records began in 1980/81.

“We’ve also recorded an impressive 61 per cent decrease in the number of children and young people who appeared in court since its peak in 2007/08, and by 13 per cent in the past year,” says Ms Adams.

“These statistics show our policies to drive down crime and keep communities safer are working. These figures represent real people and lives changed. The fewer people in our criminal justice system, the better.

“Fewer people in court is clear evidence of less crime on our streets and a less congested court system. It’s saving taxpayer money, improving the long-term outcomes for vulnerable New Zealanders and keeping our communities safer.”

The statistics show a decrease across all genders, age and ethnic groups over the past year.

"These figures are in line with the trends we’re seeing in our Better Public Services results and the crime rate, which all show less crime and fewer victims.

“These statistics are testament to the Government’s continued effort to reduce crime and make New Zealand a safer place for all who live here,” says Ms Adams.
