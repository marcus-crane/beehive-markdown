Transport Minister Simon Bridges says an amended air services agreement will enhance long-standing links between New Zealand and French Polynesia.

Mr Bridges and France’s Ambassador to New Zealand, Mrs Florence Jeanblanc-Risler, have today signed an amendment to the New Zealand – France Air Transport Agreement which was first signed in 1967.

The resulting new route opportunities will permit New Zealand airlines to use any routing for flights to and beyond French Polynesia. Similarly, airlines from French Polynesia can use any routing for flights to and beyond New Zealand. 

Mr Bridges says air services links with French Polynesia are an important component of New Zealand’s wider engagement within the Pacific.

“This is another example of the Government’s successful international air services policy.

“Liberalised air services agreements like this have already contributed to New Zealand’s milestone three million international visitor arrivals in one year.

“I also hope to see enhanced air services arrangements in the future with mainland France and New Caledonia.

“France is an important partner for New Zealand and I believe improved air connectivity between the two countries will grow connections for business and tourism, as well as for people visiting family and friends,” he says.
