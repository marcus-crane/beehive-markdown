Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed the opening of new state-of-the-art classrooms at Auckland’s Mount Albert Grammar School and Sylvia Park School (Tamaki).

“These new classrooms are part of our broader plan to address roll growth at schools across Auckland,” says Ms Kaye.

“The project at Mount Albert Grammar, one of New Zealand’s largest secondary schools, has seen a new $4 million teaching block constructed, which will house the school’s maths faculty.

“Ten teaching spaces in the new block are now up and running, and another two, as well as a new student services centre, are nearing completion.

“The new block is two-storeyed, which will help the school retain its significant sports fields while also catering for a rapidly growing roll.

“Teaching spaces in the new block feature large glazed sliding doors, opening onto a covered outdoor learning area.

“This is part of a phased property plan for the school. The next phase will see new teaching spaces for science, dance and drama, which are currently being designed.

“At Sylvia Park School, four new classrooms have opened as part of a $1.5 million property upgrade.

“As with Mount Albert, the new classrooms at Sylvia Park School are housed in a two-storey block.

“For some schools, accommodating roll growth in Auckland is going to require building up, especially those that want to keep open spaces such as fields.

“All of the new teaching spaces built as part of these two projects provide light, open and flexible environments that allow for innovative teaching and learning.

“This will enable students to learn in inspiring environments, which help them achieve to the very best of their abilities.”

**Notes:**

**About Mount Albert Grammar School**

Mount Albert Grammar School is a co-educational state secondary school (years 9-13) in Mount Albert, Auckland. Its roll as at July 2015 was 2527.

**About Sylvia Park School**

Sylvia Park School is a state, coeducational primary and intermediate school (years 1-8) in Tamaki, Auckland. Its roll as at July 2015 was 486.

**About innovative learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers addressed students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with each other and with students, in small and large groups and individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to create comfortable, well-connected and flexible learning spaces that support the creation of an innovative learning environment.

These spaces can be changed to support a range of teaching and learning approaches on any given day, and are also able to adapt to broader changes as education practices evolve over time. Acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
