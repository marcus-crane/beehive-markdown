Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner has today released the approved restoration plan for Christchurch’s beloved Victoria Square.

The release of the Victoria Square Restoration Plan completes a six month community participation process which sought people’s feedback on the future of the popular public space in central Christchurch. A draft restoration plan was developed using the feedback from almost 2200 people in the first stage of the community participation process, and the public was also given an opportunity to have a say on the draft plan in July.

The plan was endorsed by the Christchurch City Council last week.

“The response to the draft restoration plan was very positive and showed that the right balance had been achieved between enhancing the space and retaining its character,” Ms Wagner says.

“The plan includes the repair of the Bowker Fountain, more seating and better lighting. An independent reference group has addressed issues raised by the public around the widening of the pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, and the inclusion of new artworks.

“I will continue to discuss the design detail of the restoration plan with Christchurch City Council, Ngāi Tūāhuriri and the independent reference group as work progresses on this.

“After hearing all of the views, we can now move forward and make the best use of this important civic space.

“The next step is to begin work on the developed design. Physical work is expected to begin on Victoria Square early next year, and will take six to eight months to complete,” Ms Wagner says.
