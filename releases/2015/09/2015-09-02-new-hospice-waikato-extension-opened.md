Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has today opened the new Hospice Waikato extension in Hamilton.

"Hospices make a huge difference to people's lives by ensuring terminally ill people are as free from pain and suffering as possible. They also provide valuable care and support for families and friends,” says Dr Coleman.

“Around 17,000 adults and their families will access palliative care services this year, and this figure is expected to increase as our population grows.

“Hospice Waikato now cares for double the number of patients from a decade ago, with around 1,000 patients expected this year compared to 470 in 2006.

“This new extension will benefit patients, whanau, visitors and staff by providing purpose-built facilities for a range of outpatient services.

“The community support for these services is shown by the funds raised by the Hospice Waikato Foundation for the extension.”

In Budget 2015 the Government committed $52 million over four years to help hospices expand their community palliative care services.

Of this, Hospice Waikato will receive an extra $1.1 million a year over four years via Waikato DHB.

“This funding boost is part of the Government’s commitment to delivering high quality services closer to home,” says Dr Coleman.

“It will support Hospice Waikato in increasing its community based services, a significant change in care delivery from the provision of respite beds.”
