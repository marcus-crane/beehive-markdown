The Government will invest $110,000 from the Community Conservation Partnership Fund (CCPF) to help reintroduce the native Kokako to the Parininihi area of Taranaki, says Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner.

“The last Taranaki Kokako was placed in captivity in 1999 to protect it from predators. It is exciting that Kokako could soon be reintroduced to Taranaki,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Tiaki Te Mauri O Parininihi Trust aims to reduce rat and possum populations in the Parininihi forest to one per cent this year, and to keep pest levels down to allow reintroduced Kokako and other species to flourish.

“Intensive pest control is crucial if Kokako are to be reintroduced. Funding of $110,000 will support maintenance baiting to suppress predator populations, which will supplement the tireless work of volunteers.

“The Kokako’s call is distinctive and carries for a great distance. Reintroducing this treasure to Taranaki will be a magnificent gift for future generations.”

The CCPF is also investing more than $15,000 to help restore sand dunes in Sandy Bay, north-west of Opunake.

“Community restoration activities at Sandy Bay have been ongoing since 2003. This investment will help stabilise sand dunes using native sand binding grasses.

“By continuing to restore Sandy Bay sand dunes, we are giving species like the New Zealand dotterel and the Taranaki gold-striped gecko, which are known to inhabit the area, the best chance to thrive,” Ms Wagner says.
