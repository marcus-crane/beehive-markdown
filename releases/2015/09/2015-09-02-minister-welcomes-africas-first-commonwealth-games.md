Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has congratulated Durban, South Africa on being named host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

“I would like to congratulate Durban on becoming the first African city to host a Commonwealth Games,” says Dr Coleman.

Durban was named as host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games during the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly being held in Auckland from 30 August - 3 September.

“It is a privilege to have delegates from the Commonwealth Games Federation in New Zealand for this year’s General Assembly,” says Dr Coleman.

“It is an opportunity to showcase our world-leading sports system and challenge delegates to ensure the Commonwealth Games remains affordable to host and does not become the preserve of a few nations.

“I would also like to congratulate New Zealand Olympic Committee CEO Kereyn Smith on being elected to the position of Vice President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Board. Her appointment bodes well for the Games at an important time in its history.”

The Commonwealth Games holds a unique place in the history of New Zealand sport. New Zealand is one of just six nations to compete in every Games since its inception in 1930.

The next Commonwealth Games will be held on the Gold Coast, Australia in 2018.
