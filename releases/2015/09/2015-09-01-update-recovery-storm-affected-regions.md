Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says recovery from the severe storm in June is going well, but latest estimates show its economic impact could be around $270 million.

Areas hardest hit by the storm included parts of Taranaki, Whanganui and Manawatu.

“Much of the cost of the storm will be met by private insurance, but the Government will also contribute significant support.

“We do this in several ways. We make support available to individuals through things like contributions to local relief funds.

“We help local authorities meet the cost of repairing local infrastructure and providing emergency support, such as housing displaced residents. We also fund repairs to state assets such as highways.

“Based on current estimates, we expect the central and local government contribution to roading and infrastructure repair costs not covered by private insurance will be between $80 and $90 million.

“The figure will likely change, but the current estimates are that central government will contribute at least 70% of these costs.

“To date, we’ve also made around $4.5 million available through additional support packages aimed at helping people in need in the community.

“This follows today’s announcement of a further support package worth $2.6 million.

“It’s clear that this event, while not of the scale of the 2004 flooding, was a one-in-100-year event, and some areas and communities were hit very hard.

“The new support package includes targeted funding for farmers, who need help to repair essential infrastructure necessary to get them back on their feet. “This will enable existing funds in mayoral and disaster relief funds to be focused on meeting welfare needs in affected communities.

“I’d like to thank the many volunteers who continue to help with the recovery.

“Events like this can hit communities hard, but as I’ve witnessed on many occasions, they also bring out the best in people."

Notes:

The percentage of central government contribution varies depending on the infrastructure. For example, local roading subsidy rates are different for each district.
