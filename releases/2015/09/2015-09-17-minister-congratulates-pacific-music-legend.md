Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated Tongan musician Bill Sevesi who is to be inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame this evening.

Sevesi, 92, will be recognised at the 2015 Apra Silver Scroll Awards for his contribution to New Zealand and Pacific music with his mastery of the steel guitar.

“Music is a huge part of Pacific culture and identity. Bill has, over his long and illustrious career, played a big role in helping create a unique New Zealand sound that blends the best of Pacific and New Zealand cultures,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Many Pacific artists can praise Bill as their inspiration and many New Zealanders can thank him for the music of the Pacific which he made his trademark.

“I know Pacific people, in particular the Tongan community, regard Bill as their musical hero and I am pleased that he has been recognised by Apra for his talents as a singer and guitarist,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
