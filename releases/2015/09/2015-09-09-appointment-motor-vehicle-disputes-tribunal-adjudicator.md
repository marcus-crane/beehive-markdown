Justice Minister Amy Adams and Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Paul Goldsmith have announced a new appointment to the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal.

Wellington barrister Jason McHerron has been appointed an adjudicator to the Tribunal for a five-year term.

“Mr McHerron is a highly respected barrister who brings a wealth of experience to this role. His skills and knowledge will see him make a good contribution to the Tribunal,” Ms Adams says. 

“Mr McHerron’s extensive legal and dispute resolution experience will be particularly valuable to the Tribunal which hears disputes between consumers and car dealers or other registered and unregistered motor vehicle traders,” Mr Goldsmith says.

Mr McHerron will be responsible for the adjudication of cases for the South Island and the lower North Island, from New Plymouth to the Hawke’s Bay.

The other adjudicator for the Tribunal covers cases in Auckland and the northern North Island.

**Background on the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal**

The Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal resolves disputes between consumers and registered and unregistered motor vehicle traders. It deals with disputes of amounts up to $100,000 (or above this if parties to the application agree in writing) with claims that relate to a breach of the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, Fair Trading Act 1986, Sale of Goods Act 1908, and the Contractual Remedies Act 1979. Each Tribunal must consist of an adjudicator and an assessor appointed by the adjudicator.
