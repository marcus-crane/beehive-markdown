Foreign Minister Murray McCully has welcomed the upcoming official visit to New Zealand this weekend by Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.

“Minister Yun’s visit is an important opportunity to strengthen New Zealand’s relationship with South Korea, one of our most valuable partners in the Asian region,” Mr McCully says.

“Korea is New Zealand’s sixth-largest trade partner with total two-way goods trade of $4 billion in 2014.  It is also a significant source of tourists and international students.

“New Zealand and Korea signed a Free Trade Agreement in March, and ratification is under way on both sides.

“Our talks will also focus on regional and global security issues, especially the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr McCully says.

While in New Zealand, Minister Yun will participate in a wreath laying ceremony at the Korean Memorial in Dove Meyer Robinson Park, recognising New Zealand’s contribution to the Korean War.
