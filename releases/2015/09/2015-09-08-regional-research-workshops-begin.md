Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today welcomed the first opportunity for businesses, researchers, private investors and Government to collaborate on establishing new Regional Research Institutes, with a series of workshops beginning this week.

Mr Joyce says the new institutes are proposed in order to stimulate leading edge, commercially focused, and industry relevant research in regional New Zealand. This would help grow innovation and competitiveness by making the most of local industry, technology, and economic development opportunities.

“Our regional economies have different resources and strengths. These new institutes would deliver research that is of value to businesses, which will in turn create new jobs and lift incomes,” Mr Joyce says.

“The first workshop in Southland today will be an opportunity for all the regional players to get in a room to discuss their ideas with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, which is leading the initiative.”

“The workshops continue throughout September and October, visiting 11 regions in total. Industry and researchers are encouraged to work together to submit their proposals to host one of the institutes.

“I encourage businesses, researchers and investors to attend the workshops, hear about the opportunities available and evaluate whether to make a case for a new Regional Research Institute in their region,” Mr Joyce says.

The privately-led institutes were announced as part of Budget 2015, which allowed for up to $25 million over three years to support the initiative. It is expected that up to three new institutes will be established over the next four to five years.

“For New Zealand to succeed we need an economy where all regions are able to make the most of their competitive advantages. Supporting this growth is a priority for the Government and a key focus of the Business Growth Agenda.”
