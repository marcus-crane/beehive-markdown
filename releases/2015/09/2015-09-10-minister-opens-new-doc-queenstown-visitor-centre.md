DOC’s new Queenstown Visitor Centre will showcase the spectacular natural beauty and outdoor adventures on offer in our most popular tourist destination, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry says.

Ms Barry opened the centre, on Stanley St, this afternoon.

“From this high-profile, modern and innovative new site, DOC will be at the heart of tourism in Queenstown. It will be a source of up-to-date information for anyone who wants to enjoy the experiences available in the area.”

A temporary pop-up centre has been in the building since November while the rest of the new centre was fitted out. In total the project cost around $330,000, slightly under budget.

“Since the pop-up was opened last year the number of people coming through the doors has increased 40 per cent. Now the new centre is completed, we can expect to see many more take advantage of the opportunities it provides.”

Featuring free wi-fi, audio-visual safety displays developed with the Mountain Safety Council and interactive panels, the centre is a flagship project for DOC.

Ngāi Tahu helped to develop the displays at the centre and have loaned a second pounamu stone to mark the collaboration as a Treaty partner.

“Visitor centres remain vital to DOC’s role in New Zealand’s successful tourism sector, as shown by the partnership with the Tourism Industry Association announced in July. I’d like to congratulate everyone involved in putting this project together,” Ms Barry says.
