ACC Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed the major partnership formed between ACC and Paralympics New Zealand.

“This partnership will provide opportunities for people with injury-related disabilities to have a go at sports which can help them lead a more active lifestyle,” says Ms Kaye.

“At the same time, it will enable Paralympics New Zealand to identify new Para-athletes, as they look towards the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games and beyond.

“The high profile achievements of New Zealand’s Paralympians are helping to change public perceptions of disability, and are contributing to the acceptance of Paralympic competitions alongside mainstream sports.

“It will be great if more New Zealanders returning to life after an accident, especially our young people, are inspired by the deeds of our Paralympic heroes.

“This morning I’m looking forward to being at the AUT Millennium Centre in Auckland, to mark ‘1 Year to Go’ until the Rio 2016 Paralympics.

“Paralympics New Zealand is also launching its new ‘Spirit of Gold’ campaign today, which is about raising awareness and funds to support Para-Sport in the community.

“Over 50 organisations, including ACC, are taking part in a gold-themed mufti day, and 365 children dressed in home-made gold supporters’ costumes will be at the Millennium Centre with a number of our top Paralympians.

“Recovering from an accident can be a long road, and being part of a group of equally motivated individuals discovering what they can do, rather than what they can’t, can be very empowering.

“Sport gives structure, focus and a goal to achieve. The determination and achievements of our Paralympians sets an example to us all as to what can be achieved and overcome.”

***What does the ACC partnership with Paralympics New Zealand (PNZ) involve?***

ACC entered into partnership with PNZ in August to be a ‘major partner’ in 2015 and 2016.

This period includes the build-up to the 2016 Paralympic Games (7-18 September 2016).

ACC’s objectives for the partnership include:

- supporting PNZ in its aims
- improving public understanding of ACC through the partnership
- supporting ACC injury prevention campaigns using positive Paralympic role models
- inspiring New Zealanders to lead active lives via inspirational stories of sporting excellence, promoting active lifestyles and reducing the chance of injuries
- promoting media coverage of Paralympics
- providing opportunities and access to sports for ACC clients with injury-related disabilities.
