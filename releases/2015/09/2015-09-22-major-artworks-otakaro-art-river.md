Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner today released the Masterplan for Ōtākaro Art by the River, which includes STAY, a sculpture by renowned sculptor Antony Gormley.

“Ōtākaro Art by the River will be a unique trail of artworks sited along the Ōtākaro/Avon River that will help to restore and enhance the existing character of the river that Christchurch knows and loves,” Ms Wagner says.

“About 30 artworks will be featured, many of them subtle and all of them complementing the river’s history, ecology and geography.

“It is fantastic that such a world-renowned piece of art has been secured for the city by SCAPE Public Art and that the Gormley sculpture will become a part of the Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct.

“The partnership between CERA, Christchurch City Council Public Art Advisory Group, Ngāi Tūāhuriri and SCAPE Public Art is leaving a legacy for the future and will help establish a distinctive identity for Christchurch city that the community can be proud of.

“The Masterplan, released today, provides us with a big picture look at how Art by the River can develop as more art works are added over the coming years.

“Well known works such as Julia Morison’s *Tree Houses for Swamp Dwellers* and Neil Dawson’s *Spires* are planned to be relocated to the Art by the River trail, while emerging young artists will also be featured.

“This project is an important part of the transformation of Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct and will contribute to the creation of vibrant, world-class urban waterfront,” Ms Wagner says.
