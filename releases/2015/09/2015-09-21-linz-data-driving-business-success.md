Online data provided free of charge by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is proving critical to the success of businesses across New Zealand, Land Information Minister Louise Upston says.

“LINZ’s Data Service has more than 19,000 users, and a recent customer survey found more than half of those surveyed rely on its data. A further 20 per cent reported the service’s data is critical to the success of their business,” Ms Upston says.

Data available through the LINZ Data Service includes map and chart information, as well as surveyed boundaries and property titles. Aerial imagery covering 95 percent of New Zealand also forms part of the service.

“LINZ makes this data available online to users free of charge, which makes it easily available to be utilised by groups such as software developers, universities, construction and mapping companies and geospatial organisations.

“It’s been great to see this data being used to assist in projects such as the management and monitoring of customary fisheries, as well as property, mapping and ownership data used in the planning stages of new windfarms.”

Ms Upston says the LINZ Data Service survey results show that making this data freely available generates great benefits for New Zealand.

“The 2014/15 Open Data Barometer Global Report shows New Zealand continues to be one of the best countries in the world for allowing open access to government data. The LINZ Data Service is contributing to this data transparency by providing a one-stop-shop for businesses and organisations to freely access LINZ information, which is assisting organisations around New Zealand.
