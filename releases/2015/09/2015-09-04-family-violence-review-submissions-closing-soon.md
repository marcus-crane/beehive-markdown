New Zealanders have two more weeks to have their say about how we can strengthen our family violence laws, Justice Minister Amy Adams says.

There has been a strong response from submitters since the Minister launched the discussion document *Strengthening New Zealand’s legislative response to family violence* in August.

“More than 170 submissions have already been received from a broad range of submitters including from the public, sector experts and non-government agencies,” Ms Adams says.

The review takes a hard look at the way the law prevents and responds to family violence, and proposes a comprehensive rethink to strengthen New Zealand’s legislative response.

“Combating family violence is one of my top priorities and it’s my view that the law can do more to reduce the incidence and impact of family violence. This review is an opportunity to challenge the way we have thought about family violence to date - if we want different outcomes, we have to be prepared to do things differently.

“I strongly encourage anyone with views or ideas to make a submission. This is a chance to have a say on New Zealand’s family violence laws,” Ms Adams says.

The public consultation is open at [https://consultations.justice.govt.nz/policy/family-violence-law](https://consultations.justice.govt.nz/policy/family-violence-law) until Friday, 18 September.
