The start of a new year is a good time to update your cyber security including changing passwords for all your internet-connected devices says Communications Minister Amy Adams.

Today is Safer Internet Day which aims to remind people of the potential dangers that can be found online.

“The internet is now part of our everyday lives and while this brings great benefits to New Zealanders, we must be aware that it can and does contain some risk. To avoid becoming victims of internet fraud and scams, or exposed to harmful and objectionable material online, we need to be smarter about protecting ourselves online,” says Ms Adams.

“Safer Internet Day reminds us that we should be proactive in improving our personal digital security – don’t wait until it’s too late. Secure all of your internet-connected devices, including your smart phones. Protecting yourself also helps to protect your friends, family and colleagues,” says Ms Adams. 

Ms Adams said the Government recognised the huge benefits of being digitally connected and therefore was committed to helping New Zealanders feel safe online.

“We know that one reason that people might choose not to become engaged with digital technology is a lack of confidence. Our cyber awareness initiative Connect Smart is helping people learn about how to protect their security and privacy online, so they become more active and confident online citizens,” says Ms Adams.

In line with the new school year, Ms Adams said Safer Internet Day was also a reminder for parents to discuss the harmful effects of cyberbullying with their children, another Government priority area.

“Digital awareness should start early. In this technological age of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, it’s important we ensure children and young people have the skills to operate safely and responsibly online from the moment they are given access to social media.”

#### **Five easy tips for protecting yourself online:**

3. Secure your computer. Install adequate firewalls and keep your anti-virus and operating software up to date. Ensure that you have information safely backed-up.
4. Be cautious on emails & social media, particularly emails from people you don’t know or that look unusual or links to unknown websites - it may be spam email with malicious software attached. Limit the amount and type of identity information you share online. Tighten your privacy settings on social media sites.
