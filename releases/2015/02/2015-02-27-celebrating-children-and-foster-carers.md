Sunday 1 March 2015 marks both Children’s Day and the beginning of Fostercare Awareness Week 2015. Social Development Minister Anne Tolley encourages parents of all kinds to spend time with their kids this Sunday.

“Children’s Day is a great time for families to have a bit of time out and fun together,” Mrs Tolley says.

“With hundreds of events happening around the country, there’s something for everyone on Sunday. I encourage parents and caregivers to check out what’s happening in their community.

“Children’s Day is also a time to think about the children who don’t have safe and stable homes and the people who step up to help when they need it most. It is an extraordinary and generous gift to open your home to a child in need.

“Children in care are some of our country’s most vulnerable children with the most complex needs. Those who care for them can see their potential and commit to turning these young lives around. It’s a huge undertaking and deserves our thanks and recognition,” Mrs Tolley says.

Child, Youth and Family works with close to 4,000 foster carers looking after around 3,500 children.  Around half of Child, Youth and Family’s caregivers are whānau carers.

“Foster families come from all walks of life with incredibly varied backgrounds, but they have a single thing in common – a mighty resolve to do the very best for the children and young people who need them,” Mrs Tolley says.
