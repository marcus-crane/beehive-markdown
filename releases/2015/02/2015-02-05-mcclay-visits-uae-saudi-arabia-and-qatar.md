Associate Trade Minister Todd McClay leaves on Saturday for the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar where he will meet with a range of government and commercial representatives.

“The Gulf Cooperation Council, of which these three states are a part, is a growing region that offers significant opportunities for New Zealand,” says Mr McClay.

“I am excited about the opportunity to help strengthen our relationships with this part of the world. This visit is very much about reinforcing New Zealand’s commitment to partnering with Gulf States in a range of areas including food security, infrastructure, and services.

“It will also be an opportunity to share New Zealand’s expertise in asset management and government services, and to build on the already strong relationships we have with these three countries.”

In Dubai, Mr McClay will discuss the World Expo which is being held there in 2020, as well as meeting with a range of New Zealand companies active in the region, and will open a New Zealand food and beverage promotion.

In Saudi Arabia he will meet with a range of ministerial counterparts regarding NZ’s bilateral trading relationship with the Kingdom, while in Qatar he will meet with a number of government ministers and progress cooperation in the fields of environment and education.

Mr McClay returns to New Zealand on 15 February.
