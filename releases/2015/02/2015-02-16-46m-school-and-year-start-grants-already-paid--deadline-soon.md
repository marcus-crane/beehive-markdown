More than 9,500 children have received assistance for the start of the school year with grants worth nearly $4.65 million being paid to wider family members caring for children, says Anne Tolley, Minister for Social Development.

“With the school year beginning, we recognise family carers can do with a little extra help to buy essentials like uniforms and stationery, or other necessities to help children settle into a new school year.

“Stepping in to help raise vulnerable children, often after raising children of their own, is hard work and these payments recognise the invaluable role of family carers.” Mrs Tolley says.

Eligible family carers who haven’t yet applied for the new Start of Year payments can apply right now online through the Work and Income web site.

Carers can get between $400 and $550, depending on the age of the child. They must be receiving either the Unsupported Child’s Benefit or Orphan’s Benefit.  Applications close on 28 February. 

“I’m really pleased so many families are applying for these grants.   Grandparents and other extended family member carers do phenomenal work in putting the needs of our vulnerable children ahead of their own.

“We want to make the job easier for family carers and helping with the costs which come with starting a new school year is a tangible and practical way to do that.” Mrs Tolley says.

**Notes**:

- To be eligible for the new carer payments, people must be eligible for either the Unsupported Child’s Benefit or Orphan’s Benefit.
- As at 4 February 9,596 Start of Year Payments granted totalling $4.655 million.
