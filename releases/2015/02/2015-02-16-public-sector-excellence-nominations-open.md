State Services Minister Paula Bennett is calling on Government agencies to put forward their nominations for the Deloitte Fujitsu Public Sector Excellence Awards 2015.   

The awards, organised by the Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ), recognise outstanding achievements and innovations by organisations and teams across the public sector.

“This is an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the great work done by public servants, and to highlight examples of where agencies have gone above and beyond to get better results for New Zealanders,” says Mrs Bennett.

“I’m encouraging organisations, from central and local government to DHBs and tertiary organisations, to submit examples of their successes for consideration.”

There are nine categories, including the Prime Minister’s Award for Public Sector Excellence and the Young Professional of the Year award. 

The 2014 winner of the Prime Minister’s Award for Public Sector Excellence was the New Zealand Police, whose ‘Prevention First’ strategy led to an increased visibility of Police officers in communities and a 5 per cent increase in crime prevention activities.

Nominations close on 2 March 2015, and the Awards Ceremony will be held on 21 July 2015 at the TSB Arena, Wellington.
