Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is taking part in tonight’s 2015 FIFA Under-20 World Cup official draw in Auckland.

“New Zealand will be hosting some of the best under-20 football players in the world for 52 matches in Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin,” says Dr Coleman.

“The FIFA U20 World Cup is a great opportunity on the back of the Rugby World Cup and the ICC Cricket World Cup to boost New Zealand’s reputation for hosting major international sporting events.

“The tournament will be broadcast to more than 100 countries with a global television audience of more than 170 million. Between 7,000 to 10,000 international visitors, including players, staff and media are expected to visit.

“Hosting this major event also shows how far the ‘beautiful game’ has come in New Zealand with football continuing to grow in popularity. It is now our most popular participation sport for children aged 16 and under.”

Tonight’s official draw will determine where each of the 24 qualified teams will play throughout the tournament. Individual match tickets will be launched after the official draw.

Dr Coleman will be joining members of the FIFA delegation, including Chairman of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup Organising Committee, Jeffrey Webb, Chair of the tournament’s Local Organising Committee, Bill Moran, and President of New Zealand Football, Mark Aspden.

The 2015 FIFA U20 World Cup takes place from 30 May and 20 June.  Teams confirmed so far include New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Uruguay, Austria, North Korea, Qatar, USA, Mexico, and Fiji.

New Zealand Football is receiving $5.5 million in Government funding to support the tournament.
