Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Bruce Shepherd as New Zealand’s new Ambassador to Ethiopia and the African Union.

“Our relationship with Ethiopia is developing quickly with potential for closer trade and economic ties,” Mr McCully says.

“Addis Ababa is the home of the African Union, and is a base for engaging with all the states of Africa.

“The Embassy has a significant role to play, contributing a New Zealand perspective on security and development issues, and working to open doors for New Zealand exporters.

“We will also be working closely with the AU and African countries as part of our role on the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

Mr Shepherd, who is of Ngati Kahu o Torongare descent, was most recently New Zealand’s Ambassador to Myanmar, based in Yangon.

Mr Shepherd will also be accredited to Djibouti, Rwanda and Uganda.
