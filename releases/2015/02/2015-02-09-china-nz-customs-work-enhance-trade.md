Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says New Zealand and China Customs authorities are a step closer to establishing a system to enhance trade assurance and facilitation under the New Zealand China Free Trade Agreement.

Ms Wagner and NZ Customs officials met with the Vice Minister of the General Administration of China Customs Mr Sun Yibiao and his delegation in Auckland today to discuss facilitating trade and combating drug trafficking.

“Trade with China is critical to our economy, and it’s important that traders’ documents meet our trade partners’ standards to ensure exports travel smoothly,” Ms Wagner says.

“Both Customs administrations have committed to a joint electronic verification system that will provide greater assurance over documents used to gain tariff preference for our traders in China.

“Today we endorsed a plan to support electronic verification, something I am sure will help to further boost trade between our two countries.”

Both agencies have also been working closely together in recent years to combat the illegal trade of methamphetamine and its precursors from China through New Zealand Customs’ liaison officer based in Beijing.

“New Zealand and China will continue to participate in multilateral strategies and initiatives, particularly to combat drug trafficking,” Ms Wagner says.
