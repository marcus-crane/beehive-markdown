Transport Minister Simon Bridges has today turned the first sod of a $146 million dollar roading project that will better link the Auckland International Airport and the greater Auckland area.

The upgrade of State Highway 20A, George Bolt Memorial Drive, is one of the  Government's Accelerated Transport Infrastructure Improvements projects for Auckland, turning this key route from an expressway, into a motorway.

It’s the second of four Auckland projects announced by the Government last year in a $375 million funding package aimed at supporting both population and business growth in New Zealand’s busiest region.

"With freight volumes set to double in the next 20 years, it is critical we not only have a safe, reliable roading network, but also ensure vital links for the distribution of goods and services between the region’s ports and industrial areas," Mr Bridges says.

The existing interchange at State Highway 20A and Kirkbride Road is heavily congested during peak travel times and is expected to get worse with projected population and traveller growth.

"This redesign will provide an integrated transport network. It allows for a rail connection - either light or heavy rail - and a fully segregated, shared path for cyclists and pedestrians”.

A new, underground interchange at Kirkbride Road will divert traffic beneath the road for 580 metres.

"Accelerating this project, the Southern Corridor improvements, the Northern Corridor and the East West Connections will help ensure some of Auckland’s key routes - which provide the backbone to national economic growth and productivity - better serve the community and improve journey times,” Mr Bridges says.
