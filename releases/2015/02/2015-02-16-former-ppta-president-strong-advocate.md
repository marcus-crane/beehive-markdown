Education Minister Hekia Parata today paid tribute to Post Primary Teachers Association senior vice president Robin Duff who died this morning in Christchurch.

“While we did not always agree we certainly debated the issues and Robin was a strong advocate for his members’ views, which I respected. I know there will be many members of the PPTA who are saddened at his passing.”

“I extend my sympathies and condolences to his family and to the PPTA,” says Ms Parata.

Mr Duff, who started teaching in Christchurch in 1973, was a long serving member of the PPTA who held a number of leadership positions over the last decade. He was president of the PPTA for two terms, from 2007 to 2009 and from 2011 until 2013.

“Mr Duff was a member of our New Zealand delegation to the International Summit on the Teaching Profession in New York in 2012 and was one of the first members of my Cross-Sector Forum on Raising Achievement.”
