Youth Minister Nikki Kaye is pleased to welcome to New Zealand a delegation of 23 young people from Japan, who will be hosted at Parliament tonight as part of ‘Ship for World Youth 27’.

“This is a great programme funded by the government of Japan, which brings young people together from all over the world to develop young leaders and build cross-cultural friendship and understanding.”

Eleven countries participate in Ship for World Youth, which sees delegates travel to Japan to stay on a ship and take part in a range of educational, sporting and cultural activities, both on and off the ship.

“Ten young New Zealanders were privileged to be part of the Japan experience this year, and we’re proud to be one of four countries that will also host Japanese delegates for a country experience.

“There’s a great week of activities lined up in Wellington and Rotorua for both the New Zealand and Japanese delegates, based on the themes of environmental awareness and sustainability.

“Tomorrow’s leaders face a complex and changing world, and this programme is about opening young people’s minds to the diversity and challenges they will need to be comfortable with to succeed in the future.

“New Zealand is grateful to the Japanese government for providing this fantastic opportunity and $5 million towards our involvement, and we will do our best to provide our young visitors with an experience they will treasure.”
