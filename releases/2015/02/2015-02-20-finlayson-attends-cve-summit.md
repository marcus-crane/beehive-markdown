Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson represented New Zealand at the Ministerial meeting of the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism in Washington DC on 19 February.

The meeting, chaired by US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and addressed by President Obama, set an action agenda to counter violent extremism through community engagement.  

“In the current global environment, it is important that the international community comes together to develop best practice measures against violent extremism,” Mr Finlayson said.

Mr Finlayson addressed the meeting on the importance of strengthening the role of civil society in preventing violent extremism, particularly how to engage youth.

A Ministerial meeting communique will be available at a later stage.
