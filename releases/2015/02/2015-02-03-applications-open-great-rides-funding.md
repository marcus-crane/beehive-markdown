Prime Minister and Tourism Minister John Key has announced that further funding is now available for the improvement of New Zealand’s Great Rides.

Applications are now being accepted for the second round of funding available through the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund - a government initiative to maintain and enhance the Great Rides of Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

“Last year the Government announced that it is investing $8 million over four years to help maintain the quality of the Great Rides, which are the premier rides on the New Zealand Cycle Trail,” says Mr Key.

“Nearly $1 million in funding has already been approved, with 13 projects granted a total of $970,000 in December 2014.”

The fund is contestable and applicants need to provide matching funding.

Mr Key says proposals that aim to improve the safety and quality of the Great Rides will be given priority for funding.

“The New Zealand Cycle Trail is a significant tourism asset for New Zealand and has an enviable reputation. It is vital that individual trails are maintained to the highest possible standard in order to continue providing an excellent and safe experience for riders.”

More information on the Maintaining the Quality of Great Rides Fund, including how to apply, is available at [www.nzcycletrail.com/node/972](http://www.nzcycletrail.com/node/972)

The deadline for applications is 28 February 2015.
