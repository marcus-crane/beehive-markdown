Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today confirmed that the government will give $200,000 over three years to ASB Polyfest to ensure the event’s financial future.

Polyfest is the annual Auckland secondary schools Pacific cultural festival. It attracts around 9000 students and up to 100,000 spectators each year.

“Polyfest gives families and young people the chance to come together and share their cultural heritage through song, speech and dance. It is the largest Pacific youth festival in the country as well as one of the largest secondary schools events in the world,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“The cost of putting on the event has increased over the years and Cyclone Lusi also affected revenue and attendance at last year’s festival.”

The announcement delivers on a promise made by National last year and the extra funding will ensure that schools, parents and communities can continue to enjoy this popular festival.

“Celebrating our cultural identity is essential for the wellbeing of our children, families and the community. Funding to support and give certainty to this iconic event will help preserve our Pacific languages, culture and values,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

Polyfest will celebrate its 40th Anniversary at the Manukau Sports Bowl from 18-21 March 2015.

The festival celebrates the diverse cultures in the Auckland region and attracts schools and organisations from around New Zealand. Auckland secondary school students take part in performances which reflect their respective cultures, choreographed to the event theme.
