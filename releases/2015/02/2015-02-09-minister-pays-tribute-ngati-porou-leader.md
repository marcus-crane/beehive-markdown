Education Minister Hekia Parata today paid tribute to Ngati Porou leader Dr Apirana Mahuika who died today at his home in Kaiti, Gisborne, after a long illness.

“I extend my sympathies and condolences to his family and his hapū,” says Ms Parata, who is also Ngati Porou.

“He was an influential leader who devoted his life to fostering, strengthening and supporting the development aspirations of Maori. He took a particular interest in education. He recognised the transformative effect it could have on lives from pre-school right through to post graduate study. In doing so he followed in the footstep of his namesake Sir Apirana Ngata. I am sure all iwi will mourn his loss.

“At a personal level he was always supportive and encouraging and I took great heart from the fact that he chose as the subject of his masters’ thesis the influence of women leaders in Ngati Porou.”
