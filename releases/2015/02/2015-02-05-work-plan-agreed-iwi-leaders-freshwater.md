A programme of work on improving the management of freshwater has been agreed between the Government and iwi leaders in Kerikeri today, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith confirmed.

“Freshwater is one of New Zealand’s most important resources and the Government is committed to improving how it is managed. Iwi have long raised concerns about water quality, how water is allocated and want their kaitiaki responsibilities better recognised,” Dr Smith says.

“We have committed to a work programme on engaging with the Freshwater Iwi Leaders Group, which will involve case studies, new local clean-up initiatives and policy improvements so as to better manage New Zealand’s rivers, lakes and groundwater.

“The Government’s policy is that nobody owns the water. Nor is a national settlement like that achieved on fisheries being considered. Freshwater issues, such as nutrients, sediment, *E.coli* and allocation vary so significantly around the country that solutions have to be worked out on a catchment by catchment basis.

“Iwi have an important role to play in improving New Zealanders’ freshwater management with rights and interests in water quality as well as economic development. This work programme is about developing a better way for iwi to be involved in freshwater planning, allocation, pollution control, storage, and clean-up.

“This latest work builds on the collaborative process led by the Land and Water Forum in which iwi played a pivotal role to produce New Zealand’s first National Policy Statement on Freshwater. Our ambition with iwi is to publish a discussion document for wider public input later this year, which will set out the next steps on improving New Zealand’s freshwater management.”
