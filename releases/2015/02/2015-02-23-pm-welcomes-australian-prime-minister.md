Prime Minister John Key welcomes this week’s first official visit to New Zealand by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

“I am very pleased to be able to welcome Prime Minister Abbott to New Zealand. His visit will continue a long-standing tradition of regular and substantive contact between the Prime Ministers of our two countries,” says Mr Key.   

“During the visit we will hold our Annual Leaders’ meeting and discuss a range of political, economic, social and security issues, including advancing the single economic market, our engagement in regional trade initiatives and our cooperation on global defence and security issues.

“We will also mark significant milestones, including the Centenary of the First World War and the formation of the ANZACs, and Australia and New Zealand’s co-hosting of the Cricket World Cup.’’

The Prime Ministers and Ministers from both sides of the Tasman will participate in the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum on Friday which brings together Australian and New Zealand business and government leaders. This year the Leadership Forum celebrates its tenth anniversary.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will meet with Foreign Minister Murray McCully, and Australian Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb and Trade Minister Tim Groser will lead the annual Closer Economic Relations (CER) Ministerial Meeting.

During the visit the Prime Ministers will also lay a wreath at the Auckland War Memorial, attend the Australia v New Zealand Cricket World Cup match and meet with Rural Fire Service Officers who have served in Australia.
