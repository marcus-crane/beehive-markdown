The Rules Reduction Taskforce is underway with the announcement of Taskforce members and public meetings to begin in March to consider submissions. 

Local Government Minister Paula Bennett today announced the nine members of the Taskforce, who will join co-chairs Jacqui Dean MP, Parliamentary Private Secretary for Local Government, and Michael Barnett ONZM, Chief Executive of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce.

“The Rules Reduction Taskforce has been set up to get rid of loopy property rules and regulations that are stopping people from getting on with the job,” says Mrs Bennett.

“The members appointed today have a wealth of experience across the building and trades sectors as well as central and local government. I’ve asked them to hold public hearings around the country, as well as consider submissions made online, and come back to the Government outlining areas where we can make improvements and cut red tape.”

Members are:

- Jacqui Dean MP (co-chair)
- Michael Barnett ONZM (co-chair)
- Christopher Burke
- Hon John Carter QSO
- Stephen Halliwell
- Hon Tau Henare
- Philippa Murdoch
- Rachel Reese
- Mark Thomas
- Connal Townsend JP
- Ian Tulloch QSO, JP

“There’s a great deal of frustration out there from people looking to build, redevelop or make home improvements, who are being held back by confusing, costly rules which have long since lost their relevance,” says Mrs Bennett.

“We believe there are quick fixes we can make in the short-term, and some longer-term work we can do, to make things more efficient and straightforward for people. It will also be an opportunity to determine which rules should stay or be strengthened.”     

A series of public meetings will take place across New Zealand between March and May. Information on these can be found on the Taskforce’s Facebook page ([facebook.com/cutredtapenz](http://facebook.com/cutredtapenz)) and Twitter (@CutRedTapeNZ).
