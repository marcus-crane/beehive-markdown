Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says working with China Customs to establish their own cash detector dog training programme will benefit both countries.

A delegation from the General Administration of China Customs, led by Vice Minister, Mr Sun Yibiao, was in Auckland this week and received an overview of Customs’ training programme and a demonstration of cash dogs in action.

“By working together Customs administrations can collectively strengthen the border security of both countries by targeting the movement of the proceeds of crime,” Ms Wagner says.

“Trans-national crime syndicates often move cash across borders and intercepting hidden or undeclared cash contributes to the disruption of these syndicates and can uncover criminal networks.

“The NZ Customs Detector Dog Training Programme has been working with China and Hong Kong Customs over the past six months to help establish a cash detector dog capability for both agencies.

“Trainers from New Zealand Customs will provide assistance to China when they begin training their dogs.

“New Zealand Customs began training cash detector dogs in 2012.  Since the introduction of dual trained drug and cash detector dogs $5 million dollars has been detected at the border and on search warrant activity,” Ms Wagner says.
