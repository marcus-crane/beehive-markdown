“New Zealand is assisting Pacific Island countries to develop their responses to climate change,” said Minister for Climate Change Issues Tim Groser.

A two-day workshop for Pacific Island countries is being hosted in Auckland by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry for the Environment.

“Climate change is an international problem affecting all nations,” says Mr Groser.

“Pacific islands are some of the most vulnerable to its impacts. They are also playing a leadership role in terms of action.

“In December countries will meet in Paris to establish a new international climate change agreement. Each nation has been asked to decide what individual contribution it can make, based on its own circumstances.

At the workshop New Zealand will share how it is developing its contribution for the Paris meeting and hear about the experiences of Pacific Island countries as they work on their responses.

“If we can help Pacific Island nations to formulate targets that make sense in terms of their priorities this will help ensure the Paris agreement will deliver a durable, globally effective climate change agreement,” says Mr Groser.

“The likely energy sector focus of Pacific Island nations’ response to climate change fits well with New Zealand’s support for sustainable economic development in the region, including through the NZ$100 million we are investing in clean, efficient and affordable energy in the Pacific and further afield.

“This also builds on the EU-NZ Energy Access Partnership launched in March 2013 at the Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland that is supporting a number of Pacific Island Countries to implement renewable energy initiatives.”
