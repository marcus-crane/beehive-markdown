A Bill to speed up justice and modernise New Zealand’s courts has passed its second reading in Parliament today.

Justice Minister Amy Adams says the Judicature Modernisation Bill supports the Government’s commitment to delivering a 21st Century justice system.

“New Zealand has a strong, well-functioning justice system. However society and technology are changing rapidly and it’s increasingly clear that it must be modernised if it is to deliver in a 21st century world,” says Ms Adams.

“This Bill will improve transparency and efficiency of the court system, and enhance public trust and confidence in the justice system.”

Some of the new measures introduced by the Bill include:

- increasing the use of technology in courts and tribunals
- extending the District Court’s jurisdiction to allow it to deal with civil cases where the amount in dispute is up to $350,000, rather than the current threshold of $200,000
- requiring the Judiciary to publish information on the numbers of outstanding judgments beyond a reasonable time and how a party can obtain information about a reserved judgment
- increasing courts’ options to limit litigation by people with a history of taking meritless proceedings a new interest on money claims act to provide greater certainty for the compensation of creditors
- requiring written court judgments to be published online, unless there is a good reason not to.

Ms Adams acknowledged the amendments made to the Bill as a result of the Justice and Electoral Committee’s consideration.

“I welcome the amendments made to the Bill by the Justice and Electoral Select Committee. I also thank everyone who made submissions to the Committee,” says Ms Adams.
