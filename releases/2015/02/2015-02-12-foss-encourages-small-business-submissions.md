Small Business Minister Craig Foss is encouraging small business owners to make submissions to the Rules Reduction Taskforce.

“Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) interact with government agencies about 9 million times every year, giving them valuable insight into the efficacy of many of our rules and regulations,” Mr Foss says. 

“While the Taskforce is primarily focused on property regulations administered by local authorities, unnecessary or pedantic rules administered by central government will also be considered.

“These silly and sometimes contradictory rules, even within the same region, stymie business development.

“New Zealand is a country of small businesses.  Reducing red tape will make it easier to do business and help the New Zealand economy grow.

“I encourage small businesses to submit their suggestions online at [www.govt.nz/rulesreduction](http://www.govt.nz/rulesreduction), by 1 June 2015.”

A series of public meetings will also take place across New Zealand between March and May. Information on these can be found on the Taskforce’s Facebook page (facebook.com/cutredtapenz) and Twitter (@CutRedTapeNZ).
