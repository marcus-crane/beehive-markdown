Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says patients in mental health wards are the latest to benefit from an innovative programme that frees up staff to spend more time looking after patients.

“The success of the Productive Ward programme in hospitals is being extended to some of our largest mental health units,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Productive Series programmes guide staff to streamline systems so they can spend more time in direct contact with patients.

“Staff in a Waikato DHB mental health ward improved time spent on direct patient care as a result of a range of changes, including ensuring equipment is conveniently located and patient information is easily accessible.”

17 DHBs are implementing one or more of the Productive Series programmes including the Productive Ward, the Productive Mental Health Ward, the Productive Community Services, and the Productive Operating Theatre.

“These programmes guide staff to review and change the way they work, and help to deliver cost and time savings, improved quality of care, and improved staff morale,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Productive Series is making a quantifiable difference. For example, in a Hawke’s Bay specialist surgery unit, a new more focused user-friendly nursing admission form is expected to save 267 hours of nursing time a year.”

The Ministry of Health is supporting uptake of the Productive Series, including providing financial support to DHBs to access training materials. A national workshop will be held in Wellington in March to share learnings and encourage expansion of the programmes.
