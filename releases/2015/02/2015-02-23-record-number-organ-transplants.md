Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the number of organ donors and transplants reached a record high last year.

“I want to acknowledge the generosity of donors and their families and the dedication of staff in making such a difference to so many lives,” says Dr Coleman.

Figures released today by Organ Donation New Zealand (ODNZ) revealed that the number of New Zealanders receiving an organ transplant rose from 175 in 2013 to 214 in 2014, a 22 per cent increase.

This includes an increase in kidney donation from live donors, which is up from an average of 56 per year over the last decade to 72 in 2014.

“The Government is committed to increasing organ donation numbers and a number of strategies are being employed to help improve transplantation rates,” says Dr Coleman.

Budget 2014 allocated $4 million over four years to set up a National Renal Transplant Service to increase the number of live kidney donor transplantations. The funding covers donor liaison co-ordinators and continuation of the New Zealand Kidney Exchange programme.

Last year's funding increase builds on the $4 million invested in Budget 2012 to raise awareness and encourage more people to donate organs.

This includes $1.8 million being spent over three years to fund the Clinical Research and Effective Practice Foundation to help overcome barriers to live donor kidney transplantation in Pasifika and Maori patients.

“The Ministry will continue to work closely with ODNZ and our clinical services in supporting further developments in transplantation,” says Dr Coleman.
