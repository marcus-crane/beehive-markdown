Conservation Minister Maggie Barry has today announced the Department of Conservation’s 2015 Community Conservation Partnerships Fund is open for submissions.

The fund was established in 2014 to provide $26 million over four years for community-led conservation projects around New Zealand.

“I am delighted that funding is being made available to communities to support their valuable conservation work. The first year has been a huge success with $8.5 million granted to a diverse range of 107 conservation projects nationwide,” says Ms Barry.

From 23 February, community groups will be able to submit expressions of interest to DOC.

“The projects funded so far have been extremely varied, from tackling invasive weed species, to protecting and increasing kiwi populations, and preventing the spread of kauri dieback on the Coromandel Peninsula,” says Ms Barry.

Other funded projects include pest management initiatives, plant and wetland restoration and maintenance of back country facilities.
