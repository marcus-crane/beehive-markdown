Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the five winners of a prestigious tertiary scholarship in honour of the 28th Māori Battalion.

The Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund Board, which is chaired by Ms Parata, has been supporting future Māori leaders to succeed in education since 1948.

“This scholarship commemorates the brave men of the 28th (Māori) Battalion and this year’s recipients exemplify the same traits that earned the Battalion an honoured place in New Zealand’s history,” says Ms Parata.

“They demonstrate determination, service and leadership, and I’m confident that they will honour the spirit and sacrifice of the soldiers by making their own contribution to their whānau, hapū, iwi and country, just like the soldiers did.”

Among this year’s winners of the annual scholarship are aspiring psychologists, doctors and an environmental scientist.

A total of 86 applications were received in the 2014/15 round; 67 undergraduate, 13 masters, and six doctoral.

“Of the 86 applications we received this round, these five exceptional winners stood out and have shown other young Māori what can be achieved through belief, commitment and hard work,” says Ms Parata.

All winners will be recognised at an awards ceremony in April 2015.

Applications for the 2015/16 tertiary scholarship round will open on 1 July 2015 and close in September.
