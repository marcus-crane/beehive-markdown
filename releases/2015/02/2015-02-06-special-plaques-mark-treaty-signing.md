Education Minister Hekia Parata says all new schools and early childhood centres opening this year are being offered special plaques to acknowledge the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“The commemorative plaques are just one of several initiatives developed to help schools to mark a milestone in New Zealand’s history.

“Education plays a critical role in nation building so it’s important that our kids, schools and communities are involved in the commemorations.

“Among the other initiatives is the establishment of a website by the Ministry of Education ([www.waitangi.tki.org.nz](http://www.waitangi.tki.org.nz/)) where people can find resources about the Treaty. Schools and communities can also publish their own commemorative projects on the site for others to learn from and enjoy.

“Many new schools are also taking up the Ministry’s offer to provide bilingual signage in their schools, often developed in partnership with the local iwi.”

Ms Parata says the Māori Histories Project underway in schools is also due for release later in the year. The project details best practice examples of teaching New Zealand history including the Treaty of Waitangi.

Ms Parata says the Education Review Office, New Zealand Qualifications Authority, Careers New Zealand and the Tertiary Education Commission will also be joining the Ministry in supporting Treaty 175 commemorations.
