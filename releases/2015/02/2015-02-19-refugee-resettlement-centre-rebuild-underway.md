Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse has marked the rebuild of the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre at a sod-turning ceremony this morning.

The Government announced the rebuild of Mangere in the 2013 and 2014 Budgets with estimated project costs of around $21 million.

“The existing facilities at Mangere were built during the Second World War and are in desperate need of replacement. I’m delighted that today’s ceremony officially marks the start of a new revamped Mangere,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The rebuild of the Centre demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to preparing refugees for living and working in New Zealand and making a positive contribution to their new country.

“Improving the Centre facilities will help achieve the aim of the Refugee Resettlement Strategy that was launched by the Government in December 2012 by supporting the closer working relationships of onsite agencies.

“The Strategy is aimed at delivering better outcomes for refugees settling in New Zealand. The goals include increasing the number of refugees in paid employment, increasing the educational achievement of refugee school leavers and ensuring better use of GP services and greater access to mental health services.”

The Government has contracted with a private sector consortium led by Downer New Zealand to design and build the new Centre facilities.

The new facility will accommodate up to 196 beds, and include provision to accommodate up to 300 individuals if required. It is being rebuilt in stages to enable “business as usual” operations to continue during the construction period.

The new buildings should be complete and ready for use by the second half of next year.
