Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is encouraging people to head along to the ICC Cricket World Cup team welcomes organised by the seven New Zealand host cities.

“New Zealand is really getting behind this major international event. The team welcomes are a fantastic opportunity for fans to meet some of the world’s top cricket players,” says Dr Coleman.

The seven New Zealand host cities are Hamilton, Dunedin, Wellington, Christchurch, Auckland, Nelson and Napier.

Over the next three weeks they will be hosting nine of the 14 teams in the tournament which New Zealand is co-hosting with Australia.

The team welcomes are each timed to fit in with each team’s training and match schedule.

“The spectacular opening ceremony and first day match in Christchurch has been a fantastic start to the tournament,” says Dr Coleman.

“Hamilton put on a warm welcome for Zimbabwe yesterday, and today is sure to be another highlight as Dunedin welcomes Scotland.

“With around 30,000 international visitors expected and a television audience of over a billion people, this tournament is putting New Zealand centre stage.”

Further information about the teams being hosted and details of the team welcoming can be found on the local city council website.
