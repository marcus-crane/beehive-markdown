Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced that nominations are now open for the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand (EDUCANZ).

EDUCANZ is the new independent professional body that will replace the New Zealand Teachers Council later this year.

“EDUCANZ is a quantum step for the New Zealand education profession. It will act in the interests of teachers, principals and educators across the education system from early childhood through to senior secondary,” says Ms Parata.

The new council will be charged with continuously raising the quality of the profession from initial teacher education to ever-increasing expertise on clearly defined career pathways, ensuring the highest standards of professional conduct and safety of students, advocacy for professional learning and development of the profession, and partnering in education research and policy.

“Nominations are encouraged from anyone with a strong interest in the development and strengthening of the education profession. All appointments will be on the basis of skills, experience and knowledge.

“Members will act in the interests of the education profession as a whole, rather than any one sector group.

“It’s an exciting time to be involved in education. Student achievement continues to rise and the Investing in Educational Success initiative signals a new era of collaboration in raising the quality of teaching and leadership from early childhood to senior secondary.

“I am confident the nominations process for EDUCANZ will attract huge interest and a high calibre of nominees.”

The EDUCANZ governing council will have nine members, at least five of whom must be registered teachers with current practising certificates. One of the nine will be appointed chair of the council.

Nominations close on 26 March. An 0800 number (0800 EDUCANZ) has been set up for those without internet access who wish to get involved or find out more.
