Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says people with rare disorders will benefit from Pharmac’s new funding approach for rare disorders medicines.

Pharmac has announced that 28 proposals from eight suppliers emerged from its request for proposals for rare disorders medicines.

“Pharmac’s new process for rare disorders medicines aims to encourage competition and remove barriers to better access to rare disorders medicines,” says Dr Coleman.

“Providing access to medicines for very small groups of patients is a shared responsibility. It is encouraging that so many suppliers have stepped up and engaged with Pharmac to develop new funding options.

“I look forward to Pharmac concluding negotiations over the next few months so that New Zealanders can gain benefits from these medicines.”

Pharmac has identified up to $5 million per year for the next five years for funding a rare disorders contestable pilot. Proposals from suppliers were sought in August 2014.

Each medicine funding proposal will be subject to public consultation. The first decisions are likely to be made in mid 2015.
