Foreign Minister Murray McCully today called on all parties involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine to abide by the conditions of the ceasefire.

“The ceasefire generally seems to be holding, however, there are troubling reports of continued fighting in Debaltseve,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand calls on President Putin to continue to use his influence to ensure all separatist groups fully observe the ceasefire.

“While it is still early days, the ceasefire provides a glimmer of hope after months of intensifying conflict, growing hostilities and a worsening humanitarian situation.

“All parties must now follow through on their commitments and refrain from further violence.

“New Zealand has consistently called for an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, including in the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.
