Education Minister Hekia Parata and Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye today announced the government will invest up to $20.5 million in the redevelopment of Koru School in Māngere, Auckland.

“This is a major redevelopment that will see all of the school’s existing 27 classrooms replaced with 31 new teaching spaces, as well as construction of a new library, administration building and hall,” says Ms Parata.

“Koru School has faced significant issues resulting from leaky and ageing buildings, and this investment will ensure the school can provide teachers and students with a modern, inspiring learning environment.

“The Koru School redevelopment is part of a broader investment of approximately $300 million over six years, to assist around 30 schools facing complex infrastructure issues.”

Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye visited Koru School this morning to share the good news about the redevelopment.

“The government has put particular effort into improving the quality of learning environments in South Auckland, where $150 million has been invested towards enhancing existing schools over the last six years.

“The children at Koru School have been achieving great results in an environment that’s one third relocatable classrooms, and I’m thrilled they can now look forward to fantastic new facilities that will support their learning in a digital age.

“It’s my expectation that work will begin quickly this year towards construction of the new school.”

**About Koru School**

Koru School is a decile 1, full primary (years 1-8) school. It has a roll of 545 students (as at August 2014) projected to grow in the future.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.

**Current school redevelopment in Mangere**

Māngere East Primary School and Māngere Central School have benefitted with $6 million of redevelopment in 2014, and $26.5 million is being invested in the Southern Cross Campus.
