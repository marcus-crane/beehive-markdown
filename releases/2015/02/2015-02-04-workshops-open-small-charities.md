Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the news that 875 small charities have registered for a nationwide series of workshops about the new reporting standards, coming into effect from 1 April this year. 

All registered charities report annually to Charities Services, but previously the quality and content of the reporting was not specified. As well as financial information, charities must now report on their years achievements. 

“There are approximately 27,000 registered charities in New Zealand, reporting a total annual income of $16.8 billion. However, many charities are small - about half of all registered charities have a gross income less than $50,000,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Under the new standards, smaller charities will be able to supply their financial details using simple format accounting, rather than meeting the standards required of larger charities.”

“Registrations opened today for those charities with an operating expenditure of less than $2 million to take part in workshops to help them understand how to comply with the new reporting requirements.”

“Being a registered charity brings benefits and provides confidence to donors and supporters, but charities also have an obligation to be well managed and disclose information to the public,” Mrs Goodhew says. “It is fantastic so many small charities have enrolled in these workshops on the first day of registration.”
