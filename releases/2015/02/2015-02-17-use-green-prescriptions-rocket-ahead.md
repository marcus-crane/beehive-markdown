Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the health benefits of Green Prescriptions continue to be demonstrated, as more and more people take medical advice to get fit and eat well to help tackle their health problems.

“The Green Prescriptions initiative is going from strength to strength. Three quarters of patients who were issued with a Green Prescription in 2014 said they had experienced positive health changes as a result,” says Dr Coleman.

Patients with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, or those who are overweight or with health problems such as high blood pressure can get a Green Prescription from their GP or practice nurse.

These prescriptions contain advice on nutrition and physical activity to help manage their condition and reduce the risk of developing complications. Local initiatives range from cooking classes to motivational texts and boot camps.

In the last three months of 2014 more than 11,000 Green Prescriptions were issued, up from 9,272 in the same period last year.

This year close to 50,000 referrals are expected for people to receive support to get more active and eat healthier food.

“Obesity and diabetes are some of our greatest health challenges,” says Dr Coleman.

“We are working in partnership with regional sports trusts, primary health organisations and agencies like Diabetes NZ to make sure that people get the support they need to lead a healthier life and enjoy it too.”
