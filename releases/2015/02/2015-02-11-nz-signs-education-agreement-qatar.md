Tertiary Education, Skills & Employment Minister, Steven Joyce, has welcomed the signing of an agreement to strengthen New Zealand’s education relationship with Qatar.

Associate Minister of Trade, Todd McClay, and the State of Qatar’s Minister for Education and Higher Education, Dr. Mohammed Al-Hammadi, signed the agreement in Doha.

"Qatar is investing significantly in the future of its education sector and is becoming an increasingly important market for New Zealand export education organisations.

"This agreement provides an important platform to secure further international education growth opportunities, and is a testament to our high quality education system,” says Mr McClay.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says export education, New Zealand's fifth largest export earner valued at $2.85 billion, is vital to the continuing growth of both the economy and the education sector.

"It's essential that we build on the education industry’s strong performance by maximising our opportunities in the competitive international education market. Formal agreements such as this one are important contributors to New Zealand’s reputation," says Mr Joyce.

The agreement follows ongoing bilateral talks between New Zealand and Qatar.

The agreement provides for collaborative projects and activities in many areas of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Technical and Vocational Education, and Education.

New Zealand and Qatar have also agreed to encourage institutional networking, and the exchange of officials and personnel.

Mr McClay is on a visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where he is meeting with a range of government and commercial representatives and returns to New Zealand on February 15.
