Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee has granted permission for the New Zealand Defence Force to undertake specific contingency training for a possible deployment to Iraq.

The training will take place at Linton and Waiouru. 

“Cabinet agreed on 3 November 2014 for up to 10 military planners to be deployed to determine whether New Zealand could play a role in helping the Iraqi Defence Force build capacity to fight ISIL,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Those personnel continue to assess the possible nature and location of a mission to train Iraqi Defence Forces.

“They are doing their own reconnaissance as well as working alongside the Australian Defence Force.

“While the team’s work is not complete, I have accepted the Chief of Defence Force’s request to begin specific training for a possible Building Partner Capacity role in Iraq.

“This does not pre-empt any Cabinet decisions, but is prudent given Defence officials are close to providing final advice on a possible mission.

“Contingency training will cover areas such as force protection, cultural awareness and skills relevant to a possible deployment.

“Should there be a deployment, our first objective must be to keep our Defence Force personnel as safe as possible,” Mr Brownlee says.
