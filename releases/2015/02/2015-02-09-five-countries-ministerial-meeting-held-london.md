Minister responsible for the intelligence agencies, Christopher Finlayson, represented New Zealand at the second Five Countries' Ministerial meeting held in London on 6 February.

Mr Finlayson, the United Kingdom’s Home Secretary, United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Australia’s Attorney-General and Canada’s Public Safety Minister, met to discuss issues of common concern, including counter-terrorism, countering violent extremism, foreign fighters, cyber threats, information sharing and other topics.

"Our countries are all addressing similar issues in our different jurisdictions," said Mr Finlayson. "In the current international environment, it is more important than ever that we continue the successful co-operation that has characterised the relationship between our five countries for so long."

The five ministers agreed to continue to meet to address issues of mutual concern. The next meeting will be in Canada in 2016.
