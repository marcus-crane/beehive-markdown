Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew announced today that $231,000 of funding will be shared by seven community groups under the Community Internship Programme.

“Community groups often require experienced and skilled professionals to help manage projects, develop business plans, and form marketing strategies,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“This funding means groups can employ people with the specialist skills they require to help them achieve clearly identified objectives.”

The seven community groups who will benefit from this latest funding round are Canterbury Men’s Centre, Life Unlimited Charitable Trust, Methodist Mission Southern, Te Kaahui O Rauru, The Asthma Foundation, The Wellington Boys’ and Girls’ Institute, and Volunteer Resource Centre Manawatu & Districts.

“Some of the outcomes that will be achieved this year include a software system up-scale for Methodist Mission Southern, an asset map of natural resources and business plan for Te Kaahui O Rauru, and a strategy document for the Asthma Foundation,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The Community Internship Programme was established in 2001, and has provided 110 internships across a variety of non-profit organisations. More information is on [www.communitymatters.govt.nz](http://www.communitymatters.govt.nz).
