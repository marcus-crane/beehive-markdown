Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says applications are now being taken for the Māori Health Development Scheme 2015/16.

“This is an important scheme which works to increase the capacity and capability of Māori health and disability providers,” says Dr Coleman.

“The scheme is allocated $8.89 million each year which is spread over two programme areas – Māori health and disability provider development, and Hauora Māori Scholarships.”

Māori health and disability providers have used the funding to improve infrastructure, achieve service integration, improve the quality of services and develop workforce skills.

The Hauora Māori Scholarships assists a minimum of 535 people each year who are studying across a range of fields such as nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, physiotherapy and social work.

In 2014 for the medical category alone, 147 Māori medical students were awarded a scholarship – an increase of 50 percent since 2009.

“The Māori health workforce is a big asset for our health system and it needs our continued support in order to respond to Māori health needs,” says Dr Coleman.

A portion of the 2015/16 funding is already committed in multi-year contracting agreements signed in 2013/14.

Further information about the scheme and applications forms can be found on the Ministry of Health website, [www.health.govt.nz](http://www.health.govt.nz). Applications close midday 13 March.
