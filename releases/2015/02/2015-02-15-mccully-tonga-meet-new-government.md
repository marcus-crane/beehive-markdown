Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Tonga tomorrow to meet with Prime Minister ‘Akilisi Pohiva and his new government.

“Tonga is one of our closest neighbours and we enjoy a very strong relationship built around a large Tongan population in New Zealand, development cooperation, and working together at the Pacific Islands Forum,” Mr McCully says.

“This will be my first visit to Tonga since their election late last year and it is an opportunity to discuss the new government’s priorities and how we can support their development objectives.

“Our aid programme in Tonga is currently focused on support for basic education and policing, private sector development, and in particular the development of renewable energy generation,” Mr McCully says.
