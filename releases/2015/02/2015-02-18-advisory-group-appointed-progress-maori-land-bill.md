Māori Development Minister, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell is pleased to announce the appointment of a Ministerial Advisory Group to progress the introduction of new Māori land legislation this year.

The Bill will replace Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.  

“I am committed to ensuring that the final details of this Bill are informed by the practical experience of people involved closely with Māori land matters and that Māori are engaged throughout the process,” says Mr Flavell.

More than 1.4 million hectares (around five percent of New Zealand’s land mass) is Māori-owned land. Around 80 percent of that land is considered under-utilised and the current legislation is regarded as a major barrier to its optimum use.

“Our intention is to empower Māori at the regional and national level to advance their aspirations and development of their land within a more supportive framework.”

The Ministerial Advisory Group appointments are Kingi Smiler (Chair), Matanuku Mahuika, Traci Houpapa, Spencer Webster, Linda Te Aho, Sacha McMeeking and Dr Tanira Kingi.

Mr Flavell expects the bill will also create a streamlined land administration system that puts the Māori landowner first.

“I am committed to ensuring that Crown agencies also support Māori land owners with better utilisation of their land. I plan to have discussions with Ministers about the most effective and efficient way to advance, and expand the services to Māori land owners,” says Mr Flavell.
