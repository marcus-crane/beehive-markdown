Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce today announced that the Government is investing $420,000 from the Major Events Development Fund (MEDF) in the 2015 and 2016 Crankworx Rotorua Mountain Bike Festivals.

Crankworx, the world’s biggest mountain bike festival, will be held in Rotorua from 25 to 29 March this year, and on similar dates in 2016. Whistler and the French Alps have previously hosted the popular event.

“The Crankworx Rotorua Festival is an excellent addition to New Zealand’s growing international events schedule,” Mr Joyce says.

“It will attract the world’s best mountain biking pro-athletes to compete on New Zealand’s impressive mountain bike trails, with more than 1300 international visitors expected to travel to New Zealand next month to support the event.

“In addition it is anticipated that a number of riders will be staying on in New Zealand to participate in other cycling events such as the Rotorua and Queenstown Bike Festivals.”

The Government invests, through the MEDF, in major events that generate significant immediate and long-term benefits to New Zealand. 

“We are committed to working with New Zealand's major events sector to help attract and grow high-quality major events around the country that deliver economic, social and cultural benefits and promote New Zealand to the world," Mr Joyce says.
