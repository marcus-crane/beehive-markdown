Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed news that the project to install audio visual links (AVL) in prisons is complete.

This means many prisoners can appear in court without leaving prison.

“Using AVL technology for prisoners’ court appearances improves safety for the public, judges, court and Corrections staff who may be at risk from violent prisoners,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

Other benefits of appearing by AVL include reducing escape risks and lowering the cost and time associated with transporting prisoners to court. It also reduces the risk of contraband being smuggled into prisons and protects prisoners from intimidation to carry contraband.

Twelve prisons which hold remand prisoners have the AVL technology, along with Auckland Prison (at Paremoremo) which holds the highest risk prisoners.  The latest prison to join the AVL network is Rimutaka, in Upper Hutt.

The technology is particularly useful for remand prisoners who typically have more court appearances.

Around 40,000 remand hearings take place each year. Each appearance requires considerable resources in transporting prisoners to court and carries a degree of risk.

Court escorts reduced by nearly 5,000 over the last year due to the AVL technology, and this is increasing.

The AVL network is used mainly for procedural hearings, such as list appearances, call-overs and bail hearings. It can also be used for trials, with the consent of the defendant.

“I’m pleased to hear that prisons are reporting significant increases in productivity as a result of having AVL suites installed,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Prisoners are spending more time at rehabilitation and reintegration activities as they do not have to leave prison to attend court.”

The court sites where AVL was installed were identified as providing the greatest benefit, taking into account prisoner volumes, distance between prisons and courts and overnight stays.

The AVL technology is also used for Parole hearings and to allow prisoners and their families to keep in touch.

The cost of installing the latest phase of AVL was $10.68M.

The AVL programme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Corrections and is enabled by the Courts (Remote Participation) Act.
