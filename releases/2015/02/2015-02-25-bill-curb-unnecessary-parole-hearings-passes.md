The Bill reducing the number of unnecessary parole hearings for offenders who still pose a threat to the community passed its third and final reading in Parliament last night.

Justice Minister Amy Adams welcomed the progress of the Parole Amendment Bill, which implements the Government’s plan to reduce the number of parole hearings where the offender has little prospect of release.

The Bill also includes a range of measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the parole system.

“Currently up to 800 parole hearings that do not need to take place are held each year,” says Ms Adams.

“On average, each offender has three hearings before they are approved for release, and a third of all offenders have four or more hearings.”

The Bill increases the maximum interval between hearings from one year to two years. For serious offenders on indeterminate sentences – such as life imprisonment or preventive detention – or sentences of 10 or more years, the maximum time between parole hearings increases from three to five years.

“These changes will give the Parole Board greater flexibility in scheduling future hearings, so that they align with and can take account of whether an offender has completed rehabilitative programmes and relevant activities.”

“It serves little purpose to hold hearings if an offender hasn’t yet addressed the reasons for their offending and continues to pose a risk to the community.

“These hearings also cause unnecessary stress and anxiety for victims, as they relive the offence again and again.

“The Bill allows hearings to be brought forward if offenders complete relevant activities. This provides incentives for prisoners to address their offending.”
