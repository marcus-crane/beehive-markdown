Prime Minister John Key has announced a week of Anzac commemoration events in Wellington marking the centenary of the First World War Gallipoli landings.

“In the last decade, the number of New Zealanders attending Anzac Day services has risen significantly and this year holds a special significance,” Mr Key said.

Centenary commemorations begin with the official opening of Pukeahu National War Memorial Park on Saturday April 18.

Mr Key said Pukeahu belonged to all New Zealanders and recognises service in all conflicts.

“It is a place to reflect on our country’s experience of war and military conflict and to honour the more than 30,000 New Zealanders who died, and the more than 300,000 who have served their country.”   

Mr Key said Pukeahu includes the Hall of Memories, Carillon and Tomb of the Unknown Warrior and sits on top of the new Arras traffic tunnel.

Other highlights of Anzac Week in Wellington include a street parade of First World War vehicles and a sound and light show.

The week will culminate in the Anzac Day Dawn Service and the National Service of Commemoration at Pukeahu.

“It’s a time to honour those who served, remember those who died and it’s also a chance to deepen our understanding of a formative event in New Zealand’s history.”
