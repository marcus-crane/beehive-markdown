Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith has welcomed today’s release of building consent figures for January 2015 from Statistics New Zealand, which show the number of consents issued for the first month of the year at a seven-year high.

“Today’s figures show the strongest start to the year for building consents since 2008. January tends to be a typically quiet month for consenting, but the 1703 consents issued nationwide this January is an increase of 3.6 per cent on the previous year, and amounts to nearly $1 billion of total building work,” Dr Smith says.

“We are seeing this positive trend reflected in Auckland and Christchurch, where the housing supply and affordability challenge is most acute. The number of consents issued in Auckland last month is the highest for the month of January in nine years, and shows an increase of 11 per cent from January 2014. The 300 residential building consents issued in Christchurch this year is at an all-time high for the month of January.

“I also welcome the trend of a larger proportion of new homes being apartments and townhouses, because they are part of the solution to the housing challenge in New Zealand’s major cities.

“These latest figures confirm the direction of the work programme the Government’s has underway to address the housing challenge. We now have Housing Accords in place with six local councils to free up more land faster. We have initiatives in place to constrain building materials costs, rein in development contributions, cut compliance costs and invest in improved sector productivity.

“The Government remains focused maintaining this pace and momentum. Our KiwiSaver HomeStart scheme comes into effect on 1 April, and will assist 90,000 first home buyers to put together a deposit on a house.

“Another key priority is our planned second phase of Resource Management Act reforms, which will be legislated this year to resolve the long-term issues affecting housing affordability and supply. We are also working on further initiatives for Auckland and Christchurch.

“The Government is committed to supporting more New Zealanders into their own home.”
