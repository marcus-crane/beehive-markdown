Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says World Cancer Day helps to highlight the global initiatives to deliver better, faster cancer care.

“Today is an opportunity to raise awareness about the fight against cancer, and this year the ‘World Cancer Day 2015 - Not Beyond Us’ campaign focuses on solutions that are within reach,” says Dr Coleman.

“Better cancer services are a priority for the Government. The NZ Cancer Plan 2015-18 brings together all of the work of the past six years and looks ahead to what needs to be done to ensure people with cancer receive even better, faster care.”

An important part of the Cancer Plan is the new 62-day Faster Cancer Treatment Target. The aim of the target is that 90 per cent of patients are to receive their first treatment within 62 days of being referred urgently with a high suspicion of cancer by June 2017.

The Government has invested almost $63 million on the faster cancer treatment programme over the last six years. Key initiatives include:

- Under the Cancer Service Improvement Fund, $11.2 million is being allocated over four years to projects run by DHBs and regional cancer networks to improve the quality of care and support developments.
- The appointment of 60 Cancer Nurse Coordinators across the country so patients have access to a specialist nurse.
