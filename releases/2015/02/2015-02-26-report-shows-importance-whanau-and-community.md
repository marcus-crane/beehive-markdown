A research report released today has highlighted the importance of whanau and the community in preventing violence against Maori women and children.

Minister for Women Louise Upston this afternoon launched *Wahine Maori, Wahine Ora, Wahine Kaha - Preventing violence against Maori women*.

The research, which was undertaken by the Ministry for Women in partnership with the Ministry for Social Development, reinforces how whanau and the community have a role to play in keeping women and their children safe. 

“Maori women are among some of the most unsafe in their own homes,” says Ms Upston. “This report contains new information about what Maori women believe to be the key factors to ensuring they live violence-free lives.

“As well as discussing the role of education and employment in supporting women’s safety, this research shows how healthy relationships between men and women within whanau and within the community help prevent violence.

“All women want to lead safe and fulfilling lives and they want the same for their children. This report raises the voices of Maori women and offers important insights into what works, and why.”

Ms Upston said the report will be an important contribution to Government’s work with Maori on addressing family violence and sexual violence, including contributing to work as part of the Family Violence Ministerial Group.

“Policy makers and service providers can use this valuable information to formulate effective approaches to stop violence against women from occurring in the first place.

“I am looking forward to engaging with Maori service providers, iwi and community members in various locations around the country to hear their views on the report and to encourage continued collaborative work to help prevent violence against women.
