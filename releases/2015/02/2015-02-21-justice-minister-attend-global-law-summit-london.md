Justice Minister Amy Adams leaves today to attend an international law conference in London alongside Justice Ministers and Attorney Generals from around the world.

The Global Law Summit, held over 23 to 25 February, is a collaboration between the British Government, the City of London and the legal sector to mark the sealing of Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede in 1215.

While in London, Ms Adams will meet with key ministers in the British Government, including Rt Hon Theresa May, Home Secretary, and Rt Hon Chris Grayling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice.

Ms Adams will also speak as part of a panel on the principles of Magna Carta. Her speech will centre on New Zealand’s experience in creating a more efficient justice system by modernising courts including speeding up justice by making better use of technology.

Ms Adams says it is an honour to represent New Zealand at the summit.

“Magna Carta is one of the most important legal and constitutional documents in history. For the first time, basic rights were outlined and it was declared that no-one was above the law, including the King,” says Ms Adams.

“It influenced the authors of the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its fundamental guarantee that no-one shall be imprisoned without the lawful judgment of their equals or in accordance with law remains a part of New Zealand law to this day.”

The Summit will be attended by international Justice Ministers and Attorneys General, as well as judges, academics, lawyers and business people. 

About 2,000 delegates are expected and speakers include Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Rt Hon Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Ms Adams will leave for London on 21 February and return to New Zealand on 27 February.
