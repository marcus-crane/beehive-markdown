Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says a crackdown on an international drug ring is a great example of how overseas agencies working together can protect each other’s borders.

“The global drug trade causes immense harm to communities and the Government is committed to working with agencies around the world to combat it at the border,” Ms Wagner says.

“Last week, a joint operation between Shenzhen Customs, Hong Kong Customs and the Australian Federal Police resulted in a 106 kilogram methamphetamine seizure and seven arrests.

“Investigations began when NZ Customs passed information to its overseas counterparts following a drugs interception here. The crime ring was using express mail to deliver drugs packages to New Zealand and Australia.

“Collaboration between authorities is vital to combat the drug trade and during a meeting with Vice Minister of China Customs, Mr Sun Yibiao, last week we agreed to continue participating in multilateral initiatives to combat drug trafficking.

“This latest drug bust is a fantastic example of the results we’re getting by working with Customs authorities around the world,” she says.

China Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau is leading work on anti-drug smuggling between administrations of New Zealand, Australia, China and Hong Kong, with agencies working collectively to disrupt syndicates.
