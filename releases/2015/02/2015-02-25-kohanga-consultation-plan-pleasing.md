Education Minister Hekia Parata says she is pleased that Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust Board will begin consulting with kōhanga whānau next month about a new governance structure.

Ms Parata and Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell met the board last night to discuss its progress reviewing and transforming its governance structure.

“The working party convened by King Tuheitia to consult kōhanga reo on improved governance arrangements made a good start late last year. But only the Trust Board can change how it governs, so we needed to hear from the Board about its next steps,” says Ms Parata.

“The Government is committed to a strong and vibrant kōhanga reo movement, to the promotion of te reo, and raising Māori achievement. The kōhanga movement needs the support of modern governance and management to achieve those shared goals.”

At the meeting, Ms Parata repeated to the Trust that the Government needed to see more transparent and representative governance.

“Resolution of this issue will clear the way for a resumption of discussions about the Treaty claim brought by the Trust on behalf of kōhanga reo,” she says.
