Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman is encouraging kids to sign up for a school sport and get all the benefits that come with it.

“With schools opening their doors for the start of another year it is a good time to think about getting active,” says Dr Coleman.

“I encourage parents and teachers to support their children to take part in all the opportunities schools have to offer – games, active play, outdoor education, physical education and sport.

“Research shows that an active child is happier and more engaged at school. Being active contributes to their physical, social and mental development.

“School sport and physical activity also play an important role in developing young people’s confidence and self-esteem, team work, and wider social skills.

“Parents and caregivers being involved in school sport is also a great way to be part of the wider school community.”

Sport New Zealand is launching its new Community Sport Strategy in March, which covers kids and schools to help further encourage children to develop a love of physical activity and sport at an early age.
