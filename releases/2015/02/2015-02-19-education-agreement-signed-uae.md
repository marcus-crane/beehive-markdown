Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has welcomed the signing of an education agreement to strengthen New Zealand’s education relationship with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully and the UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah Al Nahyan signed the agreement today in Wellington.

"The UAE is a close trading partner for New Zealand, accounting for nearly half of all exports sent to the Middle East.  The agreement enables us to strengthen that trade relationship, and create more opportunities for collaboration on education projects” says Mr McCully.

Mr Joyce says export education, New Zealand's fifth largest export earner valued at $2.85 billion, is vital to continuing growth of both the economy and the education sector.

"New Zealand education has an excellent reputation in the Gulf, and New Zealand education providers and businesses are having good success in the UAE.  I look forward to the growth in education exports continuing with the support of this agreement” says Mr Joyce.

The agreement provides for collaborative projects and activities in many areas of Higher Education and Scientific Research.

New Zealand and the UAE have also agreed to encourage greater student exchange and sharing of educational resources between the two countries.
