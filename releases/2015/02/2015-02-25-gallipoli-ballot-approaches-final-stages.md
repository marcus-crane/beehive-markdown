Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss is urging anyone on the Gallipoli 2015 ballot waitlist to check their inbox for an update from the ballot office.

More than 6000 people on the wait list have been contacted via email with an update on the ballot process.  

“We’re keen to ensure as many New Zealanders as possible are given the opportunity to attend the commemorations,” Mr Foss says.

“With just two months until Anzac Day, the only practical way to ensure all New Zealand attendance passes are allocated is to prioritise offers to those on the wait list who have already made travel arrangements or can make them quickly.

“Passes will still be offered to people in the order they are on the wait list. Anyone not on the wait list will not be eligible for attendance passes.

“The ballot office has already heard from several hundred people on the wait list who have either made travel arrangements or are prepared to do so on short notice.

“Anyone who has not made their intention or willingness to travel known to the ballot office should get in touch right away.”  

Anyone with queries regarding their application should contact the Gallipoli 2015 ballot office by emailing [info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz](mailto:info@gallipoli2015.govt.nz) or calling 0800 336 547.
