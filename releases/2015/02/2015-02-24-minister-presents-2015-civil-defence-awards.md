Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye tonight presented awards to a number of people who have made significant contributions to civil defence emergency management in New Zealand.

 

“Tonight we recognised people who have been on the ground and in the thick of the action, as emergencies unfolded around them,” says Ms Kaye.

 

“We also recognised people who have worked tirelessly and passionately to build and improve local civil defence systems and processes.

 

“Through their efforts, either as individuals or as a team, they have all helped make our communities safer and more resilient.

 

“New Zealand is world-leading in the way it involves communities and local government in emergency management.

 

“The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management provides oversight and coordinates national support as needed, but local communities lead the way in identifying and reducing risks, and providing the front line response to any emergency.

 

“The people recognised tonight have been crucial in preventing loss of life and protecting livelihood, and I was proud to honour their efforts and achievements.”
