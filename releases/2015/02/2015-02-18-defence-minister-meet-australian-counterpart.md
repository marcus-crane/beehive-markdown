Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee will meet today with his recently appointed Australian counterpart the Hon Kevin Andrews, in Melbourne.

Mr Brownlee says the meeting is timely given the upcoming commemoration of the Gallipoli centenary, and the ongoing centennial commemorations of World War One.

The Ministers will also discuss a range of regional and international security issues, including our respective responses to the fight against ISIL and future defence capability projects.

“I am looking forward to talking with Minister Andrews about a number of matters,” Mr Brownlee says.

“Australia is our closest security and trade partner and it is important we regularly share our perspectives on international defence and security.”
