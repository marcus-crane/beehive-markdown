Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett has expressed disappointment in a U-turn by Labour housing spokesperson Phil Twyford, who has been caught backtracking on commitments made to community housing providers last year.

“In 2014 Mr Twyford addressed a community housing conference, telling members he was committed to them having access to the income-related rent subsidy, capital grants and stock transfers.”

“He also noted that members had shown ‘they can build good quality homes at affordable prices’, and ‘can leverage private sector investment’.” 

“It’s a shame Mr Twyford seems to have since lost confidence in the capability of our fantastic community housing sector, who he this week described as ‘embryonic’ and unlikely to manage the stock transfers he was committed to giving them eight months ago.”

“I’m looking forward to seeing if his crowdsourced ad makes it into the paper, but note it will only reinforce just how much of a U-turn Mr Twyford has made.”

Mrs Bennett also noted the Labour Party voted against the Social Housing Reform (Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Amendment) Act 2013, which legislated to introduce some of the very measures Mr Twyford told housing providers he would ensure they access, including the income-related rent subsidy. 

“Mr Twyford is oblivious to the fact that community housing providers have only grown in size and strength since his speech last year. Community housing providers now own or operate around 5,000 properties across the country and do amazing work with some of our most vulnerable people.”

The Government recognises the integral role community housing providers play providing social housing to those most in need, and will ensure they and their tenants are supported through the reforms.    

“Community housing providers are rightly cautious and keen for more information about our reforms. The upcoming period of nation-wide public consultation will give groups the opportunity to come and discuss their ideas and concerns with the Government, and work with us to build a better social housing sector for New Zealanders in need.”
