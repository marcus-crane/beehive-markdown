Almost 131,000 students applying for student loans and allowances have benefitted already this year from improvements to StudyLink, Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew says.

“StudyLink has continued to improve the student experience and this has meant more students can apply online and get the answers they need from our contact centres without delay,” Mrs Goodhew says.

The changes have seen call waiting times reduced, with three-quarters of phone calls answered faster this year than last year.

StudyLink has also taken steps to simplify website content, introducing pre-filled forms, shortening the processing system and creating a digital document depository with NZ Post called Connect.

“Pre-filled forms are saving students about 30 minutes each, and the ability to upload supporting documentation online has also eased the application process. Foot traffic at our physical offices is down by 22.5% from last year,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“Improved online services and contact centre performance has led to a positive student experience - all part of our Better Public Service targets.”

“I congratulate StudyLink on these improvements.”
