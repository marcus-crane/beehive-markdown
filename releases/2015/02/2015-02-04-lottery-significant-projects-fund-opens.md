Internal Affairs Minister and Presiding Member of the Lottery Grants Board Hon Peter Dunne today announced the opening of the 2014/15 application round of the Lottery Significant Projects Fund.

“From today, New Zealanders with community projects of regional or national significance worth $3 million or more will be able to apply to the fund. This is a great opportunity for New Zealand communities to seek funding for projects that they believe will make a difference in their local area, and I am excited to see the benefits this funding will bring about.

It will enable large and important community projects to be completed, creating a legacy for future generations” says Mr Dunne.

The Lottery Significant Projects Fund has previously supported a number of notable projects across New Zealand. These projects were diverse and covered a range of sectors including the arts and cultural projects, sporting facilities and environmental projects.  Projects previously funded include:

- Canterbury Cricket Trust: received $1,050,000 million for the tensile roof of the newly-built Hagley Oval Pavilion. The facility will play host to the opening ceremony and several games of the Cricket World Cup 2015, and will also provide a much-needed community facility in post-quake Christchurch;
- New Plymouth District Council: received $2,670,980 for the completion of the Len Lye Centre which will house the Len Lye collection and archive.  Len Lye is regarded as one of New Zealand’s most celebrated and influential contemporary artists, recognised globally for his pioneering achievements in art, technology and innovation, particularly in filmmaking and kinetic sculpture.
