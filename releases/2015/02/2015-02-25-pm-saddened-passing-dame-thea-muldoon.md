Prime Minister John Key today expressed his sadness at the passing of Dame Thea Muldoon.

Mr Key says he met Dame Thea on a number of occasions.

“She made a significant contribution to her community and the country – something she was recognised for when she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and awarded the Queen’s Service Order for Community Service.

“She was also a huge supporter of her husband, the late former Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon, and as Prime Minister today I recognise how important that is,” says Mr Key.

“I thank her for her contribution to New Zealand. My thoughts are with her family and friends.”
