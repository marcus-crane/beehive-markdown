Minister for Women, Louise Upston, has welcomed statistics showing women’s participation in the labour market and women’s employment is at record highs.

The latest Household Labour Force Survey (from the December 2014 quarter) shows the participation rate for women is 64.6 per cent and the employment rate for women is 60.4 per cent.  Both of these rates are the highest since the survey began in 1986.

“This is great news for women and there are also improvements across key areas,” said Ms Upston.

“There are 7300 more Māori women and 1800 more Pacific women in employment than in December 2013.

“Women are playing an increasing role in employment in Canterbury.  There are now 7700 more women employed in Canterbury than at the same time in 2013. 

“Over the past year we have seen increasing numbers of women working in construction-related roles.

“New Zealand women are playing a greater role in our economy, both in the skills they offer and in the numbers of women in the workforce.  This is fantastic for women and provides benefits for their families and communities.

“In order to continue growing our economy and to meet the demand for skills in the workplace I encourage employers to consider more women in a wider range of roles,” said Ms Upston.
