Social Development Minister Anne Tolley today congratulated the winners of the Kickstart Breakfast Awards.

“In November last year I visited Holy Family School to celebrate 3 million KickStart breakfasts being served and today I am thrilled to return to present this award.” Mrs Tolley says.

Since the Government began partnering with Fonterra and Sanitarium to deliver the KickStart Breakfast programme, an additional 3.4 million breakfasts have been served bringing the total number to more than 9 million meals since 2009. We are now reaching more than 28,000 children throughout the country.

Each year the Kickstart Breakfast Awards recognise the contribution of devoted volunteer co-ordinators, students, and principals who make the programme such a success. The three categories are Unsung Hero, Student Champion, and Club Award.

“The Unsung Hero award recognises those who give up their time to support our students and schools. It is presented to someone who works tirelessly behind the scenes, and seeks little or no recognition.

“This year the winner is Celia Roache from Holy Family School in Wellington. Celia has volunteered five days a week for the past six years and is the epitome of what this award stands for.” Mrs Tolley says.

“KickStart Breakfast is a brilliant example of partnership between government, the private sector, schools, and communities in delivering real practical help directly to children so they can focus on their education and have brighter futures.

“This partnership would not be such a success without the great volunteers across the country who give up their time to help our children succeed and my thanks go out to them all.” says Mrs Tolley.
