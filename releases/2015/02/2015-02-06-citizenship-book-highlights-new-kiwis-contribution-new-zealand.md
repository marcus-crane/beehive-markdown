Internal Affairs Minister, Hon Peter Dunne, today launched a new book celebrating the value new New Zealanders add to our national identity. Launching the book, *Choice Whiriwhiria: The New Zealand Citizenship Story*, Mr Dunne said the book showcases the role of new New Zealanders in shaping the New Zealand of tomorrow.

“As our society changes and becomes more diverse, it’s critical that we welcome new immigrants to our country and applaud them for their willingness to commit to their new home by becoming citizens,” says Mr Dunne, who is responsible under law for deciding to grant individuals citizenship.

*Choice Whiriwhiria* includes interviews and images of people who have actively chosen  New Zealand citizenship as well as information about our nation’s democracy, human rights and symbols of our identity. A video featuring messages from the Governor General and Mr Dunne has also been produced and will be shown at citizenship ceremonies.

Councils around New Zealand will distribute the book to new citizens at the many citizenship ceremonies that are held across the country every day. A total of 27,947 applicants were granted NZ citizenship in 2014, an increase of 52 people from the previous year.

“Around one in four New Zealanders are now born overseas and it is important to celebrate their contribution to New Zealand’s strong multi-cultural  national identity and heritage, and to encourage others to do the same,” Mr Dunne says.

Some of the citizens profiled in the book include ground-breaking plastic surgeon and cancer researcher, Dr Swee Tan, originally from Malaysia, top jockey Mark Du Plessis, who emigrated from Zimbabwe and has ridden in the Melbourne Cup three times, as well as Inge Woolf, matriarch of Wellington’s Woolf photography family, who fled Austria to avoid the Nazis.

“I didn’t become a citizen for a passport but because I wanted to show my commitment to New Zealand. I had the opportunity to get an EU passport but refused. I wouldn’t be anything but a New Zealander”, says Inge.

Another citizen profiled in the book, Candy Wu Zhang, says although it was hard giving up her Chinese passport to become a New Zealander, it was worth it. “I’m still proud of my Chinese ethnicity but becoming a citizen was about committing to this country which has given me so much,” says Candy.

*Choice Whiriwhiria* will be launched at citizenship ceremonies on Waitangi Day in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Samoa. An electronic version  of the book can be viewed on the Department of Internal Affairs’ website early next week.
