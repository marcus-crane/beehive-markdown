Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and ACC Minister Nikki Kaye have confirmed ACC’s commitment to free under 13s doctor visits.

“Free doctors’ visits and prescriptions for children aged under six will be extended to children aged under 13 from 1 July 2015,” says Dr Coleman.

“ACC will provide an additional $27.5 million over the next three years,” says Ms Kaye.

In Budget 2014 the Government announced $90 million over three years so under 13s can go to a doctor, any time of the day or night, for free and get their prescriptions free as well.

The free under 13s programme will now be extended further to include ACC injury-related visits, with the health sector’s representative group on primary care contracts signing off on the deal this week.

“We want our children to have the best possible start in life, and that means helping them bounce back from injuries as quickly as possible,” says Ms Kaye.

“It is also important that caregivers shouldn’t be put off getting medical assistance for their young children because of the cost,” says Dr Coleman.

*Editor's note:*

**What does this mean for GP practices?**

ACC will now pay an extra $24 on top of its existing contribution towards under 13s consultations with GPs and nurse practitioners.

ACC will also pay an extra $5 on top of its existing contribution towards under 13s consultations with practice nurses.

These new rates followed consultation. Feedback resulted in ACC increasing its total contribution from $25.2m to $27.5m over three years, to encourage more free visits for under 13s.

**What does this mean for parents and caregivers?**

ACC already pays a contribution direct to your doctor for injury-related consultations. Some doctors can also ask you to pay a fee towards the consultation.

ACC will increase its contribution for under 13s from 1 July, so that more consultations will be free of charge.
