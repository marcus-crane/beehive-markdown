Foreign Minister Murray McCully says New Zealand shares the disappointment expressed by other members of the international community about the five-year prison sentence handed down to Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.

“While Mr Anwar has followed every avenue open to him to have his conviction overturned and to avoid imprisonment, the severity of his sentence, coupled with recent prosecutions under the country’s Sedition Act, are of concern to New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.

“We have followed developments in Mr Anwar’s case closely, and a representative from the New Zealand High Commission in Kuala Lumpur was among independent international observers at his appeal hearing in the Federal Court against a charge of sodomy.

“New Zealand and Malaysia have a strong relationship and work closely together in the international arena - where Malaysia is a prominent voice for moderation and tolerance.

“In the spirit of promoting human rights and political freedoms we have registered our concerns with the Malaysian Government and will continue to do so,” Mr McCully says.
