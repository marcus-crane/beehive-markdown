Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to New York tomorrow to participate in an open debate in the Security Council on the United Nations Charter.

“To mark its presidency of the UN Security Council, and the 70th anniversary of the UN Charter, the Foreign Minister of China is hosting an open debate focused on how the Security Council can better support peace and security,” Mr McCully says.

“This is the first time China has hosted such a debate and New Zealand welcomes this effort to revitalise the role of the Security Council. The Council needs to play a more active role in addressing the real threats we currently face.

“China’s open debate is an important first step in reviewing the role of the Charter and the Security Council in the wider UN system,” Mr McCully says.

While in New York, Minister McCully will meet with the United Nations Secretary General, as well as the Foreign Ministers of Security Council members participating in the debate.
