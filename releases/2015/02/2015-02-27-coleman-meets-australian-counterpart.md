Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today met with his Australian counterpart Sussan Ley, Minister of Health and Minister for Sport.

“New Zealand has a strong relationship with Australia, and I look forward to working closely with my counterpart Minister Ley,” says Dr Coleman.

“We had a very successful meeting today, and we discussed a number of key issues including health system collaboration and preventative health, as well as sport.

“Minister Ley was particularly interested to hear about our Green Prescriptions initiative, where adult patients are given advice and a prescription on nutrition and physical activity to help manage their long term conditions.

“Both Minister Ley and I are looking forward to attending tomorrow’s ICC Cricket World Cup match between New Zealand and Australia. It will be the first time the Black Caps have played Australia since 2012.

“I am sure it will be one of the highlights of the tournament and will be hard-fought in the tradition of Trans-Tasman sport.”

Today’s meeting was the first time Dr Coleman and Minister Ley have met in their current roles.
