State Owned Enterprises Minister Todd McClay has thanked outgoing Solid Energy Chair, Pip Dunphy for her hard work and strong leadership after her decision to stand down from the Board.

“Ms Dunphy has served on the Board of Solid Energy since December 2012, and stepped into the role of Chair in March last year.”

“Ms Dunphy has played a very important leadership role in the company. I am very grateful for her work leading both the assessment of a potential re-entry into the Pike River Mine, and the company’s engagement with the Pike River families. We wish her well,” says Mr McClay.

Current Board member, Andy Coupe, has been appointed as Acting Chair of Solid Energy, while the Crown works through its appointment process for a permanent Chair.

Mr McClay says Solid Energy has been operating in a challenging environment.

As previously signalled, the ongoing reductions in the international coal price mean the company remains strongly focussed on executing plans to return to profitability.
