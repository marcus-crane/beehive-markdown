Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today paid tribute to the service of Customs staff over the past 175 years as she visited the Old Customhouse in Russell, New Zealand’s first Customhouse.

“The story of New Zealand Customs began in a tent on the Kororareka, or Russell, beach 175 years ago. The first head of Customs, George Cooper, began operating just days before the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Old Customhouse on The Strand in Russell was then occupied in 1870, becoming New Zealand’s first Customhouse until the 1890s when it became a Police Station and residence – a use it still serves today.

“Customs has come a long way in the past 175 years, now employing cutting-edge technology and highly-skilled staff to facilitate trade and travel while ensuring safety at the border.

“December last year was New Zealand’s busiest ever month for visitor arrivals and Customs was well prepared for the record numbers, with more staff allocated to busy areas and passenger arrival technology SmartGate processing almost 175,000 arriving passengers.

“It is an honour to be here where it all started and I am proud that, 175 years on, Customs continues to serve New Zealanders,” Ms Wagner says.
