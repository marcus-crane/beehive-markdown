Energy and Resources Minister, Simon Bridges, says a concerted effort from the Government to increase competition in the electricity sector is paying off for consumers.

A record seven new electricity retailers have entered the retail electricity market since January 2014, bringing the total number of retailers to 21 and the total number of retail brands to 27.

“Competition is the best way to keep downward pressure on prices and we continue to promote competitive and innovative measures in the electricity market.

“We have reformed the electricity market to improve security and efficiency.

“Part of the Government’s reforms has been to create a level playing field and encourage new players into the New Zealand retail market, and it’s good to see the share traditionally held by the big retailors decreasing over time,” Mr Bridges says.

The new entrants are SELX, EMH Trade, Ecotricity, Electric Kiwi, Body Corporate Power Ltd, Giving Energy and one other. 

“I look forward to watching the market continue to deliver the innovative and competitive services consumers want,” Mr Bridges says.
