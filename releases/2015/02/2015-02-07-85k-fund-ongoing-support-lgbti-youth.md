Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced a second round of small grants funding, worth $85,000 to ensure support services are available for LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender or intersex) youth.

“By and large, LGBTI young people are doing well, but reports over several years have shown there’s a need for more support services.

“One of the most concerning issues is that LGBTI young people are five times more likely than other young people to attempt suicide or deliberately self-harm.

“They are also more likely to be bullied, physically harmed or afraid that someone may hurt them.

“It’s crucial that support is available to address this, and the funding I’ve announced today will help organisations better support LGBTI youth.”

Last year, 23 organisations received $60,000 under the first round of small grants funding to support young LGBTI people.

The help provided by these organisation has included everything from counselling and online help resources, to safe spaces for young people to meet.

“I encourage both new and existing providers to apply for the second round of funding, which will open later this month.

“I’m proud to announce this funding on the first day of the Auckland Pride Festival, a three-week celebration of diversity, tolerance, respect and the Rainbow community.”
