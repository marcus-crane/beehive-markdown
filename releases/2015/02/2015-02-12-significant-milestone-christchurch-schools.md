Education Minister Hekia Parata has announced that Queen Elizabeth II Park (QEII) is the preferred relocation and co-location site of Avonside Girls’ High School and Shirley Boys’ High School.

“Co-locating the schools at this site will enable both to have access to modern learning environments, which support flexible teaching styles and provide comfortable, adaptable spaces for students to learn in,” says Ms Parata.

“This will further strengthen our network of quality secondary education providers in the east of Christchurch following the establishment of the Aranui Community Campus.”

The Ministry of Education looked at an extensive range of options and identified the QEII site as the best for the schools because of the size of the available land, access for transport and future flexibility and design potential.

In September 2014, it was announced that the QEII is also the preferred site for the Christchurch City Council’s eastern recreation and sport centre. 

“The schools will see many potential benefits from being located alongside the planned sports complex. This is another milestone in the Christchurch Schools Rebuild journey.”

The Ministry will now begin land acquisition negotiations with the Christchurch City Council and further discussions will occur over the coming months.  

Design will begin on the two schools in next year. Both schools are expected to be completed in 2018. The schools will continue to operate independently, maintaining their original character and focus.

In 2013 the Government announced a $1.137 billion investment in renewing, repairing and rebuilding 115 schools in greater Christchurch.
