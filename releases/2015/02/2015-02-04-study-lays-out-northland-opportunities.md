The Northland region has significant untapped economic potential and its industries could grow substantially thanks to its resource-based advantages, a newly-published report reveals.

Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy today released the *Northland Regional Growth Study,* which shows that the Northland region has strong potential to attract further investment, raise incomes and increase employment opportunities.

“This is the most comprehensive report written on the Northland economy in many years,” Mr Joyce says. “It clearly lays out the investment opportunities available in the region, the significant employment opportunities, and the crucial role that Maori, iwi and hapu can play in its growth.

“The New Zealand economy is made up of all the regional economies across the country,” Mr Joyce says. “The Regional Growth Study Programme seeks to pinpoint and prioritise significant economic opportunities to improve outcomes in selected regions and therefore throughout New Zealand.”

The Northland study shows that the region’s natural assets, rich cultural heritage and youthful population present distinctive and significant opportunities for growth in the tourism, forestry, dairy, aquaculture and horticulture sectors, says Mr Guy.

“In particular, the study highlights the need for diversification across the Northland primary sector to create higher incomes for households and higher-value exports for New Zealand. This includes sustainably building scale in areas such as oyster and mussel production, dairy, avocado and citrus production.

“There are opportunities to build stronger linkages between research and development programmes and local business expertise. Implementing initiatives that support education and skills attainment will be vital in building a stronger and more resilient Northland economy,” Mr Guy says.

Improving economic outcomes in the region will in turn play a key role in improving the health and social outcomes for its people, Mr Joyce says.

“This Government is committed to working with business, local government, Māori and iwi to take action and provide better opportunities for Northland. Realising the growth opportunities that are set out in the *Northland Regional Growth Study* will require a strong Maori contribution.

“I therefore commend the Tai Tokerau iwi chairs and chief executives for their report released today on the economic growth strategy for the Tai Tokerau Maori economy. That has been fed into this Northland report on the wider economy. Growth in economic prosperity for Tai Tokerau Maori means growth in economic prosperity for the whole of Northland.”

The Northland study is part of the Regional Growth Study Programme, which has been commissioned by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI). The programme builds on the *East Coast Regional Economic Potential Study* that was released in April 2014, with further studies currently under way in the Bay of Plenty and Manawatū-Whanganui regions.
