Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell today welcomed the release of a study confirming Northland has significant economic potential and scope for growth.

“The *Northland Regional Growth Study* outlines opportunities for the region’s communities and industries to build a stronger and more resilient economy,” says Mr Flavell.

The study identifies a number of resources and industries that have the potential to grow Northland’s economy including tourism, forestry, dairy, aquaculture and horticulture.

“Making the most of these advantages will require collaboration between business, iwi, central and local government.”

Mr Flavell says he’s thrilled to see this independent study launched on the same day as the Tai Tokerau Economic Growth Strategy *He Tangata He Whenua He Oranga*.

“Tai Tokerau iwi have made their intentions clear. It’s beholden on all of us to turn this study into action and support growth strategies like *He Tangata He Whenua He Oranga*.

“The Government is working with all regional stakeholders to develop and implement an action plan which will ultimately lead to better outcomes for the people of Northland.”

The *Northland Regional Growth Study* is an independent report commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Ministry for Primary Industries.
