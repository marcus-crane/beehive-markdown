Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says a new hospital patient information system will be rolled out across South Island DHBs to streamline services.

“The South Island Patient Information Care System (SI PICS) will be phased in over the next two to five years, replacing seven existing patient administration systems,” says Dr Coleman.

“The IT system will make the electronic transfer of patient information safer and more efficient. The programme will also manage patient appointments, admissions, discharges, and transfers across all DHBs.

“Hospital staff will be able to reduce duplication, share resources, and spend less time on administration.

“It will also be easier to find relevant information from another DHB, and health professionals who move between DHBs will have only one system to familiarise themselves with.”

Hospital patients in Canterbury will be the first to benefit from the new IT system, with it being phased in towards the end of the year. Nelson Marlborough DHB will adopt the system in early 2016.

The South Island Alliance, a collaboration of the South Island’s five DHBs, is working with Orion Health to develop and implement SI PICS.
