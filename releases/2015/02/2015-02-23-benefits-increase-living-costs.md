Benefit and superannuation payments to more than a million New Zealanders will increase on April 1, says Social Development Minister Anne Tolley.

“In 2011 we passed legislation to make sure benefits increase each year in line with inflation,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Rates and thresholds for a range of Work and Income and StudyLink assistance will rise to keep up with increasing living costs.”

The Annual General Adjustment will see a 0.51 per cent increase to:

- benefit rates, Student Allowances, Student Loan Living Costs and the Foster Care Allowance, and
- rates of  supplementary assistance.

Superannuation and Veteran’s Pension Payments will also go up by 2.07 per cent, in line with the Government’s commitment to keep the married couple rate at least 66 per cent of the average wage.

This will mean around $11.60 extra each week for married superannuitants and $7.50 a week for those living alone compared to increases made on 1 April 2014.

“These increases help make sure people who rely on state assistance aren’t disadvantaged by inflation,” says Mrs Tolley.
