Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell has welcomed the launch today of *He Tangata, He Whenua, He Oranga,* the Tai Tokerau iwi chairs’ and chief executives’ economic growth strategy for the Tai Tokerau Māori economy.

“This strategy represents the commitment of Te Taitokerau iwi to define on their own terms – the basis and actions to drive their economic growth,” says Mr Flavell.

“It focuses on the essential platforms required for growth, which include advocacy and policy, research and innovation, education, leadership and collaboration. Strengthening support in these areas will improve iwi and Māori participation in the economic development of the region.”

Mr Flavell says the study aligns well with the Māori Economic Development Strategy: *He Kai Kei Aku Ringa*, which sets out a blueprint for growing the Māori economy and a study into the Northland regional economy which will be launched this afternoon alongside Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“I commend the iwi chairs and chief executives for their vision and their desire to drive economic wellbeing in Te Tai Tokerau communities,” Mr Flavell says.

“The leadership within this group will breathe life in to this strategy through their collective efforts and I look forward to the transformation this will bring about for whanau in their communities and for the region as a whole.”
