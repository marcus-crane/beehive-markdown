Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the latest quarterly health target results show DHBs are making good overall progress.

“DHBs are continuing to improve their performance on the Government’s health targets,” says Dr Coleman.

“The latest results for quarter two show that almost all DHBs are now exceeding the number of elective surgeries they had planned.

“DHBs carried out 5,441 more elective surgeries than planned in the last three months of 2014. DHBs have also been focused on reducing waiting times for elective first specialist assessments and treatment, such as hip replacements.

“Despite more people presenting to emergency departments, DHBs have continued to perform well on the target with a national result of 94 per cent.”

Results have been reported for the first time on the new faster cancer treatment health target. DHBs consistently achieved the previous target and the new broader target covers time from referral to treatment.

“Two thirds of patients with a high suspicion of cancer received their first treatment within 62 days of referral,” says Dr Coleman.

“This is comparable with other countries when they have first introduced a similar new target. I know we will continue to see steady improvement towards the target of 90 per cent by June 2017.”

Results for quarter two 2014/15 show improvements in all the targets:

- 94 per cent immunisation coverage for eight-month-olds is the highest ever level of coverage for any immunisation health target.
- 87 per cent of eligible people had their heart and diabetes check.
- The number of smokers in primary care offered advice or support on quitting slightly increased to 89 per cent.
- The hospital component of the target has been consistently achieved in the last two years, with a national result of 95 per cent.
