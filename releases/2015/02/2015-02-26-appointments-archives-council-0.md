Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne today announced three appointments to the Archives Council Te Rua Wānanga. 

The Council has a statutory role to provide the Minister with independent advice on archives and recordkeeping issues.

The new members are Dr Angela Wanhalla, Anna Blackman and Thomas Norcliffe. 

“These three appointees bring a range of experience, skills and knowledge that will enable the Council to continue providing high quality advice,” said Mr Dunne.

Their appointments will start in March 2015.

"In welcoming the new appointees, I would like to thank the outgoing members – George Reedy, Barry Holdaway and Stuart Strachan – for their commitment and service,” Mr Dunne said.
