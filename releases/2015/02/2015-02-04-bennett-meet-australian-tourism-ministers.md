Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett will travel to Sydney on 5 February to attend the biannual Tourism Ministers’ Meeting.

The Tourism Ministers’ Meeting brings together Australian federal, state and territorial tourism ministers, as well as New Zealand. 

“It’s an exciting time for New Zealand and Australian tourism, with things truly kicking into gear in less than two weeks with the opening match of the jointly-hosted Cricket World Cup 2015,” says Mrs Bennett.

“This meeting is a great opportunity to share and build on experiences between our two closely linked sectors.”

“As we work towards improving the competitiveness of New Zealand tourism, I’m particularly interested in hearing of Australia’s progress in implementing *Tourism 2020*, an ambitious strategy to double overnight tourism expenditure by 2020.”

“The meeting will also provide an opportunity to discuss some of the issues fundamental to a strong tourism sector, such as industry engagement, seasonal migration, and tourism research.”
