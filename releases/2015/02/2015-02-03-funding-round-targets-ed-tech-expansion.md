Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has announced the Government will invest almost $450,000 in co-funding through Education New Zealand towards 12 new growth initiatives in the international education industry.

“The international education sector is performing very strongly and while we need to maintain this momentum in key markets, we must also accelerate the export of our education technology and services expertise,” says Mr Joyce.

Successful recipients for this fourth round of the International Education Growth Fund (IEGF) include Biozone International who will promote sales of new science resources for schools in the United States, and South Pacific Press who will build on its CSI Literacy resources by developing and marketing a new online solve-as-you read literacy series.

“Nearly half of the successful applications to this round of the Fund are for initiatives involving education technology products and services for the United States and Asian markets,” Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand is home to an innovative and talented ICT industry and teaming this expertise with our high-quality education is a key step towards further growing the value of international education for the country.

“While it is pleasing to see international student numbers are at the highest level they’ve been in four years, it is equally important we tap into the opportunities presented by delivering our expertise offshore.

“A good example of this is Massey University who will develop and export an oiled wildlife emergency response training programme through its distance and online learning platform, Massey Worldwide,” says Mr Joyce.

Education providers and business can apply for matched funding up to $50,000 from the International Education Growth Fund which is administered by Education New Zealand.  In this latest round, 50 applications were received.
