Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has welcomed the commissioning of a new report to examine the potential of water storage and infrastructure in Northland.

“This study will identify areas where improved water supply and potential water infrastructure could deliver economic growth and other benefits to Northland,” says Mr Guy.

“The study is an important step in a joint project involving the Ministry for Primary Industries’ Irrigation Acceleration Fund, Northland Regional Council, and economic development agency Northland Inc.

“More reliable irrigation will help develop sectors like farming and horticulture, meaning more local jobs and exports.”

The study will look at:

- the potential demand for irrigation water
- ways to improve management and use of current available water resources
- the economic costs and benefits of water storage and irrigation development
- potential infrastructure development opportunities.

MPI has committed $75,000 towards the study, which is expected to be completed by September 2015. A tender process has recently begun to seek a specialist provider to carry out the water management study.

“Northland has suffered through extreme dry spells over the last two years which has reinforced the potential of irrigation and water storage. Only 2 per cent of rainfall in New Zealand is captured and used for irrigation. Clearly we need to do a better job of using this resource.

“I’ve seen for myself what a difference irrigation has made to rural communities in the South Island, revitalising schools and entire towns, creating jobs for locals.”

In the last two Budgets the Government has committed $120 million towards major irrigation projects.
