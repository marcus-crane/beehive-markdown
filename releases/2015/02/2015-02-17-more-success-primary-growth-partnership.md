Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy is welcoming more success stories from the Primary Growth Partnership (PGP), with several programmes making big steps forward.

“Government and industry are together investing $720 over time million into 20 innovation programmes, and many of these are already delivering results,” says Mr Guy.

Mr Guy is speaking today at the annual open farm day at Limestone Downs, which is involved in the “Pioneering to Precision” PGP programme, led by Ravensdown.

“As part of this programme drones and light aircraft are being used to scan the hill country at Limestone Downs Station to develop precision fertiliser applications for hill country. This programme will deliver productivity and environmental benefits.

“The Clearview Innovations PGP programme, led by Ballance Agri-Nutrients, has just completed the commercial release of N-Guru. This is a software tool developed with AgResearch that enables farmers to tailor application rates of nitrogen to areas which are likely to produce the highest pasture response.

“N-Guru will allow more efficient use of nitrogen fertiliser and reduce over-application, which – alongside the major environmental benefits – will help farmers to generate greater returns from their land.”

The Red Meat Profit Partnership programme has just completed a major piece of research into high-performing red meat farmers and what drives these businesses to adopt new practices.

“Studying these characteristics, behaviours, skills and attitudes can help more farmers improve their productivity and reach the top tier.

“Transforming the Dairy Value Chain is also making good progress towards improved animal health, working to reduce facial eczema in cattle. It has identified tolerant bulls of high genetic merit, and farmers are now using these to breed tolerance into their dairy herds.

“Facial eczema is estimated to cost New Zealand’s dairy industry over $100 million a year in lost production, treatment costs and animal loss.

“Through the PGP we’re seeing the primary sector working collaboratively to add value not just to the primary industries, but to New Zealand’s wider economy. These programmes have a major part to play in our goal of doubling the value of primary sector exports by 2025.”

**About the Primary Growth Partnership**

- Government and industry are co-investing $720 million over time into these programmes involving the red meat, dairy, horticulture, viticulture, forestry and seafood industries.
- The PGP aims to boost the productivity, value and profitability of our primary sector through investment between government and industry. It provides an essential springboard to enable New Zealand to stay at the forefront of primary sector innovation.
- PGP programmes are generally long-run programmes of five to seven years’ duration and are subject to oversight and monitoring by an independent panel (the Investment Advisory Panel) and MPI.
- Monitoring requirements include programme steering groups, quarterly progress reporting, annual plans, audits, and progress reviews, along with evaluation of the overall programme. Funding is only released to programmes on receipt of invoices for work completed in accordance with programme plans.
- A recent report by NZIER shows that the PGP could return up to $6.4 billion to the New Zealand economy by 2025, and up to $11.1 billion if the aspirational stretch of programmes is realised, the innovations are taken up widely and the research and development is successful.
- Last year the Precision Seafood Harvesting PGP programme won the Innovation in Sustainability & Clean Tech award and the Supreme Innovator award at the New Zealand Innovators Awards, and the People’s Choice Award at the KiwiNet Awards.
