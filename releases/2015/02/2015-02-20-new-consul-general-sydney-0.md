Foreign Minister Murray McCully has named diplomat Billie Moore as New Zealand’s new Consul-General in Sydney. 

"Ms Moore will lead the New Zealand Government's presence in Sydney, which includes representatives from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Customs, Police, Internal Affairs, Immigration and Tourism," Mr McCully says.

“New South Wales and Queensland are home to a significant number of New Zealanders, and they are important markets for New Zealand business.  

“New Zealand also places importance on our relationship with the New South Wales and Queensland state governments.

“The Consul-General in Sydney plays a key role promoting and protecting New Zealand’s political and economic interests in those states, as well as providing consular assistance to New Zealanders living in or travelling through Queensland and New South Wales,” Mr McCully says.

Ms Moore has spent the last six years serving as a foreign policy private secretary and advisor to successive governments. Most recently she helped manage New Zealand's successful UN Security Council campaign.
