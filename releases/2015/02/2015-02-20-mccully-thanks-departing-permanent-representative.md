Foreign Minister Murray McCully has paid tribute to the outstanding performance of New Zealand’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Jim McLay, who concludes his second term in May.

“Ambassador McLay can take considerable credit for New Zealand’s successful campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council,” Mr McCully says.

“It is clear that his efforts, as our lead representative in New York, have contributed substantially to the high regard New Zealand is held in internationally. On behalf of the government I want to place on record our strong appreciation for his work.

“I am pleased to announce that Mr McLay will be succeeded by Mr Gerard van Bohemen, who is currently a Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, responsible for multilateral and legal affairs.

“Mr van Bohemen was the Deputy Permanent Representative in New York when New Zealand last served on the Security Council.

“The government will continue to call on Mr McLay’s services and he has agreed to take up a role as a Special Advisor to me, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, on his return to New Zealand.

“In this capacity he will serve as a Special Envoy for the Prime Minister at appropriate regional meetings and undertake a range of other duties which will utilise his network of contacts and special knowledge of UN matters. I also intend to appoint Ambassador McLay as New Zealand’s Representative to the Palestinian Authority,” Mr McCully says.
