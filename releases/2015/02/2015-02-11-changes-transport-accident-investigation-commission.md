Transport Minister Simon Bridges has announced changes to the make-up of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC).

John Marshall QC has advised the Minister he does not wish to be reappointed as Chief Commissioner, once he has completed his term in March.

“I would like to thank John for his significant contribution to the transport sector over the past five years, particularly towards improving transport safety for the benefit of all New Zealanders,” Mr Bridges says.

“John’s leadership and wise counsel in heading complex, sensitive and high profile cases, such as the Rena investigation, have been invaluable.”

Mr Bridges has appointed Helen Cull QC as Acting Chief Commissioner until the formal appointment process for a permanent Chief Commissioner is completed.

In addition to seeking a new Chief Commissioner, the Government is considering appointing a fourth Commissioner.

“TAIC can have up to five Commissioners, but has only ever had three at a time. A fourth Commissioner will ensure continuity at TAIC and give it the capacity to deal with increasingly complex investigations.”

Following the resignation of Commissioner Howard Broad in December 2013, Mr Bridges has appointed commercial barrister Jane Meares to fill the vacancy.

Ms Meares’ term is effective from 16 February 2015 to 30 April 2019.

As well as her extensive legal and governance experience, Ms Meares has a strong background in the public sector. She is the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of the Parliamentary Counsel Office, Director of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand, and Chair of the Ballet Foundation of New Zealand.
