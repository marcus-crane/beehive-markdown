Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry has welcomed the 175thanniversary of the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the Treaty of Waitangi.

Waitangi Day 2015 marks this occasion, which will be celebrated with activities and events on the day and throughout the year.

“Waitangi Day is a time to reflect on the significance of our country’s founding document and what it means to all New Zealanders now and in the future,” says Ms Barry.

“Waitangi 175 is also an opportunity to look ahead to the next 25 years and have a national conversation about the Treaty and where we see Aotearoa/New Zealand as a nation, 200 years after the signing.”

A ceremony took place yesterday at Mangungu Mission, to acknowledge the third and largest signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi on 12 February 1840.

The Ministry for Culture and Heritage is working with other government agencies to support Waitangi 175 initiatives and events across the country.

“This anniversary year is a chance to focus on our multicultural society and consider the relationship between Māori and Pakeha in the context of Te Tiriti,” says Ms Barry.
