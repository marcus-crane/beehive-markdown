The Government is backing the recommendations of the NZ Data Futures Forum to make better use of public data and uphold privacy standards, Finance Minister Bill English and Statistics Minister Craig Foss say.

The NZ Data Futures Forum — an independent expert advisory group from the public and private sectors — was established by the Government last year to help drive further use of open data.

Recommendations in the forum’s final report included:

- Exploring the potential value of an independent data council which could lead, support and advocate for data use
- Reviewing the policy and legislative environment to ensure it supports better use of data
- Launching catalyst projects supporting collaboration between public and private sectors
- Encouraging Government agencies to continue to open up data to the public.

The Government has directed officials to report back in March on progressing data catalyst projects and the Government’s Open Data initiative.

“Delivering better public services for New Zealanders means making better use of the information we have and lifting accountability to the public through transparency,” Mr English says.

These initiatives sit alongside a range of measures the Government is taking to improve data use, including Statistics New Zealand’s Integrated Data Infrastructure, the Ministry of Social Development’s investment view, and a pilot project between Land Information New Zealand and Wiki NZ.

The Government has also established the Social Sector Board to accelerate integration of social sector data, including setting common standards.

“More data use highlights the need for that data to be used responsibly,” Mr Foss says.

“The Government has signed-up to the Forum’s four recommended data use principles of value, inclusion, trust and control.

“Giving individuals greater control over the use of their data, and building confidence in our institutions to protect sensitive information is an essential part of making better-use of information.”

New Zealand was recently ranked fourth-equal in open data by Open Data Barometer Global Report.
