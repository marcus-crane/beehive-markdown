Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today released a discussion paper proposing changes to the Customs and Excise Act.

“Customs’ core roles will remain the same – protecting the border, facilitating trade and travel, and collecting Crown revenue. The review will ensure the legislation governing Customs is fit for purpose,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Government initiated the review of the Customs and Excise Act due to the legislation’s inability to efficiently respond to changes in technology and business practice.

“The current Act, passed in 1996, is based on the 1966 Act and still contains elements of 1913 Act. It’s time to update the Act to ensure Customs can best serve New Zealanders.”

Proposals include broader information sharing with government agencies, improving the excise system, and clarifying Customs’ powers and sanctions.

“The review aims to modernise the legislation by simplifying its language and making it easier for the public, Customs and other agencies to use.  It will also reduce the compliance burden for business.

“I encourage all New Zealanders with an interest to have their say, as this consultation phase will inform final policy proposals,” Ms Wagner says.

Public consultation will run until 1 May.  The discussion paper is available on [Customs’ website](http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/legislation/Pages/customsandexciseactreview.aspx).
