Young people across New Zealand will receive a boost to develop their entrepreneurial skills and knowledge, after Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced $905,000 funding under the Youth Enterprise Fund.

“Eight organisations will receive funding to help deliver a range of business enterprise initiatives to a diverse range of youth, including young people not in education and from disadvantaged communities.

“This will see around 3,000 extra young people receive the chance to develop their entrepreneurial ability.

“The Young Enterprise Trust will receive the largest funding of over $600,000, to extend the reach of their successful Young Enterprise Scheme.

“This scheme encourages school students to come up with ideas for a company or product, and then receive coaching from local business people on how to develop their ideas and turn them into reality.

“Some schools need greater support to provide the scheme to their students, especially in communities that don’t have the necessary breadth of local business expertise to draw on.

“Based on a successful pilot in Pacific communities, the extra funding will help Young Enterprise Trust employ roaming, specialist teachers to support more schools to introduce, improve and grow business enterprise in the classroom.

“Young people today are growing up in a complex, challenging and fast-changing world, and it’s important we help them develop skills such as leadership, problem solving and innovation to succeed in the future.

“This is what the Youth Enterprise Fund is all about. I recently announced $835,000 of funding for social enterprise initiatives under the fund, and look forward to announcing technology related funding in the near future.”
