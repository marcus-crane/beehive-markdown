Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed an arrangement between New Zealand and Viet Nam to strengthen food safety cooperation.

The Food Safety Cooperation Arrangement between the Ministry for Primary Industries and Viet Nam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development aims to promote recognition and consistency between the regulatory systems of the two countries.

“This arrangement comes as we mark the 40th anniversary of bilateral relations between New Zealand and Viet Nam,” Mrs Goodhew says. “It is an important step towards boosting trade to Viet Nam and further developing the strong ties between our two countries.”

The arrangement was signed in the presence of Prime Minister John Key and Viet Nam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who is currently visiting New Zealand to discuss strengthening these bilateral ties.

“The arrangement commits to exchanging information on food safety and agricultural trade laws, simplification of trade certification and collaboration on scientific research and post-graduate education,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Viet Nam is a burgeoning market for New Zealand’s food exports, with over $400 million worth of primary products exported last year, and trade increasing each year.

“Viet Nam is also a core member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with which Australia and New Zealand have a Free Trade Agreement.”
