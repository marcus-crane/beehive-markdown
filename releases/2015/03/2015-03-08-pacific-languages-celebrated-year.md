New Zealand’s diversity will be showcased in 2015, with seven Pacific cultures celebrated in language weeks throughout the year, Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“These language weeks celebrate our strong links to the Pacific and the rich contribution we make to New Zealand’s culture,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“I believe New Zealand’s future success will be significantly powered by Pacific people. As a Pacific migrant myself I understand how vitally important it is to keep our links to our cultural heritage while embracing our lives in our adopted home country.

“As the Pacific People’s Minister I am committed to creating opportunities to share and promote Pacific cultures,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The language, sights and sounds of the Pacific will be on display as the Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Fiji, Niue and Tokelau language weeks are celebrated through the year.

Pacific language weeks provide an opportunity for Pacific language and culture to be promoted through song, dance, cultural displays, language debates, speech competitions, and constitution celebrations.

The 2015 Pacific Language Week line-up begins with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week in October.
