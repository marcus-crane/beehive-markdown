Increased participation in the workforce, a decline in the gender pay gap and changes to flexible working arrangements are just a few reasons to celebrate tomorrow’s International Women’s Day.

The theme for this year’s annual celebration is Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity; Picture it, and Minister for Women Louise Upston says opportunities for New Zealand women to be empowered to achieve their potential are on the rise.

“Participation by women in the workforce is currently sitting at the highest rate since records began in 1986. We are continuing to reduce the gender pay gap – which is currently 9.9 per cent, and we are making gains in employment for Māori and Pacific women with 7300 more Māori women and 1800 more Pacific women in employment than in December 2013,” Ms Upston said.

“Women are also playing an important part in the Canterbury rebuild, with 7700 more women employed in Canterbury than at the same time in 2013, including 7200 in construction alone.

Ms Upston said this upwards drive of participation in work will be further bolstered by changes to flexible working arrangements introduced in the past week.

“The Government has promised to extend paid parental leave from 14 weeks to 16 weeks from 1 April this year, and to 18 weeks from 1 April 2016. We will also be introducing legislation soon which will fulfil our commitment to widen eligibility and make Paid parental Leave more flexible.

“Opportunities to work flexibly are especially important for supporting women to advance their careers and I encourage chief executives and managers to promote and normalise flexible work within their organisations,” Ms Upston said.

“International Women’s Day is a great chance to celebrate what we have achieved and work together to make even more progress on equality,” Ms Upston said.
