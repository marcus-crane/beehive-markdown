Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner, met with Christchurch employers today to discuss how best to get more disabled people into work, as part of the early stages of an employment pilot scheme for disabled people and people with health conditions.

“As Minister for Disability Issues, the message I am getting loud and clear is that disabled people want to have a job to support themselves and their families, just like all New Zealanders,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Government, through the Ministry of Social Development, is conducting a trial in Christchurch to assist an extra 300 disabled people and people with health conditions into work over the next year.

“Employers are critical to providing disabled people with an opportunity to get into the workforce. I want to understand from them what the barriers are, and what assistance they need to employ disabled people.

“Disabled people are less likely to be in paid employment than their peers. The 2013 Disability Survey found that forty-five percent of disabled adults were employed compared with 72 percent of non-disabled adults.

“I hope the trial will also help employers to make the most of the available talent during a period of low unemployment and skills shortages in Christchurch,” Ms Wagner says.

Details of the employment trial will be announced in May following consultation with disabled people, employers, and disability and employment providers.
