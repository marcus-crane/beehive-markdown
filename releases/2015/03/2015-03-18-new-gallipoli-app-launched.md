Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has welcomed the release of a free smartphone and tablet app which offers a new way to explore the Gallipoli campaign.

The Ngā Tapuwae Gallipoli app features compelling diary entries from the First World War, with clear facts, authentic and beautiful imagery as well as audio tours narrated by leading historians.

The app is designed to be used offline to avoid expensive roaming charges and is free for all to download in New Zealand and overseas.

“Ngā Tapuwae Gallipoli will be your informative travel guide, providing accurate information from a New Zealand perspective. It’s our unique story, following in the footsteps of Anzac soldiers as they experienced Gallipoli in 1915,” Ms Barry says.

“It is the most authentic and inspiring travel resource you can use on your trip to Gallipoli. Through it you can imagine the scenes that unfolded there and gain new insights into our brave soldiers’ contributions to the war.”

The name Ngā Tapuwae refers to following in the footsteps of those who went before.

The app draws on the expertise of First World War historians to provide heritage site interpretation for locations where New Zealand played a significant role. 

Another app, focused on the Western Front, will be released later this year.
