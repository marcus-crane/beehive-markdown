Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner today acknowledged the life-changing contribution made by disability groups as she joined the Blind Foundation for their 125th anniversary celebrations at Government House.

“Many disability sector organisations have a long history of service both to disabled people and to their families. This year two notable disability groups – CCS Disability Action and the Blind Foundation – are celebrating important milestones,” Ms Wagner says.

“CCS Disability Action is marking 80 years since it was founded and the Blind Foundation is marking 125 years.

“CCS Disability Action was founded in February 1935, by Sir Alexander Gillies in Timaru, as the Crippled Children’s Society. Over 80 years CCS Disability Action has expanded its work to incorporate working with adults and families.

“A particularly prominent service offered by CCS Disability Action is the Mobility Parking Permit Scheme. This provides people with limited mobility wider parking spaces which are usually closer to venues. Over 100,000 Kiwis benefit from the Mobility Parking Permit Scheme.

“The Blind Foundation began in 1890 as the Jubilee Institute for the Blind. The Blind Foundation supports 11,700 Kiwis who are blind or have low vision.

“One of the best known roles of the Blind Foundation is breeding and training guide dogs. Guide dogs are bred and then taken under the care of volunteers known as puppy walkers who provide developmental training and socialisation skills for the dogs.

“These are just two examples of the many disability groups in New Zealand whose members work tirelessly to ensure disabled people and their families can live normal lives,” Ms Wagner says.
