A huge increase in prisoner education aims to help prisoners get jobs on release and reduce their risk of reoffending.

Educational achievement is important to help prisoners take part in and benefit from employment, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes.

“We know that prisoners who can hold down a job on release are far less likely to commit crimes. That’s good for them and their families and helps make our communities safer,” says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

This year the total learner places available to prisoners will increase by about 90 per cent from about 900 last year to 1,700.

A number of new qualifications will be available to prisoners including the National Certificate in Computing and Certificate in Māori Studies.

NCEA study will also be increased and prisoners will be better supported to progress into higher level education and employment.

“Many prisoners did not complete school and never gained any qualifications. Being able to read and write and gain qualifications and skills can make all the difference to their future,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

Last year the Department of Corrections signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tertiary Education Commission to work together to improve prisoner education. This includes literacy and numeracy education and ensuring prisoners gain qualifications that will help them find a sustainable job or move into higher levels of education.

Corrections contributes to the Better Public Service target which aims to achieve a 25 per cent reduction in reoffending by 2017. To achieve this Corrections will see 4,600 fewer returning offenders and 18,500 fewer victims.
