Hon Te Ururoa Flavell presented Miraka with the inaugural Māori Excellence in Export award *He kai kei aku ringa* tonight at the 2015 New Zealand International Business Awards in Auckland.

“It’s great to celebrate the giants of the Māori economy like Miraka, Sealord and Kono that make a significant contribution to the Māori and national economy”, says Mr Flavell.

The Māori Development Minister and the Associate Minister for Economic Development Mr Flavell says the Māori economy is now valued at over $42 billion and growing fast.

“These Māori exporters prove once again that culture and commerce can go hand in hand”, says Mr Flavell.

Taupō-based Miraka is the first company in the world to use renewable electricity and steam to run milk powder processing operations. It manufactures UHT milk products and milk powder to 23 countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Pacific and Latin America.

“Miraka has deep connections to its local community, a commitment to the sustainable use of natural resources and an understanding that collaboration with other entitles gives them a stronger market presence”, says Mr Flavell.

The price premium Miraka pays its milk suppliers has seen an additional $5 million injected in to the local rural economy over the past three years.

“It is also committed to running a business that is underpinned by Māori values and that demonstrates the value of the Māori Inc brand”, says Mr Flavell.

Finalist Kono are based in Marlborough and represent owners from local iwi Ngāti Koata, Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama and Te Ātiawa. They produce high quality wine, fruit and seafood and export to more than 25 countries.

The other finalist Sealord are one of New Zealand’s largest seafood companies with a global network that spans seven continents. They export around $500 million worth of seafood annually and employ around 1100 people.

The *He kai kei aku ringa* award is supported by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Te Puni Kōkiri and The Treasury.
