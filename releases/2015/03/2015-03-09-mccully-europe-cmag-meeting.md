Foreign Minister Murray McCully travels to Paris today to meet with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and then to London for a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG).

“France and New Zealand have an excellent and long-standing relationship – in fact, 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries,” Mr McCully says.

“New Zealand is now well into a two year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security and my talks with Foreign Minister Fabius will also focus on areas where we can work constructively with France at the UN.”

Mr McCully will then travel to London for the annual meeting of CMAG where he will participate in the role of Vice Chair.

“New Zealand is an active member of the Commonwealth and is committed to ensuring the organisation continues to play a focused and effective role in international affairs, particularly around governance and human rights,” Mr McCully says.
