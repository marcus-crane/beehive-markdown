Nominations open today for the 2015 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards – recognising the thousands of unsung heroes who support New Zealand’s health and disability services.

“From lending a hand to supporting people at their time of need, health volunteers make life better for New Zealanders in many ways, often without seeking any recognition,” says Dr Coleman.

“If you know an individual or team of volunteers who deserve to be recognised, I encourage you to nominate them.”

Last year’s overall Health Volunteers of the Year were the Cancer Society Canterbury West Coast Division Rural Groups.

Their 400 volunteers ferry rural cancer patients to appointments, deliver meals and baking, provide companionship and help raise awareness of a disease that affects one in three New Zealanders. Their work is greatly valued by cancer patients and their families.

Nominations close on 31 March 2015. The Awards will be presented during National Volunteer Week, 21-27 June.
