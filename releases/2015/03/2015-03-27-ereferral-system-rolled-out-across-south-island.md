Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says Southern DHB has now completed the South Island’s rollout of eReferrals, enabling faster more accurate transfer of patient information.

“West Coast, South Canterbury and Nelson Marlborough DHBs replaced paper-based referrals with electronic referrals, and now Southern DHB has begun introducing the system,” says Dr Coleman.

“More than half a million patient referrals from a GP to a hospital specialist have been sent electronically since Canterbury DHB launched the eReferrals system in 2012.

“Replacing hand-written referrals with electronic referrals reduces inaccuracies and saves time for doctors.

“Patients can get through the system faster, and clinicians receive better quality information on which to base their decisions. eReferrals also allow doctors to see where the most convenient healthcare provider is for a patient.”

eReferrals have been launched through the South Island Alliance, a collaboration of the five South Island DHBs, with support from the National Health IT Board. eReferral systems are also available in most DHBs in the North Island.

The system is being developed further to enable doctors to track the progress of their referrals. In future, doctors will also be able to make eReferrals not just externally but within DHBs – for example, between hospital departments.
