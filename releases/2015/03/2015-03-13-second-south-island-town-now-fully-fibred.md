Ashburton now has access to faster, more reliable broadband thanks to the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) network, says Communications Minister Amy Adams.

Ashburton has become the second town in the South Island completed under the UFB initiative following the Oamaru build completion late last year. 

Ms Adams said in Ashburton today that more than 8600 local households, schools, businesses and medical centres can now connect to the network.

“The Government has invested $9 million to bring fibre to the people of Ashburton since the build started in the town in 2012. The new network means better speeds, capacity and reliability for this community,” says Ms Adams.

More than ten per cent of eligible users in Ashburton have already signed up for fibre and the rate of uptake has almost doubled in the past six months.   Customers have a choice of six retail providers that are active in the area. 

Fibre is also being rolled out to state and state integrated schools in and around Ashburton, with 17 out of 24 now connected to the Government’s Network for Learning.

Seven towns in New Zealand are now fully fibred:  Whangarei, Te Awamutu, Oamaru, Cambridge, Tokoroa, Hawera and Ashburton.

“The Government is committed to building world-class fibre infrastructure in regional towns around New Zealand because of the long-term gains it brings. Faster broadband is critical to growing the economy, driving innovation and improving outcomes in education, health and the not-for-profit sector,” says Ms Adams.

“With stage one of the UFB build well advanced, the Government is now progressing the extension of the programme to a further 200,000 New Zealanders, meaning the overall reach of UFB will move from 75 per cent to 80 per cent of all New Zealanders.”
