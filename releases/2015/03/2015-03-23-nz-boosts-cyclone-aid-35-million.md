Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will contribute a further $1 million to the Cyclone Pam response and will also help transport Fiji disaster response personnel to Vanuatu by RNZAF C-130 Hercules.

“The additional funding we have announced today will be split between Vanuatu and Tuvalu,” Mr McCully says.

“The $500,000 we are providing to Vanuatu will allow New Zealand Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) personnel to deploy and will enable us to respond to additional requests for assistance from the Vanuatu Government.

“The 10 person New Zealand USAR team will assist with the production of clean drinking water, clearing roads, and limited building demolition.

“The other $500,000 will be used in Tuvalu to purchase relief and medical supplies, and to provide agricultural, food security, and transport assistance. This brings our total financial contribution to $3.5 million.

“I am also pleased to announce that a C-130 Hercules will help transport a contingent of Fiji Military engineers, health professionals, and supplies from Suva to Vanuatu today.

“This cooperation between New Zealand and Fiji is a positive development that reflects the steps we have been taking to reengage with Fiji politically and militarily,” Mr McCully says.
