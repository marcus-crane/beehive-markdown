Associate Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Nicky Wagner says hundreds of people have given their opinion on the six short-listed Canterbury Earthquake Memorial designs and the public have until Sunday 15 March to provide further feedback.

“Now is the time for people to tell us which design they think best honours the victims, those who suffered, and those who helped,” Ms Wagner says.

“The designs have been on display since 24 February on the walkway beside the Canterbury Museum in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens, as well as online.

“Feedback from the public and stakeholders will be evaluated by a panel of art and architecture experts, and a family participant. They will then make a recommendation to the Memorial Leadership Group.

“The Government has set aside up to $10 million for the memorial, along with $1 million from the Christchurch Earthquake Mayoral Relief Fund. The Memorial is expected to be constructed next year.

“I encourage people to have a look at the designs and make their views known before feedback closes on Sunday,” Ms Wagner says.
