Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett today announced details of the Government’s funding boost for emergency housing providers, and a comprehensive funding review of the sector.

“In January the Prime Minister announced Government plans to support the emergency housing sector with a $500,000 cash injection alongside a wider review of funding, as part of our Social Housing Reforms,” says Mrs Bennett.

Today’s announcement sees additional short-term funding go to 16 organisations who currently contract with the Ministry of Social Development to provide services to at-risk families in emergency accommodation. 

“Emergency housing providers work with some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, and we’re committed to supporting the vital work they do for people and families with no safe, stable home to go to.”

This boost will support providers during a thorough review to determine how the sector is currently funded, clearly establish the results government funding wants to achieve, and identify options for funding going forward.

“What we’ve seen is a fragmented approach to funding for emergency and short-term housing in the past, with multiple contracts, unclear direction for achieving results, and no single, accepted definition of what is actually meant by ‘emergency housing’.”

“As part of the review, which will be completed in mid-2015, we’re asking emergency and short-term housing providers to tell us about the services they offer to ensure the review is based on evidence and feedback directly from the sector.”

“We also want to hear from social support agencies working with people and families who’ve needed emergency accommodation, like homeless shelters and refuges, to get as complete a picture as possible.” 

“The Government’s Social Housing Reforms will increase the availability and quality of social housing. Emergency housing is there for people in greatest need and this funding boost and review will provide certainty and stability for both providers and those vulnerable New Zealanders requiring emergency accommodation.”
