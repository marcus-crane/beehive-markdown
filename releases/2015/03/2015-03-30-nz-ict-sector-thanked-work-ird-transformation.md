Revenue Minister Todd McClay has thanked the New Zealand ICT sector for their collaboration with Inland Revenue on the modernisation and simplification of New Zealand’s tax system.

“Tomorrow we will launch two discussion documents that will outline the overall direction of the modernisation and ask for feedback. I would like to acknowledge the hard work already put in by the ICT sector,” says Mr McClay.

In October 2014 a working group with 20 representatives from small, medium and large software developers was established to co-design how GST and PAYE information could be transferred to Inland Revenue in the future.

“This group is helping Inland Revenue design smart ways to file returns electronically from within software packages. For example, businesses will be able to submit their GST and payroll information directly to IRD with the press of a button,” says Mr McClay.

In parallel, Inland Revenue is working with major software developers, MYOB and Xero.

“We are using their extensive knowledge to learn how we can simplify processes for small businesses.

“The Government is making a major investment in simplifying the tax system for New Zealand taxpayers, so we want to make sure it delivers significant improvements for third parties and New Zealand as a whole, not just Inland Revenue,” says Mr McClay.
