Education Minister Hekia Parata says she is delighted with the high number and calibre of people nominated for the new teacher professional body, EDUCANZ (Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand).

Nominations for the nine member council closed last week, with 145 names put forward.

“I am thrilled that we’ve had such strong interest and that it has come from across the country and all parts of the education sector.  We’ve also had people nominated with a broad range of other experience, including in governance and business.

“I want to thank everyone who has been nominated and to acknowledge their preparedness to play a key role in raising the status of teaching and lifting student achievement.

“Given the calibre of the people nominated for the council, I’m very confident it will provide sound governance and leadership and help chart the future course of the profession.

“In making the appointments I will take account of the individual talents of prospective members and the collective mix of skills, experience and knowledge so that the interests of the education profession as a whole will be truly represented.”

Ms Parata says she expects to name the new council in June. At least five members of EDUCANZ must be registered teachers with current practising certifications.
