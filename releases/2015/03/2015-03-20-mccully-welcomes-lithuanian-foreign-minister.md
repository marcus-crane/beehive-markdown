Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed a visit to New Zealand by Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Linas Linkevičius.

“Lithuania is currently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council alongside New Zealand, and the visit provided an opportunity to discuss their perspectives on key issues facing the Council,” Mr McCully says.

“At the same time, I am pleased to note that we have recently concluded negotiations on a reciprocal Working Holiday Scheme with Lithuania.

“The Scheme will provide up to 100 young people per year from both counties a great opportunity to work and travel in each other’s countries, and it will complement the agreements we have in place with a number of other European Union countries,” Mr McCully says.
