Education Minister Hekia Parata wishes the best of luck to everyone involved in this week’s national kapa haka festival, Te Matatini, in Christchurch.

“Te Matatini showcases the very best of Māori performing arts talent. It’s a celebration of identity, language and culture at the highest level and I’m looking forward to being amongst it,” says Ms Parata.

“This is a hugely significant event for New Zealand, and for Christchurch which will welcome more than 50,000 people this week. I congratulate Ngāi Tahu, the sponsors, businesses, communities, performers and volunteers working to bring this amazing event together.

“I want to see the same determination, discipline and pride we see at Te Matatini channelled into the educational achievement of our kids.

“Māori education achievement is on the rise. More young Māori are attaining NCEA Level 2 than ever before and Māori participation in early childhood education is at record levels. But we have a way to go before we can be satisfied that all our mokopuna are succeeding to their full potential.

“It takes the support and engagement of parents, whānau and educators to ensure our kids leave school with the skills and qualifications they need to succeed in te ao Māori, New Zealand and the world,” she says.

Te Matatini is jointly hosted by Te Matatini Society Incorporated and Ngā Pākihi Whakatekateka o Waitaha Cultural Council Trust. The Ministry of Education supports Te Matatini Society Inc. as a strategic partner.

Ms Parata encourages visitors to visit the Ministry of Education stall which is showcasing how a modern, state of the art schooling network is emerging.

“Tēnā tātou e whai kaha tēnei taonga ō tātou, arā, te mahi a Hine-te-iwaiwa, ngā mahi a te rēhia. Kei a koutou te wā. Tū pakari ai ki te atamira, ki te ao whānui. Kia kaha rā, kia tū māia,” says Ms Parata.
