Prime Minister John Key has today acknowledged the passing of former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.

“Mr Fraser served Australia with distinction over his many years in office and made a significant contribution to the strengthening of the Australia-New Zealand relationship,” says Mr Key.

“The bonds between our two countries that exist today were forged by past Prime Ministers whose commitment and vision for our two nations, and for the prosperity, security and advancement of our region, rested in part on working more closely together. 

“I would like to acknowledge Mr Fraser’s contribution to this important legacy and reaffirm my commitment to building on that for the betterment of both countries.

“My thoughts are with Mr Fraser’s family and the people of Australia.”
