Transport Minister Simon Bridges has today signed a protocol to amend an air services agreement between New Zealand and Viet Nam, creating enhanced services between the two countries.

The signing was witnessed by Prime Minister John Key, as well as the Prime Minister of Viet Nam, Nguyen Tan Dung, who is visiting New Zealand.

The protocol change means increased code-sharing opportunities, where two or more airlines share the same flight, are now possible.

Air New Zealand currently code-shares on Singapore Airlines to just three destinations in Viet Nam. Existing rules mean it cannot code-share to other Vietnamese destinations.

“Air New Zealand will no longer face those restrictions, once both countries have completed necessary official processes.

“Travel between New Zealand and Viet Nam is on the rise and this new arrangement could bring further growth - Vietnamese visitors to New Zealand have already grown by 33 percent between 2009 and 2014 and, during the same period, Kiwis travelling to Viet Nam grew by 81 percent.

“Viet Nam is one of our key partners in south-east Asia. Enabling enhanced air services between our two countries further demonstrates our strong relationship.

“I hope a Vietnamese carrier will consider operating to New Zealand, to further grow tourism, trade and personal ties between our two countries”, Mr Bridges says.

This change continues the Government’s implementation of its International Air Transport Policy which was announced in August 2012 and aims to grow the economy and deliver greater prosperity, security and opportunities for New Zealanders.
