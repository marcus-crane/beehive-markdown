Minister for Women Louise Upston has used this week’s 30th anniversary of the Ministry for Women to encourage all New Zealanders to do their part to encourage and develop women leaders.

In a speech at the Ministry’s offices tonight, Ms Upston said New Zealand has seen many gains for women in New Zealand over the past three decades.

“The Ministry for Women was listed in the State Services Act on 29 March 1985, 30 years ago this Sunday. This anniversary is a great opportunity to celebrate what New Zealand women have achieved, and to recognise the enormous opportunities women and girls have to achieve their potential.

“In the past we have measured women’s success in leadership by the numbers of women in Parliament, on state boards and on private boards.

“Tonight I am challenging everyone to think about those with potential that is waiting to be unlocked. Think of the women who have the skills, talent and drive to get to the top, and the women who can inspire others along the way.

“Women are currently under-represented in leadership roles in New Zealand and a significant number of women with potential drop out of the workforce, or stall below senior management and top leadership positions.

“We need the support of all New Zealanders to help make a difference to the lives of Kiwi women, which will in turn help to boost our economy and make New Zealand an even more prosperous country.”

Ms Upston said the Ministry for Women’s 30th anniversary is a time to reflect on what we have achieved since 1985 and to commit to what we can achieve for women and girls in the future.

“Until women have equal rights, equal choice, equal opportunities and are valued equally, our work will continue.”
