Education Minister Hekia Parata is today in Wellington holding the first meeting of this year’s Ministerial Cross-Sector Forum on Raising Achievement.

Around 90 people, including representatives from early learning, primary and secondary schooling, tertiary, unions, business, iwi, and educational experts, have gathered to discuss raising achievement in education.

Ms Parata, the Forum Chair, says New Zealand has a world-class education system but there are some children and young people who are not doing as well as they could be.

“Our goal is to lift up those who are being left behind, while also encouraging those who are doing well to do even better.”

Ms Parata will be speaking to the Forum to outline and discuss her priorities for raising achievement for every child and young person, including maintaining the momentum of Communities of Schools, improving inclusion and delivery for special education, and making sure that funding and legislation supports a 21st century education system.

“This is an exciting time for education in New Zealand. There is lots happening across the education system that will help our goal of raising educational outcomes for all Kiwi kids, and we need to make sure that we keep delivering on that commitment and addressing the challenges.

“The Forum has a dynamic range of expertise and the support of the wider education sector. I look forward to working with the Forum over the course of this year.”
