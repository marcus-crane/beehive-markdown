Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says the public will get a chance to have its say on the future of Victoria Square, part of the Te Papa Ōtākaro/Avon River Precinct.

“We all care about the future of Victoria Square and I want to make sure that the people of Christchurch can have their say to ensure the Square best reflects the community’s needs,” Ms Wagner says.

“There are some challenges which need to be faced, such as repairing heritage features like the Bowker Fountain, improving safety and ensuring the Square reflects the city’s joint heritage.

“But what we hope this public participation process will deliver is more of an idea about how the community sees Victoria Square now and into the future. We want to hear what the possibilities are for this very special civic space so that we can use this development opportunity wisely.

“The community participation process starts today and continues for six months. People can have their say online at [http://ccdu.govt.nz/victoria-square](http://ccdu.govt.nz/victoria-square) and on the feedback forms available at all Christchurch City Council service centres.

“People can even leave a short video message telling their story and their ideas for Victoria Square at the Visionarium at Te Matatini this weekend and then in Victoria Square for the following four weeks.

“I look forward to hearing from as many people as possible so we can work together to make the best use of Victoria Square,” Ms Wagner says.

The community participation process will take six months, starting today with the call for input. At the end of April that input will be reviewed and compiled into a draft plan which will then go back to the community for feedback.

That feedback will also be incorporated before a final plan for the works in Victoria Square is presented in mid-September.
