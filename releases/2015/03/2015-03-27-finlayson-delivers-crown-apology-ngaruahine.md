Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson today delivered the Crown’s formal apology to Ngāruahine for historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.

The apology was delivered in Hokitika at the conclusion of Ngāruahine’s week-long Hikoi ki Te Waipounamu to honour the memory of the 405 members of those Ngāruahine tupuna who were transported to and detained in the South Island by the Crown after the Taranaki Wars.

“For generations the Crown failed to live up to its obligations to Ngāruahine under the Treaty of Waitangi,” Mr Finlayson said. “The effects of the Crown’s actions damaged Ngāruahine’s autonomy, cultural and spiritual heritage and ability to exercise their customary rights and responsibilities.”

“I hope this settlement and apology will relieve the burden of grievance that Ngāruahine has carried for so many years. The Crown looks forward to building a relationship of mutual trust and co-operation with Ngāruahine, founded on respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles,” Mr Finlayson said.

The Deed of Settlement with Ngāruahine was signed in August 2014 at Te Ngutu o Te Manu in Taranaki.
