Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says that a new state of the art drug analyser funded by proceeds of crime has made finding drugs at the border easier and safer during the first six months of use.

In the past six months Customs officers have been using a handheld analyser, the Thermo Scientific FirstDefender RM, which uses a laser beam to identify substances without opening the packaging.

“FirstDefender has conducted over 3200 tests in the past six months with approximately 40 percent of the substances – over 1200 substances – indicatively testing positive for drugs,” Ms Wagner says.

“More than 1200 illegal drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine and MDMA, have not made it on to the streets and have not caused harm to our communities. Customs Officers are also safer as they can avoid handling potentially volatile substances.

“Illicit drug manufacturers are forever changing chemicals to evade detection, and Customs now has better tools to identify them on the spot. More than 11,000 substances can be identified almost instantly.

“Legitimate imports can be sent quickly on their way once identified, so trade is not held up at the border.

“In 2009 the Government made a commitment that the proceeds of crime would be used to target the drug trade and help those affected by it.

“This is one of many initiatives that have been funded under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act, including adding more organised crime investigators, supporting drug treatment programmes and helping offenders re-integrate into their communities.

“With over 1200 substances indicatively testing positive for drugs in the first six months alone, I’m pleased that ill-gotten gains are now being used to stop drugs at the border,” Ms Wagner says.
