Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew joined Māori owners and the community in Northland today to celebrate the surrender of a 740 hectare forestry lease.

The ceremony included the felling of the final trees to mark the end of what was originally a 99 year Crown lease. The trees are to be replanted by the landowner, Parengarenga A Incorporation.

“Partnership between the Incorporation and the Crown has been important to the development of forestry in the Far North,” Mrs Goodhew says. “By stabilising moving sand on the Aupouri peninsula this once unproductive land has been developed into a productive forest.

“Due to the geographic location of the Aupouri forests, the trees produce a wood density resulting in high quality structural grade lumber and veneer.

“The Northland region has 151,800 hectares of planted production forest area, and these forests continue to contribute to the social and economic well-being of local people and local businesses.

“The government is now working with industry and iwi to support further opportunities in forestry. The next step is the production of a Northland Economic Action Plan.”

The initial Crown lease had a term of 99 years from July 1966. In 1999 a variation to the lease was negotiated between the Crown and the Incorporation with the lifetime of the lease reduced to the end of the first crop.
