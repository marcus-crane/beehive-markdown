Young technology entrepreneurs in the Waikato region will benefit from $60,000 of funding for Online Education Limited, announced today by Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This is about helping to grow the next generation of software developers and technology innovators,” says Ms Kaye.

“The funding will help around 400 young people take part in technology-related challenges and product development exercises.

“The young people will practise core skills such as coding, which is how you instruct a computer to create software, apps and websites.

“But they’ll also practise working as a team, coming up with new ideas and building business prototypes.

“Tomorrow’s world will rely even more on technology, so this is an important way to support young people to develop both the skills and the attitude needed to succeed in that world.”

Ms Kaye was joined by local MP David Bennett at the University of Waikato this morning to announce the funding to Online Education Limited, and congratulate everyone behind the initiative.
