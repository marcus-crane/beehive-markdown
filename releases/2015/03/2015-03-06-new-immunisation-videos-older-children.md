Health Minister Jonathan Coleman welcomes new online resources on immunisation for older children.

“These new immunisation videos produced by the Ministry of Health give students and their parents the information they need to best protect their health,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealand’s infant immunisation rate has improved dramatically under this Government, but immunisation rates for older children have stayed steady. 

“Reducing the spread of whooping cough and HPV has a big effect on the health of our young people. Parents of older children should have the same confidence in immunisation that parents of younger children have.”

The new videos feature children aged 11-12 talking about the diseases the vaccines protect against.

Children are offered free immunisations at age 11 against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, and for girls at age 12, human papillomavirus (HPV). 

School immunisation programmes begin early in the school year, and many Year 7 and 8 students will have brought home new consent forms with the most up to date information on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.

“Schools are the most convenient place for children of this age to get immunised, but it is harder for parents to have a one on one discussion with a health professional in this context.  It is important students take home and share that information with their parents,” says Dr Coleman.
