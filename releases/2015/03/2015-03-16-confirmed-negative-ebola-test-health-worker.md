Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the healthcare worker who recently returned from Sierra Leone has been officially cleared of having Ebola following a second negative test result.

“It is great news that the second test has come back negative,” says Dr Coleman. “In line with international protocols, a second test was required to rule out Ebola.”

“The patient remains in a stable condition, and will continue to be cared for in Christchurch Hospital. The patient’s partner has now been cleared to return to work.

“I would like to thank the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne for quickly turning around the test results. Their prompt work is much appreciated.

“This case has proven that New Zealand’s well-practised procedures worked extremely well. It is a credit to all the health staff who were involved.

“I acknowledge that this has been an anxious time for the patient and their family, and I encourage the media to give them the space they need at this time.”
