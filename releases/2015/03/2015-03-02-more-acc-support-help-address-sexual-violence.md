ACC Minister Nikki Kaye welcomes ACC’s new support package for people who’ve experienced sexual abuse or assault.

“It’s clear to me ACC has listened to feedback from clients, families, counsellors and others, and their input is reflected in the more flexible, wider range of support now being offered,” says Ms Kaye.

“ACC has come a long way in the last few years and I’m encouraged things are heading in the right direction.

“The new approach is not just about helping individuals but families too, who are also impacted if a loved one is sexually abused or assaulted.”

Improvements under the new service include:

- more holistic support – as well as one-to-one therapy, people can now access new support such as family and whānau sessions, social work support and liaison with other agencies to obtain assistance that can help recovery
- more hours of support for those who need it – up to around 60 hours of total short-term support, and up to around 100 hours of further support over 12 months, if required, for people with longer-term needs
- more flexible support - making it easier to enter, exit and return to assistance at any time
- new purpose-built claim form, which reflects the sensitivities of the situation.

“The new service is also fully funded by ACC. This means service providers cannot charge clients a co-payment, which will help more people access help when they need it.

“I’m pleased to confirm that on top of this, ACC will invest more in preventing sexual violence, from around $1 million to $4 million in the coming year.

“This extra support and injury prevention funding links into the wider government strategy, led by Ministers Adams and Tolley, to address sexual and family violence and encourage cultural change.

“It can be difficult sometimes for people to come forward and get help, so I encourage anyone affected by sexual violence to see what help is available.”
