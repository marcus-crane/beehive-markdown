Communications Minister Amy Adams today announced the completion of the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) service in Blenheim.

“Around 12,500 homes, schools, businesses and health facilities can now access fast and efficient internet. The uptake in Blenheim has been one of the highest in the country with over 14 per cent of residents already signed up for UFB,” says Ms Adams.

Ms Adams said having access to fast and reliable broadband was critical to the future well-being of regional towns like Blenheim.

“Businesses with a high internet use have double the growth, exports and job creation rates compared to companies with a low web presence. BP Computers in Blenheim is a good example of a local business benefiting from UFB,” says Ms Adams.

“The company, which has nine staff, serves the Marlborough and Kaikoura region in all things IT related, but thanks to UFB the company has been able to expand its services nationwide – and still be based in Blenheim.

“The speed and reliability of UFB has allowed BP Computers to take on a major new contract, providing IT support to a nationwide franchise chain which has 250 stores across New Zealand.”

“The Government is committed to improving regional infrastructure and has invested more than $12.5 million to deliver UFB to Blenheim,” says Ms Adams

Across New Zealand, eight towns are now fully fibred: Whangarei, Te Awamutu, Oamaru, Cambridge, Tokoroa, Hawera, Ashburton and now Blenheim.

“Stage one of the UFB is well on target and extra funding of up to $210 million is planned so that the overall reach of UFB will lift from 75 percent to 80 percent of all New Zealanders.

“We are also investing $100 million to expand the Rural Broadband programme, and $50 million to improve mobile coverage in black spot areas along main highways and in popular tourist destinations,” says Ms Adams.
