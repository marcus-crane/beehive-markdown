Education Minister Hekia Parata today announced the names of the judges and education experts who will decide the winners of the 2015 Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“The Awards, presented for the first time last year, celebrate outstanding teaching in early childhood centres, and primary and secondary schools,” says Ms Parata.

“They give public recognition to passionate education professionals who have made a difference in the lives of children. We need to continue to strengthen the value and status placed on the teaching profession and the Awards help to do this. By showcasing highly-effective teaching, they also drive improvement across the education sector.”  

Judging occurs in two stages. First a panel of education experts reviews the entries and recommends finalists in four categories and the education focus prize. Then members of the judging panel visit each of the finalists, select the category winners and appoint a supreme winner.

The winning entry from each category will receive $20,000, as well as a professional development opportunity. The winners of the Supreme Award will receive an additional $30,000. Finalists will also receive a financial award to acknowledge their contribution to education.

Last year’s Supreme Award was won by Otumoetai Intermediate School in Tauranga.  The school was also joint winner in Excellence in Teaching and Learning, and a finalist in the Engaging and Governing category.

Ms Parata says the two panels contain a wonderful mix of experienced and knowledgeable education leaders from academic, early childhood, schooling and tertiary backgrounds.
