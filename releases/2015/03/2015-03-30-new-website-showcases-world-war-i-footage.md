Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says a new website featuring previously unavailable film from World War I is an engrossing historical resource.

Anzac: Sights & Sounds, from Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision, gives an evocative, insightful and compelling view of the conflict, using archival film footage gathered from across the world, recorded interviews, songs and photographs.

“The films and audio recordings on the website are an extraordinary record of a tragic and painful time in New Zealand’s history,” Ms Barry says.

“Sounds and images give an emotional, personal connection to the past. Watching the footage, you can picture yourself saying goodbye to your loved ones, knowing it might be for the last time.”

“Having this footage publicly available at no cost makes the site an important part of our ongoing World War I commemorations. It will also be a valuable education tool.”

The focus of the launch is on the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 as well as the home front, with more footage from later in the war to be added as other anniversaries approach.

Highlights include a recording of the Otago Regiment leaving Dunedin in 1914 as well as the soldier’s recollections of life in the trenches of the Dardanelles.

“You get a real sense of what their lives were like in the appalling conditions at Gallipoli. You can feel the camaraderie, the experiences and also the sense of humour that bound them all together in the horrific battles they had to endure.”
