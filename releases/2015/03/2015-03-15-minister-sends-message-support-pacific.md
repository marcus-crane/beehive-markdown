Minister for Pacific Peoples Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has offered his sympathy and support to Pacific Island nations in the wake of the destruction Cyclone Pam has wrought.

“My heart goes out to all those who have been affected. Cyclone Pam has caused deaths and destroyed many homes and much infrastructure,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“My prayers, thoughts and love go to the people of Vanuatu, including those who live in New Zealand and have family and friends back home.

 

“I can only imagine how those with loved ones in the affected areas are feeling and I hope they are soon able to contact them and hear that they are unhurt.

“As announced by Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully yesterday, our government is providing an initial contribution of $1 million to assist Pacific nations hit by Cyclone Pam and from today will make a further assessment on how we can best help affected countries,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
