Students at Tolaga Bay Area School, East Coast, are set to enjoy a $5.2 million classroom upgrade, Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“New blocks will be built at the school, to replace four older buildings and classrooms that are no longer fit for purpose,” says Ms Kaye.

“The new blocks will comprise 12 new learnings spaces, with ICT and wifi technology to enable learning in a digital age.

“Other work as part of the upgrade will include structural improvements to the school’s gymnasium, along with a new roof and upgraded shower facilities and repairs to the library.

“As with all major school upgrades, the Tolaga Bay project will see traditional classrooms replaced with more flexible, open plan learning spaces.

“This is about providing students with an environment that excites and inspires them to learn and achieve more.”

Local MP Anne Tolley visited Tolaga Bay Area School this morning to share news of the upgrade with students and teachers.

“I was really impressed with the recent Uawanui Bioblitz science initiative at the school.  The rebuild will provide a modern learning space to match the innovative education being delivered here,” says Mrs Tolley. 

Work is expected begin early next year and be completed by the end of 2016.

“This is an investment not just in the school but in the Tolaga Bay area, and will provide a facility that the local community can be proud of,” says Ms Kaye.

**About Tolaga Bay Area School**

Tolaga Bay Area School is a decile 1 school for years 1-13 students. It has a roll of 243, with levels 1-4 Māori language curriculum delivery for all students.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
