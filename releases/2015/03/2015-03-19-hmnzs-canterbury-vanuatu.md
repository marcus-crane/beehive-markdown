Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee have announced that the HMNZS Canterbury will be sent to Vanuatu to support the recovery effort following Cyclone Pam.

“HMNZS Canterbury will depart for Vanuatu as soon as possible carrying personnel, heavy engineering equipment and other supplies to support the recovery effort,” Mr McCully says.

“Once it arrives New Zealand engineering and environmental health teams will assist local people with tasks to be identified in discussion with the Vanuatu Government, such as, clearing roads, repairing key infrastructure, demolition work, and disease control.

“New Zealand is committed to helping the people of Vanuatu recover from Cyclone Pam and we are already looking at how we can further support what will be a major programme of reconstruction.”

Minister Brownlee says the HMNZS Canterbury is tailor made for this sort of operation and will make a valuable contribution to supporting the Government of Vanuatu’s response.

“I am proud of the role our defence personnel have played in supporting the emergency response phase and it is important we now do all we can to help the people of Vanuatu get back on their feet as quickly as possible,” Mr Brownlee says.

“As a multi-role vessel the HMNZS Canterbury has a number of capabilities that make it perfectly suited to this sort of operation. In addition to being able to carry a large amount of equipment and supplies it is also able to off-load on small atolls and islands using a Seasprite helicopter and smaller tender craft.

“RNZAF C-130s continue to support the Vanuatu Government with the delivery of emergency relief supplies and equipment and we will also be deploying a RNZAF King Air to support the air bridge between Port Vila and the outer islands.”
