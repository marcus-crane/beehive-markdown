Gender equality and the empowerment of women will take centre stage at the United Nations in New York this week with New Zealand having a strong voice in discussions.

Minister for Women Louise Upston will arrive in New York today, coinciding with International Women’s Day, to attend the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women until 12 March.

“New Zealand has a strong international reputation on gender equality and this is a valuable opportunity to share our work to improve the lives of women across our region,” Ms Upston said.

“This year’s theme is the [Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action](http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/pfa_e_final_web.pdf), a very important international call to action on gender equality and the empowerment of women.

*“*The Commission will undertake a review of progress made in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 20 years after its adoption at the [Fourth World Conference on Women](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/fwcwn.html) in 1995.

“Discussions will also focus on opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda.

“I am excited about representing New Zealand in international discussions on how we can improve the lives of women and girls.”

While in the United States Ms Upston will also travel to Washington for a range of meetings as Minister of Land Information, engaging with organisations working on the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure Plan, a programme similar to New Zealand’s geospatial data programme.
