Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry has congratulated Te Matatini National Kapa Haka Festival organisers for another outstanding celebration of Māori traditional performing arts.

The festival is the world’s largest celebration of Māori performing arts, attracting more than 30,000 performers, supporters and visitors over the four days.

This is the first time the event has been held in the South Island for more than twenty years.

“It’s really encouraging to see the festival in Christchurch where it’s making a dynamic and valuable contribution to the cultural recovery post-earthquake,” Ms Barry says.

“Kapa haka is about more than just the performance, it’s intrinsic to our New Zealand culture and identity and helps define who we are on the world stage. Research shows what a positive contribution kapa haka makes in the wider sense to our society and to better health and educational outcomes as well as its economic value,” she says.

Manatū Taonga, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, is Te Matatini’s principal funder and the annual funding of $1.248 million provides more than half its income.

“This year’s event reinforces my intention to not only continue this Government’s support for Te Matatini, but to work closely with the Board over the coming year to explore the ways we can contribute further to its future work and growth.”

“Te Matatini has some exciting ideas for expanding future investment in kapa haka. There is a desire to build the capability of kapa haka across the country by extending the professional development Te Matatini offers to rohe. There may also be opportunities to make better use of benefits from its intellectual property.”
