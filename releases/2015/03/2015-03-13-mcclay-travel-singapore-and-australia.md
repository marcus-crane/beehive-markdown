Revenue, SOE and Associate Trade and Foreign Affairs Minister, Todd McClay will travel to Singapore and Australia from16-21 March to help foster ties and grow New Zealand’s technology sector.

In Singapore, Mr McClay will open the New Zealand Technology Showcase, a programme designed to introduce New Zealand’s high-growth technology companies to international investors.

“This is a great opportunity to attract the wider base of investment needed to retain and grow companies in New Zealand. All of the companies participating in the showcase are high growth businesses who need investment from a range of domestic and international sources to help them scale up internationally in future,” says Mr McClay.

“Technology is New Zealand’s fastest growing sector with our top 100 high technology companies contributing $8 billion to our economy last year, and more than $5 billion of exports.

New Zealand will also be highlighted at the ‘Naturally New Zealand Pavilion’, an exhibition at Changi Airport, which hosts a replica Hobbit hole from The Hobbit movie set constructed by the team who built The Shire for the blockbuster Hobbit trilogy.

“The Naturally New Zealand Pavilion will be used as a venue to exhibit a range of New Zealand products, including food and wine, sport and Air New Zealand, which this year returned to the Singapore market.”

Mr McClay will also visit New Zealand businesses in Singapore including Skyline’s Luge track on Sentosa Island and food safety and biosecurity company AsureQuality.

Mr McClay will return home via Australia and speak at the Turkey ANZAC Centenary dinner in Sydney on Friday.
