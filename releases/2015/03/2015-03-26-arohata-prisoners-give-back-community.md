Prisoners at Tawa’s Arohata Prison are making a positive contribution to the community, Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

Mr Lotu-Iiga visited the prison today to meet Corrections staff and prisoners, to listen to them about life inside and to see first-hand how the prison operates.

“The government aims to reduce reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017. To help achieve that it is important that I see how our policies operate on a practical level inside our Corrections facilities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I am also keen to hear from prisoners and staff about any barriers that prevent us from reaching that goal and what further steps we can take to give offenders every chance of leading a crime-free life when they are released.”

“Arohata has a strong focus on community engagement and prisoners have been involved in a number of initiatives that contribute to their local community and beyond.”

The prison offers a wide range of arts and activities to encourage rehabilitation and reintegration. These include performance, art and crafts and creative writing. One project has been to knit 280 poppies for the “Patriotic Call to Yarn” for the National Army Museum in Waiouru, which is a nationwide tribute for every New Zealander who died during WWI.

Arohata is one of three women’s prisons. It has the only drug treatment unit for women, providing a residential drug and alcohol programme. It also provides the Kowhiritanga (Making Choices) Rehabilitation Programme which deals with female prisoners’ unique needs.
