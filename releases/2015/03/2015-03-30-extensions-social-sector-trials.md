Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced that the Social Sector Trials taking place in 16 communities around New Zealand are being extended for a year from 1 July.

The trials involve a number of agencies working together on the ground in communities to produce better results in delivering social services.

“The Social Sector Trials are demonstrating that a community-based approach can better coordinate Government resources to the people who need them,” says Mrs Tolley.

“With a view to adopting permanent structures, over the next twelve months we will take a close look at what is effective in the trial areas and analyse how the trials can work alongside other initiatives such as Children’s Teams and Whānau Ora, in the changing social sector landscape.

“Feedback over the next year from those involved in the trials will be extremely important, and I want to thank those communities who are embracing this new way of working together.”
