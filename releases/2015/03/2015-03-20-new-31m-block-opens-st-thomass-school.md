Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye was delighted to open a new 12 classroom block at St Thomas’s School in Kohimarama, Auckland this afternoon.

“In February last year I announced a $3 million project to replace old classrooms and create more learning space at St Thomas’s School, and it is great to be here with local MP Simon O’Connor,  just over twelve months later to officially open the new building.

“Seven classrooms in the new two-storey block replace existing, older classrooms, and the other five will enable the school to accommodate its increasing roll.

“Keeping ahead of Auckland’s population growth is a major challenge, but it’s one the government is committed to meeting.

“To ensure there’s sufficient school capacity in our biggest city, $350 million is being invested in new schools and classrooms in Auckland over a four-year period.

“The new classroom block I opened today is the first part of ongoing development at St Thomas’s School.

“Upcoming projects at the school include a new administration block, and another two-storey block of six new classrooms.

“As with all major school upgrades, the work at St Thomas’s School involves replacing traditional classrooms with more flexible, open plan learning spaces.

“This is about providing students with an environment that excites and inspires them to learn and achieve more.”

“St Thomas’s is a high performing school with an inclusive culture, and I know the new facilities here will support its students to strive for the best.”

**About St Thomas’s School**

St Thomas’s School is a state, coeducational, decile 10 full primary school (years 1 to 8) with a roll of 754 students.

**About modern learning environments**

Unlike traditional classrooms, where teachers address students from the front of the class, today’s teachers work more collaboratively with students, either in groups or individually according to students’ learning needs.

When new schools are built or existing schools upgraded, this is an opportunity to invest in modern standards which support new teaching styles and offer flexible, comfortable environments for learning.

Spaces can be changed to suit teaching programmes, and acoustics, lighting, technology, heating and air quality are of a high standard to help students concentrate on learning.
