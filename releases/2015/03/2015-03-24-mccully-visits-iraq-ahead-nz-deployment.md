Foreign Minister Murray McCully travelled to Baghdad yesterday for talks with Iraq’s Prime Minister Mr Haider al-Abadi and Foreign Minister Dr Ibrahim al-Ja'afari.

“New Zealand is committed to supporting Iraq as they address the threat posed by ISIL and build a more law-abiding and democratic country,” Mr McCully says.

“To date New Zealand’s contribution to the international coalition against ISIL has been focused on the provision of humanitarian aid to people displaced by the fighting in Iraq and Syria.

“In February the Prime Minister announced plans to deploy a military training mission to Iraq. My visit was an opportunity to talk to the Government of Iraq about the deployment and how we ensure our defence personnel have the appropriate legal protections.

“I will be reporting back to the Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues on the outcome of these discussions when I return to New Zealand,” Mr McCully says.
