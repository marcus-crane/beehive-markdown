Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today welcomed the Commerce select committee’s report on the Standards and Accreditation Bill which has recommended some improvements to the proposed regime.

“I would like to thank the committee and submitters who provided constructive feedback on the Bill, which is another part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda,” Mr Goldsmith says.

“The changes to the Standards system are aimed at ensuring it is viable and well-functioning and meets the needs of business, regulators and consumers into the future.

“Standards underpin billions of dollars of exports and enable New Zealand firms to be internationally competitive. They provide for access to markets, interoperability of technology, and give quality assurance for the products and technologies that New Zealanders use on a daily basis at home and at work.

The main changes recommended by the Select Committee provide for a more flexible and proportionate approach to managing actual and perceived conflicts of interest for members of standards development committees. They also make it clear that New Zealand will continue to be involved in the development of international standards.

Key aspects of the Bill include:

- establishing a new independent statutory board to approve New Zealand Standards and membership of Standards development committees;
- retaining and strengthening key elements of the current arrangements, such as codifying in legislation the role of technical experts in developing Standards;
- locating the Standards  development function in the Ministry of Business, Innovation  and Employment ensuring closer alignment with government objectives such as economic growth, international trade, innovation and health and safety; and
- strengthening existing cost recovery, by providing for full lifecycle costing of Standards and improved access to Standards.

The Bill will also repeal the Testing Laboratory Registration Act 1972 and incorporate its provisions into the Standards and Accreditation Bill.

Minor changes in the Bill will better reflect the Testing Laboratory Registration Council’s accreditation activities, including renaming the Council the Accreditation Council.

“The Bill will now be debated by Parliament before it is finalised and passed into law, with the main changes to the institutional arrangements coming into force several months afterwards,” Mr Goldsmith says.

Standards New Zealand and the Standards Council will continue to provide support for Standards development, approval and access during this time.
