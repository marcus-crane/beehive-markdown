Prime Minister John Key has expressed his sincere condolences to the people of Singapore following the death of the nation’s first Prime Minster, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

“Mr Lee made an extraordinary contribution to Singapore, both as it found its way to independence in 1965 and in the 50 years since then,” said Mr Key.

“A man of rare qualities, Mr Lee’s courage, determination, commitment, character and ability made him a formidable leader who held the respect of Singaporeans and the international community alike.”

Known as one of Singapore’s founding fathers, Mr Lee guided the development of a country which has become a world leader. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, which has offered cohesion and stability in a diverse region. 

“Mr Lee provided a unifying presence in his country since its creation as a state in 1965.  His loss will be deeply felt by his family and the people of Singapore.”

“I had the honour of meeting Mr Lee in 2007 during his last official visit to New Zealand. He was well known for his insights and foresight but what struck me most was his unwavering determination to see Singapore succeed.” 

“A powerful advocate for the region and supportive of New Zealand’s role in South East Asia and the wider world, Mr Lee was a close and long-time friend of New Zealand,” said Mr Key.
