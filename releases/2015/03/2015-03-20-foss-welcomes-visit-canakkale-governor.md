Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says Ahmet Cinar, Governor of Turkey’s Canakkale Province, will visit New Zealand next week.

Canakkale Province includes the Gallipoli Peninsula, where 2000 New Zealanders will attend commemorations next month marking 100 years since the Anzac landings.

“The Gallipoli centenary is a hugely significant event for Turkey, New Zealand, Australia and other countries involved in the 1915 conflict,” Mr Foss says.

“We are committed to working closely and collaboratively with Turkey to ensure the centenary is appropriately marked.”

During his visit, Mr Cinar will meet relevant ministers and NZ Inc agencies to discuss the commemorations and work through any outstanding issues.  

He will also join Mr Foss for a wreath laying ceremony at Ataturk Memorial in Wellington on Wednesday and the unveiling of a commemorative statue of Sapper Moore-Jones in Hamilton on Friday.

“This is also an opportunity for the New Zealand Government to thank Mr Cinar for the considerable resources Turkey commits to Anzac Day commemorations every year,” Mr Foss says.
