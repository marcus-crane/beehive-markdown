Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss today announced the Visiting Drivers Signature Project (VDSP) will be extended and planned safety improvements fast-tracked following recent crashes involving overseas visitors.

“The Government recognises that many people are concerned with poor driving behaviour on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations, particularly in the lower South Island,” Mr Foss says. 

“That is why we are extending the VDSP to include the West Coast — an area that attracts a large number of tourists.

“A range of planned safety improvements on state highways in Otago and Southland will also be fast-tracked for completion by July 1 this year.”

These improvements include an additional:

- 50km of centre-line ‘rumble strips’
- 140km of no-passing markings
- 200km of highway marked with ‘keep left’ arrows

“This work will improve safety for all road users, including the increasing number of overseas visitors choosing to explore our country by car,” Mr Foss says.

The safety improvements announced today will be in addition to a range of measures already in place in Otago and Southland, including 564km of edge-line rumble strips, 1800km of highway marked with ‘keep left’ arrows, 4755 curve warning signs and 165km of safety barriers.

“Every death or serious injury on our roads is a tragedy and these tragedies can be prevented by improving safety in every part of the transport system — vehicles, speeds, road users and the roads themselves,” Mr Foss says.
