Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says general practice staff are getting behind a programme which has them joining their patients to live healthily.

“The Energized Practice initiative sees medical staff and patients take part in activities designed and delivered by regional sports trusts to improve their personal health and fitness,” says Dr Coleman.

“More than 30 medical centres have signed up to the programme to date. Staff taking part receive a tailored physical activity programme, recipe advice, and motivational texts and emails.

“Whether it is exercise classes, using a pedometer throughout the day or just doing some regular gardening, staff are focusing on how fitness can be incorporated into daily routines.”

The Energized Practices project started in 2013 as part of the wider Green Prescriptions initiative, with $500,000 in funding over two years from the Ministry of Health.

The programme is run by Sport Waikato, Sport Taranaki and Sport Gisborne with support from Midlands Health Network.

An evaluation of the scheme will be carried out later this year to help inform the potential for further roll out.
