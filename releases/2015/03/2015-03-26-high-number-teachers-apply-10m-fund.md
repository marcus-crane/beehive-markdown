Education Minister Hekia Parata has welcomed the more than 200 applications for the first round of the $10 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund.

The new fund is part of the government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success Initiative and provides funding for teachers to develop innovative ideas to be put into practice and shared across schools.

“The high number of applications received reflects the passion and commitment of teachers to develop further good practice and share some of the great ideas and successes that are already happening in many kura and schools across the country,” says Ms Parata.

“The fund will act as an incubator for fresh approaches, at the same time that communities of schools are getting together to tackle their achievement challenges so that kids get the chance to do their very best at school.

“It’s fantastic that the 204 applicants who’ve put their hands up come from around the country and represent schools across the sector, from primary, intermediate and secondary, individual schools as well as clusters of schools, and those who are reaching out to work with early childhood and tertiary.”

Ms Parata says an independent selection panel is overseeing the annual rounds of applications over three years. There is $2 million of funding available in the first round and $4 million in each subsequent round.

Successful applicants from the first round will be notified at the end of this month, with their projects expected to start in July.
