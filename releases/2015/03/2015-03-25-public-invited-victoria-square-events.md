Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner is welcoming the opportunity to speak directly with Christchurch residents about their thoughts on the future of Victoria Square.

“Community events are being hosted at Victoria Square where the public can come along and share their thoughts and ideas on the future of the Square,” Ms Wagner says.

“The events provide an opportunity for the public to meet the project team face-to-face, offer their ideas and have any questions answered.

“Community engagement on the future of Victoria Square began earlier this month and it has been great to see feedback online and in writing. I encourage people to keep their ideas coming.

“Some people will prefer the opportunity to share their ideas face-to-face and I look forward to meeting them this week.

“Victoria Square is a valuable community asset with historic and cultural significance. Public input is vital to ensure the Square reflects the community’s needs,” Ms Wagner says.

The community events will take place from 5.00 – 7.30pm on Friday 27 March and 10.00am – 3pm on Saturday 28 March.
