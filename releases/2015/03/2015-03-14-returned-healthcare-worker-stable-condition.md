Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says the healthcare worker who recently returned from Sierra Leone is in a stable condition in Christchurch Hospital.

 

“The patient has settled in well after being admitted to hospital,” says Dr Coleman.

 

“The South Island based healthcare worker was able to walk to the helicopter and was transported in the specialist Iso-pod patient transfer unit.

 

“The patient is receiving medical care in one of the dedicated specialist medical isolation rooms in the hospital.

 

“Blood samples have been taken for diagnostic testing and are being sent to Melbourne today. After clearing customs the samples will be taken to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory.  

 

“Test results to rule out Ebola are expected sometime on Sunday.

 

“The patient’s partner continues to self-monitor at home. Support is being provided to the family.

 

“I am advised that our well-practised procedures have worked extremely well. I would like to acknowledge all the staff involved.”

 

A further update will be provided once the test results are available.
