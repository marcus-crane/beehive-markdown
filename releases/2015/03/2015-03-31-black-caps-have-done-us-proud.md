Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says the Black Caps have done New Zealand proud in the ICC Cricket World Cup.

Dr Coleman will be attending the public welcome home for the Black Caps this evening at the Cloud on Queens Wharf in Auckland from 6pm.

“The Black Caps have had a sensational run in the tournament. They have provided some unforgettable sporting moments and inspired the future generation of cricketers,” says Dr Coleman.

“There have been many highlights, including Tim Southee and Trent Boult’s bowling, Daniel Vettori’s impossible catch, Martin Guptill’s World Cup record setting 237* and Brendon McCullum’s leadership. Also, let’s not forget Grant Elliot’s semi-final winning six and his fantastic effort in the final.

“I would like to congratulate the International Cricket Council, New Zealand Cricket, New Zealand Cricket World Cup head, Therese Walsh, and the Local Organising Committee on a hugely successful tournament.

“The work and preparation that went into hosting this tournament has been huge, and it has been a resounding success – both on and off the field.

“More than 325,000 people attended the 23 matches held here and well over a billion watched the global broadcast. Not only has the tournament been fantastic for local cricket fans, it has also allowed the country to present itself on the global major events stage.”

The Government invested $10.45 million to support New Zealand’s co-hosting of the ICC Cricket World Cup with Australia.

The tournament is estimated to have attracted around 30,000 international visitors to New Zealand and is expected to result in more than $40 million being injected into the local economy.
