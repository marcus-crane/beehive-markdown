Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges says Northland is leading the charge in capitalising on its abundant energy resources and hopes the rest of the country will be encouraged to follow its example.

Mr Bridges visited successful energy-related enterprises in the region today, with a particular focus on those investing in renewable energy generation.

“Northland has a bright future in a wide array of energy activities both in renewable energy and the oil and gas exploration work being undertaken offshore by Statoil”, he says.

Top Energy’s Ngawha geothermal power station near Kaikohe is the only high temperature geothermal resource in New Zealand outside the Taupō Volcanic Zone.

“Ngawha is one of New Zealand’s true renewables success stories, producing around 70 per cent of all electricity consumed in the Far North. 

“We have seen renewable electricity generation throughout New Zealand rise from 65 per cent in 2008, to around 80 per cent currently, and the National Government is committed to achieving our goal of 90 per cent by 2025.

“We try to take every opportunity to promote New Zealand’s renewable advantage and expertise internationally so I would encourage innovators in this area to look to what is being achieved in Northland.”

Northland is also home to the 2014 EECA (Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority) award winner Te Mirumiru Childcare Centre in Kawakawa. 

“The Te Mirumiru earth bank building is truly exceptional – technically advanced and designed to reduce energy use by two-thirds.  It’s an asset that will deliver long term value to the local community,” he says.

Mr Bridges met with Healthy Homes Te Tai Tokerau, who helps deliver the Government’s Warm Up New Zealand home insulation retrofits in Northland.

“Healthy Homes Te Tai Tokerau is a great example of why the Warm Up New Zealand programmes have achieved such success.  Over 11,500 homes have been insulated in Northland so far thanks to Government and local funding.”
