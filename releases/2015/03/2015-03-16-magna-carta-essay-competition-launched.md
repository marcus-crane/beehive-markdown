Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson has today launched the Magna Carta 800 Essay Competition for New Zealand students to recognise the 800th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta.

“The fundamental values embodied by Magna Carta, such as rule of law, are as relevant today as they were in 1215,” Mr Finlayson said.

“As one part of a broad programme of events being organised by the Magna Carta 800 NZ Committee, this competition provides New Zealand students with an opportunity to express what this historic document means to them and to New Zealand,” Mr Finlayson said.

The competition has both a High School and University category and is open to all current New Zealand secondary and tertiary students.

Essays must be submitted by Friday 1 May 2015.
