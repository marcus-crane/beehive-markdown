Nominations are now open for the 2015 Youth Awards, which celebrate young people who’ve achieved outstanding results, or people who’ve made a significant contribution to support and champion young people, says Youth Minister Nikki Kaye.

“The 2015 Awards will recognise 40 people and organisations across eight different award categories, so if you know someone who deserves recognition for their achievements, please put their name forward,” says Ms Kaye.

“Last year, recipients included the founder of the Christchurch baking army, which fed volunteers cleaning up after the Canterbury earthquakes, to an artist helping young people who had abandoned their studies to refocus on education, and young people tackling issues such as bullying and global poverty.

“The award categories in 2015 celebrate qualities such as leadership and young people who have supported youth activities in areas such as the arts, culture, sport or the environment.

“There are also awards for youth groups, youth with disabilities and for the first time this year, individuals or organisations who’ve supported or championed young people in any type of activity.

“A special category this year is the Anzac Youth Award, which is for young people who’ve helped recognise the centenary of the Gallipoli landings, or helped celebrate the Anzac spirit.”

This year, 25 youth ambassadors will also be supported to travel to Turkey to attend the Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli.

“I am pleased to announce the opening of nominations for the Youth Awards after meeting this morning with people involved in promoting social and business enterprise activities for youth, including Guy Ryan, recently named Young New Zealander of the Year.

“Guy recognises that with the right support, today’s young people can change the world, something he encourages through his Inspiring Stories Trust, which offers programmes aimed at helping young people unleash their potential.

“The Youth Awards are a way of shining the spotlight on young people showing this potential, as well as others like Guy who are helping and encouraging youth to be the best they can be.”

Nominations close 28 April 2015. For more information, see [here](http://www.myd.govt.nz/young-people/youth-week/).
