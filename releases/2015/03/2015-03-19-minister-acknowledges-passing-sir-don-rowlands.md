Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman today acknowledged the passing of rowing legend Sir Don Rowlands.

“Sir Don was an inspirational athlete and a highly successfully businessman,” says Dr Coleman.

“He won numerous accolades for his performances on the water. These included gold and silver Commonwealth Games medals and nine national rowing titles.

“His passion for rowing led him to help organise local events such as the Maadi Cup as well international events such as the Olympics. In 1981 he was awarded an Olympic Order medal.

“Sir Don was an inspirational leader in the sport and has played a pivotal role in laying the foundations for rowing’s ongoing success.

“Sir Don’s significant contribution to the rowing community and the country was recognised when he was made a knight companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Sir Don is also one of the few New Zealanders to receive the Order of Australia.

“I thank him for his contribution to New Zealand. My thoughts are with his family, friends and the rowing community.”
