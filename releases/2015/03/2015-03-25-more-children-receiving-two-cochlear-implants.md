Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says 29 infants and children with profound hearing loss have received two cochlear implants as a result of additional funding in Budget 2014.

“This week New Zealand is marking Hearing Week,” says Dr Coleman. “Cochlear implants are life changing. They can significantly improve children’s hearing and learning ability. The earlier they are fitted the better.”

Budget 2014 provided an extra $6.3 million over four years for a bilateral cochlear implants programme for children.

“A single implant had been the standard treatment for children with profound hearing loss,” says Dr Coleman.

“In line with a change in international best practice, from July last year children assessed as clinically suitable now receive two implants. As a result, 29 children have to date received two cochlear implants.

“There is no waiting list for newborns and children.”

$2.1 million has also been set aside to provide a second implant to children under six who have already received a single implant through the programme.

Funding for the cochlear programme has almost doubled over the last five years to $8.4 million a year.

Around 86 people receive cochlear implants each year. Up to 16 are infants, 30 are aged 2-18 years, and 40 are adults.
