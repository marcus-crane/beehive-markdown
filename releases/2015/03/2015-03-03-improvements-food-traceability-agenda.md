Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew has welcomed the release of the Dairy Traceability Working Group’s reports, which make recommendations on food supply chain traceability.

“The group was formed following a recommendation from the Government Inquiry into the Whey Protein Concentrate Contamination Incident, with a mandate to investigate dairy traceability,” Mrs Goodhew says.

“However traceability is critical for all foods exported from New Zealand, and the government is now considering applying the report’s recommendations across all food sectors.

“Improving our ability to swiftly identify and locate potentially affected products will enhance our already strong food safety system.”

The group’s recommendations are broadly consistent with key New Zealand export markets. The main changes relate to record keeping, information sharing and ensuring food products can be traced as quickly as practicable within 24 hours or another specified timeframe.

“I’d like to personally thank the working group for these practical recommendations. The expertise they have brought from across industry has provided important insights into the way New Zealand traces dairy products.”

Any proposed regulatory changes will be fully consulted on in July 2015. To view the reports visit [http://foodsafety.govt.nz](http://foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/dairy-traceability-working-group-report/index.htm)
