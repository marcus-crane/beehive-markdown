Government funding has accelerated the reconstruction of an historically dangerous bridge in South Taranaki.

Transport Minister Simon Bridges has turned the first sod at the official launch of the Normanby Overbridge realignment on State Highway 3 today.

Mr Bridges says the government has sped up the realignment by fully funding the construction, as part of its Accelerated Regional Roading Programme.

Over the next two years, the 75 year old bridge will be realigned and a four kilometre stretch of road will be constructed.

The $11 million project will allow traffic to cross the railway line via an underpass to the north, with safer, straighter, shorter approaches on either side, shaving almost half a kilometre off the current route.

“The local community has sadly witnessed a number of tragedies unfold on this bridge. I would like to recognise the advocacy of the people of Taranaki, who have worked tirelessly for this project to eventuate.

“I’m delighted that construction has started and I’ll be even more delighted when people are driving on it.

“In two years’ time, it will be an almost unrecognisable highway that meets modern engineering and safety standards. This translates to safer journeys for the families, farmers, truckies, and tourists who drive through this beautiful part of the country,” he says.

Mr Bridges was joined by local MP Chester Borrows and South Taranaki Mayor, Ross Dunlop, to mark the official start of construction of what is understood to be the biggest highway project in the region in decades.

He says it will provide numerous jobs to local contractors and suppliers. The contract has been let to Downer and will be overseen by the NZ Transport Agency.

The project will also support local industry by providing a safe and more efficient route for freight. Around 15 per cent of the vehicles who use the road every day are heavy vehicles, equating to about 1000 trucks a day.

**Note to editors:**

In 2014 the Government announced it was investing $212 million in a package of 14 regionally important State highway projects – the Accelerated Regional Roads Programme.

The realignment project is one of five critically important regional projects being advanced in Northland, the East Coast, Taranaki, Canterbury and Otago.

The first five projects are all fully investigated and designed, and address current safety, resilience or productivity issues.
