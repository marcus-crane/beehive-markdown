Minister for Ethnic Communities Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed a report which shows New Zealanders feel more positive towards Asians.

The Asia New Zealand Foundation’s annual survey *New Zealanders’ Perceptions of Asia and Asian Peoples 2014*, shows events such as Diwali and Chinese New Year help non-Asian New Zealanders understand and engage with Asian cultures.

The survey also found positive attitudes in other areas, such as a sense of integration and warmth towards Asians. The importance of children learning non-English languages was also highlighted by many respondents.

“It is pleasing to see that non-Asian New Zealanders are seeing the benefits of ethnic diversity, not just economically but culturally as well,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“As our diversity continues to grow every year, many ethnic communities are becoming more established and enriching our cultural landscape.”

The report notes that some negative perceptions still remain.

“The theme of this year’s Race Relations Day was ‘Big Change Starts Small’. New Zealand is increasingly a more tolerant society where people of all ethnicities are welcomed into communities,”  Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
