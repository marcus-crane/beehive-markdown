ACC Minister Nikki Kaye has welcomed the $4 million investment in motorcycle safety initiatives in 2015/16 advised by the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council.

The council represents the motorcycling community, and advises ACC on safety initiatives that will make motorcycling safer on New Zealand roads.

“Part of this investment will go towards re-engineering identified high-risk routes in urban and rural areas.

“The aim is to help reduce the number and severity of motorcyclist injuries resulting from poor road design, maintenance or surface condition.

“There’s also an investment in educational campaigns to encourage motorists to be more aware of motorcyclists.”

Previous projects supported by the council include improving Coromandel roads popular with motorcyclists, and helping develop video-equipped motorcycles to identify road engineering solutions from a motorcyclist’s perspective.

“Because of their lack of protection compared to car drivers, motorcyclists have a much higher risk of serious injury in a crash.

“The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council plays a key role in identifying ways to reduce this risk.

“I recently met with Chairperson Mark Gilbert to discuss the council’s recent achievements and their focus moving forwards.

“They are keen to keep building on work done to improve road engineering and foster a stronger safety culture on the road.

“They’re also keen to work more collaboratively with other agencies on ways to enhance motorcyclists’ safety.

“I look forward to updates about plans and progress towards their goals.”

**Notes for editors:**

**About the Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC)**

The Motorcycle Safety Advisory Council (MSAC) was set up in 2011 to oversee investment of the motorcycle safety levy (MSL) fund.

The MSL is a $30 levy collected when motorcyclists register their bikes.

Money collected through the levy is earmarked exclusively for improving motorcyclists’ safety on New Zealand roads.

It’s MSAC’s job to advise and recommend to ACC how to invest this money, and ensure it’s spent on initiatives that will actually make motorcycling safer.

MSAC members are appointed because they’re passionate about motorcycling and road safety and want to make a difference.
