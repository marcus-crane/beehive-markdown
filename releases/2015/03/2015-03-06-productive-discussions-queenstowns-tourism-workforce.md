Sustainable workforce solutions were at the centre of discussions between Government Ministers and tourism industry representatives in Queenstown today.

Streamlined immigration rules were [announced](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/help-queenstown%E2%80%99s-labour-shortage) last month as a short term solution to help employers in Queenstown through this period of high demand.

“The Government is making it a priority to work with the tourism industry to address workforce issues. I was really impressed with the work that the Queenstown tourism industry is doing to train, recruit, and retain New Zealand workers,” Associate Tourism Minister Paula Bennett says.

“The tourism sector is a vibrant, growing industry committed to providing visitors with a fantastic New Zealand experience. Today we committed to working together to ensure that Queenstown has the workforce it needs not just today but in the future”.

Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse says the temporary changes to immigration rules have been designed to relieve the immediate pressures over the peak visitor season in Queenstown and expire in June.

“Our goal is to help employers help themselves, by facilitating industry action and removing blockages,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“First and foremost we will ensure New Zealanders are at the front of the queue in regard to both jobs and training. Where a New Zealander isn’t available, immigration will continue to be an option to attract higher skilled workers industry needs to maintain growth”.
