Minister for Ethnic Communities Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed a new report which details the overwhelmingly positive influence Auckland’s increasing Asian population is having on the city.

The “Asian Auckland: The Multiple Meanings of Diversity” report by the Asia New Zealand Foundation has revealed the increasing diversity of Auckland’s Asian communities.

The report calls Auckland one of the world’s “super-diverse” cities, a name Mr Lotu-Iiga says ushers in an exciting new era for the city.

“As Minister for Ethnic Communities, and as the MP for the ethnically diverse electorate for Maungakiekie, I welcome this report which underlines the positive influences and the diverse contribution these Asian populations have.

“From the fine food, colourful festivals and the arts, our Asian communities are a welcome addition to our cultural landscape. They bring colour, culture and diversity to our city.

Our government is committed to ensuring New Zealand’s ethnic diversity is embraced, supported and celebrated,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
