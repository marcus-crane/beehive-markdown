Prime Minister John Key has welcomed the news of a planned official visit to New Zealand by Prince Harry, the grandson and fourth-in-line to Queen Elizabeth II.

“I am thrilled New Zealand will have the opportunity to welcome the Prince, who today confirmed he will visit New Zealand in May, after a four-week secondment with the Australian Defence Force,” says Mr Key.

“This is Prince Harry’s first visit to New Zealand and we are very keen to show him as much of the country as possible.”

The Prince’s visit follows a very successful tour by his father, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in 2012 and the latest visit by his brother, Prince William in 2014. Prince William was accompanied by the Duchess of Cambridge and their son, Prince George on their first trip to New Zealand.

The visit is still in the planning stage and further details regarding dates and regions to be visited will be released closer to his arrival.
