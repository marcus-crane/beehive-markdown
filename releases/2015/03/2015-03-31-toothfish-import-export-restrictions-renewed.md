Customs Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the renewal of the Customs Import and Export Prohibitions (CIPO and CEPO) on toothfish, restricting toothfish imports and exports for another three years.

“The renewal of restrictions on importing and exporting toothfish ensures effective controls are in place to protect this deep water species,” Ms Wagner says.

“New Zealand is a party to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources that seeks to halt the decline of toothfish stocks.

“Renewing the prohibitions upholds our international obligations to maintain an effective system of controls on the catch and import or export of toothfish.

“The toothfish CIPO 2015 and CEPO 2015 will come into effect on 11 May 2015. Customs’ role is to enforce the prohibitions by ensuring any imports or exports are made in accordance with the Toothfish Catch Documentation Scheme that the Ministry for Primary Industries administers within New Zealand.

“Import and export controls on toothfish have been in place since 2000. The controls are an important tool in the sustainable management of these vulnerable fisheries,” Ms Wagner says.
