Youth Minister Nikki Kaye is pleased to announce the first round of initiatives funded under the $20,000 Isolated Communities Fund.

“This is about supporting the development of young people aged 12 to 24 living in offshore communities such as Great Barrier Island, the Chatham Islands and Stewart Island.

“It’s not always easy for young people living in these communities to access the same opportunities as their peers on the mainland.

“The fund aims to support initiatives that can help young people grow skills and qualities such as self-confidence, motivation, leadership, decision-making and communication.”

The successful recipients under the first round of funding are:

- Aotea Family Support Group, Great Barrier Island, who will receive $2000 towards offering sports training opportunities to around 100 young people
- Chatham Community Focus Trust, Chatham Islands, who will receive $5000 to help run cultural and history themed workshops that will involve around 20 young people
- Halfmoon Bay School, Stewart Island, who will receive $5000 to help six young people travel to Wellington, to take part in educational and social opportunities with young people from other small, rural communities.

“With the right opportunities, tomorrow’s leaders and achievers are just as likely to come from our small island communities as our bigger towns and cities.

“This fund is about providing these opportunities, and enabling young people in our island communities to grow their sporting, cultural or leadership potential.”
