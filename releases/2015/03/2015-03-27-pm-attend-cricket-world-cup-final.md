Prime Minister John Key will attend the final of the Cricket World Cup in Melbourne this weekend.

“I am delighted to be attending the final between New Zealand and Australia,” says Mr Key. 

“Our two countries have a special rivalry. Over the years we have been treated to some truly exceptional sporting clashes and I expect this one will be no different. I wish Brendon McCullum and the Black Caps all the very best.”

Mr Key says New Zealand has been proud to co-host the tournament alongside Australia. The event has seen 49 matches played over 44 days, across 14 venues in New Zealand and Australia.

“It has been a great opportunity to showcase New Zealand to the world, with television audiences expected to exceed 1 billion people and international visitor numbers forecast to top 30,000.

“I would like to congratulate all the teams for what has been a tremendous tournament. I would also like to thank the many fans who have turned out in force to support their teams and all those who have worked to make the tournament such a success,” says Mr Key.

Mr Key will leave on Saturday and return home on Monday.

Sports Minister Jonathan Coleman will also attend the final.
