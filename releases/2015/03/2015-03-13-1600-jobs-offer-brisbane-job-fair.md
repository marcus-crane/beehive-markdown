Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse have welcomed news that 30 Kiwi employers are travelling to Brisbane to hold on-the-spot interviews for the 1600 jobs that are on offer at this weekend’s job fair.

“New Zealand has a record number of Kiwis in work and an emerging skills shortage,” Mr Joyce says. “Unprecedented growth in building and construction driven mainly by Auckland and Christchurch means that we will need around 26,000 extra tradespeople.

“Employers are travelling to Brisbane seeking workers in construction, trades, manufacturing, engineering and IT. Increased international demand for Kiwi products means we also need workers in manufacturing, agriculture and transport, hospitality, trade, healthcare, education and other public services.”

Mr Woodhouse will travel to Brisbane today to open the fair tomorrow.

“Queensland has the highest proportion of Kiwis living in Australia,” Mr Woodhouse says. “The NZ unemployment rate is falling, while Australia’s is rising. Employment has outpaced population growth and the labour force participation rate is the highest since records began. In addition, salary and wage rates in NZ are increasing faster than inflation.

“Australians do not need a visa to work in New Zealand. They can access a range of benefits such as healthcare, subsidised tertiary education, Working for Families tax credits, and national superannuation.”

The Brisbane job fair follows events in Perth and Sydney last November that attracted almost 3000 job seekers, with the fourth in the series to be held in Melbourne next month.

The Brisbane job fair runs from 10am to 4pm tomorrow and Sunday at Brisbane Sofitel Central, 249 Turbot Street, Brisbane CBD. Tickets can be purchased in advance at: [www.workingin-events.com/new-zealand](http://www.workingin-events.com/new-zealand).
