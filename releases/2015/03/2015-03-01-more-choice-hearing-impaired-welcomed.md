Minister for Disability Issues Nicky Wagner says the extension of the CapTel relay service increases choice for hearing impaired or deaf people to make phone calls and live an ordinary life.

“Speaking with friends and family across the country on the telephone is an important part of many of our lives and is often done late in the day after work. The extension of CapTel provides greater choice for those who need assistance to make these important calls,” says Ms Wagner.

“Using the telephone for work or for making important appointments such as with the doctor is also a regular part of life. 

“The service previously ran from 8am to 9pm and is now being extended to run from 7am to 10pm.  This will make a real difference for people who have not previously been able to access the relay service.

“The extension of the relay service contributes to implementation of the Disability Action Plan 2014 – 2018, particularly the outcomes on community and self-determination.

“The focus of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December was ‘The Promise of New Technology’ and it is great to see innovative technology like CapTel play a growing role in helping disabled people to live ordinary lives,” says Ms Wagner.
