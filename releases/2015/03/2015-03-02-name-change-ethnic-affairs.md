Greater alignment with New Zealand’s ethnic communities is the focus of a change in the government agency that works to promote the benefit of ethnic diversity.

From today, the Office of Ethnic Affairs will be known as the Office of Ethnic Communities, a change that follows the renaming of the ministerial portfolio from Ethnic Affairs to Ethnic Communities after last year’s general election.      

The office, which is a business unit of the Department of Internal Affairs, works with local ethnic communities to help New Zealand move forward economically, socially and culturally.  

Minister for Ethnic Communities Peseta Sam Lotu-liga says the change reflects the strengths and potential of the office, which was established in 2001. 

“New Zealand is one of the OECD’s most culturally diverse nations, with nearly one in four New Zealanders born overseas,” he says.

“A closer alignment with our ethnic communities means staff are better able to increase the economic benefits of our ethnically diverse population by identifying and removing barriers to participation and creating conditions that will increase it.

“The office works closely with ethnic communities and businesses and uses that experience to inform government policy and practice, Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“It is important that our ethnic communities are empowered to expand their horizons so that they can play a more active role in shaping the New Zealand of tomorrow.”
