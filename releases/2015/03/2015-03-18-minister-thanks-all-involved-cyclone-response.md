Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye has thanked everyone involved in preparing for and responding to the effects of Cyclone Pam in New Zealand.

“As well as civil defence groups, council staff, emergency services and other professionals, I recognise that many volunteers have also given their time.

“Whether it’s been ringing around phone trees to make sure the community was prepared, or cleaning up debris afterwards, your efforts are appreciated.

“Given the size and strength of Cyclone Pam and the destruction it caused in the Pacific, it was right to take this event seriously.

“Good preparation is crucial to getting through an emergency, and I’m encouraged by the level of preparedness shown by communities.”

Preparations included going door to door to alert seaside communities, placing road and utility contractors on standby, and deploying extra emergency services and NZ Defence Force personnel to affected areas.

The National Crisis Management Centre in Wellington was also activated, to support local civil defence emergency management responses.

“The government will continue to support local authorities during the recovery phase. This can include financial assistance towards response costs, to enable communities to focus on recovery as quickly as possible.

“The Chatham Islands are still experiencing rough weather today, and a state of local emergency remains in place there.

“Wharves have been damaged, the community of Owenga has been isolated by road closures and high winds remain a concern.

“Local civil defence are still responding to people who have been affected, ensuring they have accommodation and essential supplies.

“I have spoken to the Mayor to ensure they have all the support they need, and I intend to travel to the Chatham Islands in the next week.

“Cyclone Pam is a reminder that we face many risks, from storms and volcanoes to floods and earthquakes, but being prepared helps you get through.”
