Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Associate Trade Minister Todd McClay today welcomed the opening of the 2015 New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Better by Design CEO Summit.

Featuring the world’s top design minds, together with 400 CEOs and senior managers from a range of New Zealand businesses, the Auckland summit this year marks the 10-year anniversary of the Better by Design programme.

“Better by Design’s purpose is to inspire and enable New Zealand businesses to succeed by design,” Mr Joyce says.

“Since the first event in 2005, this summit has continually served to inspire delegates to create a future where New Zealand can be the best in the world at understanding cultures, markets and end users, and at working with partners to design and develop great products that dominate global niches.

“This is the kind of future that we all aspire to for New Zealand - and the kind of thinking that sets this event apart. By integrating design, New Zealand businesses can become more innovative, efficient and internationally competitive.”

Over the last 10 years, more than 140 New Zealand businesses have benefited from having the expertise of private sector design coaches working alongside them to help them integrate design into their business, and innovate to achieve competitive advantage and growth.

Mr McClay opened today’s Summit, and says that as well as providing design-focused support to individual companies, the programme has created an international network of businesspeople and designers who share and learn from each other.

“Exporting companies understand that getting closer to customers is critical, and ensuring you are designing products and services that meet their needs is a core competency – in fact it is mandatory to success,” Mr McClay says.

“By using design, New Zealand companies can move up the value chain, generating high value-added export income from markets all over the world.

“The Better by Design programmes supports the Government’s commitment to building a more productive and competitive economy where more companies can continue to grow and succeed internationally.”
