Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce is encouraging senior managers, executives and business owners who want to expand their international expertise to apply for the 2015 Prime Minister’s Business Scholarships.

Entries open today for the scholarships, which cover up to 50 percent of the course-related costs of attending an international learning institution. They are designed to grow skills and business capability to make New Zealand firms more internationally competitive, Mr Joyce says.

“The scholarships offer recipients the chance to study at the world’s best business schools. They provide an opportunity to learn international best practices in management and leadership.

“The knowledge gained from the world’s top business schools by our senior executives will benefit the companies they return to.”

The recipients of last year’s 13 scholarships studied at prestigious international institutions such as Harvard Business School, INSEAD (The Business School for the World) and the London Business School. 

“Our distance from overseas markets and the size of our economy can be a challenge to firms wanting to enter international markets,” Mr Joyce says.

“The scholarships will help to develop valuable networks and the global mindset of our business leaders. Ultimately, this will help to grow our economy and make New Zealand businesses more internationally competitive.”

Applications for the scholarships close on 11 May 2015. For more information: [www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/prime-ministers-business-scholarships](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/what-we-do/prime-ministers-business-scholarships)
