Māori Development Minister, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell, has confirmed the appointment of two new board members to Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori, the Māori Language Commission.

Hinurewa Poutu (Ngāti Rangi, Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi, Ngāti Maniapoto) has been appointed for a three year term.

She is a graduate of kura kaupapa Māori, with a recent career of studying, researching and teaching te reo Māori. She is close to completing her doctoral studies on how Māori speaking teenagers are using the language.

“Ms Poutu is an outstanding example of the new generation of Māori language speakers who have grown up immersed in Māori culture and language.

“I’m thrilled that she has agreed to come on the board at such an important time given the imminent changes to the Māori Language Act”, says Mr Flavell.

Dr Ruka Broughton (Taranaki, Whanganui, Ngāti Awa, Ngāti Kahungunu) has been appointed for a six month term while current board member Dr Poia Rewi fills in as the Commission’s interim Chief Executive.

“As a renowned expert in te reo Māori and a former Māori language commissioner (1999-2002), Dr Broughton provides business continuity for the board until a new CE is appointed”, says Mr Flavell.

The pair will join Chair Mr Ērima Hēnare, Dr Kātarina Edmonds and Te Awanuiārangi Black on the Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori board.
