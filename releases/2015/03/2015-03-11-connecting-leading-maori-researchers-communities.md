Māori Development Minister Hon Te Ururoa Flavell is proud to have launched *Te Hononga Pūkenga* – the Māori and Indigenous Researcher Directory today in Wellington.

“This online and interactive directory is a milestone in Māori scholarship. It gives Māori, public and private interests the opportunity to connect easily with some of the nation’s leading indigenous experts,” says Mr Flavell.

The new directory has been initiated by Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga – New Zealand’s Māori Centre of Research Excellence.

To date, Ngā Pae has over 500 Māori doctorates working with whānau, hapū, iwi, Māori and indigenous communities around the country and internationally.

It has supported a diverse range of research projects crossing areas such as architecture and design, biology, biotechnology, business, economics, education, environment, health, law and media.

“Over the past decade Ngā Pae has made a huge contribution to the development and expansion of Māori and indigenous scholarship in Aotearoa and around the world.

“I encourage those in the public and private sector who are involved in policy development, community engagement
