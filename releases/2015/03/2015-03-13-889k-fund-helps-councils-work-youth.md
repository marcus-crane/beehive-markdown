Youth Minister Nikki Kaye says from today, councils can apply for a share of $889,000 funding under the 2015 Youth Development Partnership Fund to help them work with young people.

“Young people need to be involved in local decision-making, so that their views are reflected in the projects and facilities around them.

“The fund’s aim is to get young people aged 12 to 24 involved in and leading projects that are meaningful to both them and their communities.

“This can help those taking part develop valuable skills, such as leadership and entrepreneurial ability, while contributing to their communities at the same time.”

The focus this year will be on funding:

- Youth leadership – including expanding the reach of youth councils
- Youth volunteering – including projects that encourage young people or their peers to participate in volunteering
- Youth achievement – including youth-run projects that showcase young people and their skills and talent
- Youth participation in the celebration of special or historic events in New Zealand.

Since the fund was launched in 2005, 59 councils have received funding.

“The fund has supported everything from business internships for young ethnic leaders, to youth-led Anzac Day commemorations and making youth-focused episodes for a local TV network.

“This year, there will be greater emphasis on supporting social enterprise projects.

“These are projects that take a commercial approach to solving social or environmental challenges.”
