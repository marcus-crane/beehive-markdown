Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today welcomed the interest shown in community conservation through the large number of nominations for Conservation Boards in 2015.

“This year we have received an overwhelming 142 nominations for the 36 public vacancies available on 14 conservation boards around New Zealand,” Ms Wagner says.

“This is a substantial number of nominations for the number of vacancies.

“We have received a lot of high quality nominations from people from all walks of life who can bring a diverse array of knowledge and skills to each board.

“We are now in the process of selecting appointees for each Conservation Board after consultation with the New Zealand Conservation Authority and Department of Conservation.

“Following further consultation, Conservation Board members will be announced so that new appointments can take effect from 1 July.

“Conservation Boards are the link between the community and the Department of Conservation and it is great to see so many New Zealanders willing to become more involved,” Ms Wagner says.
