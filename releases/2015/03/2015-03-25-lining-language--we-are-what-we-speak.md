Expressing ourselves through language will be the focus of a gathering of academics, policymakers and speakers of different languages this week, Ethnic Communities Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

*Lining up Language: Navigating Policy and Programmes* is hosted by the Office of Ethnic Communities and will be held over two days at Te Papa in Wellington from Thursday.

The conference aims to foster discussion about the range of government policies and initiatives designed to promote the use and learning of languages in an increasingly multicultural New Zealand.

“Language is an intimate expression of who we are. Which languages we use and the dialects with which we speak them dictate how we communicate and helps define our identity,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This conference comes at a time when our country has more people born overseas than ever. Nearly 800,000 people speak a language other than English or Māori so a discussion about government policies is timely.”

Other speakers include Race Relations Commissioner Dame Susan Devoy, representatives from a number of ministries and non-government organisations such as the Asia New Zealand Foundation, COMET Auckland and Victoria University.
