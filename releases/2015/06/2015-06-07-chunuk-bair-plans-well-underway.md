Veterans’ Affairs Minister Craig Foss says preparations for the Battle of Chunuk Bair centenary service at Gallipoli are progressing well.

“Chunuk Bair was the site of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force’s most significant action during the Gallipoli campaign,” Mr Foss says.

“Hundreds of Kiwi soldiers fought and died in an ultimately futile bid for control of this strategic vantage point.

“The centenary service on August 8 will honour those soldiers for their bravery and sacrifice.”

Mr Foss says the Chunuk Bair service is open to all and is not ticketed.

“I encourage anyone interested in attending this special service to register on the Gallipoli 2015 website to assist with our logistics planning.”

Access to the Australian service at Lone Pine on August 6 is also unrestricted.
