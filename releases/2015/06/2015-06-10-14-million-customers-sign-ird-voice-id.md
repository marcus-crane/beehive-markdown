Revenue Minister Todd McClay says 15,000 hours of phone time are now being saved each year, with 1.4 million IRD customers signed up to voice ID.

“This cements New Zealand’s position as the country with the highest level of voice biometric enrolments per capita in the world, and is a big win in the battle to reduce red tape and compliance for New Zealanders,” says Mr McClay.

Voice ID went live in January 2012, and 60-70 per cent of people who call IRD on any given day are now enrolled with it.

“Every customer who calls IRD using voice ID saves around 40 seconds per call, which equates to 15,000 hours each year customers don’t have to spend on the phone answering personal security questions to verify who they are,” says Mr McClay.

Voice ID also allows customers to automatically check the balance and payment dates of their Inland Revenue accounts, receive child support information, retrieve their IRD number, activate their online services account and reset passwords, even if they call outside opening hours.
