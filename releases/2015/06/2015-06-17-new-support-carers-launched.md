A new set of online resources will help carers look after their own needs, make time for themselves and stay connected, Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry says.

Around one in ten New Zealanders helps a family member or friend with everyday life, and many find it hard to balance that important role with work or their other commitments.

“Being a carer can be immensely rewarding, but it can also take a heavy physical, mental and financial toll,” Ms Barry says. “It is vital they are able to get the free time they need to look after their own health and happiness.”

The new resources, including three online programmes, have been developed by the Ministry of Social Development and Carers New Zealand.

“*Time Out* is a guide to help carers have breaks, encouraging them to plan ahead so they get the essential time they need to focus on their own wellbeing,” Ms Barry says.

*Work and Care*, developed with help from Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, gives workers and employers information about how to balance jobs with care.

“Carers should also be able to work if they want to – and employers can learn more about how they can help through *Work and Care*.”

Other resources being launched today include a Facebook page for young carers, a series of online seminars and *MeetUps*, a toolkit which helps people set up get-togethers and social opportunities.

The launch of the resources coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Carer’s Alliance, a consortium of 45 not for profit organisations that supports and advocates for carers.

All the resources are available now on the new carers’ website: [www.carers.net.nz](http://www.carers.net.nz).
