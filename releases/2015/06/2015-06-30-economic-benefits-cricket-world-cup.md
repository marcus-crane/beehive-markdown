Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce and Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman welcome a PwC report which confirms the positive economic impact of co-hosting the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.

New Zealand GDP was boosted by $110 million, over 2,000 new jobs were created and more than 78,000 tickets were sold to overseas visitors.

Regionally GDP increased by $40 million in Wellington, $35 million in Auckland and $15 million in Christchurch. A further $25 million was delivered to the host regions – Hamilton, Napier, Nelson and Dunedin.

“The results of this study reinforce Government decisions to invest in major international events such as the Cricket World Cup,” says Mr Joyce.

“A dedicated television audience of 1.56 billion along with the tournament’s high popularity across digital mediums made it one of the most watched sporting events ever.

“Tourism numbers were significantly higher during the Cricket World Cup. It provided invaluable marketing and promotional opportunities which will have ongoing benefits, strengthening our reputation as a tourist and business friendly destination and further encouraging travel to the region.”

“The Cricket World Cup captivated the nation, inspired future cricketers and generated a level of public interest not seen in cricket for many years,” says Dr Coleman.

“Kiwi’s took up the once in a generation opportunity to be part of a Cricket World Cup with over 300,000 people attending matches, and over 2,000 people volunteering their time. Over 1,300 schools signed up to the joint New Zealand Cricket-ICC Cricket Smart programme.

“The tournament provided a base for future development of the sport, and contributed to the development and upgrade of sporting facilities, particularly Hagley Oval in Christchurch.” remove

“Co-hosting the event further developed New Zealand’s event management capability which will be valuable when bidding for and hosting major international events in the future.”

The Government invested $10.45 million in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.
