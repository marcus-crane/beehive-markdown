Health Minister Jonathan Coleman today officially opened a new maternal mental health respite and support service in Te Atatu South, Auckland.

“Pregnancy and childbirth can be vulnerable times for women - at least 15 per cent will develop depression, anxiety or other mental health issues. It is important mothers get the support they need,” says Dr Coleman.

“The Government is committed to providing high quality mental health services. In Budget 2013 we invested an extra $18.2 million in maternal mental healthcare for the North Island.

“This funding has resulted in a range of new and enhanced services including the maternal mental health respite and support service in Te Atatu South, He Kakano Ora, as well as a new mother and baby unit at Starship Hospital.

“The new community based service He Kakano Ora will provide crucial support to mums, babies and the whole family. He Kakano Ora will initially provide a four bed residential option, and it will also have the flexibility to support mothers in their own homes.”

Waitemata and Auckland DHB selected the WALSH Trust as the maternal mental health respite and support service provider. The WALSH Trust has been supporting people with mental health issues in Auckland for 27 years.

He Kakano Ora will be delivered from an interim site in Te Atatu South while a specially designed six bedroom facility is built. The new facility is expected to open later in 2016.
