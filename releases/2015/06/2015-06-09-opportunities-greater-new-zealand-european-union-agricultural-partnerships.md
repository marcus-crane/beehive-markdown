Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy says his visit to Europe over the last 10 days successfully highlighted opportunities for more agricultural partnerships between producers in the European Union and New Zealand.

Mr Guy visited France and Poland, and represented New Zealand at the International Agricultural Forum at the Milan Expo and at the 39th Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) conference in Rome.

The trip involved meetings with many key foreign counterparts including the newly re-elected FAO Director General Graziano da Silva, European Union Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan, Irish Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney, and Polish Deputy Agriculture Minister Zofia Szalczyk and Deputy Minister of Economy and Secretary of State Dr Jerzy Witold Pietrewicz.

“New Zealand and the EU already share long-standing cultural, trade and security connections,” says Mr Guy.

“I took the opportunity to talk about the mutual benefits that a closer economic relationship would bring to New Zealand and the EU. There are opportunities for us work together through investment in each other’s dairy sectors and developing shared global value chains , with a view to making the most of emerging markets.”

Mr Guy also met with a range of leading European producers who had invested in New Zealand, and New Zealand producers who were investing in Europe.

“The consensus amongst these leaders was that there are significant benefits from collaboration between European and New Zealand producers.”

Mr Guy used his address at the FAO conference to outline how New Zealand’s experience could help address global challenges such as world hunger.

“As a successful food producing nation, New Zealand has adapted to meet global demand, and we now export premium products to around 130 countries.

“This puts us in a strong position to help respond to challenges facing the world such ensuring sufficient food supply to meet growing demands.”
