Disability Issues Minister Nicky Wagner says the Conference of States Parties was an opportunity to exchange ideas with other countries and support the campaign for Robert Martin, New Zealand’s candidate to the Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

“Robert Martin’s candidacy presents an opportunity to have the first person with a learning disability elected to the Committee. I have taken every opportunity to tell other countries about Robert’s story and what he can offer,” Ms Wagner says.

The election will be held at the Conference of States Parties in June 2016. If elected, Robert will serve on the Committee for the period 2017 to 2020.

Ms Wagner held bilateral meetings with delegates from Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Qatar and Belgium. She also met with His Royal Highness Prince Mired Ra’ad Al Hussein of Jordan, and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Ms Catalina Devandas Aguilar.

“New Zealand has a good story to tell on disability issues. There was significant interest in our experience in de-institutionalisation, enabling disabled people into employment, coordinating services across Government, and giving disabled people more choice over the support they receive.

“I am pleased that our presence at this important event has enabled New Zealand to build on our international reputation as a world leader in disability issues. I look forward to supporting Robert's campaign over the next year,” Ms Wagner says.

Ms Wagner is now traveling to Washington, D.C. to visit U.S. Customs and border agencies.
