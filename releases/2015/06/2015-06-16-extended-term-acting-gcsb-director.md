The term of the current Acting Director of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), Una Jagose, has been extended to 31 March 2016, Minister Responsible for the GCSB, Christopher Finlayson, announced today.

“The Government has decided not to continue with the State Services Commission’s current recruitment process and instead extend Ms Jagose’s appointment as Acting Director,” Mr Finlayson said.

A wide-ranging review of New Zealand’s security and intelligence agencies, to be carried out by Dame Patsy Reddy and Sir Michael Cullen, was announced on 13 May 2015. The independent reviewers will report directly to Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee by the end of February 2016.

“It is important that the GCSB has stable leadership during the review and Ms Jagose is performing very effectively as Acting Director,” Mr Finlayson said.

“The review of the security agencies may make findings and recommendations that affect the type of person we need to lead the GCSB.

“Once the findings of the review are known, and the Government has considered its response, the State Services Commission will carry out a new recruitment process.”

The GCSB is a Public Service department with its head office in Wellington. The Acting Director of the GCSB is appointed by the Minister Responsible for the GCSB.

Una Jagose has been Acting Director of the GCSB since 28 February 2015.
