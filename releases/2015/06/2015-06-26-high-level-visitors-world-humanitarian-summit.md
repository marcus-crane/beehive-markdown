Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the leaders and dignitaries who will visit Auckland next week for the  World Humanitarian Summit Pacific.

“The Summit, which is co-hosted by New Zealand, Australia and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, will focus on addressing the most pressing humanitarian challenges facing the Pacific,” Mr McCully says. 

“We are pleased to welcome all the attendees including; Kiribati President Anote Tong, Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme Helen Clark, Stephen O’Brien, UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs,  and high-level representatives from a number of other Pacific governments and humanitarian agencies.

“The Pacific is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world and we work closely with governments and regional partners to help Pacific countries better prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

“On the back of the Summit I will meet separately with a number of the attendees, including; with the President of Kiribati, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

“New Zealand and Australia work closely together in the Pacific, particularly around responding to disasters.

“I look forward to discussing how we can strengthen that partnership with Minister Bishop, and consulting on other regional and international issues,” Mr McCully says.
