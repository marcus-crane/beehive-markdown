Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce has announced $376,325 of co-funding for ten new growth initiatives for the international education sector.

“This funding round supports the development of new products and programmes, and continues to support growth in the export of New Zealand’s education technology.” says Mr Joyce.

Successful International Education Growth Fund recipients include Tai Poutini Polytechnic, who will develop of a range of study tour programmes for tourism professionals in China, and the University of Otago, who are developing ecology and sustainability papers for students studying the tropical ecosystems of East Malaysia.

“Two projects are focused on delivering Masters Qualifications offshore, while others relate to new products and programmes, marketing initiatives and exploring new channels to market.” says Mr Joyce.

Educational publishers BIOZONE International and Kiwa Digital received co-funding to boost exports of digital learning resources. BIOZONE International are developing a digital platform for their high school biology resources and Kiwa Digital will be establishing a new distribution channel in North American market for their experiential digital books.

The successful recipients are primarily focused on China and the US markets and includes universities, polytechnics, schools, private training providers, and the education technology sector.

Mr Joyce says since the IEGF was established in 2013 and it has helped to open new markets for New Zealand’s international education providers.

“Previous success stories include Massey University’s co-funding to conduct market research in the US, which has helped to grow study abroad student numbers from a pilot of seven to a programme of 38, with plans to expand into new disciplines in 2016. And publishers Bud-e Digital have signed up two new partner agreements in Asia.”
