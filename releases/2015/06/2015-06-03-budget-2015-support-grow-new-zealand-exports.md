Extra Budget funding will help exporters take full advantage of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and avoid the risk of costly delays at overseas borders, Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says.

“Exports to China and ASEAN countries have increased significantly in the past four years. This is good for exporters and good for our economy, but as the volume of exports has increased, so too has the number of administrative issues arising at the border,” Ms Wagner says.

“The customs requirements in these countries are not always clear to New Zealand exporters and Budget operating funding of $6.2 million over the next four years will help improve access to international markets and reduce the risk of trade disruption.

“Targeted technical expertise will be provided to exporters so they are in a better position to take full advantage of our trade agreements and claim FTA duty preferences.

“Better assurance over the security and legitimacy of New Zealand exports will be achieved by monitoring the integrity of export documentation.

“Customs will also increase export assurance by increasing the number of exporters in its ‘trusted trader’ scheme and implementing an electronic system for sharing Certificate of Origin data with China.

“Further assistance will be provided through additional Customs staff in Beijing and an additional position in Asia,” Ms Wagner says.

The support for export markets initiative is part of a range of measures in Budget 2015 to improve security and services at the border, involving Immigration, Customs and Biosecurity.
