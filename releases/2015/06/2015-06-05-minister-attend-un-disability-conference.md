Disability Issues Minister and Customs Minister Nicky Wagner will travel tomorrow to the United States to attend the Conference of States Parties (COSP) at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. COSP is the annual meeting for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD).

“New Zealand is considered a world leader in disability issues. The Conference of States Parties is the pre-eminent annual disability-related event, and is an opportunity to promote New Zealand’s achievements and discuss ideas on the world stage,” Ms Wagner says.

“The Conference is a chance to meet other Disability Ministers, senior officials and stakeholders from multiple countries and agencies to share and learn from each other’s experience.”

COSP is also an opportunity to promote Robert Martin, New Zealand’s candidate for election to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2016.

“When I met Robert earlier this year, I was inspired by his commitment to improving the wellbeing of disabled people.

“Robert’s candidacy is significant for New Zealand and the world. If successful, Robert is likely to be the first person with a learning disability to be appointed to the Committee.”

Ms Wagner will also visit United States Customs and Border Protection facilities, including the National Targeting Center, in Washington D.C.

“New Zealand Customs and U.S. border agencies have a close working relationship, both countries aim to make trade and travel easier while maintaining border security.

“I look forward to meeting with staff and representatives of U.S. border agencies to reaffirm this strong relationship and seeing first-hand how our two countries communicate on border security matters,” Ms Wagner says.

Ms Wagner departs New Zealand on Saturday 6 June and returns Monday 15 June.
