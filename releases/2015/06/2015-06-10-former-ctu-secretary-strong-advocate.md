Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Woodhouse today paid tribute to former Council of Trade Unions secretary Peter Conway who passed away yesterday.

“As the former Council of Trade Unions secretary Peter was an engaging, intelligent and passionate advocate for workers,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Peter committed his whole working life to improving the lives of working people. He will be remembered for his participation on multiple advisory groups on employment relations, workplace productivity and for his contribution to labour market economic research.

“He worked constructively and tirelessly as a highly respected member of the CTU and I am sure he will be greatly missed by those in the CTU and wider community.

“I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to Peter’s family.”
