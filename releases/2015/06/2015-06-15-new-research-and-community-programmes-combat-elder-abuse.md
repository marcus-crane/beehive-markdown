New Zealanders need to confront the reality of elder abuse to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of older people, Senior Citizens Minister Maggie Barry says.

New research released on World Elder Abuse Awareness Day shows around one in 10 older New Zealanders have suffered some form of abuse or neglect.

With our ageing population, this research, the first specifically focused on New Zealand, suggests the rate of elder abuse could increase significantly.

“Last year, Age Concern received more than 2,000 referrals for older people who suffered some form of abuse, either physical, financial or psychological,” Ms Barry says.

“World Elder Abuse Awareness Day reminds us to reflect on this serious and growing problem. It’s an opportunity to draw attention to the fact many seniors are not being treated with the respect they deserve and that it is certainly not okay.”

One of the contributing factors to elder abuse is social isolation. Older people who lack connections with their community are at an increased risk.

A successful initiative called Connects, set up as a pilot in Napier, has proved effective as an umbrella organisation bringing together many of the groups working with seniors such as Age Concern, the RSA and Grey Power.

“Connects is a very successful and innovative programme. I have talked to sector groups like Age Concern, who are interested in the concept, and have asked officials to look at where we could help set up pilot schemes in other areas,” Ms Barry says.

“I believe it can make a real difference to older people’s lives and help those who are vulnerable and at risk.”

The Government also funds 27 elder abuse and neglect prevention services around New Zealand, which offer assistance to older people and their families.

“Often elder abuse is hidden away and those who are victims see it as something shameful which they are reluctant to talk about,” Ms Barry says.

“We must confront this issue, get it out of the shadows and make it clear it is never acceptable to mistreat an older person.”

The research will help to influence the government’s wider work around family violence.
