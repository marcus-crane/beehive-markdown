Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy leaves for Europe today to represent New Zealand at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations’ (FAO) Biennial Conference in Rome.

The FAO is an inter-governmental organisation with 194 member nations. Its aims include thesustainability of natural resources while driving economic and social progress.

“As a country founded on our primary industries, New Zealand can add real value to the discussions at the conference,” says Mr Guy.

“We want to encourage good policy to support sustainable production and trade in primary products.”

New Zealand is actively involved with the FAO on issues relating to climate change and livestock management.

“New Zealand is closely collaborating with the FAO and the Global Research Alliance (GRA) on climate change issues, and we’re also actively involved in two FAO initiatives relating to the livestock sector.

“The first is the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock that aims to improve the sector’s use of natural resources.  This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, and help improve food security and reduce poverty.

“The second is the Livestock Environmental Performance Partnership.  This is developing new ways to assess the environmental footprint of livestock value chains across all countries.”

As part of his trip, Minister Guy will also be attending the International Agriculture Forum, organised by the Italian government, and travel to France and Poland for bilateral meetings.

Mr Guy will be overseas from 1 to 10 June.
