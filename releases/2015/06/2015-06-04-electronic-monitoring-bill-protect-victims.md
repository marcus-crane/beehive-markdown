A bill that will improve the safety of victims and the public has had its first reading in Parliament.

The Electronic Monitoring of Offenders Legislation Bill will now go to a select committee, says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“This bill recognises opportunities to better protect the public by giving courts the option of imposing electronic monitoring as a condition when sentencing some higher-risk offenders,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Monitoring technology has also improved and this gives Corrections and Police more opportunities to protect the public from certain offenders.”

The bill will remove legislative barriers to electronic monitoring in the Sentencing Act and will make electronic monitoring available to the courts when imposing either one of two sentences;

- A prison sentence of up to two years, with release on conditions specified by the courts, or
- A sentence of intensive supervision

“Electronic monitoring can help to protect the community more from those offenders whose risk of reoffending is specific to certain geographical areas,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
