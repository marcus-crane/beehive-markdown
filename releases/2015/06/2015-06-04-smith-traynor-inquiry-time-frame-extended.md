The Government Inquiry into the escape of Phillip John Smith / Traynor has been extended by two months, State Services Minister Paula Bennett says.

“When the inquiry was announced in November 2014 I made it clear the six month period proposed for its completion might be extended because it is important New Zealanders get answers to the many questions around the escape,” Mrs Bennett says.

“The inquiry Chair, Hon John Priestley CNZM QC, has asked to extend the final report date from 30 June to 25 August 2015 to ensure a thorough review can be completed and I’ve agreed to his request.

“This extension takes into account the number and timing of interviews of key witnesses, a prior commitment of a member of the Inquiry, and the need to ensure due process is followed.”

The extension will be accommodated within the budget that was set when the Inquiry was established.

“I’d like to thank Dr Priestley and Mr Simon Murdoch for their work so far, and am confident the public will get the answers they deserve,” Mrs Bennett says.
