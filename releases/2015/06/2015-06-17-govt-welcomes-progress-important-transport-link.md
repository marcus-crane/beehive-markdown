Transport Minister Simon Bridges says a project critical to supporting freight movements in Auckland has taken another step forward today.

The NZ Transport Agency and Auckland Transport have announced a preferred route has been chosen for the East-West Connections project.

Mr Bridges says the project has been brought forward as a result of its inclusion in the Auckland Accelerated Projects package, announced by the Prime Minister in 2014.

“This Government is investing heavily in transport infrastructure across all modes in Auckland, and today we are seeing some more results of that commitment.

“Last year we announced an additional $10 million to speed up the investigation of options for the East-West Connections as part of a much larger $375 million package to accelerate a range of key transport projects in the city.

“The Onehunga-Penrose industrial hub is a significant contributor to our economy - generating $5 billion per year in GDP and employing over 64,000 people. Many of our largest distribution and logistics facilities are based in the area because of its access to key road and rail routes, but its heavy congestion is slowing freight movements and restricting economic growth.

“The projected growth rates of Auckland, particularly of Auckland Airport, Manukau City and East Tāmaki/Botany, are expected to generate greater demand for cross-city, east-west movements.

When completed, the East-West Connections project will:

- improve freight flow in and out of the Onehunga-Penrose industrial hub by removing 6 sets of lights and reducing the distance by 1 km, which can save up to 11 minutes journey time.
- improve public transport with dedicated bus lanes, making services between Māngere, Ōtāhuhu and Sylvia Park more reliable.
- improve pedestrian and cycling facilities in the area with 5.5 km of new and improved routes.

“This Government is committed to providing the infrastructure New Zealand needs to prosper, and this project is proof of that.”

Mr Bridges is encouraging Aucklanders to find out more about the East West Connections project and provide feedback by attending one of a series of open days being held by the NZ Transport Agency and Auckland Transport or by visiting [www.nzta.govt.nz/east-west](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/east-west) and [www.at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/east-west-connections/](http://www.at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/east-west-connections/)
