The Government has agreed to extend White Pages’ successful opt-in service across New Zealand, Communications Minister Amy Adams has announced.

For the third year in a row, White Pages Residential will provide an opt-in service in Auckland which will see 475,000 fewer phonebooks delivered across the city. The opt-in service has been approved on an ongoing basis with Yellow given the flexibility to apply this nationally as appropriate.

Ms Adams said this year it’s estimated that 23,000 households would opt-in to receive the Auckland White Pages on an ongoing basis, compared to the residential delivery of 478,853 phone books in 2012.

“The reduction in phone books delivered in Auckland will save 281 million pieces of paper, which if stacked end to end, could go around the world one and a half times,” says Ms Adams.

Ms Adams said this was a clear demonstration of New Zealand embracing the digital age, although it was important to retain the printed White Pages Residential on an opt-in basis for those who couldn’t or chose not to access the Internet. 

“In the longer term, as more New Zealanders come online and take up broadband, fewer White Pages telephone directories will be required and may ultimately be phased out.

“The expansion of the Ultra-Fast Broadband and Rural Broadband Initiative programmes and the rollout of the 4G cellular networks are increasing people’s ability to access a range of innovative and new communications technologies. The internet, email, text and mobile phone calls provide very different options that were available even a few years ago,” says Ms Adams.

**White Pages background:**

The Telecommunications Service Obligation (TSO) includes an obligation dating back to 1997 for a printed copy of the White Pages Residential directory to be delivered free of charge to every residence with a phone line. Spark subcontracts the fulfilment of this requirement to Yellow Pages Group Ltd. In 2013 and 2014, Yellow Pages Group trialled delivery of the Auckland residential White Pages on an opt-in basis. The trials were approved by Minister Adams on a year-by-year basis. Customers in Auckland only receive the residential White Pages if they actively indicate that they want it. There is no charge to the consumer for the act of opting-in or for receiving a copy of the Residential White Pages.
