Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew is celebrating National Volunteer Week today on Limestone Island (also referred to as Matakohe Island) where the kiwi population continues to flourish.

Today Mrs Goodhew observed an electronic transmitter being exchanged on a kiwi, and marked the start of planting season by helping volunteers plant trees on the coast of the island. 

“Since 1990 volunteers from the local community and abroad have led the restoration of Limestone Island to regenerate the island’s forest and grasslands and native habitats of birds, lizards, and other creatures,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“Twenty-five years ago the island was largely degraded pasture. Now, thanks to the local volunteer community, Limestone Island is home to 155,000 native trees and a variety of birdlife.

“This has truly been a community project thanks to the leadership of the committee who have created family friendly voluntary activities suitable for everyone that wants to be involved.

“I am honoured to be starting Volunteer Week with the Limestone Island volunteers, and the Whangarei community, whose conservation work is an asset to New Zealand.”

Kiwi chicks and young birds are placed on Limestone island to be raised in a safe environment, before they are re-introduced to the mainland. To date more than 130 kiwi have been raised on Limestone Island.

Mrs Goodhew is in Whangarei today to celebrate Volunteer Northland’s name change. While here she kicks off National Volunteer Week by visiting the Kamo volunteer fire station, the North Haven Hospice shop, and Limestone- Matakohe Island with local volunteers.
