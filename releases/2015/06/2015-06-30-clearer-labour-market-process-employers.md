A new streamlined labour market test process in Queenstown will benefit employers trying to fill low-skilled vacancies, say Social Development Minister Anne Tolley and Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse.

The changes, which come into effect from 1 July in the Queenstown Lakes District, will enable employers with a low-skilled vacancy to receive formal advice from Work and Income prior to lodging a migrant worker visa application, rather than Immigration New Zealand contacting Work and Income after the application has been lodged.

Work and Income will refer any suitable New Zealanders to the employer for consideration. Employers will also have access to an updated list of jobs where advice is not required, as Work and Income has no jobseekers available to fill the positions.

“As well as looking after the interest of New Zealanders this new process will provide more certainty for employers and migrants as they will know sooner if a work visa application is likely to succeed,” says Mrs Tolley.

“New Zealanders will always be first in line for jobs, but we recognise that for certain roles which are hard to fill, employers want to bring in migrant workers and this new system provides a quicker and more effective solution for them.”

Mr Woodhouse says that by introducing these changes in Queenstown we are acknowledging the unique circumstances faced by Queenstown employers, particularly tourism operators, in a period of exceptionally strong growth.

“Officials will also continue to monitor how immigration policies are working for Queenstown employers, in the context of wider work under way in the tourism sector to address labour and skills needs in the long term.

“The changes in Queenstown replace the temporary labour market test exemption which was in place during the exceptionally busy summer season, and is set to end on June 30.”
