The Māori Development Minister questions the integrity of Labour’s Broadcasting Spokesperson Clare Curran who has attempted to stitch together a “scandal”.

“Ms Curran originally claimed I attempted to tamper with the content of a Native Affairs programme but after failing to gain traction on this accusation she released some emails between my media secretary and an MTS staff member to bring my office in disrepute”, says Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

“She has also accused me of misleading the Māori Affairs Select Committee and breaking the law.

“I emphatically deny any wrongdoing and in the interests of transparency, I am releasing the full set of emails since this is the only evidence that the allegations hangs on.

“What the emails will show is that my media secretary was doing her job and that the reason for the change in the proposed schedule had nothing to do with either myself or my staff.”

Mr Flavell says, “It is ironic that Ms Curran is crying editorial interference when she has obtained work emails from the MTS newsroom. If anyone has crossed the line it appears to be Ms Curran.”

“I’m happy to be challenged by opposition MPs, but in turn, I expect they will exercise the same ethical standards of behaviour they demand of me,” says Mr Flavell.
