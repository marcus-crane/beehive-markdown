Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says the government will contribute significant support to areas affected by the severe storm over the past five days.

“In situations like this, the government has a range of funding and resource mechanisms to support response and recovery,” says Ms Kaye.

“We expect the support through these mechanisms to total some millions of dollars in the days ahead.

“This storm resulted in three states of local emergency being declared, in Taranaki, Whanganui and Rangitikei.

“I can confirm today that the state of local emergency has been lifted in Rangitikei, but remains in force in Taranaki and Whanganui.

“I am advised that this is to enable building assessments to be carried out, and ongoing security of flood-affected areas.

“I’ve had discussions with mayors about the support currently being provided by government agencies, and other potential support available.

“Support currently being provided includes:

- deployment of staff from the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management to provide on-the-ground advice and support
- reimbursement of local authorities for response and recovery costs such as accommodating, transporting, feeding and clothing displaced residents, and repairing essential infrastructure
- welfare assistance such as hardship grants, through the Ministry of Social Development (MSD)
- police assistance with security and rural reconnaissance, supported by the NZ Defence Force if necessary
- help from Rural Support Trusts to assist those affected in rural areas
- support to repair and clear state highways.

“Today I briefed Cabinet and met with several Ministers, and we discussed other support available.

“Additional support I can confirm is that the Minister for Social Development has approved $250,000 towards Enhanced Task Force Green, to support the clean-up in rural areas.

“I can also confirm that a disaster relief fund has been activated for the Manawatu-Whanganui region, and I’m receiving advice from the Mayor of South Taranaki about whether a fund will be activated for this area as well.

“Cabinet has agreed that the government will provide a significant contribution to these funds.

“Based on initial discussions I’ve had, the government will contribute at least $250,000, and will provide more support if required.

“These funds typically focus on supporting those who can’t access assistance from other avenues, such as insurance.

“We will continue to work to determine what other assistance may be needed.

“At the moment, I’m advised that calls are being made to people in isolated regions, to identify if they need to evacuate or require support to remain at home.

“I’m pleased to confirm that Fonterra has activated their emergency response team, who are calling farmers potentially affected and providing support.

“I’m also liaising with the Minister for Primary Industries, who is currently assessing the scale of the event to see what support is available under the Rural Recovery Policy, and liaising with the Minister of Transport about the normal process of government funding to repair roads.

“The government pays for repairing state highways, and can also contribute to the costs of repairing local roads.

“Both myself and a number of other Ministers will visit the worst-affected areas in the coming days and next few weeks, to see how recovery work is progressing and to identify if any further support is needed.

“Our thoughts are with those affected, particularly those who have still not been able to return home because of flood waters.

“Agencies and local authorities are working hard to help communities get back on track, and I extend a big thank you to everyone involved in response and recovery efforts.”
