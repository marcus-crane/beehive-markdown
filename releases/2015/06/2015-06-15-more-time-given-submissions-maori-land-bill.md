The Māori Development Minister has extended the deadline for submissions on the draft Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill to Friday 7 August 2015.

This will give submitters an extra five weeks to consider and comment on the proposed changes.

“We’re still out in the regions consulting with Māori land owners and we’ve already had a lot of constructive feedback.

“I’ve taken on board the concern about the lack of time given to make a written submission and extended the deadline accordingly,” says Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

Copies of the exposure draft and the report are available on the [Te Puni Kōkiri](http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/a-matou-kaupapa/crown-iwi-hapu-whanau-maori-relations/consultation/review-of-te-ture-whenua-maori-act-1993) website.

While the submission deadline has been extended, Mr Flavell says the bill will be introduced in to Parliament before the end of this year.

Submissions can be made online via the Te Puni Kōkiri website, by email:[ttwma@tpk.govt.nz](mailto:ttwma@tpk.govt.nz) or by posting to Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill, c/o Te Puni Kōkiri, P.O Box 3943, Wellington.
