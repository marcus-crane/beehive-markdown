Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has today released New Zealand’s Fifth Periodic Report under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

“This report provides an opportunity to acknowledge the progress New Zealand has made on children’s rights, as well as identifying areas we need to keep working on,” says Mrs Tolley.

“The report highlights a broad programme of work that is currently underway to improve the lives of New Zealand children.

“For example, the Children’s Action Plan, Well Child Tamariki Ora services, extension of free doctors’ visits to children aged up to 13 years, Whanau Ora, welfare reform, and the Youth Crime Action Plan all contribute to the Government’s priorities for children and young people.

“The requirement to submit the report prior to this year’s Budget has meant that the full Government programme of work could not be included, however in our continuing discussions with the UN we will be highlighting the Budget 2015 material hardship package which focused on supporting children and families.”

The $790 million package includes:

- encouraging and supporting more parents into sustainable, full-time work
- increasing benefit rates for families with dependent children by $25 a week after tax
- increasing in-work tax credit support for low income working families with children by $12.50 a week, with some very low income families gaining a further $12.00 a week on top of that
- increasing Childcare Assistance for low-income families from $4 to $5 per hour, with up to 50 hours a week available for each child of working parents

“The Committee on the Rights of the Child is comprised of 18 independent experts on children’s rights, and New Zealand welcomes the feedback that such a panel can provide,” says Mrs Tolley.

The Report is available on the Ministry of Social Development’s website at: [http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/monitoring/uncroc/reporting.html](http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/monitoring/uncroc/reporting.html)
