Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Paul Goldsmith today announced three new appointments to the Financial Markets Authority Board.

“I am pleased to announce that the Governor-General has appointed Campbell Stuart, William Stevens and Mark Todd as new members of the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) for terms of three to five years, starting on 8 June 2015,” Mr Goldsmith says. 

“I am very pleased with these appointments. Each candidate brings with them a great deal of experience in their respective areas. They will support the FMA to continue with its important work of strengthening public confidence in our financial markets and regulating the firms and professionals working in them.

“Mr Stuart’s knowledge of financial markets, Mr Stevens’ financial advising experience, and Mr Todd’s legal expertise will be of huge benefit to the work of the financial markets regulator.

Mr Goldsmith also welcomed the reappointment of Michael Webb to the FMA Board for a further year, and thanked James Miller and Justine Smyth for their services to the Board from 1 May 2011 to 30 April 2015.

“Mr Miller and Ms Smyth have made a considerable contribution to the FMA since its establishment. Their expertise has helped steer the FMA to become the quality regulator that it is today,” Mr Goldsmith says.
