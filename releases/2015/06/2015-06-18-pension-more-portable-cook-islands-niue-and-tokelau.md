People wishing to return permanently to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau will now be able to do so after age 55 without it impacting their eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation, Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says.

The Social Assistance (Portability to Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau) Bill passed its third reading in Parliament today, providing greater flexibility for superannuitants choosing to live outside of New Zealand.

“This change is about recognising the contribution Pacific people make to New Zealand and the close constitutional ties we have with these nations and territories,” Mrs Tolley says.

The Bill allows people to apply for New Zealand Superannuation while they are resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. Previously a person had to be ‘resident and present’ in New Zealand at the time of application.

“These islands struggle with depopulation and retaining a skilled workforce. This Bill allows people to return to these islands and contribute valuable skills for up to ten years before applying for New Zealand Superannuation.

“We want our superannuitants to have as many options as possible as to where they choose to live. They have worked hard throughout their lives and many wish to return home as they near retirement,” Mrs Tolley says.

People must still meet eligibility criteria for New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension, including having lived in New Zealand for 10 years since the age of 20, five of which must be after the age of 50. This rule applies to all recipients.
