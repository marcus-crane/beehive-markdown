Transport Minister, Simon Bridges, says the completion of a bus lane in northern Auckland marks a milestone in addressing congestion in the country’s largest city.

Mr Bridges says the opening of an extension of the bus shoulder along part of the Northern highway is the final section of the NZ Transport Agency’s (NZTA) Upper Harbour Highway to Greville Road widening project.

The Government has advanced $375 million to help the NZTA push forward with more than $800 million worth of Auckland transport projects across the Northern Corridor, Southern Corridor and State Highway 20A.

The bus lane is the first project to be completed under this accelerated programme of works to improve Auckland’s transport infrastructure.

“The first stage of this bus lane opened before Christmas and has provided immediate relief for northbound traffic and is part of the wider Northern Corridor Improvements programme,” he says.

“That accelerated fund will enable NZTA to speed up work on projects which were otherwise going to be years away from being completed.”

As well as widening SH1 Northbound to three lanes, the project also includes an upgrade of the intersection at Greville Road, developing a new shared path for pedestrians and cyclists and a new bus shoulder.

“These improvements show the Government’s commitment to investing across all transport modes both in Auckland and throughout New Zealand. This project will significantly improve the ability of Auckland’s transport system to move people and goods around the region, supporting its ongoing economic growth,” Mr Bridges says.
