Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman says this weekend’s final of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup marks the end of a great three weeks of football.

“The FIFA U-20 World Cup draws to a close this weekend with Brazil taking on Serbia at Auckland’s North Harbour Stadium,” says Dr Coleman.

“New Zealanders have really got behind the tournament. Around 300,000 people have attended matches and a further 30,000 people visited fever pitch fan zones.

“The event is known as a breeding ground for future stars and the skill of these young footballers has been evident with a record-breaking 28 goals scored in one day of the tournament.

“Our Junior All Whites also had their best ever result in the tournament, making it through to the knock-out round for the first time.”

The Government contributed $5.5 million to the tournament which is expected to attract around 7,000 visitors, benefiting our economy and regional host cities.

“Football clubs around the country are also enjoying the benefits of hosting FIFA’s second largest men’s competition, with nine new or improved training pitches now in use in Whanagrei, Hamilton and Christchurch,” says Dr Coleman.

“Off the field over 1,500 volunteers worked over 60,000 hours helping with catering, transportation, team liaison and city activations.

“Nearly a thousand volunteers have indicated they wish to take up future roles as administrators, coaches or referees.”
