An operating funding increase that will grow to just over $5 million a year by 2018/19 will allow MetService to become more resilient, Transport Minister Simon Bridges and Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss say.

The boost to MetService’s contract with the Crown to deliver public-good weather forecasting services will allow MetService to move some resources and create a new off-site data back-up in Auckland. The organisation will also use the funding to update its meteorological forecasting system.

“Many New Zealanders rely on the information provided by MetService. From the decision to take an umbrella for their walk to work to whether alpine weather conditions are too dangerous to continue a tramp, they look to MetService,” Mr Bridges says.

“This increased funding means New Zealanders can be assured they are getting world class, reliable weather forecasting services.”

Mr Foss says the increase in funding will also pay for a new rain radar in Otago in 2018/19.

“While there is currently some coverage in the lower South Island from the Southland rain radar, the rain radar in Otago will provide more accurate warnings about the risk of severe thunderstorms and flooding.

“The increased funding will also allow MetService to provide free forecasts for the recreational aviation sector through its MetFlight GA service.

“Recreational pilots will have free access to vital specialised weather information, putting them on the same footing as other outdoor recreational users, such as boaties and trampers,” Mr Foss says.
