Prime Minister John Key has this morning expressed his deepest sympathies for the family, friends and supporters of Lecretia Seales who lost her battle with cancer.

“Cancer is a terrible disease for those who suffer it and it’s particularly hard on those who witness their loved ones eventually succumb to it,” says Mr Key

“My heart goes out to Lecretia’s family and friends.”
