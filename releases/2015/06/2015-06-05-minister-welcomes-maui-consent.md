Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed a marine consent that will allow continued activity on the Maui gas field.

Today the Environmental Protection Authority granted a 35 year marine consent to Shell Todd Oil Services (STOS) which will allow the continued production of natural gas and condensate off the Taranaki coast.

“The Maui field is New Zealand’s most successful offshore gas discovery and continues to make an important contribution to our economy and our energy security,” Mr Bridges says.

“Natural gas is an essential part of New Zealand’s energy mix. It is used by thousands of businesses and in hundreds of thousands of homes across the North Island. It is also the cleanest burning fossil fuel and has an important role in the global transition to a low-carbon future.”

Mr Bridges says the Maui field has historically been the primary source of natural gas in New Zealand. It still produces roughly a fifth of our natural gas and could produce for at least a further 15 years at current estimates.

“Last month, I renewed STOS’s petroleum license. Along with the marine consent, this will allow continued production from the Maui field.”
