Primary Industries Ministers Nathan Guy and Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew have welcomed the annual KPMG Agribusiness Agenda, which shows strong industry support for the Government priorities of strengthening biosecurity and adding value to exports.

“This annual report surveys over 100 leaders in the primary sector and is a valuable snapshot of industry views,” says Mr Guy.

“It’s no surprise to see biosecurity highlighted again as the number one issue by industry, as it has been my number one priority since becoming Minister.

“This year’s Budget has $27 million in new funding for biosecurity, which will mean more dogs, x-ray machines and resources.

“The new international passenger border levy is a fair and responsible way of dealing with increasing traveller movements, and I’m pleased to see this has been warmly received by primary sector groups.

“Earlier this year I also announced Biosecurity 2025 which will update and replace the founding document of New Zealand’s biosecurity system, the 2003 Biosecurity Strategy.

“Four industries have signed up to the Government Industry Agreement (GIA) which involves industry and Government working together on preparedness and responses to biosecurity threats.

“It’s pleasing to see the continued focus on the importance of adding value to our exports. This will help insulate New Zealand from commodity price fluctuations, and will be crucial in our goal of doubling the value of primary sector exports by 2025.

“This is why the Primary Growth Partnership is so important. Government and industry are co-investing $720 million over time with 17 projects currently underway. In total, the Government is investing around $300 million a year into R&D in the primary sector."

“In order to maintain our market position as a global food supplier we need to continue to foster innovation, and we are seeing fantastic results through initiatives like the Primary Growth Partnership where new, added-value ingredients and premium meat products are being developed,” says Mrs Goodhew.

"However, ahead of innovation, food safety continues to be of high strategic importance to industry who ranked it as a top priority at second equal behind biosecurity.

“For New Zealand to continue to be globally relevant we need to maintain international confidence in our food safety system. That is why we are working to ensure our local producers and exporters meet the food safety standards of trading partners and the expectations of international markets into the future.

“It’s encouraging to again see that industry and the Government are on the same page regarding the major challenges and opportunities ahead of us.”
