Students at Auckland’s Mt Albert Primary School are set for a lift in learning thanks to the opening of a  new classroom block, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The new modern teaching spaces for staff and students at the school will support raised achievement and provide room for future roll growth,” says Ms Parata.

The Education Minister opened the 10 classroom, two-storey block today.

“The quality of teaching and leadership are the critical ingredients for lifting learning for every child and flexible modern spaces will support a wider range of effective teaching practices.”

She says the project began life four years ago as a five classroom block, but it became obvious during the early design stages that the school, which has a current roll of more than 350 students, would need more classrooms.

“The brief was changed to allow for a much bigger project, with 10 classrooms and a $3.3 million budget. I’m delighted we’ve been able to double the number of classrooms at the school to 20 to provide room for 440 students in future.

“The new building features attractive, flexible modern spaces where children can learn in a comfortable environment. Staff contributed to the design so they could be sure it would work well.

“The library was originally located in one of the classrooms. Now the school has a purpose-designed information centre that will house its new library. 

“We’re providing an environment where both teachers and students can achieve to the best of their ability.”
