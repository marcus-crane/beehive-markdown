Youth Minister Nikki Kaye today announced that four organisations will receive a total of around $45,000 of ‘services for young people’ funding, to help them deliver a range of youth development programmes.

“This is one-off funding to established organisations working in the youth sector, to support them to extend or deliver existing initiatives they’re involved with that benefit young people,” says Ms Kaye.

“The successful recipients are InZone Education Foundation, Zeal Education Trust and Youth Mentoring Network, all based in Auckland, and Ignite Sport Trust, based in Lower Hutt.

“The funding I’ve announced today will help these organisations deliver initiatives such as mentoring for young people from disadvantaged communities; a one-day event to inspire and educate emerging young change-makers; a guide to help the youth sector deliver successful mentoring; and sports-based leadership and life skills programmes.

“Last week I hosted the 2015 Youth Awards in Wellington, and was once again amazed at the depth of talent that exists among our young people.

“The forty award winners we recognised that evening are just the tip of the iceberg, so it’s important we keep supporting organisations who are reaching out to and working with young people.

“That’s exactly what this funding is about. It will support young people to build skills and confidence that will help prepare them for a successful future.”
