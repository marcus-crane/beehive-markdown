Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill has been reappointed for a second term.

“Congratulations to Mr Hill on his reappointment as Health and Disability Commissioner,” says Dr Coleman. “I would like to thank Mr Hill for his continuing commitment to the role.

“It is important to ensure New Zealanders have access to the highest quality health and disability care.

“I am confident Mr Hill and his team of Deputy Commissioners will continue to protect and improve patients’ experience of our health and disability system.”

Mr Hill’s current five-year term as Health and Disability Commissioner comes to an end in July. His second three-year term commences on 19 July 2015.
