This year’s Fieldays has been another major success and shows the resilience of the primary sector, says Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy.

“Over 126,000 visitors attended the 47th annual Fieldays this year which is the biggest agricultural event of its type in the Southern Hemisphere.

“I spent three days at Fieldays and the mood was positive overall, despite a lower payout this year for dairy farmers. Beef exports are strong and horticulture exports are enjoying a record year. The announcement of the official cash rate (OCR) reducing to 3.25% is a timely boost for the primary sector and will help provincial New Zealand.

“Farmers know that commodity prices go up and down, and are in it for the long term. The future looks extremely positive with growing Asian markets almost on our doorstep.

“Agritech exports are worth around $1.2b a year and steadily growing, and that's why many international delegations visit the Fieldays - to learn from New Zealand’s agribusiness expertise.

“A wide range of Ministers and MPs attended, including the Prime Minister who got an amazing reception when he visited and opened the Fieldays on Wednesday.

“Along with Health Minister Jonathan Coleman I was proud to announce $500,000 in new Government funding to support rural communities, including mental health services.

“It was great to see the Ministry for Primary Industries winning 'Best Innovative Showcase Site' out of 1,000 exhibitors at Fieldays. As usual, the detector dogs were hugely popular with visitors.

“KPMG’s annual Agribusiness Agenda confirmed strong industry support for the Government priorities of strengthening biosecurity and adding value to exports.

“It was also a privilege to announce Doug Avery and Zach Mounsey as the winners of 2015 Global Research Alliance World Farmer Study Tour to Argentina later this year. Both farmers are focussed on environmental sustainability and will do a great job representing New Zealand and help share their knowledge when they return.

“Congratulations to everyone involved in Fieldays 2015 for another great event.”
