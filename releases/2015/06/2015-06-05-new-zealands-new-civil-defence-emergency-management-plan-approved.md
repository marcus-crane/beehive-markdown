The government has approved, through an Order in Council, a revised plan to ensure New Zealand is well prepared to manage emergencies, Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye announced today.

“The National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan sets out the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in reducing risks and preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies.

“This includes central and local government, lifeline utilities such as electricity suppliers, emergency services such as fire and police and non-government organisations such as victim support.

“The plan is generally revised every five years to ensure it’s robust, current and well understood by everyone involved in its delivery.

“However, the plan I’ve announced today was delayed to enable the incorporation of important lessons learned from the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011.

“The revised plan will take effect on 1 December. This allows time for a guide to be produced, setting out all the supporting operational detail and diagrams.

“Years of work and extensive consultation with the public and relevant agencies and organisations have gone into developing the latest version of the plan. This included the required parliamentary process through select committee.

“As well as an increased emphasis on risk reduction and recovery from an emergency, there are strengthened arrangements for the delivery of welfare services, and recognition of the significant roles that the New Zealand Defence Force and science and research organisations have in emergencies.

“I congratulate all agencies and individuals involved in revising the plan for their commitment to raising the bar, and their shared vision of a resilient New Zealand.

“We’ve faced a number of significant emergencies in recent years, including the nation’s first state of national emergency for the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

“It’s essential we’re prepared for events such as these, and the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan plays an important role in this.”

Ms Kaye says there are also a number of other pieces of work currently underway to strengthen our civil defence system.

“This includes further work focused on improving risk reduction and resilience in communities. This covers infrastructure and planning improvements and a new legislative framework for recovery.

“It’s important to have the right laws in place so that those involved in recovery work can get on with the job and get it done swiftly and effectively.

“The recovery work is split into two phases. The first phase primarily focuses on strengthening recovery from small to moderate scale emergencies, while the second phase is about a more comprehensive framework for recovery from national emergencies, and will incorporate lessons learned from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 review.

“Work is progressing well, and proposals are being developed to make appropriate amendments to the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002.”

**Key changes at a glance:**

The plan has been extensively rewritten, recognising stakeholder feedback and review recommendations.

The outcome is a more robust, complete and well-understood set of arrangements that apply across risk reduction, readiness, response and recovery.

In short, the revised plan:

- clarifies the role of lead agencies to provide greater understanding of who’s responsible for planning the management of particular hazards during an emergency (eg, MCDEM for natural hazards, NZ Police for terrorism, Ministry for Primary Industries for biosecurity, food safety and drought)
- identifies the important role the New Zealand Defence Force can play in an emergency, eg by helping with evacuation, cordon management, aerial reconnaissance, deploying goods and services to affected communities
- includes new arrangements for building management, including building safety assessment to protect life
- recognises the role of research and science organisations such as GNS Science and MetService, which can help understand and monitor hazards and provide advice and information during emergencies
- enhances welfare services arrangements to better meet the needs of affected communities during emergencies, eg the need for financial assistance, psychosocial support, emergency accommodation, care and protection of children separated from parents, animal welfare
- incorporates new arrangements for Civil Defence Emergency Management logistics, to ensure the sufficient deployment and provision of resources during emergencies
- sets out new arrangements for business continuity planning and emergency response planning for local authorities, government departments and lifeline utilities, to ensure essential services continue to be provided to communities and that response agencies can operate effectively during emergencies
