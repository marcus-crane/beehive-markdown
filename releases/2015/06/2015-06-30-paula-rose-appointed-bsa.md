Broadcasting Minister Amy Adams has announced the appointment of Paula Rose QSO, as a board member of the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA).

“Paula Rose has valuable experience in the policing, community, welfare and media standards areas and will bring a wealth of knowledge to the BSA,” Ms Adams says.

“Ms Rose brings wide community experience alongside membership of the Online Media Standards Authority Complaints Committee which means she is well positioned to make a constructive contribution to work of the BSA.”

“Ms Rose is a well-known and respected member of her community and her vast array of skills and expertise will be of immense value in this role,” Ms Adams says.

Ms Adams also acknowledged the work of outgoing BSA member Mary Shanahan.

“Ms Shanahan has made a strong contribution to the BSA during her six years as a member, in particular by ensuring that there has been a sound community perspective to the deliberations of the BSA,” Ms Adams says.
