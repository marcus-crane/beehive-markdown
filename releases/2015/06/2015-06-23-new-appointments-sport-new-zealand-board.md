Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has today announced two new appointments to the Sport New Zealand Board.

Wellington sport administrator, Paul Cameron, and Auckland sports medicine specialist, Dr Brendan O’Neill, have been appointed to the Board.

“I am pleased to welcome high-calibre appointees Paul Cameron and Dr O’Neill to the Sport NZ Board,” says Dr Coleman.

“Paul Cameron is currently chief executive of Volleyball NZ and a member of the Halberg Trust. He is well known in Wellington as former chief executive of Sport Wellington.

“Dr O’Neill has experience as a sports medicine registrar from 2005 to 2011 in New Zealand and Australia. He is currently team doctor/medical director for Canoe Racing NZ, Counties ITM Cup, and the ASB/Heineken Tennis Open.”

Dr Coleman also thanked departing members Katie Sadleir and Paul Allison for their commitment.

“Katie Sadleir and Paul Allison brought great experience from quite different dimensions of the sector. They have made a major contribution to Sport NZ,” says Dr Coleman.
