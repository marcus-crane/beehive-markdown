Good progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of a major review of disability support services, Associate Health Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“Substantial changes to the Ministry of Health’s processes and systems and managing provider performance have been made,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This review was a response to concerns raised by the disability sector around transparent performance and quality management of ministry-funded provider services.

“Its implementation is one of the priority areas contained in the updated Disability Support Services Strategic Plan, which is being released today.”

The ministry is working with disabled people, government agencies, providers and the wider sector on more than 60 activities to help achieve the report’s recommendations.

Nineteen have been completed and 43 are in progress. Completed activities include new bi-monthly reports that inform decisions about provider performance and establishing a two-year project to provide paid internships for young disabled people.

“The ministry listened when disabled people told them they wanted a voice in decisions made about services that impact on them, their whānau and providers. The focus is on their safety, quality of life and ability to speak up about the standard of services they receive,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
