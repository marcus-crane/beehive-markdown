Announcements today on local government reorganisation applications place communities firmly at the heart of decisions about their own local democracy, Local Government Minister Paula Bennett says.

The Local Government Commission (LGC) announced it would not proceed with draft proposals in Wellington and Northland, and would return to those communities to work with them on options for change.

“I have heard these communities say they are up for change, just not in the shape of the initial reorganisation proposals,” says Mrs Bennett.

“These communities face very real challenges, and I encourage them to get around the table and design structures that can help unlock their full potential.”

The LGC is recommending establishing a single new council for Hawke’s Bay, with strong support both for and against structural change in the region.

“What happens now is in the community’s hands, and I encourage people to have their say about whether or not this proposal goes ahead.

“Efficient, representative local government is crucial to supporting a growing economy and backing our families to get ahead.

“The role of the LGC is to listen to what communities want and work with them towards effective solutions. Today’s announcements show it is doing just that,” Mrs Bennett says.
