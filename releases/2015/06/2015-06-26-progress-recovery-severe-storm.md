Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says the recovery led by local authorities is well under way in regions affected by the severe storm that crossed New Zealand between 18 and 20 June.

‘Regions hardest hit by the storm, which caused significant damage and flooding, were Taranaki, Whanganui, Rangitikei and Westland,” says Ms Kaye.

“Within these regions some areas were affected more than others, so the speed of recovery will differ for each area.

“The current estimate provided by the Horizons Regional Council is that the storm’s costs will be in the vicinity of $120 million.

“This figure will undoubtedly change, as it’s only based on some infrastructure and housing costs, and not all assessments have been undertaken. However, it does give some idea of the severity of this event.

“In situations like this, the costs are shared between central government, local government and private insurers, so communities can be assured that most of the costs should already be accounted for within our existing system.

“Based on past experience with similar events, the government is likely to meet at least 60% of these costs.

“The government will work with local mayors regarding any additional needs they may have, and potential further contributions.

“The advice I’m getting from them is that good progress is being made in many areas, as flood waters recede, roads are cleared and power and phone services restored.

“In some places, most roads are now accessible, but in other places there are roads that may be inaccessible for months or longer.

“States of local emergency remain in force in Taranaki and Whanganui, where some areas remain cordoned off for safety reasons.

“Our thoughts are with those who are still unable to return to flood-damaged homes, or who remain isolated in rural areas.

“Although it will be a longer road to recovery for some, it’s important people know there’s support available.

“Temporary accommodation is being provided for those who can’t return home yet, and supplies are being airlifted to those cut off until rural roads can be cleared or repaired.

“The government is supporting local authorities who are leading the recovery through a range of mechanisms.

“This includes funding repairs to state highways; supporting councils to repair local roads; reimbursing councils for costs such as accommodating and feeding displaced residents and repairing essential infrastructure; MSD hardship grants; and extra funding for Rural Support Trusts.

“I have already announced $250,000 of funding which will be contributed to the Manawatu-Whanganui Disaster Relief Fund.

“I’m pleased to announce that the government will also contribute $50,000 to the newly activated Taranaki Disaster Relief Fund, and $10,000 to the newly activated Westland Disaster Relief Fund.

“These funds, which are activated by local authorities, are typically used to address potential gaps by helping those unable to access support from other avenues, such as insurance.

“I’d like to thank everyone involved in the response and recovery, especially the countless volunteers who are pitching in to clean up and support their neighbours and community.

“Events such as this can take a real toll but they also bring out the best in people, and I’ve seen and heard overwhelming examples of this during my visits to affected regions this week.

“I’ve been having regular conference calls with mayors and intend to make further visits over the next month, to see first-hand how the recovery is progressing.”
