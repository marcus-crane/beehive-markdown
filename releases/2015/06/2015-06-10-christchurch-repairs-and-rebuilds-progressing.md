The pace of the Government’s rebuild and repair of social housing in Christchurch continues to progress at top gear, Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett says.

Housing New Zealand (HNZ) has now repaired more than 4,000 of its quake-damaged properties. With this achievement, HNZ enters the final phase of its earthquake recovery programme that will see up to 5,000 earthquake-damaged homes repaired by the end of 2015.

HNZ is also making good progress building 700 new homes across the region. More than 191 new properties have been built, with the remaining properties either being built or nearing completion across the region by the end of this year.

“These milestones are significant achievements and are greatly improving the quality of life for tenants throughout the region,” Mrs Bennett says.

“Over 95 per cent of HNZ’s properties were damaged in the earthquakes, resulting in skyrocketing demand and many families left in desperate situations.

“The volume of work HNZ faced was unprecedented but these milestones show it has risen to the challenge.

“The repair programme is enhancing the quality of existing state houses and construction of 700 new homes is helping modernise social housing stock which will benefit tenants and their families for many years to come.’’

As well as the necessary repairs, contractors are adding new floor coverings, ventilation, heating, insulation and other upgrades into the repair work where appropriate.

HNZ identified communities in the city’s eastern suburbs as high priorities in its repair programme and virtually all of the 400-plus homes that needed repairs have had their work completed.
