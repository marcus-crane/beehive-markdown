Transport Minister Simon Bridges says he has tasked his agencies with putting all available resources into the repair and reinstatement of the lower North Island’s storm-damaged transport networks.

Mr Bridges visited the Whanganui region today to get an overview of the impact the flooding has had on the region’s State highways and local roads.

“It’s been important for me to see and understand the situation first hand,” he says.

Mr Bridges met with Mayor Annette Main and Chief Executive Kevin Ross to discuss how the Government will support the response.

“While it’s clear the damage is extensive, the Government has a funding scheme in place to help the region restore its transport networks. I will keep in regular contact with local authorities," he says.

“The New Zealand Transport Agency is continuing to carry out assessments on the damage caused to the State highway network, and the Government will pay for those and contribute to the costs of repairing local roads.”

Mr Bridges also visited the Whanganui District Council’s Civil Defence centre.

“I’d like to thank all the road, rail and power crews who are working hard in trying circumstances to restore the networks in the region he says.
