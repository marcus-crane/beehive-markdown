The lifetime education award presented to Dr Adrienne Alton-Lee recognises a major contribution to raising educational achievement, says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

Ms Parata presented the Minister of Education’s Award for Lifetime Contribution to Raising Educational Achievement to Dr Alton-Lee at the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards in Wellington on Wednesday.

“Dr Alton-Lee is one of New Zealand’s most respected and influential education researchers. Her work on the best evidence synthesis has provided critical insight into how children learn and the factors that make the greatest difference inside and outside the classroom.”

Dr Alton-Lee is presently the Chief Education Advisor for the Best Evidence Synthesis (BES) Programme run by the Ministry of Education.

She was formerly a teacher, classroom researcher, senior lecturer in education at the University of Canterbury and professor and dean of education at Victoria University.

“It was especially fitting that she receive her award at the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards because the award categories are based on the BES which identifies teaching, leadership, parental engagement and governance as critical contributors to the quality of education,” says Ms Parata.
