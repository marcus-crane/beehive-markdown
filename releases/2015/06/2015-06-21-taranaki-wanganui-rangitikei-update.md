Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says states of local emergency were declared in Taranaki, Wanganui and Rangitikei yesterday to enable people to be evacuated to safety.

“The flooding in areas such as Waitotara and Wanganui has been very severe.

“In situations like this, it’s important that local Civil Defence Emergency Management teams can take actions necessary to help evacuate people and save lives.

“It was a long night for many, and as inspections are carried out today where possible, we’ll get a better assessment of the impact of this severe storm.

“Responding agencies including emergency services, the NZ Defence Force and welfare services are working hard to ensure people are safe and have accommodation and other assistance, as most of the focus turns to clean-up and recovery.

“Transport agencies are also working hard to carry out inspections and repair roads.

“I have been in regular contact with local mayors, and the National Crisis Management Centre in Wellington has been activated to ensure local authorities have the support they need.

“More than 200 people were evacuated last night and some may not be able to get back to their homes today.

“This afternoon, I will visit Wanganui with the Director of the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management. We will meet with the Mayor, be briefed by the local Civil Defence Emergency Management Group and visit some affected areas.

“As in any emergency, the government will help local authorities with the costs of response and recovery. We will also work alongside councils to provide further support where necessary.”
