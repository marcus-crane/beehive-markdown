Project Janszoon has named as the recipient of the Supreme Award at this year’s Green Ribbon Awards, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith and Conservation Minister Maggie Barry announced at the ceremony held at Parliament tonight.

“Project Janszoon has carried out an impressive job restoring and protecting one of New Zealand’s greatest natural assets: the Abel Tasman National Park. Project initiatives include extensive pest and weed control, the return of important plants and animals like rata and kaka and future proofing the project through education and community engagement,” Dr Smith says.

“What really made Project Janszoon stand out for the judges was its long-term commitment and vision to protect the environment. The project works closely with the Department of Conservation, The Abel Tasman Birdsong Trust and the community. It provides an excellent example of what we can achieve if we work together to conserve and restore our environment,” Ms Barry says.

This year marks 25 years of the Green Ribbon Awards. More than 170 individuals and groups have been recognised as part of the Green Ribbon Awards since their inception in 1990. This year’s awards are a joint venture for the first time between the Ministry for the Environment and the Department of Conservation, as part of the Government’s focus on encouraging a more integrated approach to protecting the country’s water, air, land, forests and endangered species.

“It is fitting that we celebrate this year’s awards ahead of World Environment Day tomorrow. Over the past 25 years, we’ve celebrated the achievements of a wide range of diverse people, organisations and businesses that have gone above and beyond to protect and improve New Zealand’s environment,” Dr Smith says.

“We also want to acknowledge the finalists and nominees of this year’s awards, who are doing commendable work to improve and protect New Zealand’s water, air, land, forests and treasured species. We know that Government cannot achieve all that needs to be done on its own, and we are grateful for the support of communities, volunteers and partners in our effort to preserve what makes our country special,” the Ministers say.
