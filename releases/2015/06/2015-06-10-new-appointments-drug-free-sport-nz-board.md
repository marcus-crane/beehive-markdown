Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has today announced two new appointments to the Drug Free Sport New Zealand Board.

Tim Castle and Dr John Mayhew have been appointed to the Board. Justice Warwick Gendall has been reappointed Board Chair, and Board members Stephen Cottrell and Sarah Ulmer have been reappointed.

“I am pleased to welcome Tim Castle and Dr Mayhew to the Drug Free Sport NZ Board. They are both high-calibre appointees who will bring significant knowledge and experience,” says Dr Coleman.

“Wellington barrister Tim Castle was the first person from Oceania to be appointed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport based in Switzerland. He is also a former chair of the NZ Olympic Committee.

“Dr John Mayhew is currently team doctor for the New Zealand Warriors and former team doctor for the All Blacks. He is a pioneer of sports medicine in New Zealand.”

Dr Coleman thanked departing members, orthopaedic surgeon Stewart Walsh and Christchurch GP, Dr Leslie Rumball for their long-serving commitment.

“Former Silver Ferns captain Leslie Rumball, a GP and sports medicine specialist, brought practical experience to her role,” says Dr Coleman.

“Stewart Walsh contributed strongly through his orthopaedic background and knowledge of the sport environment underpinned by extensive clinical practice experience.”
