Foreign Minister Murray McCully today welcomed the start of the US/NZ Partnership Forum which is taking place in Auckland this week.

“The Forum has a long history of bringing together a range of participants from multiple sectors to discuss the relationship between New Zealand and the United States,” Mr McCully says.

“The US is one of New Zealand’s most important partners and events like this reinforce the strong links between our two nations.

“The US and New Zealand have a longstanding friendship and this year I am pleased to be able to welcome Danny Russel, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific as a keynote speaker for the event.

“Mr Russel is a friend of New Zealand and having him in New Zealand this week is an opportunity to discuss the US-NZ partnership and where we can take it in the future."

“I would also like to welcome the other distinguished guests taking part in the Forum, including; senior members of the US Administration, Congress, and business representatives,” Mr McCully says.
