Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today paid tribute to former New Zealand Law Society President, John Marshall CNZM QC, who died yesterday.

“Mr Marshall was both a highly respected member of the legal profession and a friend,” Mr Finlayson said.

The son of former Prime Minister, Sir Jack Marshall, John Marshall had a distinguished career in the law as a litigation partner in Buddle Findlay and barrister. In addition, he was Chief Commissioner of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission and was heavily involved in the Presbyterian Church.

“On behalf of the Government, I offer my sincere condolences to John’s wife, Mary, and his family,” Mr Finlayson said.
