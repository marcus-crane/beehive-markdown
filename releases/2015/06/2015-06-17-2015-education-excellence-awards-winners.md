Education Minister Hekia Parata has congratulated Gisborne Boys’ High School on being chosen as the winner of the Supreme Award at the 2015 Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“The award recognises the school’s extraordinary success in defying stereotypes and transforming lives through a range of initiatives that enable boys to learn more about themselves and their culture,” says Ms Parata.

Two entries from the school were finalists in the awards with the school’s Whakairo programme winning the Teaching and Learning category.

The other category winners were the teaching team at Barnardos KidStart in Hastings  (Excellence in Engaging), the lower North Island-based Central Regional Health School (Excellence in Leading) and Mangere Bridge Kindergarten (Education Focus Prize).

“The winners and all the finalists typify the very best of teaching practice in New Zealand,” says Ms Parata. “We know that great teachers make a real difference and that is exactly what all the finalists have done.”

The awards, in their second year, recognise and celebrate outstanding achievements in early childhood education, primary and secondary schooling.

They were presented this evening by Prime Minister John Key at a ceremony at Te Papa attended by the 11 finalists along with representatives from all parts of the education sector.

The winning entry from each category receives $20,000 and a professional development opportunity.

As the winner of the Supreme Award, Gisborne Boys’ High School receives an additional $30,000 plus an opportunity to represent New Zealand education. Finalists also receive a financial award to acknowledge their contribution to education.
