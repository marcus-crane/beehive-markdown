Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye says dedicated recovery managers are on the ground to coordinate the recovery led by local authorities, in areas affected by the recent severe storm.

“Regional recovery managers appointed by Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups are working with local recovery managers from district councils, to help ensure that resources and support are coordinated and delivered effectively,” says Ms Kaye.

“The focus twelve days on from the storm’s onset is continued clean-up in urban and rural areas, supporting people who are still isolated or unable to return home yet, and completing assessments of road and property damage.

“Good progress has been achieved in reopening roads. Around 80 percent of roads in areas hardest hit were affected in some way, but in some of these areas all roads are now fully open or accessible.

“The state of local emergency has now been lifted in Taranaki, but remains in force in Whanganui to enable ongoing safety assessments of buildings affected by flooding.

“As I’ve previously said, the government is likely to contribute at least 60 per cent towards the overall costs of the storm, which have been estimated at around $120 million, depending on final assessments.

“While for many life after the storm has returned to normal, there are some who have been badly affected, and it’s important we make sure they receive the support they need to get their lives back on track.

“Today, the Minister for Social Development signed off a further $250,000 towards Enhanced Task Force Green. This is on top of the $250,000 announced last week, and will be a big help with the clean-up work.

“We will work with mayors to ensure flexible deployment of Enhanced Task Force Green teams over the coming months. This recognises that some farmers, for example, will benefit from help in the spring to address storm damage which can’t be tackled now because of extremely wet conditions.

“Yesterday, the Minister of Revenue also announced that Inland Revenue will offer relief measures for people who can’t meet their tax obligations because of the storm’s impact. These measures include remitting interest on late tax payments.

“Housing New Zealand (HNZ) has also communicated that it will help find longer-term accommodation for people unable to return to their homes, regardless of whether they’re existing HNZ tenants.”

This latest support is in addition to other government support previously announced, which includes:

- $310,000 contribution to local authorities’ disaster relief funds (typically used to help people without other avenues of support, such as insurance)
- NZ Transport Agency funding for the repair of state highways, and support for councils to repair local roads
- reimbursement of councils’ costs such as accommodating and feeding displaced people, and repairing essential infrastructure
- $145,000 Ministry for Primary Industries contribution to Rural Support Trusts
- $50,000 Ministry of Social Development contribution for psycho-social support services.

“With all the support in place, recovery work is making progress.

“The Prime Minister and a number of cabinet ministers have visited affected areas. I have visited three times since the storm hit, and I understand Ministers Guy and Bennett will visit this week. I also intend to head back to Whanganui next week.

“In the meantime, I’m keeping in regular contact with local mayors, and the government will work with them regarding any additional needs they may have.”
