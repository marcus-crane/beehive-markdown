$3 million will be invested in marketing New Zealand exporters to the world through the New Zealand Story programme and the Rugby World Cup in the UK later this year, says Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce.

The New Zealand Story programme received $1 million to be expanded and updated as part of Budget 2015.

The New Zealand Story is a marketing toolkit that was launched in 2013 to help exporters from all sectors gain a competitive advantage by building a strong, consistent profile of New Zealand in international markets.

“All countries compete for a share of the world’s attention and interest, and the success of our businesses is influenced by how we as a country are perceived internationally,” Mr Joyce says.

“When New Zealand exporters first visit a new market they need something which places New Zealand and their business into context, to explain who we are, how innovative we are, and what drives us as a country.

“The New Zealand Story provides that context, and helps us broaden the perception of New Zealand internationally.”

Since its launch, more than 100,000 people have visited the New Zealand Story website, and downloaded more than 14,000 videos and resources.

The initiative will be funded through the reprioritisation of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) funds.

Budget 2015 also allocated $2 million for a business leveraging programme that will see New Zealand companies benefit from the All Blacks’ participation in the upcoming Rugby World Cup in the UK, Mr Joyce says.

“New Zealand has a strong connection with rugby through the All Blacks, and Rugby World Cup 2015 presents an opportunity for us to build on our brand, tell the New Zealand story, and attract interest and investment from the UK and Europe that will benefit our country.”

The business leveraging programme, led by NZTE, will support businesses to build their contacts and networks in the United Kingdom and Europe through a programme of events and promotions.

“RWC 2015 will provide the opportunity to confirm to the UK and Europe that New Zealand is open for business and to highlight some of our key industries, innovative and creative businesses on the world stage,” Mr Joyce says.

The programme is funded through reprioritisation of NZTE funds from 2014/15 into this financial year, and from NZTE’s and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s operational baseline.
