Communications Minister Amy Adams today welcomed the completion of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) build in Timaru.

More than 15 per cent of eligible users in Timaru have already signed up for UFB making it the fifth highest initial uptake in the country. 

Speaking at Mt Cook Alpine Salmon, Ms Adams said better broadband was a core part of the Government’s plan to develop a productive and competitive economy. 

“Over 14,000 houses, school, business and medical centres in Timaru are able to connect to the high- speed network. Access to cheap, reliable, fast broadband will help create more jobs and improve health and education outcomes,” Ms Adams says.

Fibre has been rolled out to 15 schools in and around Timaru, with 13 of these now connected to the Government’s Network for Learning.

“Timaru can now take advantage of the benefits UFB delivers, such as seamless cloud computing, online streaming of content, video conferencing and the ability to send large images and files,” Ms Adams says. 

“Fast, reliable internet will help people living in Timaru connect with others, and businesses get products and services to the rest of the world.

“Together, the Government and Chorus have invested more than $23 million to deliver UFB to Timaru. This investment means more New Zealanders can connect to the high-speed network.”

**Nationwide UFB build by the numbers (as at 31 March 2015):**

- **46 per cent of build** **complete**. Within budget and ahead of schedule.
