Racing Minister Nathan Guy has announced that 11 projects to improve safety and development at racecourses will receive a total of $296,400 in funding.

The money is coming from the Racing Safety Development Fund which provides $1 million annually to racecourse safety and development across two funding rounds.

“This year’s second funding round has supported a wide range of infrastructure projects including storm water upgrade, new starting gates, sand track fencing, and a greyhound lure rail upgrade,” said Minister Guy.

“The fund continues to contribute to the safety of the racing industry for animals, industry participants and the public.

“These facilities are all public places and widely used by the community in rural areas, outside of racing events as well as at race days.”

The first funding round of the 2015/16 racing year opens for applications on 1 August 2015 and closes on 30 September 2015.

“I encourage New Zealand’s racing clubs, and the respective code bodies, to apply to the Fund where there are safety and development issues that need to be addressed.”
