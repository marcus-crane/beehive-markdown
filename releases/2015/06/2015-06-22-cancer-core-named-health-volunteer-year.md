Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has announced that Cancer Core, a group of students from the University of Otago, is the overall winner of the 2015 Minister of Health Volunteer Awards. 

“The health volunteer awards celebrate and recognise the thousands of dedicated health sector volunteers who give many hours of their time to help other New Zealanders,” says Dr Coleman.

“The judges were particularly impressed by the quality of this year’s entries. Well done to all those who were nominated and congratulations to those recognised as outstanding achievers.

“I would like to congratulate the overall winners Cancer Core. Their inaugural Relay for Life attracted more than 1,000 students and raised over $60,000 for the Cancer Society.”

Marking National Volunteer Week, Dr Coleman presented the Minister of Health Volunteer Awards in Parliament today.

Outstanding achievers were recognised across five categories – healthcare service provider, community or NGO, youth health, Māori and Pacific health, and long service.
