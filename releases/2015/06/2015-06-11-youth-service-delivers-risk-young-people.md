Social Development Minister Anne Tolley says the latest results from the Youth Service show it is making a difference for at-risk young people, by supporting them to build their skills and prepare them for employment.

At the end of March, 86.5 per cent of the young people enrolled in the Youth Service were engaged in education, training or work-based learning. This is a 10.4 per cent increase, or more than 1,000 clients, than at the same time last year.

Just over half of those who left the Youth Service remained independent from benefits three months after leaving the programme, a 4.9 per cent improvement.

“It’s great to see that these young New Zealanders are responding to the intensive support and mentoring which is being provided through the Youth Service,” says Mrs Tolley. 

“It is targeted at vulnerable young people, many of whom have a history with CYF, who are at risk of being long-term beneficiaries, and gives them the opportunity to gain education and employment training to help them become independent.

“The programme gives them the chance to become successful, while also reducing future benefit costs for taxpayers. It is estimated that for every dollar spent on the Youth Service, the long-term financial liability to New Zealanders reduces by $2.53.

“By giving these young people the options they need to stay off a benefit, we are also reducing the risks of intergenerational welfare dependency, as the children of beneficiaries are much more likely to grow up to be on a benefit.

“Youth Service providers are telling us that the number of clients achieving the goal of at least NCEA Level 2 or equivalent has seen a large increase, and a full evaluation, containing updated qualification statistics, is expected by the end of the year.”

At the end of March, there were 12,242 young people enrolled in the Youth Service.
