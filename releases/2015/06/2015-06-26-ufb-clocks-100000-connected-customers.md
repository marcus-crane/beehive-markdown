Communications Minister Amy Adams today unveiled the 100,000th user to benefit from the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) rollout.

Outdoor media provider Go Media became the landmark customer to have UFB installed when it was successfully connected to Enable’s network in Christchurch.

Ms Adams hailed the latest milestone as a huge achievement from a programme that is seeing a record number of households, businesses and schools connect to fibre.

“To have reached this milestone just four and a half years after the rollout began highlights the success of the programme and the thirst that New Zealanders have to connect to faster, more reliable internet,” says Ms Adams.

“With around one-in-seven customers in coverage areas now connected, the Government’s uptake expectations have been exceeded.”

For international comparison, in late 2010, when Singapore was 50 per cent complete, uptake was very low at around 2 per cent. As of 31 March 2015, uptake in New Zealand was 13.8 per cent.

“I’m delighted to see that UFB connections have grown ten-fold in the last two years, the highest growth rate in the OECD. In Canterbury, Enable’s network has more than one in three customers connected in some locations, which is a fantastic outcome,” says Ms Adams.

Go Media has billboard sites for outdoor advertising nationwide. Previously on a copper broadband connection, it wanted to bring three businesses under a new brand, with the Christchurch office as head office. The company needed a way of sharing and storing large files, as well the ability to move large files quickly to effectively meet clients’ demands

**About the Ultra-Fast Broadband programme:**

The UFB build is now complete in 11 towns and cities, while more than 2,200 schools have fibre installed and ready for service. The first stage of the UFB programme will enable at least 75 per cent of New Zealanders to access fibre to the premise by 2019. The expansion of the programme will extend UFB to at least 80 per cent of New Zealanders.
