Associate Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Nicky Wagner says people want to see Victoria Square preserved as a green, tranquil space that recognises its history.

The community participation process on the future of Victoria Square is underway, and almost 2200 survey responses were received from the public in the first round of feedback. This information has now been collated and the summary of feedback has been released.

“I’m delighted at how many people took the time to have their say on this important civic asset,” Ms Wagner says.

“This process highlighted that people want the green spaces, curved paths and historical elements kept, but feedback also suggests including more recognition of Maori culture and improving amenities.

“People enjoy the sense of space within Victoria Square and the access they have to Otakaro/Avon River. However, they also recognise that there are improvements that can be made to enhance the space and make it safer.

“Overall, the message is clear that only small changes that retain the key tranquil qualities will be supported by the community.”

The feedback and proposed designs will be closely reviewed by an Independent Reference Group made up of heritage, local business, tourism, accessibility and youth organisations alongside Ngāi Tūāhuriri and members of the team that developed the current design during the 1980s.

“It is essential that any proposals are looked at by a cross-section of our community and then put out for wider comment,” Ms Wagner says.

The second round of public comment is due to begin this winter. This is part of wider six-month long community participation process and the final design is expected to be released in September.
