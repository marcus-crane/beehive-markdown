Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce has today opened an innovation hub to support new and emerging businesses in Christchurch’s Innovation Precinct.

A joint partnership between Canterbury Development Corporation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the GreenHouse hub will support early-stage entrepreneurs by providing the necessary technological and social infrastructure required by such firms to grow.

“Early-stage and start-up businesses are typically the generators of new ideas, products and services,” says Mr Joyce. “GreenHouse will help grow the next generation of New Zealand’s innovative firms, within an environment that will encourage innovation and collaboration.

“The Government is committed to encouraging business innovation, which is the key to improving economic productivity and prosperity in New Zealand.”

The first group of businesses to be located in GreenHouse are:

- Debtor Daddy – an automated credit control system
- Maprogress –  a provider of adventure race tracking software
- Staff Buddy Ltd – a health and safety alert provider
- Xeal Mobile – a website builder for SMEs

They will be located alongside the Innovation Precinct’s anchor tenants Vodafone, Kathmandu and Wynyard Group, as well as Callaghan Innovation, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, and the ICT graduate school.

“Having these start-ups alongside larger firms with an established market presence will ensure a thriving, competitive, and knowledge-rich local innovation ecosystem within the Christchurch CBD,” Mr Joyce says.

The Innovation Precinct covers an area of approximately 3.6 hectares in the south-east corner of the Urban Frame and is located within three city blocks bounded by Lichfield, Manchester, St Asaph, High, Tuam and Madras Streets.
