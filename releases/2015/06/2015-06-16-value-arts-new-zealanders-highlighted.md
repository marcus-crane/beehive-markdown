Newly released research shows more Kiwis enjoy and value the arts than ever before, Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Maggie Barry says.

This evening Ms Barry will launch Creative New Zealand’s New Zealanders and the Arts: Attitudes, attendance and participation at Parliament.

The survey is the fourth triennial look at Kiwi attitudes to arts and culture, and shows it is a key part of what makes the country a great place to live.

“Attendance is at record levels with nine out of 10 New Zealanders either participating or going to at least one arts event in the last year,” Ms Barry says.

“Nine out of 10 Kiwis also think the arts have a positive impact on their lives, eight out of 10 agree arts improve our society and 86 per cent feel arts help them learn about different cultures.”

Results from young people are particularly encouraging. 74 per cent felt very positive when doing creative things and 83 per cent described “being creative” as a favourite pastime.

“It is a good sign for the future health of our cultural scene that so many young Kiwis value the arts.”

“They are vital to how we connect with others, how we see ourselves as a society and how we present our unique New Zealand identity to the world,” Ms Barry says.

“Though there are many competing demands on taxpayer dollars, as a government we remain committed to supporting the creative sector.”
