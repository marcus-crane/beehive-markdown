Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith today welcomed Parliament’s passage of the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) (Transitional Provisions) Amendment Bill, which will allow existing petroleum operators to continue operating while their marine consent is being considered by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).

“This change to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) Act will address transitional issues over the timing of existing marine consents. The Act required new marine consents for existing activities by the date the current mining permit expires, but did not include provisions for any appeals on a consent decision. This created unintended uncertainty for Shell Todd Oil Services Limited, with its marine consent for the Maui platform expiring on 28 June,” Dr Smith says.

The amendment passed today still requires existing petroleum operators to apply for a marine consent, but allows them to continue operating while the consent is under consideration and any appeals are being heard. The law change will now also require, however, existing operators to submit a marine consent application to the EPA and have it accepted as complete nine months before their pre-existing Crown Minerals mining permit or privilege expires.

“An application has already been lodged by STOS for a consent with the EPA, and today’s amendment will enable operations to continue at the Maui platform during this transitional period,” Dr Smith says.

“There are four petroleum production operations in our EEZ off the coast of Taranaki – including the Maui gas facility – that are crucial to maintaining New Zealand’s oil and gas supply. We could not have any uncertainty over its operations. This small and pragmatic law change made today will ensure operators like STOS can transition to the new regime in a sensible way.”
