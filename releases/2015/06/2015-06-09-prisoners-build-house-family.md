A house built by prisoners has been handed over to a family in need in Northland.

In a first for Northland Region Corrections Facility, prisoners travelled to Dargaville each day to build the house for housing charity Habitat for Humanity.

“This project gave these men skills for sustainable employment,” says Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“Research shows a strong link between employment and offenders remaining crime-free. Getting offenders into stable employment is key to improving the lives of offenders, their families and the community. This will help with our government’s goal to reduce reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The supervised group of prisoners travelled to Dargaville each day and built the house from start to finish.

They also did theory work inside prison. Some have completed Level 1-2 towards the National Certificate in Building, Construction and Allied Trades Skills with NorthTec. This has given the prisoners recognised skills and qualifications they can take to the job market when they are released.

This is the first time prisoners have built a house for Habitat for Humanity outside prison. In 2013 prisoners at NRCF built a house behind the wire for Habitat for Humanity. It was then lifted out of the prison by a crane and taken to Dargaville.

Habitat for Humanity builds and renovates homes for people in housing need in New Zealand and around the world. This is the 40th home Habitat has provided in Northland.

Prisoners at other prisons also contribute to easing social housing shortages.

At Spring Hill Corrections Facility more than 400 prisoners have worked in the refurbishment yard since it opened in 2008. More than 60 new houses and refurbishments have been completed and a further nine are under construction, mainly for Housing NZ.

At Rolleston Prison’s construction yard, five houses from the Christchurch Red Zone have been refurbished for Housing NZ and moved to the community. A further 11 have been completed or are nearing completion.
