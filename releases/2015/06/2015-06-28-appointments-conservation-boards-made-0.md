Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner today announced 41 appointments to the 14 Conservation Boards across New Zealand.

“I want to congratulate each of the community representatives who are being appointed in 2015, particularly the 14 who will serve for the first time. I would also like to thank the outgoing representatives for their contribution to conservation in their region,” Ms Wagner says.

“A third of Conservation Board positions were open for renewal this year. The diverse range of appointees will bring a wide array of knowledge and skills to conservation management in the communities they represent.

“We want to encourage all New Zealanders to get out and enjoy our magnificent country. This year, boards will have a greater focus on promoting recreation opportunities and tourism on conservation land, and enhancing relationships with iwi and hapū.

“Conservation Boards are the link between DOC and the community. They help ensure their region’s voice is heard on conservation issues.

“There were 142 applications for Conservation Board positions. This level of community interest in conservation management is outstanding and I want to thank applicants for their ongoing commitment to conservation in their communities,” Ms Wagner says.

Conservation Board appointments take effect from 1 July. More information about Conservation Boards can be found at: [www.conservationboards.org.nz](http://www.conservationboards.org.nz)
