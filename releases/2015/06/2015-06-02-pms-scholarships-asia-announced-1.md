The first Prime Minister’s Scholarships for 2015 to study at top Asian institutions have been awarded to 140 New Zealand students.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia programme will see just over half of the scholarship students in this round study in China, one of New Zealand’s largest trading partners, while the rest will study in Japan, India, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says it’s important to give our young people a deeper understanding of cultures in countries that are crucial to New Zealand’s future.

“New Zealand’s prosperity is tied into being an open, trading nation that is confident of its position in the Asia-Pacific rim.  New Zealand’s investment in these scholarships will help strengthen our people to people linkages in a region that is increasingly important to New Zealand.”

“These students are the international marketers, the traders, the diplomats, and the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. It is great to see them have the opportunity to understand some of our most important neighbours and their cultures while they are studying.”  

“The experiences these scholarships offer will have an enduring impact on the students involved. Connections made through education can last a lifetime and bring a world of opportunity,” Mr Joyce says. 

The 140 recipients awarded funding in this round are undertaking a diverse range of programmes.

Twelve students from Massey University’s College of Creative Arts will work with students in Shanghai to explore ways to reuse industrial waste in new product lines.

A University of Auckland group plan to focus on disaster prevention, response and recovery in Indonesia and Thailand, while students from Canterbury and Otago universities will immerse themselves in Chinese business and commerce.

“We often talk about young people being the future of the country, and this couldn’t be better illustrated than by these scholarships that will provide the students with new perspectives on global issues affecting our future.”

Funding of $9 million over five years was provided in Budget 2013 for the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia as part of the Government’s Internationally Focused Growth Package.

Applications are now open for the next round of scholarships and close on 30 September 2015. Applications can be made by individuals or groups to Education New Zealand.
