Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith today recognised Fuji Xerox for its efforts to responsibly manage the environmental effects of its products, with the company awarded product accreditation under the Waste Minimisation Act for its Zero Landfill scheme.

“The Zero Landfill scheme from Fuji Xerox is a great example of how forward-thinking businesses can manage and mitigate their impact through proactive product stewardship. The scheme aims to recycle and reuse an estimate 99.5 per cent of Fuji Xerox equipment and products – including printers, copiers, toner bottles, print cartridges, drums, rollers and fuser oil, and packaging –  resulting in approximately 1200 tonnes being diverted from landfill each year,” Dr Smith says.

“Over 80 per cent of the Fuji Xerox equipment and products that is recycled and reused is collected from customers. The equipment and products are returned to the company through product trade-ins, that are then sent to Fuji Xerox warehouses in Wellington, Christchurch or Auckland for assessment, and either reused or recycled from there,” Dr Smith says.

The Zero Landfill Scheme is the 13th scheme to receive accreditation since the Waste Minimisation Act was passed in 2008. The Act gives the Government the ability to award accreditation, which serves as recognition and endorsement for schemes that meet waste and environmental harm reduction criteria.

“Fuji Xerox’s initiative is the second e-waste initiative to receive accreditation, and demonstrates that it is possible for global electronic corporates to voluntarily take responsibility for the impacts of their products in a way that provides benefits for the environment, and also stacks up commercially,” Dr Smith says.

“I commend Fuji Xerox on the effort to make a positive difference, and I encourage other organisations and industries to seek accreditation so they too can receive the environmental and economic benefits of product stewardship.”
