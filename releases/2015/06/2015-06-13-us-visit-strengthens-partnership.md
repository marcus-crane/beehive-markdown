Customs Minister Nicky Wagner says meetings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to discuss border interests and supply chain security, have reinforced Customs strong working relationship with its U.S. counterparts.

“The constructive relationship New Zealand Customs enjoys with USCBP and ICE has increased our border security and supports exporters through our Secure Exports Scheme,” Ms Wagner says.

“Communication links between our respective National Targeting Centres also allows Customs to assess potentially risky cargo and passengers before they reach our shores.

“Customs adopted the USCBP’s ATS-G passenger screening tool last year, which has increased risk profiling capabilities. Funding in Budget 2015 will see this tool being used to screen departing international passengers for security threats such as terrorism and drugs.

“Today’s meetings reinforced our commitment to working closely with U.S. border agencies to protect our borders and foster safe travel between our two countries,” Ms Wagner says.
