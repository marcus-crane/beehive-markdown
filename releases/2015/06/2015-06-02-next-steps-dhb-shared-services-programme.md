Health Minister Jonathan Coleman says Health Benefits Limited (HBL) will be wound up and a new DHB owned company will implement the shared services programme from 1 July 2015.

“It is important to maintain momentum and progress the DHB shared services programmes to ensure substantial savings are freed up from the back office and reinvested into frontline health services,” says Dr Coleman.

“Cabinet has today agreed to the establishment of NZ Health Partnerships Limited which will be equally owned by all DHBs and lead the implementation of the shared services business cases.”

In November 2014, Dr Coleman asked DHBs to put forward a proposal to implement the shared service business cases for finance and procurement, laundry, national IT infrastructure, and food services.  

“HBL led this work through the development phase, and now that we are in the implementation phase, the responsibility best sits with DHBs,” says Dr Coleman.

“The HBL Transition Interim Governance Group has worked through the next steps, including a due diligence process, and all DHBs have approved the final proposal.”

HBL will be wound up by 30 June, and the new company, NZ Health Partnerships Limited, will come into effect from 1 July with transitional governance and management arrangements in place.

HBL and DHBs have achieved over $300 million in savings since HBL was established in July 2010.
