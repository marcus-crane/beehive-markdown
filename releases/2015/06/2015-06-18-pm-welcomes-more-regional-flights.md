Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism John Key has welcomed the announcement by Jetstar that the airline will expand its domestic network to regional New Zealand.

Jetstar announced today that from December it will fly to at least four regional locations, with Hamilton, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Napier, Palmerston North, Nelson and Invercargill among the destinations under consideration.

“Today’s commitment is more good news for New Zealand and for the regions,” says Mr Key.

“This will create jobs, mean cheaper fares and more choice for New Zealanders and our international visitors, and will provide a welcome boost to regional economies.”

Mr Key says the regions are making an important contribution to New Zealand’s economy.

“They’re doing this through a diverse range of industries such as tourism, niche-manufacturing, winemaking, forestry, agriculture and horticulture.

“And the Government is supporting them through important programmes such as ultra-fast broadband, rural broadband and our regional roading programme.

“Extra air links will help connect regional New Zealand with the world and the main centres, making it easier to do business and for Kiwis and tourists to get around the country.”

Last year a record 2.95 million tourists visited New Zealand, spending $7.45 billion - 13 per cent more than the year before - and the Government remains committed to growing those numbers and ensuring the benefits are spread around the country.

Mr Key says New Zealand’s strong economy is giving businesses such as Jetstar the confidence to invest here.

“This is another example of how a growing and vibrant economy is delivering more benefits for Kiwis.”
