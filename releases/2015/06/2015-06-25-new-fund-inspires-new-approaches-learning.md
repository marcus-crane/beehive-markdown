“Forty one projects have won funding worth a total of about $2.6 million in the first round of grants from the Teacher-Led Innovation Fund,” says Education Minister Hekia Parata.

The projects involve more than 80 schools as well as several early childhood centres.

The fund is open to primary and secondary teachers in state and state-integrated kura and schools, one of which is collaborating with neighbouring ECE services. The fund is designed to encourage schools to look at different approaches to learning, particularly for students who are Māori, Pasifika, have special education needs, and/or come from low socio-economic backgrounds.

“The calibre of entries was exciting,” says Ms Parata. “It shows what we already know – that our best teachers are really engaged with students, want to provide them with rich learning opportunities and want to constantly improve their own teaching practice.”

Ten million dollars has been set aside in the fund for allocation over the next three years.

Ms Parata says schools whose applications were unsuccessful have received feedback on their applications which will help them re-apply for the next funding round which opens in November.

**Notes:**

Names of successful schools will be available once funding agreements have been signed.
