Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Jo Goodhew has announced the appointment of a new member to the independent Charities Registration Board, and confirmed the reappointments of Chair Roger Miller and Board member Caren Rangi.

Appointed for a three-year term, Simon Karipa is a Wellington-based barrister and solicitor. He will join Roger Miller, who has been reappointed as Chair for a three-year term, and Caren Rangi, reappointed for a one-year term.

“I am delighted to welcome Simon Karipa to the Board,” says Mrs Goodhew. “He is very knowledgeable about the sector, and is joining a Board that has a considerable experience and passion for the charitable sector, which has proved invaluable in their analysis of the complex issues involved in charities law.

“Registration as a charity is not a simple ‘rubber-stamping’ exercise, but a carefully-considered process, which enables the public to feel trust and confidence when making donations or volunteering for registered charities.”

“I would also like to acknowledge outgoing board member Ms Kirikaiahi Mahutariki, whose contribution has been extremely valuable during the establishment of the independent Charities Registration Board.”

**Notes:**

Roger Miller is a solicitor and is a specialist in trust law and governance. He also chairs the Scots College Foundation, the Porirua City Council Community Services Board, and the Performing Arts Foundation of Wellington.

Caren Rangi is a chartered accountant with considerable experience working with community organisations.  She is a Ministerial appointee to two Crown entities and a community trust, and is the current National President of PACIFICA Inc.

Simon Karipa is currently General Counsel for Te Ohu Kaimoana (the Māori Fisheries Trust) and has previously held roles with several iwi organisations.  He has also held a range of governance roles, including currently being a Court-appointed Alternate Trustee to the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. 

The independent Charities Registration Board makes decisions about charity registration and deregistration based on applicable charity law.
