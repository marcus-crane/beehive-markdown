The volunteers behind a project to improve the lives of Cook Islanders living in Auckland have been recognised for their work this National Volunteer Week.

“I congratulate the Takitumu Cultural and Arts Society on the successful completion of their community development scheme project,” says Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

The Takitumu Cultural and Arts Society’s three-year project aimed to improve outcomes for Auckland’s Cook Islands population.

The Cook Islands Development and Action plan, named Akirata Ou or New Dawn, was launched at the inaugural Akirata Ou Festival in 2013. The two-day festival was also held last year and it is hoped this celebration of Cook Islands culture will become an annual event.

“I am excited to see how Akirata Ou grows over time. I am happy to see what many thought was impossible become a reality,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

Other initiatives developed during the project include the oneCOMMUNITY S.H.E.D. (social human economic development) Social Innovation Centre project which supports community-led start-up enterprises.

“This project aims to generate income, jobs and build sustainability for Cook Islands families and their communities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

The oneCHILD initiative, to provide early childhood education for Cook Islands children, recently received Ministry of Education funding to open its first centre.

The Cook Islands oneAWARDS have also been set up to recognise the achievements of Cook Islanders across New Zealand.

“It is initiatives like this, and the volunteers who drive them, that make our country special. I would like to congratulate all those who have been involved in these worthy community projects,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

National Volunteer Week runs from 21-27 June and is co-ordinated by Volunteering New Zealand.
