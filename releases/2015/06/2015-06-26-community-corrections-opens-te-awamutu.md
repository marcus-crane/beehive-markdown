Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially opened the refurbished Te Awamutu Community Corrections site.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the improvements will benefit staff, visitors and the community-based offenders who report there.

One of the key features of the refurbishment is the reception counter which has anti-climb features and is overlooked by staff in an open plan work area for increased visibility and security.

The $1.5 million refurbishment included extending the original building, upgrading security and technology and improving the community work area.

“This fit-for-purpose site will help achieve our government’s goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

A total of 14 staff work for Te Awamutu Community Corrections, including six based in Te Kuiti. The site manages 158 offenders on 184 sentences and orders, including home detention and community work.

Corrections manages offenders to ensure they comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of reoffending, minimise their risk to others and help them become productive and contributing members of society.
