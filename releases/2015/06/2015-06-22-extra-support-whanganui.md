Social Development Minister Anne Tolley has announced extra support for Whanganui after extensive flooding over the weekend.

“I’ve activated Enhanced Task Force Green (ETFG), a temporary employment programme which will employ local beneficiaries to help with the clean-up operation,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Whanganui and the surrounding areas have been hit hard by severe flooding and the Government is pitching in with additional support for the flooded region.”

ETFG will cover wages for workers and supervisors employed by local councils to help with the clean-up operation in areas where there is too much damage for local councils to manage alone.

Beneficiaries in the area will help in cleaning debris and repairing damaged property, fences and infrastructure.

“The damage appears extensive and I’m certain the extra hands will be a welcome relief,” Mrs Tolley says.

At this stage up to $250,000 would be made available for the Taskforce which would cover four clean-up teams working for 14 weeks.

“Work is underway to assess clean-up requirements and have the teams available as quickly as possible, and support may increase as more assessments on the recovery are completed,” Mrs Tolley says.

“Additional Hardship support is available through Work and Income for those in need and I encourage people affected by the storms to get in touch to see what assistance they may be eligible for.”
