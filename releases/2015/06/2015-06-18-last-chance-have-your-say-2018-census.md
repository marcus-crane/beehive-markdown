Statistics Minister Craig Foss is again urging New Zealanders to share their views on 2018 Census content.

The consultation process includes online submissions and a discussion forum — a first for Statistics New Zealand. 

“It’s been great to see hundreds of New Zealanders going online to discuss and debate what really matters to them,” Mr Foss says.

“I encourage anyone who hasn’t done so already to go online and have their say before the consultation process ends on 30 June.

“Delivering better online services is a key focus of the Government’s Better Public Services programme.

“I hope to see more and more online consultation across the public sector.  Statistics NZ’s move to online consultation shows it’s focused on ensuring the census meets New Zealanders’ needs in the 21st century.”

Statistics NZ aims to publish a summary report of the consultation process by the end of 2015, with a final report published in 2017.

Online consultation and formal submission forms are available at: [www.stats.govt.nz](http://www.stats.govt.nz)
