Corrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga today officially opened the refurbished Taupō Community Corrections site.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the improvements will benefit staff, visitors and community-based offenders who report there.

One of the key features of the refurbishment is the reception counter which has anti-climb features and is overlooked by staff in the open plan work area for increased visibility and security. 

The $1.7 million refurbishment included extending the original building, upgrading security and technology and an improved community work area.

“This fit-for-purpose site will help with our government’s goal of reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

A total of 17 staff work from Taupō Community Corrections, including two who work part-time from Turangi.  The site manages 294 offenders on 351 sentences and orders, including home detention and community work.

Corrections manages offenders to ensure they comply with their sentences and orders, reduce their likelihood of reoffending, minimise their risk to others and help them become productive and contributing members of society.
