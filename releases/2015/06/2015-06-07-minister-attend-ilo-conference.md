Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Woodhouse will travel to Geneva, Switzerland to represent the New Zealand Government at this year’s International Labour Conference on 8-9 June 2015.

“New Zealand has a positive and constructive relationship with the ILO and I look forward to this year’s conference,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“It is a great opportunity to share insights with my ministerial counterparts and ILO officials on our experiences in the Workplace Relations and Safety and Immigration portfolios.”

Mr Woodhouse will address the plenary session of the Conference, outlining the achievements of New Zealand’s employment relations system, progress made in combatting migrant exploitation, health and safety reforms, and New Zealand's intended ratification of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006.

While in Geneva, Mr Woodhouse will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts to discuss a range of topics including migrant worker rights, workplace relations frameworks and health and safety reforms.

Prior to the conference, Mr Woodhouse travelled to Hong Kong and London where he had a number of beneficial meetings across all three of his ministerial portfolios.
