Transport Minister Simon Bridges has welcomed the release of the largest National Land Transport Programme in New Zealand’s history.

The programme is developed by the NZ Transport Agency every three years to give effect to the Government’s transport priorities which are set out in the [Government Policy Statement on Land Transport](http://www.transport.govt.nz/ourwork/keystrategiesandplans/gpsonlandtransportfunding/gps2015/).

“The $13.9 billion dollar programme represents the largest ever spend on land transport over a three year period and is a 15 per cent funding increase on the last three year period.

“The programme will deliver on the Government’s priorities of increasing economic growth and productivity, improving safety, strengthening regional transport networks, lifting investment in public transport and cycling and ensuring value for money.

“The programme will make smart investments that will continue to drive economic development and productivity and ensure New Zealanders have the safe, reliable and efficient transport system they need and deserve,” Mr Bridges says.

- $6.3 billion is planned for investment in the State highway network over the next three years.
- $4 billion is planned for investment in local roads – a 6 percent increase.
- Almost $2 billion is planned for spending on public transport – a 21 percent increase.
- Investment in cycling will more than triple, to $251 million.
- $4.2 billion is planned for investment in Auckland’s transport system and services.

“The programme is nationally consistent and regionally responsive. It ensures the development of our transport systems across the regions with strong links in and across our major cities,” Mr Bridges says.
