Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye acknowledges Wanganui District Council declaring a state of local emergency this afternoon before flooding threatens homes.

“I have spoken with Mayor Annette Main and offered support if needed,” says Ms Kaye.

“The Mayor declared a state of local emergency to enable about 100 people living near the Whanganui River to be evacuated.

"I have been told the river is expected to flood nearby houses, and it was important for people's safety that they evacuate as soon as possible.

“I’ve been advised that civil defence emergency management responders, including emergency services and the army, are supporting the evacuation.

“The Council is helping coordinate appropriate accommodation for people, and along with emergency services is providing advice through the news media and other channels.

“It is most important that people evacuate if asked, and follow direction and advice from agencies.

"Civil defence emergency management and emergency services in the district are responding well and have good local knowledge. The District Council is leading the response and knows support is available should it be needed.

“The Manawatu-Wanganui Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Group is coordinating across all the councils and emergency services in the region.

“The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management (MCDEM) is monitoring the situation and is ready to coordinate support from other CDEM Groups to support the local CDEM group if necessary as the situation evolves.

“I will be regularly briefed throughout the night. My thoughts are with everyone affected. Agencies will be working hard to help local residents through this.”
