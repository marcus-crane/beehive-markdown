Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has announced the two winners of the 2015 Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA) - World Farmer Organisation Study Tour in Argentina later this year.

Doug Avery and Zach Mounsey have been selected as winners by a panel including Mr Guy and Associate Primary Industries Minister Jo Goodhew after giving presentations at Fieldays this year.

“The purpose of this study tour is to increase global understanding and engagement on agricultural greenhouse gas research. These two winners will have an important role as ambassadors for New Zealand in sharing environmental management practices that support sustainable productivity.

“This is an important part of New Zealand’s role in supporting the Global Research Alliance, which helps countries to understand, measure and mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions from their agricultural sectors.

“Last year New Zealand hosted a study tour for farmers from Poland, Argentina and Canada who visited New Zealand to study farm management systems and new practices that reduce environmental impacts.

“This year Argentina has agreed to host farmers from New Zealand to continue this sharing of information and expertise.

“I’m proud of New Zealand’s leadership role in helping the world meet a growing demand for food in an environmentally responsible way,” says Mr Guy.

A technical assessment panel of MPI staff selected the shortlisted applicants through work they submitted on their ability to communicate examples of on-farm innovation which support production and environmental objectives.  The focus was on reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity, and on approaches which have international relevance.
