Pacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has congratulated all the winners in last night’s Vodafone Pacific Music Awards.

“The Vodafone Pacific Music Awards night is one of the biggest events in our calendar. It is a chance for the music and Pacific communities to come together to celebrate the talent and success of our Pacific musicians,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Pacific people have a huge influence on the New Zealand music scene. This music connects us to our roots as Pacific people and to each other. New Zealand’s culture is enriched by the music being made and played by these gifted people.”

From industry veterans such as Cydel and Herbs to newcomers Erakah and Donell Lewis, all the musicians at last night’s celebration affirm the energy and creativity of our Pacific people.

“Music has always been an important means of communication for Pacific cultures and this oral tradition continues in the music of these artists,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
