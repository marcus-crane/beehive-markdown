Trade Minister Tim Groser departs today for Peru to attend the Pacific Alliance Summit in Paracas, Peru from 1-3 July.

New Zealand is an observer member of the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American regional integration grouping established in 2011 with four member states - Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. 

“My focus at the Summit will be to explore ways to deepen New Zealand’s economic engagement with the Pacific Alliance, whose members represent collectively more than one third of Latin America’s GDP.  I will also engage with the Alliance on themes such as innovation, education, trade facilitation and entrepreneurship.” Mr Groser says.

While in Paracas, Mr Groser will also hold bilateral meetings with counterparts from within the Asia Pacific region to discuss bilateral and regional issues.
