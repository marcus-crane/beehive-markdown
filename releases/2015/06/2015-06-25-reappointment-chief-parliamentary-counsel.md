Attorney-General Christopher Finlayson today announced the reappointment of David Noble as Chief Parliamentary Counsel to 6 May 2016.

“Mr Noble’s reappointment will provide consistent leadership to this important role,” Mr Finlayson said.

Under Mr Noble’s leadership the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) has delivered significant programmes such as the New Zealand Legislation system website and database and has led the team drafting the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act 2010. He also delivered the Pacific Island desk which addresses legislative backlogs and a lack of legislative drafting resources in the Pacific Islands.

“Mr Noble has performed remarkably in this role to date,” Mr Finlayson said. “His reappointment ensures that PCO will continue to benefit from his specialised experience and expertise.”

The Chief Parliamentary Counsel is the principal advisor to the Government and Parliament in their legislative capacities and the Chief Executive of PCO. The Chief Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for ensuring that PCO provides high quality legislative drafting services and advice to the Government and Parliament.

In addition, the Chief Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for ensuring that New Zealand legislation is effective, accessible and based on sound legal principles.
