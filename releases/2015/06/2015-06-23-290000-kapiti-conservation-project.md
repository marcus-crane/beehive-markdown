The Government is providing a $290,000 Community Environment Fund grant for a project aimed at protecting and restoring biodiversity on the Kapiti Coast, Environment Minister Dr Nick Smith announced today.

“This funding for Friends of Queen Elizabeth Park (Kapiti) Trust will be used to restore local biodiversity and protect important flora and fauna. The Trust will work with the local community to build penguin nesting boxes, improve habitats for skinks, lizards and weta, propagate and plant rare dune plants, increase fish and insect populations in streams, and carry out pest control.” Dr Smith says.

“The project combines scientific advice with community enthusiasm. It will run for three years, during which time it will collect valuable data that can then be used to better understand the local environment.

“New Zealand is lucky to have many rare and unique native plants and animals, and accordingly it is important that we look after what makes our country special.

“I commend the Friends of Queen Elizabeth Park (Kapiti) Trust, as well as other groups active in the community including Nga Ururoa, the Nga Manu Trust and the Whareroa Guardians for their hard work and ongoing commitment to protecting and restoring Kapiti’s biodiversity.

“This is the latest initiative funded by the Government’s Community Environment Fund, which supports community groups around the country to put in place practical initiatives to protect and improve our environment, and increase community-based advice, educational opportunities, and public awareness on environmental issues.”
