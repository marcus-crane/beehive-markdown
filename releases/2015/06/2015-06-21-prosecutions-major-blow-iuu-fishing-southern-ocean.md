Foreign Minister Murray McCully today hailed the action taken by Spain against those responsible for illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing as giant step forward in the fight to protect the Southern Ocean.

“New Zealand strongly supports the Spanish Government's decision to bring a prosecution against Spanish fishing companies and associated IUU vessels, including the three found fishing in the Southern Ocean in January,” Mr McCully says.   

"According to Spanish authorities, prosecutions will be laid against companies and individuals responsible for four CCAMLR IUU fishing vessels (Kunlun, Yongding, Songhua and Tiantai) associated with the Vidal Armadores syndicate.  

"Action will also be taken against 50 Spanish crew; shell companies linked to these operations; and, companies involved in the supply and distribution of catch, or provision of services to these vessels or operators.  

“While it is too early to declare victory, these prosecutions are a major step and the product of unprecedented levels of cooperation between a range of Governments since January.

"Five of the seven vessels that have regularly fished in the southern Ocean over the past five years have been detained this year, and a further one has sunk. 

“New Zealand is committed to doing its part to protect the Southern Ocean and we will assist in every way to deter IUU fishing and stop those responsible,” Mr McCully says.
