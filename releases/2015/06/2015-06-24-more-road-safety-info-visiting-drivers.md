Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss is welcoming an initiative to provide road safety messages to every visitor from China travelling on a general visitor visa.

“Record numbers of Chinese tourists are travelling to New Zealand — 310,000 last year alone.  Many are opting to self-drive and it’s important we help them do so safely,” Mr Foss says.

The ‘Driving Safely in New Zealand’ leaflet is a joint initiative by the Ministry of Transport, New Zealand Transport Agency, New Zealand Police, Tourism New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Chinese Embassy.

“The leaflet, part of an ongoing body of work focussing on the safety of visiting drivers, will be distributed with every approved visa.   This is yet another way to spread the road safety message to this key tourism market,” Mr Foss says.

“Whether borrowing, buying or renting a vehicle in New Zealand, the leaflet contains important information on road safety and local conditions.

“Of course, every country wants its citizens to be safe when travelling abroad.  I recently met representatives from the United States, United Kingdom, Australian, German and Chinese embassies to discuss how best to educate and inform visitors from their countries.  I was pleased to see many already have measures in place. For example, the UK includes road safety information on its travel advisory website

“As well as educating and informing drivers, we’re making changes to road infrastructure — this means more centre-line rumble strips, keep left arrows and no passing lines.

“The Tourism Industry Association and Rental Vehicle Association are also developing a range of resources, including a code of practice for rental vehicle companies.

“Together, these improvements will help make the roads safer for everyone,” Mr Foss says.
