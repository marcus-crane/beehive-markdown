Associate Social Development Minister Jo Goodhew has announced the appointment of Board Member Mr Len Cook as the Families Commissioner and Chair of the Families Commission (Superu) Board.

“Mr Cook has already provided excellent service in his role as expert advisor to the Superu Board since 2013 and I am extremely pleased to have him continue in his new capacity,” says Mrs Goodhew.

“As a specialist in the use of statistics and social science research, and with his experience working with the Board, Mr Cook’s leadership will bring great value to Superu.”

Mr Cook has previously held the role of Acting Chief Executive for the Families Commission. He will take up the role of Chair on 1 July.

“I would also like to thank interim Chair Jo-anne Wilkinson who has done a fantastic job over the past eight months, and I am delighted that she has agreed to continue on as deputy-Chair,” says Mrs Goodhew.

The Families Commission has been operating as Superu – Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit since December 2014.
