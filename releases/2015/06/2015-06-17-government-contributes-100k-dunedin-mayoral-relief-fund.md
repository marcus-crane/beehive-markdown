Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye announced today that the government will contribute $100,000 to the Mayoral Relief Fund to support people affected by the recent Dunedin flooding.

“In 24 hours from 3 June, Dunedin received a record 177mm of rain, which caused flooding in South Dunedin and surrounding areas, as well as landslides,” says Ms Kaye.

“This fund has been set up by the Dunedin City Council, which has contributed $150,000. The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management has worked with the Council to contribute to the fund.

“I’ve been told that Council staff and volunteers have visited around 6000 properties. Flood water has affected around 1250 properties, and to date there have been around 45 applications for support, but more are expected.

“The focus of the Mayoral Relief Fund is supporting residents unable to get help from other avenues, such as insurance, to get back into clean, dry homes.

“Examples of what the relief funds can be used for include essential furniture and fittings, heating, temporary accommodation, one-off medical costs and establishment fees for phone connections.

“People affected by the flood can also seek assistance from the Ministry of Social Development.

“As well as its contribution towards the Relief Fund, the government will assist the Dunedin Council with response and recovery costs incurred during and after the flooding, as is usual practice following an emergency.

“We will also consider providing more support if there’s a significant increase in applications from people needing help.

“There will be families who are feeling the financial impact on top of the emotional experience of dealing with the floods, and we want to help those families through this.”

The public can donate to the Relief Fund via the Westpac account 03 0905 0184000 18, or by using donation boxes at Westpac Bank branches in Dunedin. There will also be a street appeal in Dunedin on Friday 19 June.

People seeking assistance from the Mayoral Relief Fund should contact the Dunedin City Council on 03 477 4000.
