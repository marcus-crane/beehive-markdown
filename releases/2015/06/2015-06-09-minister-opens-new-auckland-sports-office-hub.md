Sport and Recreation Minister Jonathan Coleman has today officially opened Sport Central – a new sports office hub in Auckland which will see five sports organisations work more closely together.

The project has been led by Sport New Zealand, who will be joined in the new hub by Triathlon New Zealand, Hockey New Zealand, Aktive – Auckland Sport and Recreation, and College Sport Auckland.

“Sport Central will enable a range of sports organisations to work more collaboratively, to share resources and to help ensure that sport and recreation in Auckland is well planned and supported,” says Dr Coleman.

“With an increased presence in Auckland, the new sports hub will also help Sport NZ foster stronger connections with key strategic partners such as Aktive, Auckland Council, Auckland Tourism, and ATEED.

“With one third of New Zealand’s population living in Auckland, it is important to encourage people into active, healthy lifestyles.

“I welcome Aktive’s ambition to make Auckland the world’s most active city. We know that active communities are healthier, happier and more productive.”

Dr Coleman officially opened Sport Central, Mount Eden, with Peter Miskimmin, CEO Sport NZ.
