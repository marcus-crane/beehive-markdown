Small Business Minister Craig Foss will travel to Melbourne tomorrow to attend the 28th Annual Small Enterprise Association of Australia and New Zealand (SEAANZ) conference.

“Small business is the backbone of the New Zealand economy.  SEAANZ is an important platform for researchers, educators, policy makers and practitioners to develop and share ideas,” Mr Foss says.

“The New Zealand SME Research Hub — launched last year — was a product of earlier SEAANZ discussions with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 

“I’m interested in finding out more about Australian initiatives and sharing New Zealand’s progress on the Business Growth Agenda and Better for Business programmes.

“I’m also looking forward to catching up with Bruce Billson, Australia’s Small Business Minister, and meeting the Victorian Small Business Commissioner.”

While in Melbourne, Mr Foss will also meet Senator Michael Ronaldson and the Honourable Kelly O’Dwyer, his Australian counterparts in the Veterans’ Affairs and Statistics portfolios.
