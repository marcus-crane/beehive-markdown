The major redevelopment of the Auckland War Memorial Museum will be able to get underway with the passing of the Auckland War Memorial Museum Site Empowering Bill in Parliament today, says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

The Bill repeals the Auckland Institute and Museum Site Empowering Act 1918 and replaces it with this new legislation allowing the lease of land within the Auckland Domain for the purposes of the Auckland War Memorial Museum and for extensions to the Museum.

“The Auckland War Memorial Museum is undertaking a significant expansion and redevelopment project to meet the needs of the people of Auckland, of all New Zealanders, and of the over 70,000 school students and 250,000 international tourists who visit the Museum each year,” said Judith Tizard.

“When completed, the Museum will have much needed and improved collection and visitor amenities, befitting its role as one of New Zealand’s most important cultural institutions and Auckland’s major war memorial.

“The Auckland Museum is a key component in our country’s cultural framework and the passage of this Bill is the final step to enable the project to proceed.”

The government is contributing to the redevelopment project through a Regional Museums Fund contribution of $26.5million over 5 years, which is half of the total cost. The expansion project is scheduled to commence on October 1 2003 and open to the public in late 2005.

Judith Tizard thanked the Government Administration Select Committee for their prompt and thorough work on the Bill. She also expressed thanks for the full support for the Bill from all parties in the House.

“I also want to congratulate the Auckland Memorial Trust Board, the staff of the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and everybody involved in the Museum redevelopment project for their passion and commitment towards one of New Zealand’s most significant cultural assets,” said Judith Tizard.
