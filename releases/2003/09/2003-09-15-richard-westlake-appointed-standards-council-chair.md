Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced the appointment of Richard Westlake to the Standards Council as Chair for a three-year term.

Richard Westlake replaces John Belgrave who resigned to take up his new position as Chief Ombudsman.

”Richard is a highly experienced director and chair and has worked in both the public and private sectors. He brings particular strategic management skills to this position. He is experienced at the implementation of standards through his role in assisting the MetService to become the world’s first meteorological service to achieve ISO 9001 certification, gained as part of a strategy to grow a sustainable competitive advantage. His wide corporate governance experience includes his being the Chair and non-executive director of Quotable Value New Zealand Ltd and an independent Director of Kiwibank Ltd,“ Lianne Dalziel said.

“This is an important appointment and I am pleased that Richard is able to take up this position. Former chair John Belgrave set a high benchmark and I am confident that Richard is well placed to step up to the mark.

His appointment is particularly timely given the current discussions between Standards New Zealand and Standards Australia in relation to a Memorandum of Understanding and the importance that New Zealand places on the continuing development of joint trans-Tasman standards,” Lianne Dalziel said.
