Housing Minister Steve Maharey says he is gobsmacked by criticism of the government’s state housing policy today from National’s housing spokesperson Wayne Mapp.

Dr Mapp this afternoon criticised the length of the state housing waiting list – despite the fact that his own party sold a greater number of houses in government during the 1990s.

Steve Maharey said income-related rents has been a hugely succesful policy, providing quality, affordable housing to New Zealand’s poorest families.

“Wayne Mapp’s crocodile tears about the state house waiting list are really gauling.

“National sold 13,000 houses during the 1990s – enough to fully house all those currently on the state house waiting list.

“The government has reintroduced a social allocation system for state housing and stopped the sales. This ensures that those most in need of housing get it first – and that the overall stock numbers rise each year so we can house more and more low-income New Zealanders.

“National has signalled again it wants to privatise state housing. This is a recipe for social disaster.

“The current government is working with property developers to build and lease housing, as well as building more houses to add to HNZC’s core housing stock. We are also assisting those paying market rents to purchase their own home to free up state houses for those in greater need.

“Privatising state housing is ideological madness,” Steve Maharey said.
