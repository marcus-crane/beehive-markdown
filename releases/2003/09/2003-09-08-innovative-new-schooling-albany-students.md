A new junior secondary school for students from years 7 - 10 is being established as part of an exciting new development in Albany to meet increasing population growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“This is the first junior high school planned and constructed as a new facility, and I am convinced that this new and different approach to the provision of education in the Albany area will bring significant benefits to future middle and senior school students,” Trevor Mallard said.

Students moving on from the junior high school will be catered for at a new senior high school, which will also be established in Albany, ready to enrol students when they graduate from the junior high school.

The Ministry of Education is currently working with Massey University on a proposal to develop a senior high school in association with the Albany campus of the university.

“This could open up enormous opportunities for senior secondary students, effectively blurring the line between secondary and tertiary education. I’m looking forward to hearing about a range of innovative suggestions for education as this work gets under way," Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard congratulated Albany schools on the collaborative and visionary way they had worked together and with the Ministry of Education to develop a long-term plan for schooling in the area.

“I’d like to thank all parents, boards of trustees, and local community groups who participated in the consultation process and I believe the establishment of this school will be welcomed by local parents."

The new school, scheduled to open in Appleby Road at the beginning of 2005, will enrol form 1 (year 7) students is 2005, with another year level to be added each year thereafter.

The opening facilities will be built for a roll of 840 increasing to 1400 students once the school is fully established.

“An establishment board of trustees will be appointed this week, and will ensure the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community," Trevor Mallard said.

The establishment board appoints the principal, who will have overall planning responsibility for both the junior and secondary school, and other staff, as well as determining school policy, sound governance practices and contributing to the school design. This board will be in place until a new school board is elected, usually within six months of the school opening.
