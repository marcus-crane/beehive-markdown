Local Government Minister Chris Carter has announced that there are no legal grounds to order a review of the Auckland Regional Council as requested by David Thornton of the Glenfield Ratepayers and Residents Association.

"I have examined this issue and I have found that the ARC's decisions do not amount to significant mismanagement and therefore I cannot appoint a review authority to examine its affairs.

"Clearly, the ARC has made an unpopular decision about the way it sets its rates but this does not amount to mismanagement under the law and I cannot pretend that it does so," Mr Carter said.

"I know that this will be frustrating for Aucklanders who feel strongly about the ARC but the law is written this way to preserve the integrity of the local democracies that we have in New Zealand.

"Councils are elected by local people to make decisions on their behalf. There is no point in having elected councils if ministers can intervene whenever a section of a community does not like a decision a council makes. Parliament has consistently recognised this in the legislation it has passed relating to local government. I am bound by that legislation.

"In making this decision I have considered advice from the Department of Internal Affairs. I am happy to make this advice publicly available," Mr Carter said.

Before the minister can appoint a review authority to examine a local authority's affairs the Local Government Act requires:

a)that there has been a significant or persistent failure by the local authority to meet its obligations under this Act or any other enactment; or  
b)that there has been significant and identifiable mismanagement of the resources of the local authority; or  
c)that there is a significant and identifiable deficiency in the management or decision-making processes of the local authority.
