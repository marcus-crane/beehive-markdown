Minister of Tourism Mark Burton is welcoming the results of Statistic New Zealand’s latest Accommodation Survey, saying that it is another indicator that the tourism sector is on the road to recovery.

The survey shows a one percent increase in total guest nights for July 2003 in comparison to July 2002.

“This is excellent news indeed—a welcome indicator that New Zealand’s tourism sector is alive and well,” said Mark Burton.

“These results are particularly welcome in light of the release this week of the Tourism Research Council New Zealand’s (TRCNZ) 2003 - 2009 forecasts, which showed that tourism yield is growing at nearly double the rate of visitor numbers. In other words, our guests are staying longer and spending more.

“The sector has just held its annual Tourism Conference, where industry representatives met to plan for what some expect to be the largest summer season New Zealand has ever seen.

“Last month’s External Migration survey also indicated that visitor arrivals are steadily improving, and that the industry is still on track to end the year in positive growth mode.

“New Zealand’s tourism sector already generates close to ten percent of New Zealand’s GDP, is directly and indirectly responsible for one in eleven jobs, supports over 15,000 businesses, and is one of our largest earners of foreign exchange.

“The results of today’s Accommodation Survey are a clear indication that the industry’s future is sound, and that the sector will continue to contribute strongly to the New Zealand economy.”
