Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Putaruru area, a move that will unlock nearly $4.9 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

“I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project.

“I now hope that schools and their communities will put their energy into working towards the best use of the resources that the review will release. This re-organisation of schools is about ensuring local students continue to receive quality education well into the future.

“Using current estimates, $2.4 million in operational funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements. There will be a fund of nearly $700,000 for schools to use jointly, and $1.8 million of extra property funding will be available,” Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
·The retention of Te Waotu, Tirau and Lichfield Primary Schools;

·The merger of Putaruru Intermediate and Putaruru High School on the High School site with the Putaruru Intermediate School board of trustees governing the new school until new elections are held; and

·The merger of Cambridge St, Oraka Heights, Putaruru West and Puketurua-Arapuni schools on the Intermediate school site, with the Putaruru West board of trustees governing the new school until new elections are held.

“The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

“The Ministry of Education will ensure there are enough quality buildings to meet schooling needs on the Putaruru High School site and will investigate options. It will report to me once those investigations are completed.

“The ministry will also be working closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year,” Trevor Mallard said.
