Chat Live On Line to John Tamihere tonight at 6pm.

For the first time, people will be able to text questions as part of Labour's ongoing online chat sessions. Chat was established in July on the youthsite www.headsup.co.nz to give people greater access to Cabinet Ministers and to encourage participation in the political process. The monthly sessions have proved popular and John will be online tonight ready to answer questions relating to his youth affairs, small business, and Associate Maori Affairs portfolio responsibilities.  
To CHAT ONLINE just go to to http://pmchat.01.co.nz/ and register to chat and then join the chat between 6 and 7pm today, Wednesday 17 September.  
To CHAT BY TXT, all you need to do is enter CHAT before your question and send it to 5227 \[LABR].  
EXAMPLE: chat \[space] followed by your question.
