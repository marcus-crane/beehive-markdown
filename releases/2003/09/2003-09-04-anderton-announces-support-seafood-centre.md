Nelson's proposed seafood centre for excellence is to receive support from New Zealand Trade & Enterprise, Regional Development Minister and Progressive leader, Jim Anderton, said today.

The Nelson Tasman Regional Partnership Group is to receive $1.5 million towards the development of the centre that will consist of education, research and business facilities related to the seafood industry.

The investment will be made under New Zealand Trade & Enterprises' Regional Partnership Programme.

"This is a significant step for the future of the seafood industry both in the top of the South Island and nationally," Jim Anderton said.

"The centre will allow better-targeted and coordinated research and development, specialised education that will support the development of the sector and it will improve the commercialisation of intellectual property in seafood," the Progressive leader added.

"In the long term, it should mean more internationally competitive seafood businesses that will increase wealth in the region and help to expand this sector nationally," Jim Anderton said.

The centre is estimated to cost $18 million in total and is supported by the Nelson Marlborough Seafood Cluster, a group that includes Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough seafood and aquaculture businesses, Cawthron Institute, Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, Canterbury University and Otago University.

The centre will be located in Nelson, New Zealand's largest fishing port and it is designed to actively and practically promote further development of the seafood industry in the Nelson and Marlborough regions as well as nationwide.

The Nelson Tasman Regional Partnership Group comprises representatives of the Nelson City and Tasman District councils, Nelson Marlborough Seafood Cluster and local businesses.
