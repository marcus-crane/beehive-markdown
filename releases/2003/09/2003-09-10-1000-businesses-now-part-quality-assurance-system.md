The Royal Albatross Centre on Dunedin’s Otago Peninsula today became the 1000th business to sign up to Qualmark, the tourism industry’s official quality assurance system.

Minister of Tourism Mark Burton, who presented the Centre with a Qualmark certificate, said that the Qualmark system is offering visitors a comprehensive choice of quality operators in all regions and across all sectors.

“Visitors’ quality assessment begins when they first investigate New Zealand as a holiday destination, perhaps via the web, and ends long after the visit is over. There must be a close match between the promise made in marketing material and the products delivered.

“The challenge for the industry is to ensure that the tourism sector meets or exceeds our visitors’ expectations every single time. The Qualmark licensing system is the mechanism the industry uses to determine if operators are export-ready and to provide business improvement feedback.

“More and more operators are realising the value of the system as a capability-building tool, enhancing both business development and competitive edge. For operators, the Qualmark system offers increased credibility, enhanced visibility, and improved profitability.

“I commend the Royal Albatross Centre and all other tourism businesses that have demonstrated their commitment to quality by becoming licensed to use the Qualmark. It is these operators that are helping to build New Zealand’s reputation as a world class visitor destination.”
