Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today released details of actions taken by the Environmental Risk Management Authority on the 49 recommendations made in the Capability Review earlier this year.

The review, conducted by a three person panel headed by Graeme Nahkies, former chief executive of Environment Waikato and Hutt Valley Health Ltd, found that ERMA had the capability to do its job and recommended ways to strengthen the authority's performance.

"In response to the review the chairperson, Neil Walter, initiated a high level organisational review covering management and governance structures and systems," Marian Hobbs said. "These findings are now being implemented and will be completed by the end of October.

"ERMA is expanding its public awareness programme and strengthening its relationship with stakeholders. I will be appointing new members to strengthen Authority capability and the agency is now engaged in upskilling staff in certain areas and ensuring recruitment is more strategic.

"The review panel was clear that the Authority contained a good cross-section of the necessary skills and experience. The 49 recommendations were about strengthening management structures and systems. I am confident that as a result of the external and internal reviews and actions taken, ERMA is ready and fully capable to carry out its statutory functions when the moratorium ends, allowing applications for the release of GM organisms to be considered."

ACTION TAKEN ON RECOMMENDATIONS  
OF CAPABILITY REVIEW TEAM: AUGUST 2003  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

GOVERNANCE  
Recommendation 1:  
That it be clarified that Ngâ Kaihautû Tikanga Taiao (Ngâ Kaihautû) is an advisory committee of the Authority; a subordinate component of the governance structure of ERMA.

Action  
This represents the situation at the time of the review. Opportunities to clarify the relationship between the Authority and Ngâ Kaihautû were taken at the Mâori network hui in June and at recent meetings of consultative groups. Material is also being published in Te Putara and Perspective. The provisions of the NOOM Bill will require some changes to be made to the existing terms of reference for Nga Kaihautu, and work is already underway on this exercise

Recommendation 2:  
That the Authority take responsibility for appointing the chairperson of Ngâ Kaihautû.

Action  
No action required. This was the situation at the time of the capability review.

Recommendation 3:  
That the chairperson of Ngâ Kaihautû be invited to be present at Authority ‘governance’ meetings but not be considered a ‘Member’ of the Authority for such purposes.

Action  
No action required. This was the practice at the time of the review and is being maintained. The Chair of Nga Kaihautu has a standing invitation to be present at all Authority meetings.

Recommendation 4:  
That the membership of the Audit Committee be reviewed to support the specialised role that it has to play.

Action  
No further action required - membership already includes an external financial/audit specialist.

Recommendation 5:  
That the Authority review (and possibly extend) its definition of the governance component of its responsibilities.

Action  
A number of actions have been taken to strengthen the Authority's governance role, in line with the report’s recommendations. They include a reallocation of responsibilities between the Authority and the Board, a stronger focus on governance duties and a restructuring of the Authority’s Standing Committees. Further work is now being done, based on the recommendations of the Institute of Directors' adviser, on the establishment of a formal Register of Interests, Board Charter and annual work plan. A major strategic planning exercise is now in its final stages, and work has been completed on the Chief Executive's performance agreement for the current year.

Recommendation 6:  
That the Authority adopt a more active and systematic approach to the performance management of the Chief Executive.

Action  
Action completed. A full-scale performance assessment for 2002/03 has been completed and a detailed agreement for 2003/04 is in place.

Recommendation 7:  
That the Authority reassess whether it should retain the structures and processes that give rise to and support the identity of ERMA New Zealand separate from the Authority.

Action  
There are valid reasons, including the HSNO legislation, for distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of the Authority and the Agency on occasions. Action has however been taken - for example, strengthened governance arrangements, Authority members' involvement in media briefings and meetings with special interest groups, regular meetings between the Authority Chair and the Chief Executive, more frequent interaction between Authority members and Agency staff - to ensure that the Authority and the Agency work in close harmony. The previous nomenclature has also been changed to emphasise the closeness of the relationship: "ERMA New Zealand" covers the Authority, Ngâ Kaihautû and the Agency.

Recommendation 8:  
That the Authority review and take ownership of the policies that relate to the design of its own job and discharge of its responsibilities. All such policies should be agreed by the Authority and signed off by the Chairperson.

Action  
The Authority already had ownership of such policies, in the sense that they were required to be submitted to the Authority for approval. To ensure this is clearly understood, policies have for some months now been signed off by the Authority Chair except where there is an explicit delegation to the Chief Executive.

Recommendation 9:  
That the Authority adopts the practice of developing an “annual agenda” (or work programme) to assist it in determining its own priorities. This should follow through into a reformatting of its monthly meetings.

Action  
Recommendation on an annual work programme accepted and under action. The Authority has already overhauled its meeting procedures.

Recommendation 10:  
That the Authority conduct a formal self-assessment of its governance performance including a review of its effectiveness in the application of its policies and procedures at least annually.

Action  
Recommendation accepted and implemented ( in July) under the guidance of the IoD adviser on governance.

Recommendation 11:  
The Authority be maintained at full strength of eight members at all times.

Action  
This is the current situation. No new action is required.

Recommendation 12:  
That the Authority itself take an active part in its own succession planning, in conjunction with the Minister.

Action  
The government has accepted this recommendation.

Recommendation 13:  
That future appointments address the areas of comparative inexperience and under-resourcing that are identified in the report.

Action  
This recommendation is supported by the government.

Recommendation 14:  
That the Authority’s statutory decision making committees be well supported with legal advice.

Action  
The Authority and its committees are already well supported with legal advice, both in-house and external. No new action is proposed.

Recommendation 15:  
That the recruitment and selection process for Authority Members should be approached no less thoroughly than would be the case for the selection of a chief executive. Appointments should be “merit-based”.

Action  
This recommendation is supported by the government.  
METHODOLOGIES  
Recommendation 16:  
Dialogue should continue between ERMA and MAF on the selection of particular controls and the frequency of monitoring.

Action  
Arrangements are in place for regular and ongoing dialogue between ERMA and MAF on new organism controls and the monitoring and enforcement of controls. For the avoidance of any doubt, feedback on the practicalities of controls is being made more explicit than in the past. The details of the new enforcement arrangements are however still subject to the passage of the NOOM Act.

Recommendation 17:  
A short study of the scope of work required to complete core registers should be conducted, perhaps with MAF or DOC collaboration. ERMA and the Ministry of Fisheries should discuss the requirements for a marine equivalent.

Action  
A scoping study is being contracted out for completion within the current financial year.

Recommendation 18:  
The Authority should consider the content and style of Evaluation and Review Reports, to improve internal consistency and readability; each Report should open with a summary of key issues in the view of applicant, submitters and staff.

Action  
E&R reports are key documentary inputs to decision-making and are continually under review.

The reports already open with a key issues section, and the Authority and Agency are working together to further improve the quality of these reports. Internal procedures have been strengthened to ensure that key issues raised by both applicants and submitters are included.

A specific review of the templates used for E&R reports is underway and will be completed over the next few months.

Recommendation 19:  
The Authority should clarify the instruction to Agency staff on how conflicting information should be dealt with and the minority views reported, including deciding what types of information are included or excluded. The Authority should be informed where there are significant differences in view among staff. The Agency should be developing skills in interdisciplinary collaboration with emphasis on dialogue as well as debate.

Action  
This issue has been worked through by the Authority and the Agency in the context of recent decisions and a general review of decision-making over the past year. It has never been the practice to exclude comment on differences in expert advice, but the need to bring out differing views has been further emphasised. The new operational procedures for Standing Committees involve more frequent Authority/ Agency meetings in person so that specific issues such as this can be addressed more fully.

Recommendation 20:  
Effort should continue on the broadening of risk management understanding, to meet the requirements of the Act: stakeholders should more fully appreciate that balancing of environmental risk and benefits is different to the insurance risk paradigm of detecting potential for loss and providing for compensation.

Action  
This is an important issue. The recommendation is in accordance with action already in train. A number of recent Authority meetings have included discussions and workshops on new guidelines for evaluating and managing risk. Our expanded public awareness programme also features this issue, as does the revised draft methodology.

Recommendation 21:  
ERMA, research funding agencies and applicants should look together at the implications of case-by-case processing for research programmes dependent on a series of approvals to produce useful outcomes.

Action  
Applicants are routinely made aware of the sequence of approvals necessary to take any new organism (GMO) from initial development through to full release. In particular, we emphasise the need to fully explore risks (not just benefits) when designing field trials and similar programmes. However, the point made by the review team is being given particular emphasis in the re-writes of the user guides currently in progress.

Recommendation 22:  
In its evaluation and review reporting, public awareness and consultation activities, ERMA should make use of the recent work available on the expectations of the New Zealand public and their range of perceptions, views and values.

Action  
Again, this continues to be an important issue for ERMA New Zealand. We are putting significant effort into tracking work in these areas and are taking account of it in our decision-making, public awareness and consultation activities.

Recommendation 23:  
A body of knowledge about decision-making precedents and their implications should be distilled from the casework completed, as has been promised in the Annotated Methodology.

Action  
Additional funding has been provided by the Government to enable this work to be undertaken. The initial focus will be on setting up and implementing systems to capture current decisions and that will be done within the current financial year. This will be extended into past decisions over a longer period of time.

Recommendation 24:  
More flexibility in the risk assessment process will eventually be required and should be investigated soon. Perceptions change over time, to the extent that previously valid judgements are no longer fitting. The dynamic meaning of caution should be anchored in public risk appetite and scientific evidence.

Action  
The risk assessment process provides an important discipline for robust decision-making.. Within the process there is flexibility to reflect changing perceptions and standards on aspects such as the degree of caution and/or risk averseness that should apply. The revised consultation paper on the Methodology to be released in September will incorporate a response to this recommendation.

It should however be noted that the Authority’s decisions must at all times be compliant with the legislation and regulations governing Part V considerations.

Recommendation 25:  
ERMA should look for means of promoting awareness that provide for dialogue rather than debate, especially between communities of interest with a history of misunderstanding.

Recommendation 26:  
Observations deserving further consideration include those on the case for dialogue outside hearings.

Action  
It is sensible to consider Recommendations 25 and 26 together. Part of recommendation 27 is also relevant.

Within the limits applying to a statutory Authority that must be impartial, ERMA looks actively for opportunities to stimulate both dialogue and constructive debate. However, in 2002/03 particularly, programmes of this type were constrained by resource limitations.

With funding constraints eased in 2003/04, ERMA is looking to re-commit to programmes that are consistent with the recommendation. An extensive public awareness programme on the NOOM Bill is planned for later this year. There will be a strong emphasis given to Maori perspectives and stakeholder dialogue, utilising the recently-established Maori network.

Recommendation 27:  
Observations of merit on the need for dialogue outside the hearing process and on improvements to the hearing process should be considered in the light of whether they will assist wise and consistent decision-making that is more cost-effective. A more committed effort should be made to reduce cost for the Agency and applicants: alternatives to the present structures and process, allowable under the Act and Methodology, should be costed and their qualitative merits examined.

Action  
See Action under Recommendation 25 for aspects relating to dialogue.

The Authority has reservations about the proposal concerning changes to the hearing process to make it more cost-effective. The process already makes good use of the (limited) flexibility available under the Act, consistent with our obligation to meet the legitimate aspirations of submitters. While we will be doing what we can to ensure that our processes give good value for money, the Authority has a responsibility to ensure that all submitters get a fair hearing.

A committed effort is being made on an ongoing basis to reduce costs by reviewing and improving processes and approaches. This includes regular decision-making debriefs involving both the Authority and staff and a specific annual review of cost-effectiveness. Pricing policy is a matter for decision by the government.

It will be important to engage stakeholders in this process. A “customer satisfaction” survey is planned for 2003/04, and this will be designed to encourage feedback on cost-effectiveness. Any specific feedback will be followed up, to ensure that any reasonable scope for action is taken.

Recommendation 28:  
The Authority should take steps to understand and respond to perceptions that submitters, in particular, may not trust the process or the Agency.

Action  
The Authority is committed to taking action on this point, and is doing so through interaction with environmental and community groups and by means of special events.

A particular vehicle for action is the NGO consultative group that contains participants from a wide variety of organisations. This group has had four meetings with Authority and Agency representatives in the past few months.

Beyond this, it is considered that ERMA New Zealand has in its decision-making to date provided solid reassurance to the New Zealand public. The Authority is committed to maintaining its reputation for impartiality and professionalism in its approach to submitters as well as in its decision-making.

Recommendation 29:  
The role of Ngâ Kaihautû should be communicated more clearly to stakeholders. Advisory interaction between Ngâ Kaihautû and the Authority should be reinforced at a strategic level as well as the present case-by-case level.

Action  
Action on the first part of this is covered under Recommendation 1.

On the second part of the recommendation, such discussions are already occurring and are increasingly a focus of the 4 monthly joint meetings between the Authority and Ngâ Kaihautû. The Chairs of the Authority and Nga Kaihautu meet on a regular basis, as do members of the Authority and Nga Kaihautu and Agency staff.

Recommendation 30:  
Fluctuations in applications numbers and effort required in pre-application, application and monitoring phases should be studied to explore the foreseeable options facing new organism work over the next three years. Such a study should include discussions with representative applicants and parties involved in monitoring and enforcement. The whole of government aim should be reinforced: protection and prevention outcomes are to be achieved, though different organisations may use different approaches or legislation.

Action  
ERMA New Zealand routinely engages with applicants on these issues, and this dialogue will continue. A survey of new organism applicant intentions has recently been undertaken and is being used to inform forward planning. The survey included CRIs, universities, MAF, DoC, MFish, companies with an applications history and “industry” organisations.

Recommendation 31:  
The Agency should review the way of working and expectations about what standard of proof decision-makers need. Changes to staffing levels should not be considered until potential for process changes has been examined and governance implications considered.

Action  
The issue of what standard of proof the decision-makers require and the implications for the provision of information and analysis by staff, are a matter of continuing discussion internally. The discussion has inherent tensions because additional information/analysis leads to additional cost. Dialogue on this issue will continue, and will continue to be informed by developing experience. The new arrangements for Standing Committees to meet more frequently with staff will help ensure a shared approach.

Clearly decisions in this area will affect levels of staffing, but this is routinely taken care of. The issue of how processes can be improved is being dealt with as part of our overall organisational review.

Recommendation 32:  
Coaching efforts with IBSCs should continue, complementing audit of their processes and decisions.

Action  
The recommendation is agreed. Opportunities for coaching are being taken as they arise.

MANAGEMENT  
Recommendation 33:  
A review of organisation development strategy, culture and structure should be completed in time to be fully implemented before the end of the moratorium, perhaps splitting the functions presently grouped in Science and Operations differently to focus attention on the very different requirements of new organisms and of hazardous substances.

Action  
A review of organisational structure was already intended for 2003/04. A review focussing on the new demands on the Hazardous Substances side of our work was undertaken earlier this year. A second, wide-ranging review was undertaken in July 2003 and its findings are now being implemented. The new structure recommended by the review team has been approved.

The exercise encompassed the full range of issues touched on in both the governance and the management sections of the report.

Recommendation 34:  
Management level representation of policy development in environmental or public arenas should be considered, to complement the operational and technical focus of the organisation.

Action  
This issue has been dealt with through the recent organisational review, which established a new Strategy and Policy Group along the lines recommended..

Recommendation 35:  
Budget holding for all senior management positions should rest with the position holder, so that the quality of service to Agency and Authority can be controlled with a single point of management and professional accountability.

Action  
The general principle is agreed and is already the case for all senior management positions.

However, there are two specialist functional areas (Mâori Affairs and Legal Services) that are responsible direct to the Chief Executive. While both areas operate as separate cost centres ( i.e. they have separate budgets) financial management is handled through other senior managers. This enables the officers concerned to concentrate on their specialist work outputs. This arrangement is being reviewed as a part of the organisational review.

Recommendation 36:  
Application Review Meetings (ARMs) should be used for clarification of issues around applications and familiarisation with skill areas in need of development, as well as ensuring compliance with the application-processing regime.

Action  
ARM meetings are already used as a forum for discussing and clarifying issues raised by applications. This can lead to the identification of skill gaps or training and development needs, although the consequential details are often dealt with through other mechanisms, e.g. Senior Management or Group meetings.

Recommendation 37:  
There should be more opportunity for dialogue within ERMA on high level issues of relevance to work now or in the foreseeable future, including the factors that need to be weighed, the ways these can be investigated and the workplace culture that will facilitate wise, balanced decisions.

Action proposed:  
A range of avenues exist for dialogue within ERMA New Zealand on issues relevant to the existing and future work of the organisation. These were re-examined in the context of the organisational review and steps are being taken to ensure that the opportunities are fully utilised.

STAFF QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE  
Recommendation 38:  
The Agency’s Operations Group should lead an operational review of the way application-processing is expected to be done, looking for skill deficits and potential for savings of time or cost in the preparation and processing of applications. Action plans for building or co-opting expertise in areas of shortfall should be implemented.

Action  
See responses to Recommendations (18) and (27). The exercises referred to in these responses will automatically pick up potential efficiency improvements. Taken together, these reviews represent a substantial commitment to continual improvement.

The reference to building or co-opting expertise in areas of shortfall is noted. There is already provision place for bringing in external expertise when needed. This is likely to happen more frequently in the future, at both Agency and Authority level.

Recommendation 39:  
Professional development of staff should be guided by an organisation-wide strategy to develop capacity to meet the challenges facing ERMA.

Action  
The recommendation is agreed. There is an active programme in place to up-skill staff but to date this has been run informally. The strengthening of the Corporate Services Group by the appointment of an HR specialist is aimed at giving effect to this recommendation.

Recommendation 40:  
The Authority should reconsider the high-level processes used within and beyond ERMA to complete tasks related to new organisms, including the sustaining of stakeholder relationships that assist future compliance and understanding. The potential for alternatives, still meeting the requirements of the Act and Methodology, should be examined.

Action  
Recommendation being given effect through our expanded public awareness programme.

Recommendation 41:  
A shared vision for ERMA, and the path to its achievement, should be built, lead by the Authority. There needs to be free and frank discussions on what might happen as the new organism work progresses, including cultural, ethical and scientific dilemmas, perhaps involving applicant, submitter and other agency perspectives. Support for the expected workplace culture should be a part of the path to the vision. A means of addressing recurring contradictory culture themes should be proposed by management for the Authority to consider.

Action  
The need for a shared vision led by the Authority is supported, and work is already in progress (through the 2010 strategic plan initiative) to achieve this.

There are already a range of forums available and used internally for discussing issues and dilemmas in HSNO decision-making. However, there is merit in more actively engaging stakeholders in those discussions. Means of doing this include building relevant sessions in to external events and more active use of Standing Committee meetings involving both Authority members and Agency staff.

Recommendation 42:  
Developmental guidance should be provided for managers, to ensure treatment of staff is consistent with obligations and provides the support necessary to work to the standards expected.

Action  
Guidance is currently provided through the performance management process, supplemented by additional discussions when required. The appointment of an HR specialist will help here.

Recommendation 43:  
There should be periodic review at Authority level of the satisfactory presence of specialisms and management competencies critical to the Agency’s achievement of a reputation as an even-handed adviser to a wise Authority making informed judgements. Governance activities should regard these strategic human assets as crucial to the present and future performance of the organisation, to be added to and replenished in advance of need. Detailed recommendations are made in sections on shortfalls.

Action  
This was given careful consideration through the recent organisational review, and initial proposals have been formulated.

Recommendation 44:  
Rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods should be used to establish baseline perspectives and begin predictions of changing attitudes. Collaboration with research institutions should be investigated, including the possibility of obtaining FRST funding for a public-interest research programme.

Action  
There is already active collaboration with FRST, and with research institutions, to take full advantage of FRST funding. This has led to a range of HSNO related research programmes, including biophysical issues (e.g. horizontal gene transfer) and values-based issues (e.g. Mâori culture and GM). This collaboration will continue to be actively pursued and will be extended to include research on public attitudes and approach to risk. As far as possible this will build on the conceptual work already done by ERMA New Zealand.

Recommendation 45:  
Authority Members should become familiar with the different qualities of advice required so they can express their requirement clearly. This expression will assist the Agency, external experts, applicants and submitters in completing work to necessary and sufficient standards.

Action  
This recommendation seems to cover similar ground to Recommendation 31. The new arrangements for Standing Committees are designed to promote a shared view between the Authority and the Agency in this area.

Recommendation 46:  
The Authority should review management competency ratings to ensure alignment with the 2010 visioning, then ensure their use in planning and conducting developmental activities for present and potential managers.

Action  
Being taken forward by the Authority and the Agency.

Recommendation 47:  
The Authority should consider the balance between expenditure on technical and managerial development of staff in the light of the needs facing the Agency.

Action  
To be reviewed by senior management once the HR specialist is in place.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS  
Recommendation 48:  
Policy agency relationships should be sustained where established and reinforced where liaison is limited. This may require re-prioritisation of senior management attention in ERMA.

Action  
Agreed. Close working relationships already exist with policy agencies. Steps will be taken to strengthen and expand these linkages, and linkages with counterpart agencies offshore, where possible. The proposed new senior management structure will facilitate this work.

Recommendation 49:  
Liaison for compliance and enforcement purposes should be examined by the Authority to explore the division of responsibilities between ERMA and other agencies. The existing MoU arrangements have not been wholly satisfactory ‘on the ground’. Reliance on agency relationships to deliver core services creates risk that the other agencies’ priorities might precede those of ERMA. The Authority must be confident of satisfactory implementation of compliance controls and, when required, enforcement and emergency response actions. Diligent monitoring of actions by ERMA and other parties is needed, as is better integration of ‘on-the-ground’ operations.

Action  
The further development of the relationship between ERMA New Zealand and MAF in particular is currently being discussed, to incorporate the impacts of legislative change (NOOM Act). A set of governing principles has already been agreed and this is currently being translated into a revision of the MoU between ERMA New Zealand and MAF. Consequential changes will then be made to the operating agreements that sit under this. These changes will further develop a cooperative arrangement that already functions effectively.

Initiatives are also being taken at a more practical level. The terms of reference for the existing quarterly meetings at senior level between ERMA New Zealand and MAF are being revised to give a sharper focus to the continuous improvement of the relationship. A successful joint workshop was held recently involving about 40 staff, mostly from MAF but also from MFish.
