Foreign Minister Phil Goff is to attend the funeral for Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in Stockholm tonight (NZT).

Mr Goff arrived in Rome on Thursday to meet Italian counterpart Franco Frattini for New Zealand's six-monthly consultations with the European Union Presidency, currently held by Italy.

"I have accepted an offer to join Mr Frattini's flight to Stockholm for the funeral of Anna Lindh, and greatly appreciate the gesture," Mr Goff said.

"I had enormous respect for Anna. She was a warm and gracious person, and a very competent minister. We enjoyed a warm relationship. Her death is a tragic loss for her family and young children, and an enormous loss for Sweden.

"I'm pleased to be representing New Zealand at her memorial service, to show our respect for her and Sweden.

"The formal consultations scheduled for Rome will now be held at the Italian Ambassador's Residence in Stockholm. European Union Secretary General Javier Solana and EU Commissioner Chris Patten will take part in those discussions, with Mr Patten also joining the flight back to Rome.

"The new arrangements demonstrate our excellent relationship with Italy and the importance that New Zealand and the EU Presidency place on these talks."

Mr Goff said regular consultations with the EU Presidency were a valuable way for New Zealand to register its interests with the EU's decision-makers. On the agenda for these talks will be an update on developments in the Pacific, including the outcome of the recent Forum and the situation in the Solomons, where the EU is providing assistance.

Other topics to be discussed will be the failed WTO negotiations in Cancun, the security situation on the Korean peninsula, Iraq and the Middle East.
