The Modern Apprenticeships programme is to get a $600,000 cash boost so it can keep up with higher than expected growth this financial year, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

New funding worth $650,000 was provided in the 2003 Budget, for 2003/2004 financial year. However trainee numbers have grown rapidly with the June 2003 target of 5,000 Modern Apprentices being achieved by March 2003. By June 2003 there were actually 5,739 Modern Apprenticeships.

Steve Maharey said the additional funding will help meet the high demand for the programme by supporting another 500 new Modern Apprenticeships.

“The Modern Apprenticeships programme has been a huge success with employers and young people. Employers solve their skill shortages by heping to train tomorrow’s skilled workforce. Apprentices get a valuable career opportunity to learn on the job and get a recognised qualification at the end of it.

“Modern Apprenticeships are now available in 28 industries including agriculture, boatbuilding, food processing and tourism. The programme is available to a young people aged 16 to 21 years old.

By 30 June 2004, it is expected that there will be a total of 6,500 Modern Apprenticeships in place. Funding already allocated in the 2003 Budget for 2004/05 and 2005/06 will support the achievement of 7,500 Modern Apprenticeships by June 2006.
