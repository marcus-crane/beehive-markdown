12 September 2003Media Statement

New Zealanders in their thousands are taking up the opportunity to have input into the [government’s proposals](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/foreshore/home.cfm) for the foreshore and seabed, says Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen.

“We want as wide a consultation as possible because the broader the participation, the better the chance of securing broad agreement,” he said.

“The government’s bottom lines remain the same: no new freehold title and no loss of traditional access for all New Zealanders to the foreshore and seabed.

But within those parameters, the government is keen to discuss how public access can be protected while also acknowledging and respecting Maori customary rights where those rights can be established,” Dr Cullen said.

Government MPs have held public meetings in West Auckland, Dannevirke, Martinborough, Masterton, Christchurch East, Levin, Foxton, Palmerston North, Upper Hutt, Waikanae, Otaki and Paraparaumu. At least 18 more meetings are scheduled across communities as diverse as Havelock North, Napier, Christchurch, Ashburton, Blenheim, Birkenhead, Waitakere, Kawhia, West Auckland and Northland.

In addition, key interest groups have been offered ministerial briefings. Dr Cullen and Associate Maori Affairs Minister John Tamihere will conduct the first of these next week. It has been co-ordinated by Fish and Game New Zealand and will involve 12 organisations representing environmental, conservation and outdoor recreational interests.

These activities are running in tandem with 11 hui to consult hapu and iwi, five of which have now been held.

Calls to the 0508 FORESHORE number now total 527, and more than 11,500 pamphlets and booklets have been sent out on top of the large mail-out to launch the consultative process.

Around 600 submissions have been received. The deadline is Friday, 3 October but there will be a second opportunity to make submissions when the legislation to implement the policy which emerges out of the consultations is before the select committee.
