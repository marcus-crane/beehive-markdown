Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed the change to regulations covering the sale of pedal bicycles, which come into effect this Friday. The changes exempt second-hand bicycles from the Product Safety Standard.

“This reflects a good balance between consumers’ rights to safe products, the realities of selling second-hand bikes and the ‘not-for-profit’ transactions that take place, such as hand-me-downs and fund-raising activities,” said Judith Tizard.

“I want to thank everyone who worked with the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to enable a speedy resolution to the situation which saw people, including the Police, uncertain about their ability to sell second-hand bikes.”

Consumers can be assured that when they buy second-hand bikes from a trader the general safety provisions of the Consumer Guarantees Act will still cover these bikes.

A second-hand bicycle is expected to be roadworthy and to meet minimum performance standards unless otherwise agreed between the buyer and trader.

Families will also be able to gift or on-sell second-hand bicycles on an “as is where is” basis without the risk of acting outside the law.

Whenever a consumer rides their bike they need to be aware of safety issues. This not only covers on and off road use but also maintenance.

“In New Zealand we have a very active and responsible bike service and repair sector. The Bicycle Association of New Zealand has worked to develop a recognised qualification for cycle mechanics. I’d like to urge consumers to use the expertise available to them,” said Judith Tizard.

The Product Safety Standards (Pedal Bicycles) Amendment Regulations 2003 will come into effect on Friday 12 September 2003.

“From this date lost property held by Police that may otherwise have been destroyed will now be available for consumers to buy,” said Judith Tizard.
