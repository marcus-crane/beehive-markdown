Nominations have opened for the 2004 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards.

The awards, which were established by the government and awarded for the first time in 2002, recognise excellence in tertiary teaching, promote good teaching practice and enhance career development for tertiary teachers. The recipients of the excellence awards receive $20,000 and the winner of the Prime Minister’s supreme award, $30,000, to be spent enhancing their teaching career and promoting best practice.

The thirty-four tertiary teachers who took away the 2003 awards are profiled in a new publication released today by the Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey encouraged tertiary education providers to consider nominations for the 2004 awards.

“After two years of the excellence awards its clear that there are many inspiring teachers within our tertiary education system.

“In 2002, the Prime Minister’s Award went to an Auckland design educator; this year it has gone to an Otago pathologist. Last year we congratulated a team from a Waikato school of education for their innovative mixed media programme for primary teachers; this year we acknowledge excellence in collaboration in a team of Christchurch chefs and a team of Auckland statisticians.

“These teachers have demonstrated how to work successfully across schools and departments, and with industry, and the positive impact they have on the experiences and achievements of their learners,” said Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey said the 2003 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards publication, released today, is an important element of the award scheme.

“This year’s booklet describes the work of the 2003 recipients who received their awards in June. It also features testimonials from students and colleagues. It enables other tertiary teachers and the general public to take a closer look at the teaching philosophies and methodology of some extraordinary educators,” said Steve Maharey.

**About the Awards**

The awards are administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. Professor Graeme Fraser, Board Chair of the Qualifications Authority, chaired the selection committee, consisting of representatives from throughout the tertiary sector.

Awards are considered in three categories:

·Sustained Excellence  
Awarded to teachers who demonstrate continuing excellence in their teaching over a period of at least six years.

·Excellence in Innovation  
Awarded to teachers who demonstrate innovation in their teaching methods, curriculum design or materials that encourage and enhance learning.

·Excellence in Collaboration  
Awarded to groups or teams who demonstrate clearly that they have worked collaboratively within or between institutions, to improve learning.

There are nine awards of $20,000 each and a supreme award, the Prime Minister’s Award, of $30,000. The number of awards and the three categories indicate the Tertiary Teaching Excellence Committee’s aim to encompass the diversity of teachers and providers across all levels of tertiary education and training.

All tertiary providers, including universities, wânanga, polytechnics, colleges of education and private training establishments, have been invited to make nominations for the 2004 awards. Nominations close on 31 March 2004 and recipients will be announced at a ceremony in mid-2004.

Full contact details and procedures are given in the guideline document (available on the NZQA website at www.nzqa.govt.nz in the ‘For Providers’ section). Providers should contact the Qualifications Authority if they have any questions about the nomination process.
