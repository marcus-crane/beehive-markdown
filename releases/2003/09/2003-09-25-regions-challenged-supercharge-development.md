Regions are being challenged to step up their commitment to major regional initiatives.

Opening the regional development conference in Timaru today, economic development minister and Acting Prime Minister Jim Anderton challenged regions to step up the Major Regional Initiatives programme.

Regions can receive up to $2 million in matching funds for major regional initiatives, which meet criteria including consensus support in the region.

So far eight regions have announced major regional initiatives, including a wood processing centre of excellence in Rotorua, a wine centre of excellence in Marlborough and an Innovation Park in Hamilton.

"Those regions that have not completed one MRI when others begin their second need to push on harder," Jim Anderton said.

"We need to see a series of major strategic projects around our 26 regions, then 52, followed by 78 major strategic projects. We need to inspire New Zealand with a series of innovative ideas from one end of New Zealand to the other.
