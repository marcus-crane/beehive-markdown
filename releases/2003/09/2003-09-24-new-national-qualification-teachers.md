A new national qualification for secondary teachers who have been unable to access the new top step on the teachers’ salary scale was announced today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

“The new qualification will recognise the current skills and knowledge of the teachers concerned – and be professionally enhancing at the same time,” Trevor Mallard said in a speech to the PPTA annual conference in Wellington today.

“The qualification is specifically designed to provide a pathway for trained secondary teachers in the G3 equivalent salary group to meet the substantive non-teaching level 7 qualification requirement of the G3+ salary group.”

Trevor Mallard said a specialist stakeholder group, including the PPTA, Ministry of Education and New Zealand School Trustees Association representatives, would be established to oversee the development of the new qualification.

“The group designing the qualification will identify the unit standards necessary for the qualification, advise on proportions of credit exemption, and specify the maximums for credit transfer from additional qualifications. The qualification will be registered on the National Qualifications Framework.

“Teachers who want to obtain this qualification will need to go through a full assessment process against a robust set of agreed standards. I expect the structure of the new qualification to be communicated to G3 equivalent teachers by the end of term 4 this year so those who wish to take up this opportunity can do so from the beginning of 2004.

“This proposal reflects our government’s commitment to addressing potential recruitment and retention issues, as well as supporting teachers’ professional development, and increasing the level of capability in the curriculum area.

“That is why the government has committed to financially supporting teachers who undertake the diploma. The government will refund half the course fees, the cost of which is yet to be determined, and will provide up to 2 weeks study leave for each teacher who is engaged in the diploma.

“This is much bigger than the G3 issue. It is about the whole challenge of creating wider and more exciting career pathways for teachers. It is also about providing recognition for teachers who show greater competency, “ Trevor Mallard said.
