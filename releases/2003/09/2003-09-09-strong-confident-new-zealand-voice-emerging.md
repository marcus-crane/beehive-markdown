A strong, confident New Zealand voice is emerging in the creative sector as arts activity grows with increased Government support, says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

This year Creative New Zealand received an extra $11.6 million over four years to continue its support for well-established professional arts organisations, emerging organisations, regional arts initiatives, Mâori arts, community arts, and contestable project funding. The government also increased the Royal NZ Ballet’s funding by $2 million over the next four years to continue the company’s artistic and audience growth.

“Creative New Zealand has been able to offer more funding for several of the 38 recurrently-funded organisations it supports, including NBR New Zealand Opera, Taki Rua Productions and Auckland Philharmonia. Meanwhile, the Ballet’s funding increase allows it to continue to present a diverse repertoire, tour nationally, and deliver education programmes,” said Judith Tizard.

“This means more New Zealand works will be created, more New Zealanders will have opportunities to enjoy that work, and more New Zealanders will have work in the creative industries.”

Judith Tizard said the government’s investment in the arts is an investment in New Zealand’s future as a proud, confident and innovative nation.

“The arts play an important part in the economy, contributing around 3.1 percent of total gross domestic product according to one Industry New Zealand report, and employing more than 50,000 New Zealanders directly in the sector. Arts activities also impact positively on regional and community development, health, education, tourism and New Zealand’s overseas profile.

“Events taking place this month point to the vital role of the arts in regional growth and the development of strong local identities. The impressive Montana World of Wearable Arts Awards have put Nelson on the world stage, while the new Auckland Festival, AK03, will celebrate the region’s diversity and creativity and develop new audiences for the arts.

“The partnerships and support of government agencies such as Creative New Zealand, Tourism New Zealand and others provide a cornerstone for the success of these endeavours.”
