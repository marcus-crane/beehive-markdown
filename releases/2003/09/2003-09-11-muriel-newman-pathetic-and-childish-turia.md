The Associate Minister in charge of Child Youth and Family, Tariana Turia, describes as 'pathetic and childish' the suggestion by Muriel Newman of ACT, that a child needing care and protection should be placed in her office.

"Sometimes I genuinely wonder whether politicians like Muriel really care about the welfare of vulnerable children when they stoop to using them as pawns in their political games.

"At least I can say that I have often opened my home to children. What is Muriel's record like?

"I can also say that I take my responsibilities for children in my care very seriously, and I am not prepared to use them as ammunition to try to score points against other adults.

"If Muriel is genuinely interested in the welfare of this child, she could look to see if she herself can do anything constructive for him, instead of making ridiculous suggestions," said Mrs Turia.
