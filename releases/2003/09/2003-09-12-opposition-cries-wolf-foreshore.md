Attorney-General Margaret Wilson said the Opposition was deliberately misinterpreting her statements made in the House yesterday.

â€œItâ€™s crass for Bill English to try to make people think that public access to beaches is at risk, just so the National party can grandstand about it.

â€œThere should be no confusion: access has always been and remains a core part of the Governmentâ€™s proposal. There will be no new fee simple title and no loss of traditional access for all New Zealanders to the foreshore and seabed.

â€œThe proposal is also looking at how the customary interests of whanau, hapu and iwi in the foreshore and seabed should be acknowledged. The present consultation round is precisely about what specific rights might be identified and protected.â€?
