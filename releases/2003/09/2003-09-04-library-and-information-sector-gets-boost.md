The Minister Responsible for the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mâtauranga o Aotearoa, Marian Hobbs, today announced 11 appointments to two new ministerial advisory bodies.

The Library and Information Advisory Commission Ngâ Kaiwhakamârama i ngâ Kohikohinga Kôrero (LIAC) and the Guardians Kaitiaki Alexander Turnbull Library will have the role of advising the minister on issues related to the role of library and information services, including mâtauranga Mâori, in the cultural and economic life of New Zealand, and protecting and developing collections of the Turnbull.

"The appointments to the Library and Information Advisory Commission will ensure the government receives independent advice on library and information issues, and public access to library and information services, as well as the role of library and information services in the cultural and economic life of this country," Marian Hobbs said.

The Commissioners are: Ms Ainslie Dewe (Chairperson), Ms Diana Kelly, Mr Karl Du Fresne, Mrs Evelyn Tobin, Mr Chris Szekely, and Mr Paul Reynolds.

"The Guardians Kaitiaki appointments confirm the government's undertakings to preserve, protect, develop and make accessible the special collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library in perpetuity, and to maintain the character of the services that distinguish the Alexander Turnbull Library as a research library," Marian Hobbs said.

The Guardians Kaitiaki are: Dr Lydia Wevers (Chairperson), Dr James Ng, Professor Judith Binney, Ms Theresa Graham, and Dr Patu Hohepa.

"These two bodies are a boost of expertise and a significant step towards implementing the new National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mâtauranga o Aotearoa) Act passed earlier this year," the Minister said.

"I am delighted with the people who have been appointed to these two new bodies. They'll bring community focus and direction to decision-making around the government's approach to library and information issues in New Zealand, including mâtauranga Mâori, and preserving and developing the Turnbull collections."

The call for nominations to the two new bodies was widely advertised in June.
