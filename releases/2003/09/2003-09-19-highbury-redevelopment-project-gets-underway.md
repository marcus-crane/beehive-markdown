Housing Minister Steve Maharey today announced details about a $300,000 redevelopment and modernisation project to improve fourteen of the sixteen Cowley Place properties in the Palmerston North suburb of Highbury.

The project involves redeveloping and modernising Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) properties in Cowley Place to change the image of the street and provide housing that is attractive to tenants. As part of the redevelopment eight units contained within three blocks will be demolished and four HNZC homes from areas of low demand will be relocated to the sites and modernised. A modern stand alone house and a Community Group Housing property used as a köhanga reo are not included in the project.

Steve Maharey got the demolition work underway himself this afternoon in front of local residents and invited guests.

“This is a significant redevelopment/modernisation project which will improve housing in Cowley Place, improve the streetscape and create a more sustainable future for residents.

“Cowley Place has been the site of much discontent over the past two years and I know the community is eager to move ahead and improve the image of the area. As the sole landowner in this street HNZC is making a significant contribution to helping this community move forward.

“Local firms will have the opportunity to tender for the work. Where possible materials will be recycled in keeping with HNZC’s environmental policy.

“The modernisation includes designed interiors, new kitchens, bathrooms, floor coverings, additional power points, lighting, better insulation, fencing, garaging and landscaping.

“Ultimately the aim of this work is to make the homes more comfortable and modern, warmer and healthier,” Mr Maharey says.

HNZC will be meeting with the Palmerston North City Council and the Highbury Focus Group to consider possible uses for the site at 14-20 Cowley Place before a decision is made. It will also continue to work with the Council to consider other ways to further improve Highbury.
