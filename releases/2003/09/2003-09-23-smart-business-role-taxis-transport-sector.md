Delivered on behalf of Hon Paul Swain by Mark Peck, MP.

**Welcome and Acknowledgement**

- I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today as part of the New Zealand Taxi Federation 65th annual conference.
- The Minister and Associate Minister of Transport, the Hon Paul Swain and Hon Harry Duynhoven asked me to pass on their apologies for not being able to be with you today.
- They wish you well in your discussions and look forward to learning more about the outcomes of your conference.
- I'd like to thank in particular Tim Reddish and John Taylor for their invitation.
- I know also the Minister of Transport, the Hon Paul Swain has a good working relationship with the Federation and was well received at last year's conference in Nelson.

**Introduction**

- The Minister tells me that he has met with Tim and John to discuss issues facing the taxi industry, in particular:
  
  - timing of changes to the driving hours and logbooks regime;
  - public transport lanes; and
  - driver standards, for which I know the Minister has a special interest.
- The Federation has asked me to speak on those issues and also to provide an update on the:
  
  - Land Transport Management Bill; and
  - the proposed operator safety rating system.
- But first I'd like to re-emphasise the messages the Minister spoke of last year about the New Zealand Transport Strategy and the approach this government has taken to move transport ahead in New Zealand.

**The New Zealand Transport Strategy**

- This government is committed to passenger transport in New Zealand. In December last year the government's 'New Zealand Transport Strategy' was released.

The Strategy defines the government's vision for the future that:  
"By 2010, New Zealand will have an affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable transport system".

I cannot emphasise the "integrated" part enough.

- We need a transport system that links passenger and freight movement across land, sea, air and rail.
- We need to think about linkages between different modes and the potential impact each decision can have.
- This means transport policy should aim for an efficient and integrated mix of modes, making use of existing and new public infrastructure and investment.
- This is the first time all modes of transport will be considered as a whole not as fragmented ad hoc decisions that create future problems.
- The Strategy's five objectives which seek to find the most effective solutions across all modes are to:
  
  - assist economic development;
  - assist safety and personal security;
  - improve access and mobility;
  - protect and promote public health and;
  - ensure environmental sustainability.
- A sustainable development approach to transport means that all five objectives must be progressed in parallel.
- The Strategy provides direction and strategic leadership for transport in New Zealand.
- Clearly public transport, which includes taxis, has a significant role to play in providing good access and increased mobility to the community.

**Driving Hours and Logbooks Review**

- The Minister spoke on this issue last year and outlined the changes in the pipeline.
- The Parliamentary Counsel Office is in the process of drafting legislation ready for introduction later in the year.
- The Ministry of Transport has contracted the LTSA to produce a Land Transport (Driving Hours and Logbooks) Rule and the Minister is working hard to push things along.
- I understand the Federation has been waiting a long time for these changes especially changes to the offences and penalties regime.
- I must point out however, that the government has five Transport Bills on the legislative programme for this year.
- Four of those Bills are currently with select committee and the Land Transport Amendment Bill is currently being prepared for introduction, which includes changes to the driving hours and logbooks system and other changes affecting taxis like the Operator Safety Rating System.
- As the Federation will understand these Transport Bills are considered along with other government priorities.
- And because of the large number of Bills on the legislative programme there are potential risks; such risks can include delays.
- I know the Minister has heard your appeals and will endeavour to push the changes through.
- In addition, the Ministry of Transport tells me that the Land Transport Amendment Bill will include a taxi runner offence for the non-payment of a fare.
- This will allow taxi drivers to pursue unpaid fares, like the high profile politician that refused to pay his fare recently in Wellington.
- In this instance, he would have incurred a $150 infringement notice for the non-payment of a fare.

**Public Transport Lanes**

- The problem of restricted access to public transport lanes has been raised on a number of occasions by the taxi industry and the Federation.
- It is interesting to hear that some Councils allow taxis access to public transport lanes and some don't.
- I think taxis are an integral and integrating part of the public transport system in New Zealand.
- They provide essential services to many sectors of the community and to those who may not have access to a private motor vehicle.
- Taxis also provide essential services to many of our international visitors.
- The policy to restrict taxi use of public transport priority lanes unfairly discriminates against passengers that choose to use taxis as their preferred mode of public transport choice.
- I support the concept of public transport priority lanes, as they are a sound means of encouraging commuters to leave their cars at home.
- I'm also encouraged by initiatives that promote improvements to access and mobility as a key New Zealand Transport Strategy objective.
- However, as a public transport service provider, taxi and shuttle operators should have the same opportunities and access as other public transport providers to priority lanes.
- I understand Christchurch and Hutt City Councils allow taxis access to priority lanes, but Auckland and Wellington City Councils restrict access.
- \[I know the Minister has just written to the Councils conveying his concerns about this issue and is seeking an explanation. Check with Ministers office]

**Driver Standards**

- Driver standards are an issue that continually receives a lot of attention in the media.
- I'd like to point out recent improvements to taxi standards in Cyprus where the islands licensing authority want taxi drivers to bin their medallions, cover up hairy belly buttons and ditch flashy rings to project a cleaner image among tourists.
- The island's licensing authority plans etiquette classes for its cabbies after surveys conducted among holidaymakers showed some grooming was needed. Thick gold chains around the neck, sovereign rings on three of the five fingers...all this has got to go. Explicit tattoos, shorts exposing hairy legs and flip-flops were also in for the chop, the official added.
- About 2.5 million tourists flock to the Mediterranean Island of Cyprus every year.
- Etiquette standards among New Zealand taxi drivers are generally a lot better than that sounds, but we continually hear about poor area knowledge and the poor ability of some drivers to speak adequate English.
- I understand the LTSA completed a review of area knowledge and English language testing.
- The implementation phase of the Area Knowledge Certificate Project has now been completed.
- All providers including those in Auckland, who are approved to test Taxi Drivers' Area Knowledge, are currently using the new enhanced test.
- Many providers have now been running the new test for at least 6 months, and some for up to one year.
- The LTSA has started auditing course providers on the enhanced test, to ensure that it is being delivered correctly.
- Area knowledge and the ability to communicate effectively with customers is an important aspect of driving a taxi.
- The Land Transport Amendment Bill proposes to increase accountability of approved taxi organisations.
- Approved taxi organisations have influence over their members' standards, like safety and service, and need to take more responsibility for actions or inaction of their drivers.
- The Bill proposes to increase accountability of approved taxi organisations in relation to driver and vehicle standards.
- This will include:
  
  - ensuring drivers hold the correct licence;
  - understand the rules for operating a taxi;
  - have adequate area knowledge and English language skills;
  - comply with fatigue management and complaint resolution procedures;
  - notify the Director the names and driver licence number of taxi drivers whose services have been terminated and the reasons why; and
  - report to the Director complaints of a serious nature.
- It is also proposed to introduce an infringement fee of $2,000 for an approved taxi organisation failing to comply with legal requirements.
- I know the Minister takes taxi industry standards seriously and has also proposed to set eligibility criteria of people applying for a Passenger endorsement (taxi licence).
- Those persons, from the enactment date of the Land Transport Amendment Bill, convicted of serious criminal offences, such as murder, serious sexual offending, or serious violent offending, will be prohibited from applying for or holding a P endorsement.
- The public place their trust in the hands of taxi drivers; people have the right to feel safe riding in a taxi and to know they're going to get to their destination safely.
- There have been instances of serious misconduct of certain drivers, which reflects badly on the whole taxi industry.
- This measure seeks to address those concerns.

**Land Transport Management Bill**

- The Land Transport Management Bill will make some of the biggest changes to the funding and policy direction of land transport for 20 years.
- It is also the first transport legislation to implement the New Zealand Transport Strategy vision for land transport.
- The Bill remains before a Select Committee so I am limited in what I can say.
- There have been many useful submissions.
- Because of the complexities of some of the issues, the Committee has been given more time to fine-tune the Bill.
- The Bill sets out a strategic direction for land transport, removing the bias towards roading, and allowing an integrated approach to be taken to funding.
- In addition, it encourages long term planning, and introduces flexibility to the funding system to allow for innovation in the way land transport is funded.
- Social and environmental responsibilities are being enhanced, including more effective participation in the decision making process.
- The Bill also allows for tolling on new roads, whether built by Transit, local authorities or as Public/Private Partnerships. This offers the potential to accelerate a number of major projects.
- Public/Private Partnerships will help New Zealand tackle its shortage of transport infrastructure, which could hold back economic growth if not addressed.
- They are also useful as a means of spreading costs when a number of high cost projects come on stream at one time.
- We have taken a cautious approach on tolling. The public will probably accept a toll for a new bridge, for example, but may be less happy to pay for a road that they consider they've already paid for.
- Submitters have asked for greater flexibility in this area, and the Select Committee is considering this.

**Operator Safety Rating System**

- The Operator Safety Rating System is the long awaited system that will assist to improve transport industry standards.
- The Minister spoke about the system in some detail at last year's conference.
- The LTSA is in the process of pulling together a specialist team to manage the development of the Operator Safety Rating System. It has recently contracted an ex-Director of Civil Aviation - Kevin Ward - to oversee the development of this project. This is a clear sign that the LTSA sees this as an important project and one that is beginning to gain momentum.
- As mentioned by the Minister last year, the safety risk profile of operators is based on several sources of information, each of which is considered in isolation.
- The Operator Safety Rating System seeks to assign an objective rating based on information such as:
  
  - crash involvement;
  - transport-related convictions of drivers and operators;
  - pass/fail rates of vehicle inspections; and
  - outcome of Police stops.
- Operators will be assigned a rating; those ratings will be Unsatisfactory, Conditional, Satisfactory or Superior.
- It is proposed that those who receive an "unsatisfactory" rating will be suspended from operating for 28 days and then rated again.
- Incentives and disincentives could be applied with an assigned safety rating. This could result in more or less frequent Certificate of Fitness inspections.
- A national register is proposed to hold the safety rating of all transport operators; the ratings will also be publicly available. This will allow the public to make an informed choice of what taxi company to use based on its rating.
- This new rating system has received positive support from the wider transport industry.

**Conclusion**

- Let me finish now by saying, there is still a lot of work to be done.
- The New Zealand Transport Strategy provides a framework for this government to address key transport issues in New Zealand.
- I acknowledge the New Zealand Taxi Federation has a part to play in assisting the government with its transport objectives by providing quality services to the community.
- The changes to the Driving Hours and Logbooks system and the implementation of the Operator Safety Rating system will provide a better operating environment for the taxi industry.
- However, the taxi industry must also take account of customer expectations and standards.
- The New Zealand Taxi Federation is an important organisation in the provision of public transport in New Zealand.
- I know we will continue to have an active working relationship with the New Zealand Taxi Federation and I look forward to relaying messages back to the Minister.
- Thank you again for inviting me here to speak with you.
