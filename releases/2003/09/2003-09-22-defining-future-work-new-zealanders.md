A new publication launched today looks at the big trends that are changing the future of work, and aims to help people take control of their working lives.

Work Trends sets out these medium and longer-term trends in an accessible way for those who advise students, employees and job seekers, employers and government. The audience it’s written for includes careers and human resource advisers, work brokers and those involved in planning or giving advice.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said New Zealand has come out of a twenty-year period of dramatic change in the economy and labour market.

“Few New Zealanders will be left untouched by future changes to our workforce, workplaces and economy.

“What will happen in a New Zealand for instance that has an older and more ethnically diverse workforce, with an economy fuelled by increasing taste for customised service?

“No one has a crystal ball to give predictions. But knowing about the trends that Work Trends discusses helps us control and plan for change,” Steve Maharey said.

In addition to launching Work Trends, Steve Maharey also announced today funding for six new research projects to help advance what New Zealanders know about the future of work.

These projects form part of the Department of Labour’s Future of Work programme. The programme provides research and information to help New Zealanders plan for the future - whether they’re an employer, a worker or someone looking to enter the workforce.

“The research from these projects will ensure we can understand and act on emerging trends, rather than just passively let change happen to us,” Steve Maharey said.

**Future of Work Research Fund**

One of the main roles of the Future of Work programme is to build knowledge about key economic and social trends that could affect the nature of work in New Zealand over the next 10 to 20 years. To this end, the programme is making available approximately $200,000 this year to fund research into the future of work in New Zealand.

The six projects commissioned for 2003 are:

·Learning information technologies in the workplace: Maori and older workers in the pulp and paper industry. Judy Hunter and Susan Reid (Workbase: The National Centre for Workplace Literacy and Language).

One of the most rapid and far-reaching changes in today’s workplace is in the area of information technology. If employees are to adapt to new technology, they will need investments in their learning, combined with job flexibility, knowledge and skills. This case-study research will provide detailed analysis of the nature of workplace learning, in regard to new workplace technology, for older Maori employees in the pulp and paper manufacturing sector.

·The future of work within households: understanding household-level changes in the distribution of hours of paid work. Paul Callister and Susan Singley (Callister & Associates).

Reflecting emerging concerns about the growth of “overwork” and “underwork” at individual and household levels, this study’s main aim is to describe patterns of paid work hours within various households. It will look particularly at the changing roles of men and women – in both the labour force as a whole, and within families and households.

·NZ accommodation providers and technology: impacts on workplace organisation and labour demand. Simon Milne, Elizabeth Roberts and David Mason (Auckland University of Technology).

Information and communication technologies (ICT) are changing the business of tourism. Some commentators have even suggested that ICT changes the very rules of tourism - with industry leaders being forced to adopt new managerial and strategic 'best practice'. This research will analyse in detail the nature and extent of technology uptake by New Zealand accommodation providers.

·Combining work and care – older workers, eldercare and the work-life balance. Judith Davey (New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing) and Sally Keeling (Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences).

This project will document the nature and extent of eldercare responsibilities among the workforce of the Wellington and Christchurch City Councils, and will look at the ways these employees combine work and care. It will document any measures the councils have to help employees meet these responsibilities. The project will also explore ways in which unpaid eldercare could be recognised and accommodated while maintaining efficiency and effectiveness in the workforce.

·Research into the transition from school to further education or training and work for rurally disadvantaged Maori youth aged 15-18 years in the Waikato sub-region of Thames-Coromandel. Sally Steedman.

Sally Steedman will research and provide detailed analysis of the state of Maori youth in regard to education, training programmes, and paid work – and identify their career aspirations. This research is based on the assumption that rurally isolated Maori youth have limited options when it comes to further education and/or training opportunities leading towards a meaningful career or work. Due to their isolation, rural Maori communities and in particular Maori youth, are significantly disadvantaged (even relative to urban).

·The changing demographic and qualifications structure of occupations. James Newell and Martin Perry (Monitoring Evaluation and Research Associates Ltd).

This research aims to provide an overview of how the age, sex and qualification profile of occupations has changed from 1991 to 2001, and will discuss the implications of these changes for the future of work within a select group of occupations, both nationally and in local labour markets.

Research and information is published on the Future of Work’s website at [www.futureofwork.govt.nz](http://www.futureofwork.govt.nz). The reports from the research funded this year will be published on the website by the end of July 2004.
