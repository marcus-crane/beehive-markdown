New Zealand will contribute NZ $1million towards the cost of providing a reliable electricity supply in Honiara. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark made the announcement during her visit to Honiara today.

“The restoration of a reliable electricity supply in Honiara is a priority. Without electricity the economy and society struggle to function effectively, and the quality of health and education services suffer. Reliable electricity supply is especially important in Honiara where the National Referral Hospital provides services for all of the Solomon Islands. Reliable services such as electricity and the water (the town water supply pumps run on electricity) are also essential for business and to attract investment.“

The reliability of the electricity supply in Honiara has deteriorated significantly over the last few years and consumers have experienced daily power cuts.

The Regional Assistance Mission, in which New Zealand is taking part, is working closely with the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority to improve services. A recently commissioned assessment estimated the cost of restoring a reliable electricity supply in Honiara at approximately NZ$2.5 million. The New Zealand funds will be a contribution towards these costs.
