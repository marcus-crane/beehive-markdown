The Communications Minister Paul Swain has received the draft report from the Commerce Commission investigation into unbundling the local loop network and the fixed public data network.

"This is an important issue for the country and has been a major undertaking by the Telecommunications Commissioner Douglas Webb, and I thank him for his work to date."

"I recommend that all those affected by the preliminary recommendation make submissions on this draft report, because it has major implications for the future of the telecommunications regime in this country."

Mr Swain says it would be inappropriate for him to comment further on the preliminary recommendations.

"I will be studying the draft report closely, and look forward to receiving the final recommendation from the Commerce Commission in December."
