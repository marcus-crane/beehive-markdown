Environment Minister Marian Hobbs has approved a range of actions aimed at Rotorua's polluted lakes.

Releasing a Ministry for the Environment report to her on Lake Rotoiti and other Rotorua lakes Marian Hobbs said her ministry will contract an expert in managing degraded lakes to advise and assist Environment Bay of Plenty and will also consider ways of financially supporting a community programme of action.

Rotorua's lake problems will also be included in a programme of action being developed for water by an MfE working group under the government's sustainable development policy.

Marian Hobbs said she will meet representatives of Environment Bay of Plenty in Wellington soon to discuss the Rotorua lakes.

"There are no quick, cheap and easy solutions to the problems with Rotorua lakes but they are nationally important for tourism and recreation," Marian Hobbs said. "Once Environment Bay of Plenty has completed its investigations and has a proposed action plan for Lakes Rotorua-Rotoiti I will consider further government involvement."

MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  
SubjectLake Rotoiti and other Rotorua lakes  
SummaryThe water quality and oxygen levels in Lake Rotoiti are poor and some have concerns that the lake will collapse this summer. Environment Bay of Plenty and Rotorua District Council are working constructively together towards producing a plan to hold steady the nutrients that feed the algal bloom and investigating short-term action to deal with the symptoms of degraded water quality. Local community action groups are concerned that the councils are doing the right things but appear to have insufficient urgency. Farmers, including managers of Maori tribal lands, consider that proposed action to reduce nutrient inflows will restrict their ability to use and develop their land when farming run-off is not the only cause of the problem. There are no quick, cheap and easy solutions to the problems with the Rotorua lakes, but they are nationally important for tourism and recreation. We believe that the issue is important enough for central government to be informed and consider possible responses.

Purpose  
1.The Lakes Water Quality Society, Environment Bay of Plenty and others have written to you about the wide public concern caused by the algal bloom on Lake Rotoiti earlier this year. The Local Government and Environment Select Committee also raised concerns about the condition of the lake. This paper reports on a Ministry investigation during which we talked to key stakeholder groups and suggests options for Ministry involvement.  
Background  
2.There are eleven major lakes around Rotorua. Several of the lakes have suffered water quality problems for decades and the situation appears to be getting worse. The fundamental problem is excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) stimulating algal growth, cyanobacteria blooms and weed growth. Concerns grew when Lake Rotoiti, one of the major trout fishing and recreational lakes in the North Island, was entirely closed last summer for swimming. The severe cyanobacteria blooms on Lakes Rotoiti and Rotorua have received considerable media attention. There are concerns that Lake Rotoiti will become anoxic (lose its remaining oxygen) in the next year or two and that all life in the lake will die.  
3.The regional and district councils have been criticised by community groups for lack of urgency in dealing with the problems and lack of cooperation. There have been calls from various parties for more substantial central government involvement. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has been following the issue and is committed to an investigation into ‘how can we actually move forward’.  
4.Rotorua is the largest settlement on a lake in this country. For many years the sewage from Rotorua city was disposed of in Lake Rotorua, which is connected to Lake Rotoiti by the Ohau Channel. In the late 1980s central government provided $30 million to assist in diverting the sewage to land treatment. Since then the nutrients in Lake Rotorua water have reduced significantly, but the sediments in both lakes still contain high levels. The algal bloom in Lake Rotoiti is fed by nutrients from a range of sources, including the lake sediments, farm run-off, septic tanks (most of the settlements around the lakes are not yet connected to a sewerage system), and groundwater (which can take some decades to reach the lakes).  
5.Environment Bay of Plenty says that the flow through the Ohau Channel from Lake Rotorua contributes more than 70 percent of the nutrients to Lake Rotoiti. For about half the year water from Lake Rotorua travels up to six kilometres up Lake Rotoiti, spreading nutrients up the lake. Over the last few years the depth down to which dissolved oxygen reaches in Lake Rotoiti has reduced year by year, so that the lake is close to losing the oxygen necessary to sustain fish and other life. The climate last summer had a strong influence on the algal bloom – similar warm weather this summer would increase the risk of the lake collapsing. The bloom generally starts about November.  
Perspectives of key stakeholders  
Local government  
6.We spoke to political leaders and senior staff of:  
a)Environment Bay of Plenty  
b)Rotorua District Council  
7.Environment Bay of Plenty is responsible for 11 lakes in the Rotorua area, of which five are below the target quality set in the proposed regional land and water plan. Some lakes have algal blooms every year. Action plans are being or will be developed for the five degraded lakes and working groups of key players are planned to help implement the action plans. Lake Okareka is a pilot for this work – Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti are a much more complex problem with many questions still to be answered. The councils see the problem of restoring these lakes to a healthy state as pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge.  
8.The action plans to reduce nutrient flows into the lakes are likely to include a combination of retiring riparian land, changing land use, establishing wetlands and installing sewerage connections. To help reduce the nutrients going into the lakes, Environment Bay of Plenty has included “Rule 11” in its proposed regional land and water plan. This rule would limit any new development or farm intensification that might increase the nutrients flowing into the five lakes. (A decision on Rule 11 is expected by the end of the year.) These proposals are long-term solutions – they may help prevent the lakes getting worse but they will not improve the water quality for many decades.  
9.As short-term “first aid” for Lake Rotoiti, Environment Bay of Plenty is also investigating and costing engineering solutions such as diverting water from the Ohau Channel directly down the Kaituna River to reduce the flow of nutrients from Lake Rotorua into Lake Rotoiti, water treatment options such as aeration, and chemical solutions such as activated clay treatment to reduce release of nutrients from the sediment. These options are expensive and there is a risk that they may not work. Before they spend money, the councils want to be sure that they will improve the situation, not make it worse. Staff expect to put recommendations to their councils by the end of the year.  
10.Both the political leaders and the senior staff of both councils told us that they are working well together. They have appointed a Senior Manager at Environment Bay of Plenty, Paul Dell, as their coordinator of action on the lakes. Research for the regional council is being carried out by council staff, NIWA and Waikato University.  
11.Environment Bay of Plenty has endowed a Chair in Lakes Water Quality and Management at the University of Waikato, currently held by Professor David Hamilton. He and his students have been carrying out research on the Rotorua lakes. This research appears to have the strong support of both the regional and district councils and the community action groups. They are concerned that Professor Hamilton’s application to the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology for research funding was turned down, even though it would have direct application not only in Rotorua but also for other lakes facing similar problems. The Foundation has also cut funding for research by Geological and Nuclear Sciences into groundwater flow and age assessment, which would also have been useful. (However, other Crown research institutes have received new funding to address nutrient losses from land to water.)  
12.The councils are very aware of central government involvement with action to improve water quality in Lake Taupo and hope for similar assistance with the Rotorua Lakes. They believe that the Rotorua lakes are also of national importance and that the problems with the lakes are greater than local government alone can deal with. They have been aiming to get all of their research and investigations completed before formally approaching central government for assistance, probably in March 2004, by when they expect to have a comprehensive plan.  
Community groups  
13.We spoke to representatives of:  
a)Lakes Water Quality Society  
b)West Rotoiti Action Group  
c)Lake Rotoiti Ratepayers and Residents Association  
d)Lake Okareka Residents Association  
e)Mourea Okawa Bay residents group  
14.The members of the community groups are mainly residents in settlements around Lake Rotoiti and other degraded lakes. While Lake Rotoiti is their main concern at present, they see its problems as part of a general trend in the Rotorua lakes. They are distressed about last summer’s closure of an important recreational lake because of health risks and see a high risk of the lake collapsing next summer – when all fish and other life would die from lack of oxygen and the lake would become smelly and unpleasant to live near. They regard this situation as a national environmental emergency.  
15.The community groups recognise that halting the degradation of the Rotorua lakes is a major challenge, let alone restoring them. They know that the possible solutions to the problems are difficult, both technically and politically – they affect people’s property rights and are likely to be expensive. However, the community groups claim that the response by the councils to the crisis in Lake Rotoiti has been ‘grossly inadequate’, lacks urgency, and has been marred by a history of tension between the regional and district council.  
16.The community groups know that it will be March before the councils’ proposals for an action plan are ready for consultation, and even longer before action gets under way. The experience of those already involved in the Lake Okareka action plan does not give them confidence that they will see something happening soon to improve Lake Rotoiti.  
17.The solutions proposed by the Lakes Water Quality Society are appointment of a co-ordinator to drive all lakes projects, the regional council to make an immediate start on the action plan for Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti, the district council to reduce nutrient inflows from stormwater and sewerage, and urgent investigation of water treatment and engineering solutions. They also want central government involvement, both organisationally and financially, as with Lake Taupo.  
Faming interests  
18.We spoke to farming and landowning interests in the area, including people from:  
a)Federated Farmers  
b)Ngati Whakaue Tribal Lands  
c)Te Arawa Federation of Maori Authorities  
19.There is a significant amount of agriculture in the catchments of Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti. The farmers told us that agriculture and forestry represents 56 percent of the local GDP (compared with tourism at 14 percent). Much of the land in the catchment is Maori-owned, some of it well-developed farmland and some still in gorse and scrub but with development potential. The views of Maori farming interests are similar to those of other farmers.  
20.The farmers told us that most of the waterways running into the lakes are already fenced off, farmers have carried out riparian planting and 75 percent have effluent systems that comply with the regional council’s requirements. (Much of the fencing was subsidised by central or local government.) The farmers are willing to work with Environment Bay of Plenty to develop nutrient budgets that will help farmers to manage their impacts on water quality.  
21.The farmers are concerned that no-one has yet asked what standard of water quality is acceptable to people in the region and what level of impact on the local economy is acceptable to achieve a higher quality. They have reservations about the scientific modelling used to underpin proposals such as Rule 11 and want the science to be peer-reviewed. They are very concerned that the impact of septic tanks on nutrients in the lakes has not been recognised or dealt with (eg, at the last inspection five years ago, 71 of 108 septic tanks in Mourea/Okawa Bay failed. This area of the lake is among the worst in terms of water quality). The farmers support the macro-economic research that has recently been commissioned by the regional council. Farmers are also engaging consultants to assess the impact of Rule 11 on their future income. They, and the district council, see a risk of Rule 11 reducing district economic output.  
22.Overall, the farmers feel that all parties need to recognise their contribution to the problems in the lakes, rather than expecting farming families and Maori landowners to carry an unfair share of the burden. Equity is a key issue for them. If Rule 11 is modified, as requested by the district council, to exclude septic tanks and residential areas, it would become an agricultural rule. It would then constrain further development, such as switching to dairying and limit economic use of the undeveloped Maori land, but not limit subdivisional development. The farmers would appeal against the rule, and would ask for compensation for the loss of potential future earnings. (Legal analysis undertaken for our Lake Taupo work shows that compensation is not payable under the Resource Management Act for this type of land use restriction. Such rules, however, face compliance challenges.)  
Te Arawa Maori Trust Board  
23.The Crown is currently involved in Treaty of Waitangi Settlement negotiations with Te Arawa for claims to the lakes. The Trust Board is part of a joint Rotorua Lakes Management Strategy with Environment Bay of Plenty and Rotorua District Council, but has not really participated because of the Rotorua lakes Treaty claim. However, the Trust Board is committed to the relationship with local government and wants to be part of an ongoing partnership. They are concerned about the quality of the Rotorua lakes and suggested that the issues be managed locally as much as possible.  
24.In addition to the stakeholder groups above, we also spoke to Steve Chadwick, MP for Rotorua, three senior scientists from NIWA who have expertise in lakes, and local journalists.  
Our observations  
25.There is a good chance that Lake Rotoiti will lose much of its remaining oxygen this summer. If this happens, the fish and all life in the lake will die and it will become an unpleasant and smelly place. However, there is no simple, quick or cheap solution to the problems with Lake Rotoiti and other stressed lakes in the Rotorua area.  
26.The issue of Lake Rotoiti is one for the regional and local people to manage – but the lakes are nationally important for tourism and recreation. The problem of land use impacts on lakes water quality is nation-wide. The local people have legitimate concerns that the problems are so pressing that the councils cannot wait for a normal Resource Management Act timeframe to deal with the causes of the problems.  
27.We consider that the political leaders and senior staff of Environment Bay of Plenty and Rotorua District Council are working constructively together to address the problems with the lakes. They intend to have a proposed ‘response plan’ for Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti ready by March 2004.  
28.The councils need to manage both reducing nutrients in the lakes in the long term and the short-term symptoms such as loss of oxygen. It is likely that the proposed response plan will preserve the status quo but not cure the problems. While the plan will be based on the best available science, science will not be able to give a firm recipe for a cure. Effective action to solve the lake problems will require a major effort. All sources of nutrients, particularly intensive sources, will need to be managed. Local government needs to move as quickly as possible to install a sewerage system that will control the problem of septic tanks near Lake Rotoiti. We have already expressed our general support for Rule 11 through a statutory submission.  
Options for central government involvement  
29.Environment Bay of Plenty is keen to brief you about the issues with the Rotorua Lakes and the work that they and Rotorua District Council are undertaking to address the problems. They have offered to come to Wellington to meet with you. We understand that you have agreed to this meeting.  
30.Options for the Ministry to become involved in the process include:  
a)Meeting regularly with Environment Bay of Plenty and the Rotorua District Council to monitor progress with their investigations and discuss further central government involvement  
b)Asking the Working Group on the Water Programme of Action to include the Rotorua lakes among the issues they are working on  
c)Engaging an expert in managing degraded lakes to advise Environment Bay of Plenty on managing the short-term symptoms in the lakes. We know experts who have managed similar situations in Australian lakes.  
d)Commissioning work on identification of alternative low nutrient/high return land uses and sharing similar work undertaken at Lake Taupo  
e)Providing support through the Sustainable Management Fund for a community liaison and action programme similar to the landcare-type activity undertaken by the Taieri Trust in Otago.  
A number of these options will require significant resources.  
Recommendation  
I recommend that you:  
(a)Note the views of the stakeholder groups as outlined above and the Ministry’s observations on our discussions with them  
(b)Agree to meet with representatives of Environment Bay of Plenty in Wellington as soon as possible for a briefing on the situation at Lake Rotoiti and to discuss central government involvement  
(c)Note that the Ministry intends to ask the Working Group on the Water Programme of Action to include the Rotorua lakes among the issues they are working on  
(d)Agree to the Ministry contracting an expert in managing degraded lakes to advise and assist Environment Bay of Plenty in managing the short-term symptoms  
(e)Note that the Ministry intends to discuss with Environment Bay of Plenty options for the Sustainable Management Fund to support a community programme of action  
(f)Note that the Ministry will discuss with you further central government involvement in this issue once Environment Bay of Plenty has completed its investigations and has a proposed action plan for Lakes Rotorua-Rotoiti  
(g)Agree to the release of this report to the key stakeholders.

Rotorua Lakes  
Background

There are 11 decent sized lakes in and around Rotorua. Lakes are extensive holes in the ground filled with water. Mostly the water comes from rain. The rain either gets to the lakes quickly through overland flow and streams, or slowly by seeping through the ground. On its journey to the lake, water picks up plant food (or nutrients) from the land.

Some of the lakes are interconnected and may overflow to each other.

Plants grow in the water in the lakes. In order to grow, the plants need only plant food and light for photosynthesis. When there is a regular amount of plant food, there is generally a resident population of water plants that grow there. When there is too much plant food, there can be virtual population explosions of fast-growing, mobile little plants called algae. The excess of algae is unpopular because it can smother out other life in the lake, and is considered to be water pollution.

There always have been algae explosions in the lakes near Rotorua, and there always will be. The trouble now is that they come more often; they stay much longer, and in some cases may become fixtures. Too much algae for too long smothers out everything else, and the lake may die.

Plant Food

The problem is too much algae. The cause of the problem is too much plant food that makes the algae grow and reproduce.

It would seem to obvious that if we know how much plant food is needed to grow algae, then we reduce the plant food to less than that, and the problem is fixed. Unfortunately this is not a case of what you see is what you get.

Firstly the science is at best approximate, and it always will be. There is a case for more and better science, but it will only ever give answers in generalities.

Secondly all plant foods are not equal. (the growth responses are not linear). Likely the algae risk from concentrated plant foods from septic tanks is greater than the same amount of plant food at lower concentration coming from rural sources. Conversely for some lakes the main source of new plant food is from rural sources.

Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the plant food comes in three different forms of availability to drive algae growth.

The immediate form of plant food is mineral dissolved in water. It is the smallest fraction of the plant food, and is the only form that the algae can eat today. In terms of immediacy it is equivalent to our food on the table at mealtime. It is immediately measurable and immediately available. It comes mainly from fresh inputs of contaminated water, but may come from being released from the other two less-available forms. Algae growth cant necessarily be reduced by controlling today’s inputs of plant food, but certainly the growth cant be reduced if today’s inputs are not controlled.

The intermediate form of available plant food is in short-term storage. If you like it is equivalent to our food stored in the cupboard. Some of it is packaged, but over the medium term quite a lot of it can be available if our table is depleted. In lakes this is food in living or recently dead plant material, or attached to fine soil particles, suspended throughout the water of the lake. This intermediate form tends to hang around for a while, and depending on conditions, may turn into the immediately available form, or even slip off into long term storage.

The least available form of plant food is in long-term storage. It has accumulated over the history of plant food inputs to the lake, and is now in the sediments at the bottom of the lake. If you like it is equivalent to us having dried food for an emergency stored in the basement. For the lakes around Rotorua, that basement now has much more stored food than it used to and some of it is spilling out onto the table. Changes to conditions like temperature, water flow etc has always caused some to spill out, and the algae population has always exploded to eat it up. These days there is so much plant food in the basement (sediment) that less change of conditions is needed to make it spill out, and the spilling may happen more often than not.

The large amounts of plant food in storage in the sediments means that removing the day-to-day inputs will not remove the risk of algal growth from the most polluted lakes. Even with no more external inputs of plant food, there is likely enough there to feed algae for years.

What to do and what not to do?

It is possible to use weedicides to kill off most of the algae (and most other things) but they breed up again while you watch.

If we decide that killing algae is a waste of effort, there are three basic strategies – manage the cause, manage the symptoms, or change the rules.

Manage the cause

The cause is too much plant food that is available to algae; if you like, on the table.  
Some of the lakes have a level of plant food that they can cope with in most circumstances. For these the objective is to manage the inputs of plant food at a level such that they continue to cope.

In the most polluted of the lakes it is unlikely that the problem can be managed with the present rate of inflow of plant food. For some lakes most of the excess of plant food is directly or indirectly from farms. For some lakes it is mainly from urban run-off, including sewage (septic tanks). For some lakes (e.g. Rotoiti) it may be inflow from other lakes (Lake Rotorua) that the other lake can cope with but they can’t.  
It is not certain that fixing the rate of plant food going into the lakes will solve the problem. It may be that the spilling out of the stored food will be sufficient to feed the algae.  
Conversely the problem of the excess algae will not be managed if the present rate of inflow of plant food continues.

It seems likely that it will be necessary to cap the plant food input to those lakes that are coping, and reduce the inputs to those that are not coping. This means obvious things like reticulated sewerage with compulsory connection and no more building without it around polluted lakes like Rotoiti (it doesn’t have it now despite the level of development), and less obvious things like constraints or reductions on agricultural inputs. Even these activities will not give guaranteed improvements, and certainly not immediately, because of the large amounts of plant foods already in storage in the sediments.

Remember also that this is not and never will be exact science.

Manage the Symptoms

Algae smother other life for oxygen and light. There can be some relief from strand –type algae by harvesting them with special machines and removing them from the lake. Unfortunately the algae of concern here are so tiny as to be not harvestable.  
Another technique is to introduce extra oxygen to make up for that used up by the algae. Oxygen can be introduced via water fountains, air pumps, or even by changing internal patterns of flow and mixing in the lake. The introduction of new sources of clean water can also help. Certainly these are worth considering in some areas whilst there is longer term attack on the causes. Furthermore, if oxygen levels are kept high, there is less release of plant food from the stored sources in the water column and lake sediment.

Again the science is not exact, and some cautious adaptive management approach would be necessary.

Change the Rules

The first rule that may be changed is the balance between plant food in the sediment and plant food released to be immediately available for algae growth. As above, oxygen keeps that balance away from release from the sediments. More direct impact may come from adding to the lake clay-like materials that absorb plant food and sink to the bottom.

The second possible rule change is the natural flow of waters. It is possible to divert away sources like inflowing waters (even natural) with high amounts of plant foods. This may be particularly pertinent in Rotoiti which receives plant food in excess from Rotorua, and from thermal springs.

Such changes are likely expensive, and need to be weighed against the risk both of failure in this inexact area, and secondary impacts elsewhere that might eventuate.

Timing for Decisions

The timing for decisions-making is soon. The EBOP-led investigations will produce plans for consideration by around March 2004. A reasoned investigation and proposal takes this reasonable amount of time.

Unfortunately the past warm season was accompanied by more algal growth than expected especially in Rotoiti. We can not predict if the next warm season is going to be better, the same or worse. If it is worse the impacts could be undesirable and the longevity of those impacts is unknown.

It would seem timely to make some strong decisions within the next year, and to prepare for either rapid response or ameliorative positions even faster than that.

(As important but less urgent there are at least two other issues, which would be prominent if our attention was not focused on algae. The lakes are carrying too much suspended soil from run-off, and there is significant alien invasion of waterweeds.)
