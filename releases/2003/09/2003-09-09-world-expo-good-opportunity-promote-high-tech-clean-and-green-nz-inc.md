Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that New Zealand will participate in the 2005 World Expo in Aichi, Japan.

Helen Clark said the World Expo presents a good opportunity to build on the well-established reputation of New Zealand and its industry and tourism to the Japanese and international audience.

“The primary focus of the 2005 World Expo will be on the environment and technology, which ties in strongly with the government’s drive to develop an innovative, high tech economy which enhances New Zealand’s environment and quality of life.

“We will use those themes to promote New Zealand Inc – the way government and the private sector are working together to build a dynamic new economy in an environmentally sustainable way.

“Japan is New Zealand’s third largest trading partner, and an important source of investment, tourism, and students. The economic relationship is worth close to $5 billion to our two countries. Put simply, the Japanese relationship and market are too important for New Zealand not to participate in the expo.

“New Zealand and Japan co-operate closely on many issues and our peoples travel widely between our two countries. Participating in the 2005 World Expo will help build on the warm bilateral relationship as we seek to take it to a new level of engagement.”

Helen Clark said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and Tourism New Zealand will be the government agencies involved in the project. The private sector is being approached for support, and some has already been expressed.

Around 110 countries have committed to participating in the Expo, including Australia, Canada, most members of the European Union, and many Asian countries.

The participation is expected to cost up to $8.5 million. The last World Expo at which New Zealand participated was the Seville Expo in Spain in 1992.
