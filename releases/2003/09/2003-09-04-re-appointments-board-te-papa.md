The re-appointment of members of the Board of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa was announced today by Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Dr Roderick Deane, currently Chair of the Board, has been re-appointed to the position for a further term of three years. Dr Deane, chairman of Telecom, was first appointed to the Board in 2000.

Current members John Judge and Jenny May have been re-appointed to the Board for a further term of three years expiring 30 June 2006. Professor Judith Binney, Ms Glenys Coughlan and Mr David Gascoigne have also been re-appointed: Professor Binney and Ms Coughlan for terms of two years to 30 June 2005 and Mr Gascoigne for a period of one year to 30 June 2004.

“These re-appointments will ensure continuity and enable the Board to retain the benefit of their experience and expertise,” said Judith Tizard.  
The Museum was established as a "national forum to present, explore and preserve both cultural heritage and environmental knowledge in order to better understand and treasure the past, enrich the present, and meet the challenges of the future".  
The principal functions of the Board are to collect works of art and items relating to history and the natural environment, and to conserve and exhibit the national collections and to make those collections accessible to the public. The Museum also has research and educational roles, and is developing a National Service, in co-operation with other New Zealand museums, to provide adequate support to institutions and organisations holding objects or collections of national importance.
