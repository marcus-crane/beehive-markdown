Health Minister Annette King today launched a Ministry of Health document that aims to improve the quality of health care in New Zealand: Improving Quality (IQ): A Systems Approach for the New Zealand Health and Disability Sector.

“New Zealand already offers very high quality health services and many people are committed to improving quality, but there is always room for further improvements,” said Ms King.

"The Improving Quality approach is about New Zealanders receiving safe, quality services that continually improve and put people at the heart of the health system.”

The launch took place at the 3rd Asia Pacific Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care at Auckland's Aotea Centre today.

Ms King said the Improving Quality approach is important in a complex health sector, with decisions being made by a range of people, teams and organisations.

"Building a culture that improves quality involves everyone in the health and disability sector and requires strong leadership at all levels. Improving Quality will be central to achieving our vision for New Zealand's health and disability sector."

The 3rd Asia Pacific Forum has put New Zealand's health system in the international spotlight. Attended by almost 1000 international and national experts, the Forum was organised by two of the world's most prestigious health organisations - the British Medical Journal Publishing Group and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement from the United States.

Improving Quality is available on the Health Ministry website: www.moh.govt.nz

Questions and Answers

What prompted the creation of IQ?  
IQ is the Minister of Health's response to requirements in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 and advice from the National Health Committee. A high performing system in which people have confidence is one of the seven fundamental principles of the New Zealand Health Strategy and quality is also reflected in many of the New Zealand Disability Strategy's objectives.

Is IQ in line with international developments in quality improvement?  
The subject of patient safety and the quality of health care has gained increasing momentum internationally as a major focus of attention in professional and health policy circles. IQ's systems approach to quality improvement is consistent with international developments, such as the work by Dr Don Berwick of the United States Institute for Healthcare Improvement, that have highlighted the importance of such an approach.

How will IQ remain up to date?  
The strategy will be updated using a quality improvement approach and involve sector input. IQ contains an action plan that will be updated at least every three years with sector input. Progress in implementing nationally consistent quality assurance standards and quality assurance programmes will be reported annually to the House of Representatives.

How does New Zealand compare internationally in quality improvement?  
The latest issue of the British Medical Journal highlights New Zealand as a world leader in its commitment to improving the health of indigenous  
people. Equity is an important measure of quality improvement. In the past, more emphasis has often been placed on technical safety and effectiveness  
than access to services and equity. However, failing to reach Maori and other indigenous peoples effectively is a quality issue

What are the key dimensions of quality in the health and disability system?  
The key dimensions are people-centred, access and equity, safety, effectiveness and efficiency.

What other initiatives are being taken throughout the sector to improve quality?  
Many initiatives are being taken across the sector, including:  
·The recognition of excellence by several District Health Boards through local quality awards. Examples include Counties Manukau's Science Feast; Waitemata's Clinical Board Awards; Waikato's Best of Health Awards and Canterbury's Quality and Innovation Awards. A key aim of the awards is to promote the sharing of innovative products, services and processes.  
·The Government is introducing changes to improve complaints processes and to ensure health professionals retain their competence as part of a comprehensive bill to address safety and quality in the health sector  
·Over the last three years the Ministry of Health has released Towards Clinical Excellence, a series of publications to help practitioners and managers work to improve clinical quality in the New Zealand public health system.  
·The Ministry of Health has issued Reportable Events Guidelines that provide guidance on processes and systems for organisational reporting and the management and investigation of incidents, accidents and hazards.  
·Accreditation of many health and disability support service providers by a range of accreditation agencies.  
·Implementation of practice standards for primary health care by general practices.
