The vote on the meat and wool industry referendum was a pleasing result, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said the result was a very clear mandate from livestock farmers to the leadership of the industry.

“It is a ringing endorsement of the proposals that were put forward.”

Mr Sutton said that given the complexity of the structures, it was a remarkable achievement.

Legislation will be needed to implement the proposals approved by the referendum. Mr Sutton said officials were working on this with industry leaders now.
