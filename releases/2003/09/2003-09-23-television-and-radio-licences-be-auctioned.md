An auction for additional television, AM & FM broadcasting licences will commence on 18 November 2003, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Communications Minister David Cunliffe said today.

In May this year the government announced the intention to allocate some additional licences. The auction will consist of long-term licences for all the temporary commercial broadcasting licences issued in recent years and for two new commercial FM licences in Auckland, where strong demand is expected.

Steve Maharey said the auction will enable some new broadcasters to start up, adding further choices for listeners.

“In particular, the auction will enable more stations to get access to the Auckland radio market.

“Remaining upper FM radio spectrum will be retained in the meantime. This will ensure the government retains the flexibility to respond to future needs and also enables innovative new ways of licensing the band to be explored, such as closer channel spacing,” Steve Maharey said.

“As with previous radio spectrum auctions, bidding will be completed using an internet auction system”, said David Cunliffe.

An Auction Catalogue will be published by the Ministry of Economic Development in mid-October on the following web site: [http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/auctions](http://www.med.govt.nz/rsm/auctions).
