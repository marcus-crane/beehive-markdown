"The rejection today by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of the Air New Zealand-Qantas deal is disappointing but not unexpected given the tenor of the ACCC's draft determination," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"I am advised that both Air New Zealand and Qantas will apply for review of the decision. It remains Air New Zealand's very strong view that the proposed strategic alliance with Qantas is the best way to secure the company's future as a viable international airline.

As the New Zealand Commerce Commission is currently in deliberation on the same proposal, it is not appropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage," Dr Cullen said.
