Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia today called on three outstanding health professionals to continue to develop their careers for the benefit of their whanau and tangata whenua generally.

Mrs Turia was presenting Dr John McLeod Scholarships, worth $4,000 each, to Lorraine Brooking, of Ngati Porou, Lincoln Nicholls, of Ngati Raukawa, and Segina Te Ahuahu, of Nga Puhi and Te Arawa descent.

"All round the country, health is probably the number one development priority for whanau and hapu. We have been making huge progress in terms of getting our own health providers established, and delivering services tailored to the needs of our communities," Mrs Turia said.

"The Mäori Health Scholarship programme is a practical way the government can help boost the numbers, and develop the skills, of Mäori health professionals.

"This year 802 applications came in for Mäori Health Scholarships, which is 200 more than last year. Due to the high calibre of all those applications, 468 scholarships were awarded.

"Of all the scholarships awarded this year, the Dr John McLeod is the most prestigious. Students do not apply, they are awarded to outstanding students who excel academically, while maintaining strong links with whänau, häpu, iwi and the wider community.

"Dr John McLeod, of Ngä Puhi descent, had a distinguished career both nationally and internationally. His contribution to improving the health status of our people, and his work in public health, was second to none. His outstanding medical research and management career ended with his premature death in 1994 in a car accident.

"Recipients of such a prestigious scholarship are seen as future leaders, as authorities in their chosen field, and advocates for the people. Therefore, the honour of receiving this scholarship bears great expectation.

"You are a part of the next generation, you must strive to surpass the precedent he set, for commitment and contribution to improving Mäori health," she said.

Mrs Turia also thanked the whanau members who came in support of their young leaders.

"Your presence has great significance. You demonstrate that these young people belong to whanau, hapu and wider communities. By your presence, we know that you appreciate the value of whanau support, and we are reassured that these young people have been brought up to understand their obligations to others.

"A sense of belonging to a collective, and being responsible for others, is the essence of whanau ora - and the key to our future health and well-being," she said.

**Lorraine Brooking** - of Ngäti Porou, Ngäriki ki Mangatü descent, is completing her PhD at Otago University. Lorraine is in her 3rd year of Bachelor of Medicine (MBChB) and 2nd Year of her PhD in Diabetes amongst Mäori.

Lorraine has received this scholarship before, and she remains an outstanding applicant who is actively contributing to improving Mäori Health. Lorraine is also active in community affairs, holding numerous voluntary roles.

**Lincoln Nichols** - of Ngäti Raukawa descent, is in his third year of Bachelor of Medicine (MBChB) at Otago University. Lincoln already has a Bachelor of Education, and a Diploma in Teaching & Bilingual Teaching. Lincoln has also received this scholarship in a previous year, but is another outstanding, all-round achiever academically, in sport, as a regional Rugby representative, and within Te Ao Mäori participating in Kapa Haka, Marae Health Clinics, and as a Te Reo Mäori Teacher.

**Segina Te Ahu Ahu** - of Ngä Puhi and Te Arawa descent, is in her final year of an LLB (Hons), BSocSc (Hons) and first year of a post-graduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology, for which study is by invitation only.
