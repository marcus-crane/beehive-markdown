The Tourism Research Council New Zealand’s (TRCNZ) latest forecasts show that the tourism sector is headed in the right direction, with visitor yield increasing at a rate nearly double that of visitor numbers

The forecasts were released today by Minister of Tourism Mark Burton, and predict a 5.7 percent growth in international arrivals annually, with international visitor expenditure increasing at 9.7 percent.

Mark Burton says that the forecasts have proved to be a very effective planning tool for the entire sector.

“Since I established it over three years ago, the TRCNZ annual forecasts have built up an impressive track record of accuracy. As a result, the forecasts provide a very solid basis upon which the industry can strategise for and invest in its future.

“Tourism has been experiencing a strong growth pattern over the past few years, and this year’s forecast certainly indicates a continuation of this positive trend—both in terms of visitor numbers and, even more importantly, in terms of visitor value.

“It is also significant to note that these forecasts detail the most likely outcome of maintaining the market’s current situation. Part of my role as Minister of Tourism is to aid the sector in outperforming these forecasts. By working together to make the relationship between visitor numbers and visitor value work even more in our favour, we will be able to build an even stronger, more sustainable tourism industry.

“New Zealand’s tourism sector already generates close to ten percent of New Zealand’s GDP, is directly and indirectly responsible for one in eleven jobs, supports over 15,000 businesses, and is one of our largest earners of foreign exchange.

“Today’s forecasts illustrate that the industry’s future will continue to contribute strongly to the New Zealand economy.”
