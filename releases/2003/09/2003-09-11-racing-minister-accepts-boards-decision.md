Racing Minister Damien O’Connor says the resignation of the [Auckland Racing Club](http://www.ellerslie.co.nz/) board last night was good for the industry.

Mr O’Connor said he agreed that the board had been unable to function properly.

“Everyone in the industry knew this; it’s a surprise, really, with the trenchant factional positions, that it lasted this long.”

The Minister’s Office discussed the matter with the ARC Board chairman Colin Devine, who explained the board’s rationale.

“Colin said they just couldn’t go on being at loggerheads all the time. It was not good for racing in Auckland, and for the industry as a whole.

“Auckland Racing Club is New Zealand’s most prestigious club. The club is pivotal not only because of its illustrious history, but also because it’s in the heart of the country’s largest population.”

Mr O’Connor said ARC members now needed to get on and choose a new board with the right balance of commercial and industry skills.

“The board needs a fresh mandate and a shared vision to take advantage of the combination of the recently passed Racing Act and new gambling laws.”

“Since the start of August the industry has had a strong and confident new Racing Board set up under the Racing Act 2003. Racing has a great future ahead, with plenty of scope for innovation and sustainable growth.”
