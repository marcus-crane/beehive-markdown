Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Jan Kelly as a District Court Judge. She will sit in Wellington from 8 October.

The 42-year-old gained an LL.B (Hons) from Canterbury University and was admitted to the bar in 1984. She retired from Simpson Grierson at the end of 2001, having spent 11 years with the firm. She had been a partner since 1994, the first woman partner to be appointed to Simpson Grierson’s Wellington office.

A commercial legal advisor with specialist expertise in competition law, Jan Kelly, together with other litigation partners, managed the litigation and dispute resolution department of the firm’s Wellington office from 1994 until 1998. The following year Jan Kelly established a technology practice in the Wellington office which became part of Simpson Grierson’s x-tech group of lawyers working full time in the technology sector.
