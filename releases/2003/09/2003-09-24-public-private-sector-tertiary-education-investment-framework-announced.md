The development of teaching and research partnerships between tertiary institutions and business is the aim of a new public-private sector investment framework outlined today.

The Partnerships for Excellence facility enables tertiary institutions to seek matching funding from government for large-scale investment projects (generally those valued at $10 million or more). It has been established to encourage greater private sector investment in tertiary education and to foster better linkages between tertiary institutions, business and industry.

Applications have been called today for matching government funding, closing with the Tertiary Education Commission on 21 November 2003.

Steve Maharey said the Partnerships for Excellence facility will create a climate for joint private-public sector investment to increase the capability of the public tertiary education sector to respond to New Zealand’s social and economic development needs.

“Partnerships for Excellence supports the goals of the Tertiary Education Strategy to increase the capability of New Zealand’s tertiary education system. It will enable institutions to access funding for significant new projects.

“It’s clear from the interest already shown in the facility that some innovative projects are likely to apply for funding. For example:  
·the government has already decided to contribute $25 million towards the development of a new business school at the University of Auckland, subject to matching contributions being obtained from donors, and  
· Ministers will shortly be considering a proposals for $25 million ‘Advancement Programme’ proposal by the University of Otago.

“To be eligible for a government funding contribution, projects need to be large scale, new and unable to be funded via other means. Private sector investment is expected to match that of government.

“Government funding will be provided either as a capital injection, or as a suspensory loan which may be converted to a capital injection upon the achievement of agreed outputs. An assessment panel established by the Tertiary Education Commission will consider individual projects, with funding for successful projects appropriated as part of the annual budget process,” Steve Maharey said.
