National's agriculture spokesperson David Carter has scaled new heights of irrelevance with his latest comments on funding for agricultural and Maori research, says Science Minister Pete Hodgson.

"Mr Carter says the investment of a small amount of public funding in research relevant to Maori knowledge and development is a 'slap in the face' for farmers, who are being asked to contribute increased funding for research into agricultural greenhouse gases.

"The Government is also funding health research, social research, economic research and environmental research. Presumably, according to Mr Carter's logic, these are just more slaps in the face for farmers.

"Taxpayers provide at least $40 million a year for research benefiting farmers. They will continue to spend a further $4.7 million a year on research into agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

"Faced with these facts, it takes a special kind of small-minded peevishness to complain about $1.9 million of funding for research benefiting Maori. This will include research into Maori health."
