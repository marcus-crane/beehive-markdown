Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today the appointment of Warwick Hunt as Chair of the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB). Mr Hunt has been appointed for a five-year term.

He replaces Liz Hickey who resigned in June to take up a senior management position at the International Accounting Standards Board.

Mr Hunt is a Partner and Line of Service Leader in the Assurance and Business Advisory Services at PriceWaterhouse Coopers. He is also a member of the New Zealand Management Board for PwC.

Mr Hunt is a technical accounting, audit and transaction service specialist with 20 years’ experience in leading accounting practices in New Zealand and South Africa. He specialises in the resolution of complex commercial, financial reporting; and governance related issues. He is actively involved in leading edge accounting and reporting developments, and is a well-published commentator on issues related to professional practice and external financial reporting.

“Mr Hunt’s expertise confirms that he is well-placed to step into this role and I am confident he will provide valuable leadership to this body. He comes to the position at a time of major change for the Board as New Zealand is set to adopt international financial reporting standards, changing the focus from standards setting to standards influencing and taking.

“In addition, the Australian Assistant Treasurer, the Hon Helen Coonan and I recently announced that we have asked officials and standards bodies to report to us on the prospects for closer trans-Tasman co-operation on accounting standards issues. Mr Hunt has exactly the expertise needed as New Zealand moves towards meeting these two exciting challenges.

Lianne Dalziel also thanked the Board’s Deputy Chair, John Spencer, for his work as acting Chair of the Board since 1 July.

**Role of the ASRB**  
The ASRB is a Crown entity established under the Financial Reporting Act 1993. It’s main function is to review and approve financial reporting standards and any amendments to the standards. The ASRB is responsible for:

- encouraging the development of financial reporting standards, including financial reporting standards for different classes of reporting entities; and
- liasing with the Accounting Standards Board in Australia with a view to harmonising New Zealand and Australian financial reporting standards.

In October 2002 the ASRB announced it would recommend, in principle, to the government the adoption of international standards by 2007 for listed issuers with an option to adopt earlier ie, by 2005. The decision was precipitated by the announcement that Australia would be adopting international standards by 2005. If agreed by the New Zealand government, the issues would be worked through over the next few years, with New Zealand working closely with Australia. Unlike the rest of the world, financial reporting standards in Australia and New Zealand are the same for the public and private sectors.

**Appointment of Members to the ASRB**  
The ASRB consists of between four and seven members appointed from time to time by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister. When considering appointments the Act requires the Minister to recommend candidates who have knowledge of, or experience in, business, accounting, finance, economics or law. New Zealand financial reporting standards are the same for the public and private sectors. Therefore within these disciplines it is important to have people with backgrounds in small and medium size enterprises, large corporates, the public sector and academia.
