The government shares the aspirations contained in a report on housing issues released today, says Housing Minister Steve Maharey.

The report by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) draws attention to the run-down and sell-off of New Zealand’s state housing stock by National during the 1990s and argues for the development of an effective social housing strategy.

Steve Maharey said ensuring more New Zealanders have access to affordable, quality housing has been a key achievement of the Labour-led government – and it is also at the centre of the New Zealand Housing Strategy and its associated programme of action, now under development and due to be finalised in 2004.

“Adequate housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of families and communities. The current government inherited a state housing system that had either been sold off or run down and we are working hard to rebuild a quality social housing sector as quickly as we can.

“There are a number of barriers to moving as fast as CPAG advocates. These include the lack of tradespeople to build the houses it wants to be constructed each year and the large cost of such programme even if it were possible.

“However a number of the initiatives suggested by CPAG are currently underway, for example:  
·the government will be building or acquiring over 3,200 new houses over the next four years, more than 70 percent of which will be in Auckland;  
·more than more than $172 million is being invested to modernise, enlarge or improve run-down existing state houses  
·we are trialling a mortgage insurance scheme in partnership with Kiwibank to help low to modest income earners buy their own homes; and  
·we are investing $63 million to encourage greater involvement in housing by local government and third sector groups such as iwi, churches and non-governmental organisations,” Steve Maharey said.
