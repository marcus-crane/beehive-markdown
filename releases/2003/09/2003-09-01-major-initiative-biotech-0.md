\[Joint statement with Hon Jim Anderton, Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development]

World-leading diabetes treatments will continue to be developed in New Zealand by Auckland biotechnology company, Protemix, which has just received a $2 million underwrite by Investment New Zealand for possible funding for Protemix from existing programmes provided by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology.

Protemix will also receive an $18 million capital injection by a New Zealand consortium headed by Birnie Capital Partners.

One of Protemix's diabetes drugs has already been fast tracked by the United States Federal Drug Administration because of its potential significance.

"I am very pleased that a collaboration between Investment New Zealand and Birnie Capital Partners has ensured that Protemix will continue its drug developments with a view to commercialising them internationally," said Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

Protemix has attracted significant interest from American venture capitalists for further development of its diabetes treatments. Along with the $18 million raised by Birnie Capital Partners, the Government's $2 million underwrite, is reflective of the Government’s commitment to grow the biotech industry in New Zealand.

Jim Anderton and Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson announced today that Investment New Zealand's Strategic Investment Fund will provide a $2 million guarantee for technology assistance support. Protemix will apply to FRST under its existing programmes and criteria and any difference between the available assistance through FRST and $2 million will be underwritten by Investment New Zealand.

Protemix develops new therapies for diabetes and associated cardiovascular disease, as well as for metabolic disorders. It has a number of diabetes-related drugs under development, including one potential "blockbuster" - capable of generating annual revenue of US$750 million or more - for diabetic heart disease. The compounds were developed by Protemix’s scientific team based at the University of Auckland led by internationally-regarded New Zealand biochemist Professor Garth Cooper and diabetes physician Associate Professor John Baker.

"Protemix is an example of the world class capability of the New Zealand biotech industry," Mr Hodgson said. "Its presence in New Zealand will inevitably attract more interest from overseas investors and give confidence to other biotech players that there is a commitment to help them take their discoveries through to commercialisation.

"This deal is a milestone in the development of a New Zealand biopharmaceutical industry. "It will help New Zealand retain and recruit the pool of scientists, business people and scientific entrepreneurs it needs to participate in the global biopharmaceutical market."
