Foreign Minister Phil Goff tonight expressed his deep sadness at the death of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh.

Ms Lindh died in hospital less than a day after being stabbed by an unknown assailant while shopping in a Stockholm department store.

“Anna’s death is a tragedy. She was a remarkable person whom I worked very closely with, and held enormous respect for,” Mr Goff said from Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia.

“She was immensely capable and had the potential to become the Prime Minister of Sweden.

"Anna hosted me in Stockholm in May 2001 for New Zealand's European Union Presidency consultations. New Zealand and Sweden share similar values and policies, and our working relationship was close and constructive.

“Her death is not only an enormous sadness to her family and friends but a great loss to Sweden and the international community.”
