A new $12 million fund to support trans-Tasman joint ventures in biotechnology is part of the Government's response to the report of the Biotechnology Taskforce, Science Minister Pete Hodgson announced today.

The fund, to be managed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, will offer partnership funding to New Zealand and Australian companies working together on biotechnology development, manufacturing and marketing.

The first call for proposals is due to be issued by July next year, with $3 million to be allocated in the first round. Further allocations will be made in 2005-06 and 2006-07. Eligibility criteria will be developed over the coming months.

Mr Hodgson said the fund addressed the Biotechnology Taskforce's recommendation that industry and government act to stimulate the formation of international biotechnology partnerships, with Australia noted as a priority.

The Biotechnology Taskforce was set up last year under the Growth and Innovation Framework, which identified biotechnology as one of three key sectors with high growth potential and economy-wide benefits.

The taskforce reported to the Government in May this year with 28 recommendations for action and an ambitious 10-year vision for the sector. This included increasing the value of biotechnology exports from the current $250 million to more than $1 billion a year.

Mr Hodgson said another important new initiative in response to the taskforce was a $2.3 million programme to support best practice in commercialising biotechnology research.

"The taskforce highlighted a need to improve the flow of good ideas from the lab to the market. This four-year programme will begin with an expert review of the state of our biotechnology research investment and its readiness for commercialisation. It will be followed up with workshops, seminars, individual mentoring and other measures to help scientists link their research to global market opportunities."

A further $1.2 million will be spent over the next four years to get better statistical  
information on the development of the biotechnology sector, to track its growth.

"Overall the taskforce recommendations are a good fit with the Government's policies and initiatives to promote growth and innovation," Mr Hodgson said.

"This means most of the actions the taskforce suggests are being addressed by existing Government policy and work programmes. In this year's Budget, for example, we established a $4.8 million pre-seed fund that will help the commercialization of biotechnology research."

Mr Hodgson said he was pleased to see the biotechnology sector acting on the taskforce recommendations directed at the industry, including the establishment of a single industry body.

A new organisation – New Zealand Bio – was launched today from the merger of the industry group BIOTENZ and the New Zealand Biotechnology Association. It will receive $1.3 million of support funding from the Government over three years.

Biotechnology will also benefit from new cross-sectoral programmes designed to help growth and innovation in all target sectors. These were announced by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today and include science and technology education initiatives and a fund to support projects aimed at building capability within sectors.
