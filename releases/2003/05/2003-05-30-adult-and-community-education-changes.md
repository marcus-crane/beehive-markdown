Associate Education Minister, Marian Hobbs, has announced changes in the provision of adult and community education through schools.

"The first major step in the reforms is consolidating the funding sources under the direction of the new Tertiary Education Commission," Marian Hobbs said.

To minimise the effect on the 248 schools now delivering adult and community education, the transition will be done in several steps. Schools have been notified of the changes, and consultation is under way on the issues involved.

The key messages to schools are:

ØSchools will continue to be major providers of Adult and Community Education, funded to continue with their planned programmes in 2004.

ØThe 248 school providers will receive a total monetary grant based on the average use of tutor hours over the past three years.

ØThe Tertiary Education Commission will manage the funding and accountability from January 2004.

ØSchools will receive their funding in regular grants and will meet all expenses of ACE from that funding. Boards of Trustees will be accountable for the funding received for those purposes.

ØStaff will continue to be covered by the respective industrial agreements.

ØSchools will have the transition year to reshape their programmes to meet the Government’s priorities for adult and community education. New funding arrangements will be in place for 2005.

"I am confident that the changes to take place over time, will strengthen considerably the provision of education to adult learners and community groups," Marian Hobbs said.
