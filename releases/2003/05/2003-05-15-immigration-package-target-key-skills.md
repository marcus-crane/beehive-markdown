Funding initiatives to support the active recruitment of migrants who will contribute to New Zealand's skill and growth needs and settle well are included in Budget 2003.

Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said the funding confirmed the government's commitment to achieving positive outcomes for new migrants and New Zealand.

"For several months, I have signalled the need for New Zealand to shift from being a passive recipient of immigration applications to an active recruiter of the skills and talent we need. This announcement will enable NZIS to put in place the infrastructure to do just that.

"It will allow the NZIS to more actively match skilled migrants with actual opportunities in New Zealand so that they are able to contribute to, and participate in, New Zealand society and the economy sooner. It will also allow the NZIS to enter new markets such as the United States to recruit migrants who could provide a positive return for New Zealand.

"The Skilled/Business stream of the NZ Immigration Programme is where we need new migrants to 'hit the ground running'. It is good for the new migrant and it is good for New Zealand - a win-win," Lianne Dalziel said.

The package will be allocated $7.6 million in operating funding in 2003-04, $10.323 million in 2004-05, $11.537 million in 2005-06 and $3.527 million a year thereafter. Capital funding of $5.7 million will be allocated next year and $5.3 million across the following two years.

Lianne Dalziel said the measures would tie in well with the Pilot Regional Immigration Schemes signed off by her and Progressive leader Jim Anderton, as Minister of Economic Development, last year. Evaluation of the pilots later this year would no doubt lead to an expansion of the initiative especially in light of the targeting of skills needed to enhance regional development.
