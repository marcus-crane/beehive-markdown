The Labour Progressive Coalition Government is increasing the excise duty charged on some alcoholic beverages in order to promote safer communities by discouraging underage teenagers and children from misusing alcohol.

Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton introduced the Customs and Excise (Alcoholic Beverages) Amendment Bill, legislation that will raise the excise duty on alcoholic beverages that contain between 14% and 23% alcohol by volume.

"This is an important piece of legislation to address a serious challenge being faced by far too many New Zealand families," Jim Anderton said.

"The law change increases the excise duty on beverages that contain more than 14%, but not more than 23%, of alcohol by volume. The products that mainly fall into this category are the very cheap light spirits often used by young people," Jim Anderton said.

"The drinking habits of too many young New Zealanders are of great concern. Recent surveys have shown an increase in the level of heavy drinking amongst the young. This trend is both dangerous and unacceptable to our society and the Labour Progressive Government is committed to take steps to reverse it," Jim Anderton said.

Studies indicate that young people's purchases of alcohol are particularly sensitive to price and that excise duties have an important role to play in managing their consumption of alcohol.

The Progressive leader, who chairs the Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs, introduced the new law in his capacity as Acting Minister of Customs.

Background:

·Affecting the price of alcoholic beverages has been identified internationally as one of the key ways of reducing the amount of alcohol consumed by young people and heavy drinkers. Young people and heavy drinkers are particularly susceptible to the price of alcohol so increasing the price of alcohol through an increase in excise duty should result in decreased consumption by young people and heavy drinkers.

·Minimising the harm caused by alcohol and illicit and other drug use, to both individuals and the community, is a key priority for the Labour Progressive Government. It is using strategies of supply control, demand reduction, and problem limitation to achieve its aim of harm minimisation.

·The drinking habits of young New Zealanders are of great concern. Recent surveys have shown an increase in the level of heavy drinking amongst young people. Survey data show that the proportion of young women aged 14-17 years “who drank four drinks or more in one sitting at least once a week" increased from 15% in 1998 to 28% in 2001. In addition to an increase in heavy drinking in young women, survey data show there was also an increase in the proportion of young men who are drinking excessively.

·The survey also showed that 58% of young men aged 14-17 years and 51% of young women aged 14-17 years reported drinking enough to feel drunk at least once a month.

·Further action may well be needed to address the serious issue of heavy drinking by young New Zealanders and the Labour Progressive Government will be guided by independent research.

·The Alcohol Advisory Council (ALAC) commissioned economist, Brian Easton, to produce a report on the current excise regime for alcohol.

·This Bill puts into effect the recommendation in the Easton report relating to the excise duty on light spirits. The change means that alcoholic beverages in the 14-23% alcohol by volume range will be taxed according to their actual alcohol content, rather than all being levied as though they contain 18% alcohol by volume. The changes also mean that the products will be taxed at the higher rate – the same rate that full-strength spirits are taxed at. This will remove the tax advantage that the light spirits currently receive. This will mean that young people will not be able to afford to buy as much alcohol as they currently do. Their $10 pocket money won’t be able to buy them a bottle of gin. They’ll drink less alcohol, get less drunk, and cause less harm.

·While light spirits have been identified as a particular problem area, it is necessary to apply the higher rate of excise duty to all products containing between 14% and 23% alcohol (including wine-based products such as sherry and port). This is necessary to ensure that these products do not become an alternative source of low-priced, higher alcohol content beverages, as happened in other countries like Australia if this potential problem is not dealt with adequately.

·It is estimated that, on current consumption levels, the increase in the excise duty will raise approximately $18 million in the 2003/04 financial year. However, as the aim of the increase in excise duty on light spirits is to reduce demand from young drinkers and heavy drinkers, the increase in duty will probably decrease the consumption of light spirits. Therefore, additional revenue may be lower than estimated.

·All excise duty collected goes into general revenue. However, increased revenue will indirectly offset the estimated $405 - $875 million net fiscal costs of alcohol consumption. Decreased harms resulting from lower demand by young drinkers and heavy drinkers for light spirits will reduce net fiscal costs of alcohol consumption.

·The changes will have no impact on the price of so-called alco-pops. Alco-pops generally have about 5% alcohol by volume and do not fall into the 14%-23% alcohol range that is affected by the excise duty changes. Light spirits are of greater concern at the moment than alco-pops as the price of light spirits currently allows young people to purchase a greater quantity of alcohol for a less amount of money.
