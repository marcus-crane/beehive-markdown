Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia says yesterday's passing of the Maori Television Service (Te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi Maori) Bill will mark a new era in New Zealand broadcasting, and more importantly in Maori broadcasting.

The legislation establishes the Maori Television Service as a statutory corporation, providing it with the full powers and abilities to proceed with the development of the Maori television channel.

Mr Horomia said a dedicated Maori Television channel has been a long time coming, eagerly awaited by Maori and non-Maori around the country.

"I am proud to be part of a Government that has remained focused on its commitment to promoting and protecting Maori language and culture and providing an outlet for showcasing Maori achievement".

"I feel confident that the vast majority of New Zealanders will be active viewers of the channel. For Maori in particular the channel will provide a new opportunity to interact with the Maori language and culture, to learn, and to be entertained. It will also provide opportunities for the present social and economic development of Maori to be better understood. The channel will assist to inspire us all, and to challenge us about who we are".

Mr Horomia said the amendments recommended by the Maori Affairs Select Committee provide greater clarity in some areas and will assist those parties who have to work with the legislation.

The Minister says today would not have been possible without significant consultation, negotiation and agreement by many Maori groups in particularly the NZ Maori Council, Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, Te Awhiorangi (the Reo Maori Television Trust) and Te Putahi Paoho (the Maori Television Service Electoral College).

"While yesterday was significant, there is still a lot of work ahead of the Maori Television Service to ensure the channel goes to air later this year."
