More Polytechnics have lined up to address their region’s skill shortages and will receive support from the Labour Progressive Coalition Government through the Polytechnic Regional Development Fund.

Regional and Industry Development Minister, Jim Anderton and Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey today announced the results of the second round of funding under the Polytechnic Regional Development Fund.

“I am pleased to see seven more polytechnics and institutes of technology will be working more actively to address local skill and development priorities working with local industries and businesses. A key factor in today’s announcements is that some of the funding will contribute to key nationwide priority industries including biotechnology, information and computer technology, and wood processing,” said Jim Anderton.

Tairawhiti Polytechnic, the Western Institute of Technology, Whitireia Community Polytechnic, WELTEC, Otago Polytechnic, Waikato Institute of Technology and the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, will all receive funding which together amounts to $1,068,000. This is in addition to nine proposals totalling $1,304,189 approved for the 2002/2003 year under the fund in 2002.

“This commitment by polytechnics and institutes of technology shows that they are key drivers for regional growth and have a vital role in regional economic development,” said Steve Maharey.

The Coalition Government provided $1 million in 2002/2003 and $2 million in both 2003/04 and 2004/05 for this programme. The maximum grant for any one application is $300,000 (GST inclusive). Industry New Zealand administers the fund and oversee a two-step process for allocating the grants.

Applications were analysed by Industry New Zealand’s Regional Offices in conjunction with TEC and the Ministry of Education’s Tertiary Advisory Monitoring Unit.

All applications were considered by the Regional Partnerships Programme Assessment Panel which is chaired by Industry New Zealand and includes representatives from the Ministry of Economic Development, Te Puni Kokiri, Skill NZ, and two independent members.

The next funding round is in November 2003.
