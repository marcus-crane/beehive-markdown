Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today welcomed the provision in Budget 2003 of an additional $1 million to strengthen the capability of iwi radio stations throughout the country.

Today's budget provides $250 000 a year for the next four years for professional development of radio staff, governance training, te reo Maori, management and planning skills.

Mr Horomia said as part of its commitment to promote Maori language and culture, the Crown has reserved radio frequency for Maori and provides funding to 21 iwi radio stations.

"The Maori radio service covers nearly 80 per cent of the total Maori population. Iwi radio stations play a vital role in their communities but if that is to continue, professional development of existing staff is a must."
