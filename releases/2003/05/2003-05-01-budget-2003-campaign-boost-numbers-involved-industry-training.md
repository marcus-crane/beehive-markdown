The government is joining forces with Business New Zealand and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions in a campaign to promote the benefits of workplace learning to employers and workers.

Funding of $800,000 is included in the industry training package announced today to develop a major 'Skill New Zealand' promotional campaign describing the benefits of workplace learning and a project to develop the ability of small and medium sized enterprises to engage in workplace learning.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said the May Day announcement symbolises the partnership between workers and employers, supported by the government, to future proof our economy against debilitating skill shortages and international uncompetitiveness.

"The Labour-Progressive government welcomes the commitment of our social partners - organised business and labour - to participate in this 'Skill New Zealand' campaign.

"Industry training is a very effective way of dealing with and preventing skill shortages. Ambitious plans outlined by the government to have 250,000 New Zealanders learning on the job by 2007 means it will be essential to persuade a much wider range of businesses and workers to participate in workplace learning if the training target is to be achieved.

"The details of the campaign will be developed by the partners over the coming months and will complement the existing promotional activities undertaken by industry training organisations. It will include:

- a major promotional campaign focusing on the importance of recognised learning in the workplace;
- working to build the capacity of enterprises, particularly small and medium sized businesses, to engage in workplace learning;
- a major focus on adult literacy issues in the workplace; and
- the promotion of unit standards that focus on key and generic skills needed for the workplace.

"All New Zealand work places also need to become learning places if we are to become a more innovative and prosperous nation," Steve Maharey said.
