Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today congratulated Liz Hickey on her appointment as Director of Education with the International Accounting Standards Committee.

The position is based in London and therefore Liz Hickey has resigned as Chair of the New Zealand Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB), effective 30 June 2003.

“It is significant that a New Zealander has been appointed to this important international body, and it reflects Liz Hickey’s international standing as one of the leading experts on technical accounting and standard setting issues. I am taking this opportunity to thank Liz Hickey for her service to the ASRB as well as her 11 years’ service as a member of the Securities Commission.”

“I wish Liz Hickey well in her new role. I know that she will make an invaluable contribution to the International Accounting Standards Committee,” Lianne Dalziel said.

John Spencer, Deputy Chair of the ASRB, takes on duties as the Acting Chair. He has served on the New Zealand board since 1999.

A process and timetable to replace Ms Hickey will be put in place shortly.
