Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today a new early childhood education initiative that will create six Centres of Innovation, which will be used to build a strong research base to inform and develop models of best teaching practice.

“Investing in quality early childhood education is crucial to children’s learning and their opportunities in later life," Trevor Mallard said.

"The good teaching and learning practices these centres are currently using will be further developed in collaboration with researchers and that information will then be available to other services.”

The initiative will provide $2.102 million over three years to support the six centres. After that, another six centres will be chosen to undertake research and development for a further three years.

"This investment is part of the Government’s commitment to increasing participation, improving quality and promoting collaborative relationships in early childhood education. This is particularly important for Mâori and Pacific children who currently participate less than others.”

The six Centres of Innovation are:  
·A’oga Fa’asamoa, Auckland – provides quality Pasifika early childhood education  
·Roskill South Kindergarten, Auckland – widespread and integrated use of information technology, with good levels of parent involvement.  
·Te Kohanga Reo o Puau Te Moananui a Kiwa, Auckland – showcases Maori language based learning  
·Wycliffe Nga Tamariki Kindergarten, Napier – good collaboration with Maori and Samoan communities, and good parent involvement through use of information technology  
·Wilton Playcentre, Wellington – displays a strong commitment to education and involvement of parents, and the innovative use of schema learning theory  
·New Beginnings Preschool, Christchurch – innovative use of Reggio Emilia approach and commitment to development

“The proposals we received showed a very vibrant early childhood education sector. The Centres of Innovation initiative aims to capitalise on the experience of those most likely to provide innovative ideas, the people working in ECE services,” Trevor Mallard said.

The first allocation of funding includes $170,000 of capital funding to support the participating services. Further operational funding will be the focus of contract negotiation in the near future.
