Labour Minister Margaret Wilson today announced that the Civil Aviation Authority will administer the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 for the aviation sector while the Maritime Safety Authority will administer the Act for the maritime sector.

The CAA and MSA have been given these roles because of their knowledge of their different sectors and to ensure employers and workers in these sectors only have to deal with one agency for all safety matters.

The MSA will look after any work that occurs on board ships. The CAA will look after aircraft when they are in operation i.e. the period when the aircraft is taxiing, taking off, in flight and landing.

The ability to designate agencies other than the Occupational Safety and Health Service was included in the Act in order to take advantage of the technical expertise and knowledge these organisations had of their sectors.

It will require OSH, CAA and MSA to work closely together to provide a seamless and consistent application of the HSE Act in all workplaces.

Information on the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Act and its implications for employers and employees is available from the Workinfo website [www.workinfo.govt.nz](http://www.workinfo.govt.nz) and from 0800 20 90 20.
