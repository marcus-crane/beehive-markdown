An increasing shortage of bus drivers in central Auckland has created new employment opportunities for several registered job seekers eager to work in the pasenger transport industry.

In January this year mounting shortages of drivers with heavy transport (Class 2) licences and passenger transport endorsements led to the awarding of a Work and Income training contract to Ezi Drive Limited.

The contract was for an initial 20 job seekers and was awarded after consultation with key stakeholders such as the National Road Carriers Association, Auckland transport and bus operators and the Industry Training Organisation.

In mid February the first group of job seekers began training at the Howick and Eastern Bus Company, gaining practical driving experience and New Zealand Qualifications Authority standards during the four week course.

All six trainees completed the course successfully, gained their L2 licence with passenger ratings and were employed by the Howick and Eastern Bus Company.

A second group of seven job seekers began training on 10 March and after completion of the course four were employed by Howick and Eastern Buses. The remaining three trainees also gained jobs at Birkenhead Transport, Ritchies and Murphy Buses.

Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment Rick Barker applauded the initiative, which he said served as another example of how government agencies like Work and Income were helping industries to alleviate major skills shortages.

“It’s likely that all job seekers who complete the driver course will also be offered employment. That’s fabulous news for everyone, particularly for the trainees as they will have good jobs and Work and Income because they have transited clients into sustainable work.”

Mr Barker said the current contract with Ezi Drive was due to finish on 30 June but owing to its success, there was a likelihood it may be extended.

“I think Work and Income will certainly look at expanding the programme and number of trainees to ensure Auckland’s passenger and heavy transport needs are met.”

Bill Dalbeth, chief executive officer of Howick and Eastern Buses, said he was pleased with Work and Income’s support of the driver training programme.

“The energy and commitment shown by Work and Income, and in particular Work Broker Alex Filyaev, has been very impressive.

“That, combined with Ezi Drive’s ability to tailor their training to meet our specific requirements, is what’s made this programme such a success.”

Mr Dalbeth said bus patronage in Auckland was experiencing unprecedented growth and training new drivers for the passenger transport industry was essential.

Ezi Drive course director Zane Gray said the calibre of Work and Income job seekers applying for positions on the bus driving course was reflected in the job placement rate they achieved.

“We’ve achieved roughly one hundred per cent placement of trainees into work because both Ezi Drive and representatives from the bus companies are involved in the selection process.

“When the candidates are chosen, they go into the training knowing that if they achieve the desired result, they will be employed in the passenger transport industry. It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.”

The final four week bus driving course commences on Monday 5 May.
