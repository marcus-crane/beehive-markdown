Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel has today decided to grant a two-year temporary permit to a renal failure patient from Tuvalu.

The individual, who is currently being treated for acute renal failure at Auckland Hospital, had made an application for Ministerial intervention so he could receive treatment.

“I have made this decision after considering this individual’s particular circumstances. His wife is a New Zealand citizen, and he is the father of a New Zealand born child.

“One of the matters which has been clarified, is that the individual was invited to apply for a permit last year. Had he done so, it is likely he would have gained residence before his medical condition reached such an acute stage. It appears he did not know he could make this approach.

“My decision today takes these very specific matters into account and has no precedent effect. The case also highlights how visitors to New Zealand need to be aware that they are not eligible for state funded medical treatment while in New Zealand. The new health guidelines specifically in relation to dialysis treatment for non-eligible patients with renal failure, are particularly stringent.”
