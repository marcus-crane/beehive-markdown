Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark and Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard today announced funding increases for Creative New Zealand and the Royal New Zealand Ballet.

The Royal New Zealand Ballet will receive an extra $2 million over the next four years, to enable the company to meet significant cost increases incurred in recent years and to continue the company’s artistic and audience growth.

Helen Clark and Judith Tizard also announced an increased allocation of $11.6 million over four years to Creative New Zealand to enable it to continue its support for well-established professional arts organisations, emerging organisations, regional arts initiatives, Maori arts, community arts, and contestable project funding.

Helen Clark and Judith Tizard said the extra funding for Creative New Zealand and the Royal New Zealand Ballet underlined the government’s ongoing support for the creative sector.

“This government has been forthright in its commitment to the arts from the outset. The creative sector was in a dire situation when the government announced its cultural recovery package and initiatives three years ago.

“That package gave a new lease of life to many arts organisations, including the Royal New Zealand Ballet, which has inspired and entertained New Zealanders throughout its 50-year history. Today’s announcement will allow it to continue to present a diverse repertoire, tour nationally, and deliver education programmes.

“Similarly, Creative New Zealand’s funding increases will build on the boost delivered under the cultural recovery package and enable the agency to continue to give adequate support to the arts across a range of activities.

“The creative sector is making a very significant contribution to New Zealand in cultural, economic and social terms. Creative New Zealand is a cornerstone of that success.”

Helen Clark and Judith Tizard made today’s Budget 2003 announcement during a visit to the Royal New Zealand Ballet studios to see dancers in rehearsal for the Ballet’s Meridian Energy season of Romeo and Juliet.
