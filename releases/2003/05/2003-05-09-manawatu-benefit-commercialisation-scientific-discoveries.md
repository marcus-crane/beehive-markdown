“The opportunity for scientific research to be commercialised locally has taken a major step forward with the launch of the Bio Commerce Centre for Manawatu”, Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton and Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) and local MP Steve Maharey said today.

The establishment of the Bio Commerce Centre at Massey Campus has received approval for $2 million in funding through Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnership Programme. The Centre will be co-located with a Bio Incubator in a refurbished building being supplied by Massey University.

Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton said that the Bio Commerce Centre will provide a focus for the interaction of business and science, allowing a window for businesses to view the opportunities available for the commercialisation of scientific discoveries.

“The Bio Commerce Centre will provide a new sense of purpose and commitment to the region among the science and research faculties of Massey University and the local Crown Research Institutes, and provide a mechanism for the commercialisation of research to add value to Manawatu’s regional economy.

“The Manawatu region has the largest concentration of biological research scientists and specialised technicians in New Zealand. It is unique in having the largest plant-based research capability but the full potential of the aggregation of these skills has not been fully realised.

“With funding of $2 million now confirmed from Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnership Programme the Manawatu region can get on with realising the enormous economic potential of the local research infrastructure,” Jim Anderton said.

Steve Maharey said the regional initiative was critical to ensuring Manawatu’s research establishments do not migrate from the region, and ensuring the local economy does not decline.

“A regional benefit analysis of this project has indicated that it will lift regional GDP, and increase employment by four percent, over the next ten years. At last government funding has been made available to realise the potential of our knowledge city.

“Key to the development of this project has been the high degree of ownership by regional businesses, Massey University, the Crown Research Institutes, Palmerston North City Council, and Vision Manawatu.

“Biotechnology is one of the priority sectors in the Government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, and commercialisation of intellectual property has been a perennial issue for Crown Institutes and Universities in New Zealand.

“The Bio Commerce Centre will provide a much-needed boost to the Manawatu regional economy, build on the quality of New Zealand science, and help position New Zealand as a centre of excellence for bio sciences,” Steve Maharey said.

Editor’s Notes:  
The Regional Partnerships Programme is Industry New Zealand’s regional development programme, characterised by cooperation between a region’s stakeholders and government. Industry New Zealand provides guidance and funding to help regions identify and develop sustainable economic growth strategies, and to put those strategies into action. Successful proposals involve a cross-section of agencies and organisations (e.g. business groups, local government, iwi, economic development agencies, community groups) implementing an agreed strategy. Three levels of funding are available: up to $100,000 per region for strategic planning; up to $100,000 per year for capability building; and up to $2 million for major regional initiatives. The Regional Partnership Programme guidelines require regions to provide part funding or an in-kind contribution of no less than 25% of the requested amount.

The Manawatu Bio Commerce Centre proposal seeks funding to assist with:  
·establishment of the Centre’s offices and Incubator premises;  
·staffing costs for four new joint business development manager positions with CRIs and Massey University;  
·the appointment of a CEO with expertise in commercialisation and the establishment of a business development coordinator’s position; and  
·contribution to administration costs.

Industry New Zealand’s contribution will be combined with regional support valued at $1.6 million.
