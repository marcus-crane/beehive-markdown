Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that she had accepted with regret the Hon Mark Gosche’s decision not to return to the Cabinet after a period of leave.

“Mr Gosche’s family circumstances are such that he considers it better to return to the backbench and continue his work as a Member of Parliament without the added responsibilities of holding ministerial portfolios,” Helen Clark said.

“I and his Cabinet colleagues are sorry that Mark cannot continue in the Cabinet, but we understand that he has made this decision in the best interests of his family.

“I would like to acknowledge the work Mark has done since the government was first elected in 1999, and in particular the humanity and decency he brought to his work in the housing portfolio.

“Mark was the first person of Pacific Island descent to become the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs. I appreciate the contribution he made in that portfolio, and also his work across the Transport, Corrections and Racing portfolios.

“I will shortly be giving consideration to filling the Cabinet vacancy,” Helen Clark said.
