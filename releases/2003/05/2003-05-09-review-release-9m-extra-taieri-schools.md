Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced his preliminary decision on the review of the schools in Mosgiel and the wider Taieri area, saying his proposal would unlock an extra $9 million for educational improvements in the area.

“This review is about ensuring sustainable quality education for students in the area. The proposal I am outlining today will result in a strong and viable network and the additional resources will strengthen the delivery of education in the area. We want to make sure education resources are spent on teaching children, and not on maintaining empty buildings,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I recognise that the process of change is stressful and I would like to thank all those who have been involved in this project for their efforts. Although these changes are tough on schools and their communities, I look forward to Taieri students enjoying the benefits of the operational resources released to individual schools, which will total around $3.5 million. This is in addition to the current and continuing operations of the present schools.

“There will, in addition, be approximately $1 million specifically for joint education initiatives for the benefit of all schools and the wider community,” Trevor Mallard said.

“On top of that $4.5m, there will be approximately another $4.5 million additional available for capital works. This is in addition to the $2m to which the schools in the area are currently entitled under their present five year property plans."

Proposals under the review are:  
·To merge Taieri High School and Mosgiel Intermediate School on the site of Taieri High School to form a Year 7 - 15 college with the Mosgiel Intermediate Board governing the new school;  
·To merge Arthur Burns, Reid Park and North Taieri Schools on the present Mosgiel Intermediate site, with the Arthur Burns Board governing the new school;  
·To merge Melville Park, Mosgiel West and Wyllies Crossing Schools on the Mosgiel West site, with the Mosgiel West Board governing the new school;  
·To merge East Taieri and Allanton Schools on the East Taieri site, with the East Taieri Board governing the new school;  
·To merge Henley, Momona and Outram Schools to create a full primary school on the Outram site, with the Outram School Board governing the new school;  
·The retention of Lee Stream and Waihola Districts Schools as full primary schools on their present sites.

Trevor Mallard expects to make final decisions in late June after two further periods of consultation with the schools involved and changes will be implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
