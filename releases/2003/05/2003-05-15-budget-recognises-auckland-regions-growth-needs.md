The budget announced today by Dr Michael Cullen enables the Labour-Progressive Government to continue its work in partnership with Auckland to address the region’s growth issues, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“The budget continues our work with Auckland on achieving the vision identified in the Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy, which aims to improve the region’s performance on a platform of exceptional people, cultures, environment and infrastructure,” says Judith Tizard.

“Good health, housing and education are the fundamentals of any civilised society, and are essential in the Auckland region with its young and rapidly growing population. This budget contains initiatives and funding in those areas to enable Aucklanders and all New Zealanders to achieve their full potential.”

For education, this year’s budget sees an increase of $715 million annually in new spending for education by 2006-07 to bring the total to $8.6 billion in that year. In tertiary education, the budget delivers long-term fee predictability and a $71 million package of student-focused initiatives.

For housing, nearly $260 million in extra funding for housing low-income people and those at risk is contained in the budget. Within this, nearly $100 million is to be spent on providing another 318 state homes as well as extending 80 houses to better suit larger families. This is on top of nearly 3000 more state houses that were already planned.

In health, Budget 2003 allocates another $535 million to carry the government’s $3.3 billion three year health funding package into 2005-06. A $19.8 million funding initiative will allow all Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) to charge low fees for patients under 18 years from October 1.

Effective education and training programmes are vital to deliver the skilled workforce that Auckland requires.

The budget contains a $152.8 million package over four years to help people move into the paid workforce, and a $56 million package to get all 15 to 19 year olds into some form of training or work by 2006.

“To deliver the quality of services New Zealanders have a right to expect, we must raise the sustainable growth rate,” says Judith Tizard. “The government has set itself the task of restoring New Zealand to the top half of the OECD in terms of per capita income, and the budget promotes this objective through a series of measures to support the Growth and Innovation Framework, regional development, and enhancing our trade performance.

“We are also working on a tax package and a series of other initiatives to address the problems faced by small and medium sized businesses, which represent a large chunk of Auckland’s economy.”

Judith Tizard, also Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, was delighted that extra funding had been allocated to the Historic Places Trust, Royal NZ Ballet and Creative New Zealand.

“Aucklanders will see the benefits of this funding for the region’s heritage and culture. The Ballet will be able to maintain its touring programmes and Creative New Zealand will be able to maintain levels of funding to professional arts organisations, many of which are based in Auckland.”

Some Auckland-related measures include:

-*Boosting policing effectiveness in Auckland:* 50 additional police in early 2004, a specialist mobile DNA squad, and $6.6m over four years to fund two police teams trained in the cleanup of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. One of these teams will be based in Auckland.

\- *Auckland Metropolitan Migrant and Refugee Strategy:* $21.2 million to move greater numbers of migrants and skilled workers into work, which will greatly assist in meeting skill and labour shortages in the Auckland region.

\- *Auckland’s first Urban Search and Rescue team:* $500,000 will establish a USAR team in Auckland. USAR teams locate and rescue people trapped after the collapse of a building, or those caught in landslide, subsidence, or earthquake.

\- *Project Early for Auckland:* a successful early intervention programme for children with behavioural problems is to be established in Auckland. Funding of $600,000 over three years will see Project Early operating in a cluster of Auckland primary schools and early childhood centres from January 2004.

\- *Youthline funding boost:* Auckland-based Youthline gets $400,000 over four years to help staff manage and supervise the Youthline volunteers towards having a 24-hour, 7 days a week telephone crisis service.

Further budget initiatives relating to Auckland will be announced in the near future, including work on a “sustainable cities” programme, which is an element of the Sustainable Development Programme for Action.

Judith Tizard says the government continues to work in partnership with the Auckland region on key issues such as sustainable and efficient infrastructure and transport solutions.

“The government has a real commitment to helping improve the region’s passenger transport and roading networks, and on ensuring the region is a great place to live and work. We are committed to managing the country’s finances responsibly and lifting New Zealand’s economic performance. Auckland plays a major role in that performance and this budget recognises specific needs in the region.”
