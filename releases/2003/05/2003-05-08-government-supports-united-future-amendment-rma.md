Environment Minister Marian Hobbs says she welcomed the United Future Party's initiative to delete three controversial terms from the Resource Management Amendment Bill (No 2).

The amendments removed the terms "spiritual", "cultural landscapes" and "ancestral landscapes" from the definition of historic heritage.

Marian Hobbs said these terms were inserted by the select committee which considered the first RMA Bill.

"It is a bit rich for National MPs to make such a song and dance about these terms given the history of how they came about," Marian Hobbs said. "I find their histrionics over historic heritage quite astounding.

"As I told the House I had difficulties with, for example, the definition of the word 'spiritual'. United Future raised with me their reservations and I undertook to give the matter further consideration.

"The removal of these words is sensible because they created unnecessary uncertainty. The issues covered by these terms are still covered by other more understood terms in the definition.

"I congratulate and thank United Future for their constructive approach to this legislation."
