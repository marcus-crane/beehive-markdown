TrustPower's expansion of its Tararua wind farm to 68 megawatts is a welcome and significant addition to New Zealand's renewable energy supply, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

TrustPower announced today that it would be proceeding with the expansion, adding 55 turbines to the existing 48, which produce 32 megawatts. The project is expected to be completed by May next year.

"This extra generation capacity will help reduce demand for thermal electricity generation and will be a welcome addition to power supplies for next winter," Mr Hodgson said. "That is good news both for the environment and for the security of the nation's electricity supply."

Mr Hodgson said he was pleased that the allocation of Kyoto Protocol emission units, or 'carbon credits', had enabled TrustPower to go ahead with the project.

"By allocating carbon credits to firms building clean, renewable energy plants the Government can help ensure they are economically viable.

"Electricity from renewables avoids some gas or coal-fired generation, with its associated greenhouse gas emissions. That helps New Zealand meet its emission reduction target, the government passes on the savings by way of carbon credits and everybody wins."
