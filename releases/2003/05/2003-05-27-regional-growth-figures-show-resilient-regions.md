“Positive regional growth figures announced today show the growing economic resilience of New Zealand’s regions,” said Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton today.

“The regions of New Zealand are all in various stages of developing regional plans in partnership with central Government. These concentrate on improving local strengths and allow development of competitive advantages to create jobs and stronger businesses.

“The fact that year on year all regions are still in positive growth mode with the majority at over three per cent is good news for all New Zealanders and we should celebrate their achievement,” said Jim Anderton.

The results came out in the National Bank Regional Trends survey released today.
