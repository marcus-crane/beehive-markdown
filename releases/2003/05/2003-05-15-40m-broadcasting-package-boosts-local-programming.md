A $39.9 million broadcasting package will improve the quality and amount of local programming New Zealanders can tune into, says Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

"The new funding will assist Television New Zealand to better meet its Charter obligations and to commission and screen programmes for a wider range of New Zealanders than would be possible if only commercial considerations were taken into account.

"Radio New Zealand receives a funding boost to enable it to meet rising costs, build an FM simulcast network and extend the hours that RNZ International broadcasts to the Pacific.

"New Zealanders want to be informed and entertained in ways relevant and recognisable to them. The budget supports this objective," said Steve Maharey.

The funding details \[figures over four years] are:

- $17 million to TVNZ to implement its Charter, taking total funding for charter initiatives to $17 million a year by 2006-07.
- $8 million to NZ on Air.
- $14 million to Radio New Zealand (announced on 6 May 2003).
- $288,000 to the Broadcasting Standards Authority.
