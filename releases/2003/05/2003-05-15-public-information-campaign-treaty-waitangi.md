The Government will initiate a $6.5 million public information programme on the Treaty of Waitangi, honouring commitments made by Labour at the last election, MÄ?ori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia announced today.

The purpose of the programme is to improve public knowledge by increasing the range, distribution, accessibility and visibility of factual information related to the Treaty of Waitangi.

The three-year programme has been allocated a total of $6.475 million in this yearâ€™s Budget.

The funding will cover the development of new resources for distribution to educational institutions, libraries, community centres and other interested groups. The resource information will also be provided through a website on the Governmentâ€™s portal.

â€œLabour recognises the Treaty of Waitangi is this countryâ€™s founding document, providing a basis from which strong and mutually respectful relationships can be developed and strengthened,â€? Parekura Horomia said.

â€œThe key point of the education programme is to make factual information available, such as the text of the Treaty itself, historical information on the drafting and signing of the Treaty, and the principles of the Treaty as determined by the courts.â€?

Decisions on the final details of the programme are still to be taken. A ministerial group comprising State Services Minister Trevor Mallard, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia, and Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Margaret Wilson will oversee the work programmeâ€™s implementation.

The State Services Commission will manage the programme with input from Te Puni Kokiri, Office of Treaty Settlements and other relevant agencies.
