Education Minister Trevor Mallard confirmed his decision to close Enfield School, North Otago at the end of this term.

He has also directed the Ministry of Education to retain the school site for at least the next 5 years in case developments in the area result in an increased demand for education provision.

“This decision is about ensuring that children continue to receive quality education. I have listened to people in the area who said that there needed to be a substantial re-population for the school to remain open,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Enfield School has experienced a falling roll for some time, with only 15 students enrolled this year, and it does not have a permanent principal. I am also confident that the students from Enfield can receive a good education at Weston School, which is only six kilometres away,” Trevor Mallard said.

“However, in case there is an increase in school-aged children in the future because of regional developments, I have directed the ministry to retain the school site as a sensible precaution, in case it is needed in the future,” Trevor Mallard said.

Enfield School will close on Friday 4 July 2003.
