The Associate Minister of Energy, Hon Harry Duynhoven today announced a petroleum exploration bidding round over 17 blocks in offshore north Taranaki and onshore Taranaki.

“The offshore area, largely north of New Plymouth, is possibly the most promising exploration theatre in New Zealand for finding large oil or gas accumulations” Mr Duynhoven said.

“The energy sector faces major challenges over the next few years. New Zealand needs new discoveries of oil and gas through continuing exploration.

“The expected early depletion of the Maui gas field is changing New Zealand’s gas market. This changing market, coupled with the Taranaki basin’s proximity to production infrastructure, pipelines, power stations and markets, will attract explorers attention to the current bidding round. Increasing wellhead prices for new gas finds is also stimulating more interest in gas exploration.

“Petroleum explorers are showing more interest than ever in New Zealand as an international exploration destination. New Zealand is now the 13th most attractive country in the world for petroleum investment, according to the latest 2003 international survey by the IHS Energy Group. New Zealand’s standing has risen from 36th place in 1999 to its current highest level.

“The Government has responded to this interest by issuing a large number of petroleum exploration permits. There are now 86 exploration and mining permits on issue with 8 more applications pending. Two years ago there were just 58 permits issued” Mr Duynhoven said.

Applications for the nine offshore and eight onshore blocks on offer close on 31 October, 2003.
