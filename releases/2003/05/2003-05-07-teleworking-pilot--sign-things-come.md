Transport and Communications Minister Paul Swain said the Close2:Kapiti Teleworking pilot project, launched today by Greater Wellington Regional Council, is a great initiative and a sign of things to come.

The twelve month pilot project is aimed at reducing the number of people commuting from the Kapiti Coast to Wellington City by encouraging people to look at working from home or using the Kapiti TeleCentre.

“As Minister of both Transport and Communications I am excited by the potential of 21st century telecommunications technology to ease the pressure on the roading network,” said Mr Swain.

Greater Wellington, together with the Kapiti Coast District Council, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, the Kapiti TeleCentre, Telework New Zealand and Transfund New Zealand, are launching Close2:Kapiti.

The project targets Kapiti Coast commuters and their employers in order to change their working practices by working away from their offices on a part-time basis, perhaps twice a week.

“I welcome this initiative and encourage other Council’s around the country to, where appropriate, follow Kapiti’s lead,” said Mr Swain.
