The important work of community and voluntary groups is being recognised with the setting up of a Community and Voluntary Sector Office in the Ministry for Social Development.

The Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Tariana Turia, said community, voluntary and tangata whenua groups link people and their needs to government and its policies and services that meet those needs.

"It is important to this government that the relationship is based on trust, and that these groups have access to government decision-making, and that is why we have set up the Community and Voluntary Sector Office," she said.

The office will receive $1 million this year, and $1.3 million for each of the following three years. These amounts include $3.59 million of new funding (and all include GST).

The office will strengthen community, voluntary and tangata whenua organisations and their relationships with the government, and in particular, will provide a strong voice for the sector in government decision-making.

"The office will provide a central policy contact point in the government for community and voluntary organisations, and provide cross-sectoral policy advice to promote the role of the community and voluntary sector in building strong and vibrant communities.

"As well as picking up on critical issues for the sector, and ensuring their interests are considered in policy making, the office will also support development of strategic leadership within the community and voluntary sector.

"The office will be accountable to the vote minister, Steve Maharey, for its funding and performance, and to me as responsible minister for its work programme and priorities," said Tariana Turia.

The Office will help to promote strong and vibrant communities, social inclusion and cohesion.
