The government is committing $9.825 million over the next four years towards improving the calibre of senior management in the state sector, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“Boosting people development is one of the highest priorities for the state sector in general, and the public service in particular,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Without good people, the organisations of government cannot be effective.

“We recognise that if we want a strong future as a country we have to get the foundations right. A strong and effective state sector is integral to the country’s economic and social performance.

“This government is committed to lifting the overall capability of the state sector and improving the delivery of government services to New Zealanders. This task requires leadership – from the government, chief executives and from the people who staff and manage the many state sector agencies.

“To meet this need, over the next four years a package of measures will be implemented to boost senior leadership and management development in the public service and state sector,” Trevor Mallard said.

An important focus will be identifying and building a group of talented managers of the required quality and diversity to meet the future needs of the public service initially, and state sector subsequently. The senior leadership and development programme will replace the Senior Executive Service and set up a new development infrastructure across the public sector.

The programme will also provide development and training incentives for senior public servants. For example, publicising and managing project management opportunities and secondments between government departments will provide much needed experience for managers with high potential.

“These initiatives will bring about significant change in the way senior management talent is developed and supported in the future and will make state sector management a much more attractive career option for talented people,” Trevor Mallard said.
