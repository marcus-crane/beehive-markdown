Minister of Tourism Mark Burton will spend the next week promoting New Zealand to the US tourism market.

The trip will begin in New York City, with a special pre-release of the New Zealand film, Whale Rider. The film will be screened for members of the American travel media, including senior representatives from such prominent publications as the New York Times, Conde Nast Traveller, Travel & Leisure, and Consumer News.

Mark Burton then heads to Los Angeles for Kiwilink, Tourism New Zealand’s largest annual trade-training event. Kiwilink is designed to showcase New Zealand’s tourism products to members of the North American travel trade.

“This trip is an ideal way to educate the travel professionals who are in direct contact with reach New Zealand’s target market offshore,” said Mark Burton.

“Kiwilink attracts a large number of US and Canadian wholesale and airline reservation staff and sales managers, as well as New Zealand suppliers from airlines, hotels, rental car companies, and adventure operators. This event is an excellent opportunity for the US tourism sector to gain a deeper understanding of the wide range of products that Destination New Zealand has to offer.

“New Zealand’s reputation in North America has grown immeasurably through The Lord of the Rings films and last year’s Royal Tour, a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel and screened in millions of homes in the United States and Canada.

“The New York screening of Whale Rider, the New Zealand film which has already won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival and the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, is an excellent chance to build on this reputation. Key members of the travel media will be able to see the kind of unique culture and environments New Zealand has to offer—not to mention what wonderful films we make.

“Around the world, tourism is currently facing some short term challenges. This government’s goal, however, is to continue building a sustainable tourism sector for New Zealand. By showcasing the hugely diverse range of activities on offer, visitors can be encouraged to come at different times of the year, to try a greater number of products, to stay longer, to explore a wider range of locations, and, of course, to spend more.”

Mark Burton leaves today and will return to New Zealand 20 May.
