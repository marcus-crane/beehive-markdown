Transport Minister Paul Swain and Associate Transport Ministers Harry Duynhoven and Judith Tizard expressed sadness at the death of Possum Bourne and offered condolences to his family.

Mr Duynhoven, a keen motorsport fan, will attend Possum Bourne’s funeral in Pukekohe today on behalf of the government. “I had the pleasure of meeting Possum on a number of occasions and we talked about driver training programmes for young people, which he was keen to be involved in,” said Mr Duynhoven.

“As New Zealand’s most high-profile rally driver he would have been an ideal front-person to promote the programmes. As well as being a successful driver Possum also established a thriving motorsport business, which did a lot of export business. Role models such as Possum are a huge loss.”

Mr Swain, also a big motorsport fan, said Possum was, “a great driver and an excellent ambassador for his sport and his country. He will be missed.”

Ms Tizard, said: “Possum Bourne was a visionary man who remained dedicated and accessible to his community. His integrity, decency and good humour shone through everything he did.”
