New water safety signs containing symbols instead of words should help  
reduce the worrying number of ethnic people drowning in New Zealand, Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said today.

"I am delighted to see that Standards New Zealand and Water Safety New Zealand have developed a new signage standard based on internationally recognised symbols to inform people of water hazards.

"Statistics show that New Zealand has one of the worst drowning rates in the world, and that the number of Asian and Pacific Island drownings in particular, have almost doubled between 2001 and 2002.

"I know from reports of incidents along Auckland’s West Coast that those statistics might well be worse were it not for the good work of rescue groups like lifeguards and the Coastguard.

"In most drownings there are a number of contributing factors but it makes good sense to ensure that a language barrier or inconsistency of signage is not one of them," Mr Carter said.

"Signs are important in ensuring water safety because it is completely impossible for all aquatic dangers to be patroled all of the time. All New Zealanders, including those who are new to New Zealand, deserve as much protection from the perils of water as we can give them. While it is not feasible to have multi-lingual signs appropriate to all water users, agreed international symbols are a good and effective compromise."

Mr Carter said he would ensure the Office of Ethnic Affairs actively promoted understanding of the signs among ethnic communities. The Department of Conservation would also be using them around its waterways.

"I will also be encouraging councils to consider adopting the new signage standard in their area," Mr Carter said.
