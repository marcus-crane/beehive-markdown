Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that Budget 2003 demonstrated that the government was committed to managing the country’s finances responsibly and lifting New Zealand’s economic performance.

The Prime Minister welcomed Michael Cullen’s fourth budget, saying it set out a coherent and highly credible programme for 2003/04.

“The Budget strongly supports our aim of building and maintaining solid levels of economic growth through innovation, and of funding good public services and infrastructure sustainably.” Helen Clark said.

“The Budget also provides confidence that New Zealand is well placed to deal with the challenges of a turbulent international environment.

“It continues to build on the many initiatives which have been taken in line with the February 2002 Growth and Innovation Framework to strengthen the economy’s capacity to grow through innovation.

“The government is determined to continue the task of building a shared vision and national consensus around the goal of lifting New Zealand’s economic performance and improving our social outcomes.

“The budget surplus being outlined by Michael Cullen today reinforces the government’s reputation as a careful and competent fiscal manager.

“That enables the government to address the priority areas of higher living standards for all through growth and innovation; supporting a cohesive society by funding good public services; reducing crime and boosting security levels; and investing for the future through a broad-based capital programme.

“Budget 2003 is another important step in ensuring opportunity and security for all New Zealanders,” Helen Clark said.
