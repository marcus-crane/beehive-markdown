The Transport Minister Paul Swain has opened the final 5.2km section of the Hawkes Bay Expressway, in a rope-cutting ceremony near the new Ahuriri Estuary Bridge.

The Airport to Taradale Rd section has cost $12.5 million, while a total of $23.6 million is being spent on state highways in the Hawke's Bay region this year.$120 million will be spent on highway maintenance in Hawkes Bay region in the next 10 years.

Mr Swain told those gathered for the ceremony that infrastructure in Hawkes Bay is facing heavy demands from growing volumes of exports and imports.

He said figures released this week by the National Bank show the Hawkes Bay region grew by 3.9 percent in the year to March - higher than Wellington and Auckland. The quarterly growth figures show a 2.6 percent increase for Hawkes Bay in the March quarter, twice as strong as the next region, Northland. Mr Swain said the Port of Napier is handling record volumes which means more heavy trucks on the road, but the new Expressway is a more efficient route to the port.

He said it has already removed a lot of heavy traffic from Napier's Marine Parade - helping that city with its own development and keeping the tourists in shorefront hotels happy.

Mr Swain congratulated the people of Hawkes Bay who helped build the road, the locals who put up with the dust, dirt and disruption during construction, as well as the Transit team, the consultants and contractors.
