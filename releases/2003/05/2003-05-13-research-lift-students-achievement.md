A programme of research into teaching and learning is to be set to help raise students’ achievement in New Zealand, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The New Zealand Council for Educational Research is co-ordinating this initiative which involves establishing a programme of research for early childhood through to tertiary education. Calls for proposals will be made shortly by the council.

“At the heart of this initiative is the desire to raise achievement levels for students through building knowledge about teaching and learning, and what works the best, and making that knowledge accessible to teachers,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The research programme will place a real emphasis on partnerships between researchers and practitioners. These partnerships will run through from the initial design of the research to communicating the results to teachers and other educators who can use them to make a difference to practice.”

Researchers working either in an organisation or independently will be eligible to put forward an expression of interest, but they will need to demonstrate that they are working in close partnership with teachers. They will also need to show that their research can help improve educational achievement.

“We are looking for research that can help to reduce educational disparity and enable us to have a better understanding of teaching and learning processes. Researchers will be encouraged to take into account the wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and skills of children and young people in New Zealand and be innovative,” Trevor Mallard said.

Researchers will have until 14 July to signal their interest to the council. Guidelines are available to help with the completion and selection processes for these expressions of interest.

Further information on the expressions of interest will be circulated to all sectors, including schools, at the end of May. Information will also be placed in the Education Gazette and the Education Review.
