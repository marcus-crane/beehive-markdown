The New Zealand Landcare Trust will receive $1.8 million in funding over the next four years, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs told Parliament today during the Budget debate.  
"This funding provides the Trust with the certainty it needs to continue working closely with farmers and landowners to really make a difference for the environment," Marian Hobbs said. "The Trust’s work reinforces the government’s overall sustainable development and biodiversity objectives, which will ultimately underpin New Zealand’s aim to protect its biodiversity."  
Marian Hobbs said the Landcare Trust brings together seven very different Trustee organisations to help promote sustainable land use -- Federated Farmers, Federation of Maori Authorities, Forest and Bird Society, Fish and Game NZ, Federated Mountain Clubs, Rural Women NZ and Ecologic Foundation.  
"The Trust does remarkable work in helping landcare groups around the country to both set-up and to get out and do the hands-on work, for example the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust launched last November," Marian Hobbs said. "The role the Landcare Trust plays in getting communities involved in much-needed landcare work is also extremely successful."
