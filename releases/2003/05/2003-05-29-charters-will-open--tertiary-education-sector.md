The publication today of the criteria for tertiary education organisation charters marks an important milestone in the tertiary education reforms becoming a reality, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Under legislation passed last year, all tertiary education organisations that seek government funding must have an approved charter by 1 January 2004 setting out its special mission and role in overall tertiary education system. This applies to universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, wananga, industry training organisations, private training establishments and adult and community education providers. Charters must be submitted to the Tertiary Education Commission by 30 September 2003.

Steve Maharey said that the tertiary education sector and its stakeholders need to carefully focus on the development of the charters as they will be in place for the medium- to long-term and are crucial to the achievement of a strategically-aligned system.

“Charters and Profiles are two tools that will help bring the Tertiary Education Strategy alive, and bring about medium and long-term change in the tertiary education system.

“Developing these initial charters is a crucial task not only for the organisations themselves, including their staff, but also for the students, industries, communities and iwi that they serve.

“The first step of the charter process is the identification of stakeholders and it is crucially important that stakeholders tale an active role in ensuring that their needs and aspirations are appropriately reflected in the charters.

“The reforms are about getting the tertiary education sector more connected to the wider society, and this is a two-way process. We need all stakeholders to get involved.

“The Charter assessment criteria are designed to be transparent, easily understood and able to recognise the different sizes and shapes of our tertiary education organisations. The criteria were designed following consideration of the report of a sector-wide Charters and Profile Working Party chaired by Tertiary Education Commission Deputy Chair Kaye Turner,” Steve Maharey said.

The Tertiary Education Commission will distribute guidelines for tertiary education organisations on the development of their charters in June.
