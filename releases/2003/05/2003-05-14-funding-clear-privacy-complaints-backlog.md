Extra funding to help manage a growing number of complaints lodged with the Privacy Commissioner has been allowed for in Budget 2003, Associate Justice Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

The funding will help clear an existing backlog of complaints as well as manage the increasing number of complaints received by the Privacy Commissioner’s office.

“Funding of $375,000 will be allowed for in the 2003/2004 financial year and $222,000 in each of the three outyears. This will allow the Privacy Commissioner to implement a case management approach and improve the processing and resolution of complaints. This initiative will allow more complaints to be processed to closure, each year,” Lianne Dalziel.

This year’s budget initiative also includes $241,000 in 2003/2004 plus $207,000 in 2004/2005 to clear the backlog of more than 430 long-standing complaints (as at 31 October 2002) made more than 12 months ago.

“A small separate team of experienced people, supported by specialist legal advice and mediation services will be devoted to the closure of complaints that are over a year old. This initiative will clear the backlog in a credible time frame.”

In the year to June 2002, 1044 complaints were received by the Privacy Commissioner, an increase of 163 from the previous year. Over the past five years, approximately 960 complaints have been closed each year.
