He has been a contributing author or editor to a number of legal publications and is co-author of a 1998 Butterworths’ publication entitled Advising suspects at the police station. He was appointed a member of the Crown Panel in Dunedin in 1989, and served as President of the Otago District Law Society from 1998 to 1999.

Mr O’Driscoll has been actively involved in the racing industry and sports, particularly lawn bowls. He has held roles in several disciplinary, judicial or appeal bodies in both sports and racing.
