Minister of Tourism Mark Burton today announced budget funding of $15 million over three years, aimed at increasing New Zealand’s market share in the United States among our ideal visitors—high-value, interactive travellers.

The money will be used to fund a US-specific version of Tourism New Zealand’s global 100% Pure campaign, designed to maximise marketing opportunities provided by New Zealand’s currently high media profile in the United States.

“2002 was a watershed year for tourism in New Zealand. The extraordinary publicity we have received through the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the America’s cup, and our ongoing and successful partnership with the Discovery channel has been invaluable, and it is essential that we capitalise on it.

“The USA is the world’s largest outbound market, with some 34 million people leaving the USA every year on holiday. Their international travel has been growing at some 7 percent per annum since 1990, with the average spend per traveller increasing by 5.4% per annum.

“Many travellers from the US fit the profile of our ideal visitor. They travel regularly, actively participate in the natural environment, seek a wide range of authentic experiences, and are large consumers of Maori cultural product.

“In 2002, we had over 200,000 visitors from the US, with an average spend of $4,400. That’s $1000 more than the average international visitor—and an $880 million contribution to the New Zealand economy.

Mark Burton says that the campaign will begin later this year, and will largely be focused on California and New York, which together account for 33 percent of all outbound travel from the USA. Tourism New Zealand will be investing a further $2 million of reprioritised funding in the campaign, as well as developing on-line programmes with their media partners.

USA *100% Pure* will centre on:

- Discovery Channel programming and exposure
- Outdoor campaigns in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and possibly New York
- Promotional activities at targeted events such as food and wine festivals
- Magazine campaigns
- Partnered Internet marketing with key on-line travel providers and campaign media partners, and
- Working with key partners to maximise impact in the market place.

Mark Burton said that recent growth in Internet travel sales offered significant opportunities for direct business in the US market.

“Worldwide, travellers purchase US$23 billion worth of online travel products every year. This campaign will focus on increasing the value of New Zealand’s Internet presence to visitors, the tourism sector, and the media.

“Americans are looking for the kind of holiday that New Zealand can provide, and this major initiative is focused on increasing market awareness of the wide variety of experiences and products we have to offer.”
