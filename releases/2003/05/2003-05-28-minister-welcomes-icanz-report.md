Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today welcomed a report on corporate governance, prepared by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ).

“ICANZ has conducted some valuable work in the area of corporate reporting, and I am pleased with the report which was recently presented to me. I believe the report provides a sound foundation for the kind of debate we need to have in New Zealand about corporate governance standards.

“I will be asking the Securities Commission to build on the ICANZ initiative, and to provide a wider market perspective as we explore transparency, accountability and regulatory issues in relation to corporate governance,” Lianne Dalziel said.
