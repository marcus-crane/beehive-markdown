Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his preliminary decisions on the review of the schools in the Dannevirke area, saying his proposal would unlock at least an extra $6.5 million for educational improvements in the area.

“This review is about providing sustainable quality education for students and ensuring they have the option to attend local schools rather than going outside the area,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The proposals I am outlining today will result in a strong and viable network and the additional resources will strengthen the delivery of education in the area. We want to make sure education resources are spent on teaching children, and not on maintaining underused or empty buildings,” Trevor Mallard said.

“These proposals acknowledge the situation in Dannevirke with declining school rolls, that are predicted to continue to drop.

“Although these changes are tough on schools and their communities, the long-term benefits will be worth it. Dannevirke students will enjoy the benefits of the operational resources released to individual schools, which will total around $2.6 million. This is in addition to the current and continuing operations of the present schools.

“There will, in addition, be approximately $700,000 specifically for joint education initiatives for the benefit of all schools and the wider community.

“On top of that and depending on the options decided there will be at least $3.2 million available for capital works,” Trevor Mallard said.

Proposals under the review are:

·To merge Norsewood, Ormondville and Matamau Schools on the Norsewood School site, with the Norsewood Board governing the new full primary school;  
·To merge Ruahine and Rua Roa Schools on the Ruahine School site, with the Ruahine Board governing the new full primary school;  
·To close Awariki School;  
·To retain Weber School as a full primary school;  
·To retain Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori O Tamaki Nui a Rua as a year 1-13 school;  
·To merge Dannevirke North, Dannevirke South and Hillcrest Schools either on the Dannevirke South site or on part of the Dannevirke High School site;  
·To retain Dannevirke High School as a Year 9-13 secondary school;  
·To create a single combined board from the Dannevirke South and Dannevirke High School boards to jointly govern Dannevirke High School and the new primary school.  
“The Ministry of Education will work with affected schools to ensure that school transport arrangements work well for the students concerned,” Trevor Mallard said.  
Trevor Mallard expects to make final decisions in July after two further periods of consultation with the schools involved.
