A new field store to be built at Scott Base will be the largest construction project undertaken since the original commissioning of the base in 1956, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

Antarctica NZ will receive $3.9 million from this year's Budget to develop the two-story 1800 square metre field store. It will provide a dedicated heated facility for organising and preparing all Antarctic field research programmes, along with storage for Scott Base field supplies and perishables.

“The new building will significantly improve New Zealand's expanding science and environmental programmes in Antarctica," Mr Goff said.

"Currently, Scott Base staff work in an aircraft hanger built in 1960, in temperatures as low as minus 45 degrees, so the new field store will clearly be a welcome addition to the complex.

"Construction will start in November, and the building's commissioning is scheduled for October 2005."
