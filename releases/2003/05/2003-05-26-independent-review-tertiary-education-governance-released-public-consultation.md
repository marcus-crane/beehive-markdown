An independent review of the governance of tertiary education institutions has been released today for public consultation.

The review, undertaken by Professor Meredith Edwards, Director of the National Institute for Governance at the University of Canberra, recommends a new framework to achieve good governance practice for tertiary education institutions (TEIs) in New Zealand. Professor Edwards was assisted by a reference group made up of key stakeholders, including representatives of tertiary education institutions, business, unions, students and Maori.

Steve Maharey welcomed the report and said public comment was now sought on its proposals, closing on 30 July 2003.

“Improved strategic capacity and leadership at both governance and management levels is one of the objectives in the government’s Tertiary Education Strategy.

“Professor Edwards argues that achieving improvements in governance requires:  
·clarifying the roles and responsibilities of councils and their members;  
·improving the balance between councils, Chief Executives and Academic Boards;  
·sharing of good governance practice across the sector; and  
·optimising the role of stakeholders in tertiary governance,” said Steve Maharey.

The Edwards Report recommends that all TEIs sign up to a national protocol on good governance which outlines key best practice principles for the sector. The Protocol would be supported at institutional level by codes of governance practice that allow for flexibility according to institutional circumstances. In addition, a national association of Tertiary Council Chairs and Chancellors is recommended to disseminate best practice information and to lead training and development programmes for council members. A number of recommendations for legislative change are also made in the Report.

Steve Maharey says that he looks forward to discussion and engagement by tertiary councils and other stakeholders on the Report.
