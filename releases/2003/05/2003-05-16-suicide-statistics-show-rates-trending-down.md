Latest figures on the rates of suicide are encouraging and provide support to continue efforts in the area of suicide prevention, the Associate Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Provisional all age suicide statistics for the year 2000 released today by the Ministry of Health show the total number of suicide deaths has decreased markedly to 458 in 2000, from a peak in 1998 of 577 and 516 in 1999. The 2000 figure is the lowest number in 14 years.

“It's encouraging to see the number of suicide deaths coming down, especially by more than 100 in two years to the lowest number since 1986. However 458 suicides still represents an unacceptable number of preventable deaths,” said Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton emphasised how important it is to look at long term trends rather than drawing conclusions from comparing one year to the next.

The suicide rate for the total population in 2000 was 11.2 per 100,000, which is the lowest rate for 15 years. The rate for males was 18.7, and female deaths from suicide were 4 per 100,000 – this is the lowest rate for females since 1961.

Most of the reduction in suicide deaths has occurred in females (83 deaths in 2000 compared with 131 in 1999) with a small decrease in male suicide deaths (375 in 2000, 385 in 1999).

Suicide deaths are trending down overall among both Mäori and non-Mäori, although there was a slight increase in 2000 among Mäori (80 deaths in 2000, 78 in 1999). In 2000, the rate of suicide deaths for Mäori was 13.1 per 100,000, compared to 10.7 per 100,000 for non-Mäori.

In 2000, the 25-29 age group had the highest rate of deaths from suicide. However, the highest rate of hospitalisations from suicide attempts was from the 15-24 age group and stands at 282.4 per 100,000.

"Every suicide is a personal and community tragedy. We need to be clear that we’re talking about lives, not numbers. We must all try to create a supportive inclusive social and economic environment that prevents people from seeing suicide as their only option," said Jim Anderton.

Preventing suicide and suicide attempts across all age groups is a priority under the New Zealand Health Strategy. It involves cooperative efforts from Government, service providers, communities and families.

Jim Anderton has already announced a budget package for suicide prevention that will help reduce not just youth but also all-age suicide.

The separate initiatives include support for families, whänau and friends following a suicide, or an attempted suicide.

It includes support for Youthline, enhanced national coordination, leadership and capacity, and an evaluation of the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy.

“Families, whänau and friends can be particularly vulnerable when they have lost someone to suicide. Where a suicide has been attempted family members can end up being very distressed and vulnerable themselves. On the other hand, with the right support and information they can play a very positive role in helping someone who is suicidal towards recovery,” said Jim Anderton.

The rate of hospitalisation for intentional self-harm in 2000/2001 was 129.2 per 100,000. It is not possible to compare this rate with previous years as the definition of intentional self-harm has been extended to include cases not previously included.

The 2001 provisional youth suicide statistics will be available later this year.

The 2000 statistics are currently only provisional as there are a small number of outstanding deaths awaiting a coroner's finding.

The 2000 statistics are available from the New Zealand Health Information web site: http://www.nzhis.govt.nz.

BACKGROUND

Suicide Facts  
Provisional 1999 Statistics (all ages)

For graphs to illustrate suicide statistics and more detailed information, see the NZHIS website www.nzhis.govt.nz

Key PointsIn 2000, the total number of suicides was 458, down from 516 in 1999 and 577 in 1998. This is the lowest total number since 1986 (414) and the lowest rate since 1985.Total suicide deaths have reduced among both males and females in the last two years. In 2000, the female rate was the lowest since 1961.In 2000 both the 45-64 year age group and the 65 and over age group recorded the lowest rates since 1948.In 2000 a total of 96 young people aged 15-24 years died by suicide, compared with 120 in 1999, and 140 in 1998. Young people still have high rates of suicide but the highest rate is now in the 25-29 year age group.Suicide deaths have reduced in non-Mäori, but have remained almost the same in Mäori. In 2000 the rate of suicide in Mäori was 13.1 per 100,000 compared with 10.7 per 100,000 in non-Mäori. The hospitalisation rate for intentional self-harm in 2000/2001 was 129.2 per 100,000. The definition of intentional self-harm has been extended to include cases not previously included so should not be directly compared with previous years. Youth (15-24 years) had the highest hospitalisation rates in 2000/2001 (282.4 per 100,000).There is some variation in regional suicide rates for the total population but no pattern. The New Zealand Health Strategy has identified reducing suicide and suicide attempt across all ages as a priority health objective.Suicide prevention requires a range of interventions across a number of settings and the co-operation of Government, service providers, communities and families.

What Initiatives were announced in the 2003/04 Budget?

Government has agreed to fund five new suicide prevention initiatives for the coming budget.

These initiatives are tangible actions to further help reduce both youth and all-age suicide. Added to existing activities they will enhance the ongoing implementation of the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (NZYSPS).

The initiatives are:  
1.Support for families/carers/whänau following a suicide ($1.3 million over 4 years).  
2.Support for families/carers/whänau following an attempted suicide ($1.3 million over 4 years).  
3.Enhanced national coordination and leadership capacity ($300,000 over 2 years).  
4.An evaluation of the NZYSPS ($75,000 for 1 year).  
5.Support for Youthline’s 24/7 Crisis Phone Service ($400,000 over 4 years).

The initiatives aim to:  
·give effective support to people bereaved or affected by suicide, and reduce the potential for further suicides  
·increase the Ministry of Youth Affairs’ capacity as lead agency for the NZYSPS  
·determine the extent the NZYSPS is achieving its objectives  
·support Youthline’s volunteer workforce.

What is the most recent data available on suicide?  
We have provisional 2000 data for all ages. These figures are still considered provisional because there are a small number of deaths that are subject to coroners’ findings, for which a cause of death has not yet been assigned. For this reason we are unable to say they are final. Data becomes official once it is published by the New Zealand Health Information Service (NZHIS) in the annual publication series Mortality and Demographic Data publication series.

How is a death deemed to be a suicide?  
Only a coroner can classify a death to be a suicide. A coroner will inquire into all suspicious deaths and make the decision after they have all the facts. In some cases the inquest will be heard over a year after the death, particularly if there are other factors surrounding the death that need to be investigated first.

Suicide – All Ages  
How many people died by suicide in 2000?  
A total of 458 people died by suicide, compared with 516 in 1999, and 577 in 1998.  
In 2000, 375 males died by suicide, compared with 385 in 1999, and 445 in 1998.  
In 2000, 83 females died by suicide, compared with 131 in 1999, and 132 in 1998.

What is the rate of suicide in New Zealand?  
The suicide rate for the total population was 11.2 per 100,000 in 2000, compared to 12.1 per 100,000 in 1990. This was the lowest rate since 1985 (9.3 per 100,000).

The rate of suicide for males was 18.7 per 100,000 in 2000, compared with 19.7 per 100,000 in 1990. This is the lowest rate since 1993 (18.7 per 100,000).  
The rate of suicide for females was 4.0 per 100,000 in 2000, compared to 4.7 per 100,000 in 1990. This is the lowest rate since 1961 (3.9 per 100,000).

Suicides by age group  
In 2000, the highest rates of suicide were among males 25-29 years (45.0 per 100,000), followed by males aged 20-24 years (38.3 per 100,000). Among females 25-29 year olds (9.5 per 100,000), and 15–19 year olds (8.3 per 100,000) had the highest rates.

Over the last five years suicide death rates across age groups have been trending downward. In 2000, both the 15-24 year age group and the 25-44 year age group had a rate of 18.1 deaths per 100,000. In 2000, both the 45-64 year age group and the 65+ age group recorded the lowest rates since 1948.

How many Mäori died by suicide in 2000?  
Eighty Mäori died by suicide in 2000, compared to 78 in 1999 and 112 in 1998.  
Sixty-nine were male compared to 58 in 1999 and 87 in 1998.  
Eleven were female compared to 20 in 1999 and 25 in 1998.

In 2000, the rate of suicide for Mäori was 13.1 per 100,000, compared with 12.1 per 100,000 in 1999 and 19.2 per 100,000 in 1998.

The rate of suicide for Mäori males was 23.3 per 100,000, compared to the non-Mäori rate of 17.5 per 100,000.

The rate of suicide for Mäori females was 3.6 per 100,000, compared to the non-Mäori rate of 4.0 per 100,000.

How many Pacific and Asian people died by suicide in 2000?  
In 2000, 12 Pacific people died by suicide (ten males and two females), compared to 14 deaths in 1999 and 24 deaths in 1998.  
Twenty-one Asian people died by suicide (16 males and five females) in 2000.

What is the male – female suicide ratio?  
In 2000, the all-ages sex ratio for suicide in New Zealand was 4.5 male suicides to every female suicide. The youth suicide (15–24 years) ratio was 5.4 male suicides to every female suicide.

Research suggests that the difference in male and females suicide is associated with choice of methods. Females, however, make more non-fatal suicide attempts.

Suicide – Youth (15–24 years)  
How many young people (15–24 years) died by suicide in 2000?  
In 2000, a total of 96 young people aged 15–24 years died by suicide, compared with 120 in 1999 and 140 in 1998. Of these 96 young people, 81 were male and 15 were female.

What is the rate of youth suicide (15–24 years) in New Zealand?  
The total rate of youth suicide in 2000 was 18.1 per 100,000 compared with 22.5 per 100,000 in 1990.

The rate of youth suicide for males (aged 15–24) in 2000 was 29.9 per 100,000 compared with 38.0 per 100,000 in 1990.

The rate of youth suicide for females (aged 15–24) in 2000 was 5.8 per 100,000 compared with 6.7 per 100,000 in 1990.

How many Mäori youth (15–24 years) died by suicide in 2000?  
In 2000, 28 Mäori young people (15-24 years) died by suicide (24 males, four females), compared to 33 in 1999 and 43 in 1998.

The suicide rate for Mäori youth in 2000 was 25.7 per 100,000, compared with the non-Mäori rate of 16.2 per 100,000.

In 2000, the rate of suicide for young Mäori males was 43.5 per 100,000, compared with the non-Mäori rate of 26.4 per 100,000.

In 2000, the rate of suicide for young Mäori females was 7.4 per 100,000, compared with the non-Mäori rate of 5.4 per 100,000.

Other information  
In 2000, amongst the total population, there were 31 suicide deaths in males aged 15 to 19, and 50 deaths in males aged 20 to 24; there were 11 deaths in females aged 15 to 19, and four in females aged 20 to 24. There were four deaths in people under 15 years of age.

In 2000, there were six youth (15-24 years) suicide deaths among Pacific people, and five among Asian people.

Is the overall rate of youth suicide decreasing?  
Yes. The youth suicide rate has now decreased for five consecutive years. The number and rate for 2000 are the lowest since 1986. The number and rate of youth suicides have dropped for both Mäori and non-Mäori, reflecting the reduction in the number of female suicide deaths. There has been a slight increase in the Mäori male rate, and a slight decrease in the non-Mäori male rate compared with 1999.

Because suicide is, in statistical terms, an uncommon event and rates vary from year to year, it is better to look at the total pattern of suicide rates over several years.

Suicide Attempt  
How many people attempted suicide in 2000/2001 (collected from mid-year to mid-year)

All ages  
The rate of hospitalisation for intentional self-harm in 2000/2001 was 129.2 per 100,000. It is not possible to compare this rate with previous years as the definition of intentional self-harm has been extended to include cases not previously included.

In 2000/2001 there were 1800 male hospitalisations (a rate of 91.7 per 100,000) and 3260 female hospitalisations (a rate of 167.4 per 100,000).

Among Mäori in 2000/2001 there were of 743 hospitalisations, at a rate of 119.0 per 100,000 (284 male hospitalisations at a rate of 93.5 per 100,000, and 459 female hospitalisations at a rate of 144.0 per 100,000).

Among non-Mäori in 2000/2001 there were of 4317 hospitalisations, at a rate of 131.2 per 100,000 (1516 male hospitalisations at a rate of 90.6 per 100,000, and 2801 female hospitalisations at a rate of 172.9 per 100,000).

More females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning, that generally are less fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.

The ratio for intentional self-harm in New Zealand in 2000/2001 was 1.8 female hospitalisations to every male hospitalisation.

Youth (15–24 years)  
Youth have the highest hospitalisation rates for intentional self-harm.  
The hospitalisation rate for young people (15–24 years) in 2000/2001 was 282.4 per 100,000 (1496 hospitalisations). The Mäori rate was 244.8 per 100,000, which was lower than the non-Mäori rate of 292.1 per 100,000  
In 2000/2001 there were 478 male hospitalisations (rate of 176.3 per 100,000) and 1018 female hospitalisations (rate of 393.5 per 100,000).  
In 2000/2001, the hospitalisation rate for Mäori females was 307.7 per 100,000, lower than the non-Mäori female rate of 416.0 per 100,000. For Mäori males the hospitalisation rate was 183.2 per 100,000, higher than the non-Mäori male rate of 174.6 per 100,000).

Are there problems with the accuracy of suicide attempt data?  
Yes. It is important to be cautious about interpretation of suicide attempt data.

We don’t have accurate data on all suicide attempts because records are only kept on those who are admitted to hospital as inpatients or day patients. Data is not collected nationally on people treated in Accident & Emergency (A&E) as outpatients (although some hospitals are now reporting people admitted to A&E day or short stay units), nor people treated by GPs, nor those who do not seek medical treatment.

Also, changing treatment practices make comparisons across years difficult. For example, improving treatments for overdose has meant that more people can be treated on an outpatient basis, and will not appear in hospitalisation suicide attempt figures. In addition, in 2000 a new international classification of disease (ICD-10) system was introduced that slightly altered the inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of Intentional Self-Harm; the definition of an admission also changed resulting in the inclusion of cases that had not previously been included.

The suicide attempt figures (above) are for self-inflicted injury and may include cases of deliberate self-harm where the intent was not death.  
Hospitalisation figures include people who are admitted more than once during that year, and also include those who died while in hospital.

What is the relationship between suicide and attempted suicide?  
People who have already made one suicide attempt are at greater risk of dying by suicide so it is important that such people get effective follow-up support and treatment.

Regional Comparisons  
Key points (total population)  
Although there is variation at the District Health Board level, no pattern in suicide rates is apparent. Caution should be used in interpreting regional variations due to small numbers and large fluctuations from year to year.  
Rates for 1996-2000 show that Northland, Bay of Plenty, Lakes, Wanganui, Hawkes Bay, West Coast and Canterbury District Health Boards have suicide rates significantly higher than the national rate. No District Health Board has suicide rates significantly lower than the national rate.

International Comparisons  
How does New Zealand’s suicide rate compare internationally?  
In comparison with selected OECD countries, New Zealand’s 2000 suicide rates are high for males, particularly male youth.  
In 2000, New Zealand’s all age suicide rates for males were the fourth highest among selected OECD countries. However, New Zealand’s female all age suicide rates were tenth among the selected OECD countries.

Note: Comparison years vary by country between 1997 and 2000.  
For youth aged 15–24 years, New Zealand has the second highest rates of suicide for males and fourth highest rates for females among selected OECD countries.

How accurate are international comparisons?  
Comparing international rates of suicide is inherently problematic as countries may have different evidentiary standards when ascertaining whether a death was a suicide.

Background Information on Suicide  
What causes people to want to take their own lives?  
Because each person is unique, there is no single reason why people choose to end their lives. However, from research it is known that several factors may contribute to a person engaging in suicidal behaviour.  
Mental disorder, most commonly depression, appears to be the most important risk factor for suicide and suicide attempts.  
Research from the Canterbury Suicide Project in Christchurch has found that young people who have died by suicide, or who have made a serious suicide attempt, often have shared circumstances, such as:  
·they have some underlying psychological distress or mental illness  
·they display some recognisable mental health or adjustment difficulty prior to the suicide attempt  
·immediately prior to the suicide attempt they may face a severe stress or life crisis that often centres around the breakdown of an emotional or supportive relationship  
·they tend to come from disturbed or unhappy family and childhood backgrounds  
·they tend to come from socially and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.  
Research from this study also found that approximately 90 percent of people who die by suicide or make suicide attempts will have one or more recognisable psychiatric disorders at the time. The most common of these are: depression, substance-use disorders (alcohol, cannabis and other drug abuse) and significant behavioural problems.

Are there protective factors for suicide?  
Research is continuing to investigate the range of factors that may have the capacity to protect people who might otherwise be at risk of suicide. Suggested protective factors include good coping skills and problem-solving behaviours, positive beliefs and values, feelings of self-esteem and belonging, connections to family or school, secure cultural identity, supportive family/whänau, hapü and iwi, responsibility for children, social support, and holding attitudes against suicide.

How can suicide be prevented?  
As there is no one reason that brings someone to take their own life, initiatives need to be in place across a range of settings supported by government, service providers, communities and families. Such interventions are generally aimed at promoting protective factors and reducing risk factors for suicide.

Key components of suicide prevention  
In the absence of conclusive scientific evidence on all aspects of suicide prevention, there is strong agreement internationally on the key components for suicide prevention. The main themes from reports and strategies on suicide prevention, both in New Zealand and internationally, state the need for a comprehensive and intersectoral approach. This approach should use multiple strategies that:  
·address multiple risk factors and enhance protective factors  
·involve sustained action over a long period  
·involve local, regional and national action  
·involve action across several sectors (eg, health, education, police, corrections, child, youth and family, etc)  
·have a wide view of prevention requiring interventions to occur at a range of levels including the environment, whole population, specific population groups (eg, Mäori, youth, Pacific peoples, males) and individuals at risk (preferably in the context of the family/whänau)  
·include a focus on improving data, research and evaluation.

Intervention themes  
There is general agreement that a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention needs interventions to address the following six themes:  
1Mental health promotion including strengthening social cohesion and providing supportive environments.  
2Effective, accessible and responsive services for people with mental disorders or suicidal behaviours (including prevention, recognition and treatment of depression).  
3Training and skill development on suicide risk assessment and management.  
4A managed approach to media and publicity about suicide.  
5Reducing access to the means of suicide.  
6Management and support for families and friends following suicide.

Examples of suicide prevention approaches  
·The prevention, recognition and treatment of depression.  
·The promotion of positive mental health in families, schools, workplaces and the community.  
·The promotion of awareness of mental health issues at the community level.  
·Improvement of services that have contact with people at risk of suicide (eg, primary healthcare, emergency services, Corrections, Child, Youth and Family, school guidance counsellors, etc).  
·The support of initiatives to reduce the stigma of mental illness (eg, Like Minds, Like Mine campaign).  
·The improvement of public understanding of what to do if someone is suicidal.  
·The improvement of support and treatment of those who have already attempted suicide, and their families and friends.  
·The implementation of measures to restrict access to the means of suicide.  
·The provision of guidance to the media about the reporting and publicity of suicide to minimise the potential of imitative suicides.  
·The improvement of knowledge and information systems so suicide prevention strategies can be targeted for the best outcomes.  
·The support of communities, families and whänau to provide emotionally safe and nurturing environments for all people, particularly children and young people.  
·The expansion of family support and early intervention services to help keep children and young people safe and healthy.

A toolkit has been developed to provide guidance to District Health Boards on the most effective ways in which they can work to reduce the rate of suicide and suicide attempts in their region. This is available on the Ministry of Health website:http://www.newhealth.govt.nz/toolkits.htm.

What is the New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy?  
In March 1998, the Government released The New Zealand Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. This strategy provides a framework for understanding what suicide prevention is, and signals the steps a range of government agencies, communities, service providers, Mäori whänau, hapü and iwi must take to reduce the incidence of suicide.

Through the strategy all suicide prevention initiatives should become increasingly coordinated and any service gaps identified and addressed.

The strategy has two components. In Our Hands is the general population strategy. Kia Piki te Ora o te Taitamariki takes an approach based on whänau, hapü, iwi and Mäori community development and encourages mainstream services to be more responsive to Mäori.

Since 2001 the Ministry of Youth Affairs has had the leadership role for promoting, coordinating and communicating the implementation of the strategy.  
A Ministerial and Inter-agency Committee, and an External Reference Group have also been formed to oversee the implementation of the strategy.

Where can people go for help?  
·If you are concerned about someone who may be suicidal or is very distressed you can approach the following people for advice:  
·general practitioner (GP) or practice nurse  
·community mental health service  
·Mäori community health service  
·counselling services such as school guidance counsellor, Iwi and other Mäori health/counselling services, lesbian and gay support counselling services, sexual abuse counselling services, alcohol and drug services, or other specialist counselling services, such as bereavement services, family counsellors, whänau support services, refugee support services, etc  
·help lines such as Lifeline, Samaritans or Youthline (refer to front pages of telephone book)  
·Group Special Support, Ministry of Education (formally Specialist Education Service).

In an emergency  
Anyone seriously concerned about an individual’s immediate safety should:  
remain with them until appropriate support arrives  
remove any obvious means of suicide (guns, medication, cars, knives, rope etc.)  
contact the nearest hospital or psychiatric emergency service.
