Eleven business incubators have been given a combined $1.8 million boost from Industry New Zealand’s Incubator Development Programme.

"The Incubator Development Programme is relatively new but is already proving extremely successful," says Associate Minister for Industry and Regional Development Pete Hodgson.

"In 2002 the annual turnover of the 103 companies in incubators that have received Industry New Zealand funding more than doubled, to an average of $237,000. These companies have also more than doubled their staff numbers, on average, and they have raised $10 million in equity funding."

Incubators typically provide workspace, support services and an intensive mentoring programme for entrepreneurs and new businesses at the start-up and early stages of development.

Industry New Zealand’s programme has been designed to help get a network of incubators up and running in New Zealand and to help ensure their long-term survival, by encouraging best practice in incubator management.

The $1.8 million granted in the latest round of incubator awards included funding for mentoring, marketing plans, commercialisation of intellectual property, information technology and salaries. Incubators housing high-growth potential companies with export and global opportunities are targeted for support.
