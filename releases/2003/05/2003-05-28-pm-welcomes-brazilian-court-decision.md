Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the decision to uphold the sentencing of the six men convicted of murdering Sir Peter Blake in December 2001.

The Brazilian Federal Appeal Court has decided unanimously to uphold the terms of the original verdict but have slightly reduced the periods of their sentences. The sentences – which originally ranged from 26 to 36 years – now range from 24 to 32 years. Further appeals to a higher court are unlikely.

“This brings finality to a tragic episode for both the Blake family and New Zealand,” Helen Clark said.

“The Brazilian court system acted swiftly to bring Peter Blake’s murderers to justice. This final sentence for these six young men reflects the severity of the crimes they committed and I am satisfied that justice has been done in this case.”

Helen Clark said Sir Peter would always be remembered and honoured in New Zealand for his sportsmanship and for the huge profile he brought the country through his yachting conquests.

“Two weeks ago the government announced a memorial to commemorate the life and work of Sir Peter, to be build on the Auckland waterfront. This memorial – which will include the boat which brought the America’s Cup to New Zealand - will ensure his legacy endures for generations to come.”
