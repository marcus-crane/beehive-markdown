A vision and direction for the development of biotechnology in New Zealand is set out in the Government’s Biotechnology Strategy, released today.

"This strategy is about developing the biotechnology sector with care," says Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson.

"Development with care means the Government wants New Zealand to reap the benefits of biotechnology in a responsible and sustainable way. To achieve that we need engagement and understanding between the biotechnology sector and the community, along with robust regulation that safeguards people and the environment.

"Biotechnology is an industry in itself, but it is much more that that. It generates knowledge, skills and technology that can contribute in numerous ways to achieving our economic, social and environmental aspirations.

"Wrestling with the opportunities and challenges presented by a fast-moving and complex sector is not easy, but standing still is not an option. That’s why the strategy calls for action in three areas — growth, community engagement and effective regulation."

To promote growth in biotechnology the strategy draws on the work of the Biotechnology Taskforce, set up under the Government’s Growth and Innovation Framework. The Taskforce has highlighted important factors including a strong knowledge, skill and research base, investment and infrastructure focused on New Zealand's strengths and strong international research links.

"Constructive community engagement and public confidence in effective regulation will underpin growth in biotechnology," Mr Hodgson said. "This strategy represents a commitment by the Government to work with communities, researchers and industry so New Zealanders can benefit from developing and applying our world-class biological knowledge, skills and innovation."
