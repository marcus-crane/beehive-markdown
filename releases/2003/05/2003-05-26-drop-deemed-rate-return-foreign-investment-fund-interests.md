Drop in deemed rate of return for foreign investment fund interests

The deemed rate of return for foreign investment fund interests has dropped from 10.46 per cent to 9.90 per cent for the 2002-03 income year, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The foreign investment fund rules tax New Zealand residents on undistributed profits arising in foreign entities in which they have invested but do not control.

The deemed rate of return, which is set annually, applies to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. It is based on an average of five-year government stock rates to which a margin of 4 per cent is added.
