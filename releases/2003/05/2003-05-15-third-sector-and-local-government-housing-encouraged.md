$63 million is to be spent encouraging greater involvement in housing by third sector groups and local government.

Acting Housing Minister Steve Maharey today announced an extra $43.262 in capital funding and $19.831 in operating funding will be spent over the next four years encouraging greater housing partnerships with local government and third sector organisations such as church groups and other non-government organisations, as well as iwi and Maori.

"We are keen to develop these sectors' involvement in social housing. Demonstration projects will be used to test their ability in developing housing solutions for low income people.

"The aim is to safeguard and extend the stock of social housing that is available to those on low incomes and those with special needs. Local government and third sector groups, with their strong community links, are in an excellent position to provide local solutions to local problems if they have the resourcing."

In the case of the third sector, Mr Maharey said it would take time to grow in to a sustainable and reasonable sized housing sector. This funding will assist with growth in both the third sector and local government.

"Activity levels are likely to be low initially and to increase incrementally over time."

An evaluation of the initiatives would be done in 2004/05.

Details of both the third sector initiative and the local government initiative are still under development and will be released later this year for comment.
