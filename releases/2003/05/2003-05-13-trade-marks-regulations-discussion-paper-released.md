Proposals for regulations to be made under the Trade Marks Act 2002 are set out in a discussion paper released today by Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard.

The Trade Marks Act 2002 was passed in December 2002 and substantially updates New Zealand’s trade mark legislation. The new Trade Marks Act:

·defines the scope of rights protected by trade marks more clearly;  
·simplifies and streamlines processes for registering a trade mark;  
·introduces some measures to address concerns of Maori over inappropriate registration of Maori text and imagery as trade marks;  
·introduces new measures to deter pirating of copyright works and counterfeiting of trade marks;  
·strengthens protection for well-known trade marks.

It is proposed that the regulations to be made under Act will for the most part retain the processes in place under the current regulations (the Trade Mark Regulations 1954). Areas for which new regulations are proposed include:  
·applications for registration of trade marks in multiple classes;  
·the merger and division of trade mark applications and the merger of registrations;  
·new proceedings for removal of trade marks from the register on the grounds of non-use; and  
·a case management system to increase efficiency in proceedings before the Commissioner of Trade Marks.

The closing date for submissions is Wednesday 11 June 2003. Submissions on the discussion paper should be sent to:
