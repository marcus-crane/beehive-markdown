Housing Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming a Tenancy Tribunal decision today awarding $500 exemplary damages and ordering illegal charges of $7580 to be repaid to a Papatoetoe family caught up in a scheme they thought was ‘rent to buy’, but in fact gave them no such right.

Mr Maharey said the Tribunal awarded the damages under the Residential Tenancies Act, ruling that money paid by the tenants in addition to rent since August 2001 was illegal.

“The family involved signed over ownership of their house in the belief that this would help them out of financial difficulties. The family understood they had a tenancy agreement with Blue Sky Holdings Ltd that would help them to gain credit-worthiness to buy back their house, by making extra payments in addition to rent.”

The Ministry of Housing’s Tenancy Services division uncovered the illegal payments after Blue Sky Holdings Ltd applied to the Tenancy Tribunal to evict the family for falling behind in their rent.

“The Ministry is aware of at least seven other possible cases where tenants appear to have signed similar agreements with the company and we are making sure the tenants involved are aware of their rights, which include taking their case to the Tenancy Tribunal.

“It’s in the public interest that the Ministry of Housing actively pursues cases of this kind, and helps raise people’s awareness of the dangers of signing a tenancy agreement that they don’t fully understand,” Mr Maharey said.

Mr Maharey also endorsed earlier Consumers’ Institute comments that warn people against schemes that involve transferring property ownership to secure finance.

“The risk of vulnerable people losing their homes through this type of arrangement is too great and anyone considering such a transaction should get solid legal advice on any contract they are asked to sign,” he said.

The Minister said the issues of this case go further than the scope of the Residential Tenancies Act, which covers landlord-tenant relationships. The Ministry of Housing is ensuring that people potentially affected by Blue Sky agreements understand the full range of their rights and remedies under the law, in terms of the legal ownership of their properties, and how they can go about enforcing those rights.

Key points from the Tenancy Tribunal adjudicator’s decision include:

·There was no legal basis upon which Blue Sky was entitled to claim an additional $145 per week from the tenants.  
·The tenants mistakenly paid the additional money in the belief that those payments were accumulating equity for the purchase of the property, and were therefore entitled to full recovery of those payments.  
·The manner in which the arrangements between the parties came into play were of particular concern. They were reasonably complex and conducted without the tenants receiving the benefit of legal advice.  
·Blue Sky should have ensured that all the documentation was properly executed and understood by the parties. However, the lease agreement was undated and unsigned and there was no proper record of the apparent agreement that the tenants would receive financial benefit in the event they decided to exercise the option to purchase. The tenants also did not appear to have received copies of the documentation.
