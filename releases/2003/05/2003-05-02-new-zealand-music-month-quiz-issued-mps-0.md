Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard has issued her annual New Zealand music quiz to all Members of Parliament in celebration of New Zealand Music Month.

“The twenty-question quiz started three years ago when I thought that it would be a fun and informative way to get politicians thinking about all the New Zealand music around them,” said Judith Tizard.

“This year, music industry experts from the New Zealand Music Industry Commission, New Zealand On Air, Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Sounz have helped me with a broad range of questions covering the spectrum of New Zealand music.

“I don’t mind whether MPs choose to answer the questions off the tops of their heads, or get stuck in and do some research. Either way, I think it’s a great way to learn a little more about our vibrant and successful music scene, and each year more and more MPs take up the challenge.”

Prizes up for grabs for the MPs include New Zealand Music Month t-shirts and New Zealand On Air hit-discs. Answers must be in to Judith Tizard’s office by 12 noon, Thursday 8 May.

Judith Tizard said the New Zealand Music Awards on Wednesday night were a fantastic celebration of the local music industry, which is in a solid position with strong domestic sales and exciting international opportunities.

“There’s a lot of positive work happening at the moment to increase the profile and exports of New Zealand music. Since the World Series showcases of New Zealand music last year, many of the World Series delegates have developed business relationships with sectors of the New Zealand music industry and have gone out of their way to promote New Zealand music overseas.”

The New Zealand Music Industry Commission, Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand have been supporting the opportunities that have arisen as a direct result of the World Series, which has seen New Zealand music showcased in the US and Canada.

“Music has enormous potential to contribute to New Zealand’s economic and cultural wellbeing. It’s vital that musicians can continue to do what they do best – write, record and perform their songs. But they also need a supportive and healthy business environment in order to make a long term living from their talents. So we’re working across the government on ways to build up management skills, strengthen the industry, increase business capability and expand export networks, for all forms of New Zealand music,” said Judith Tizard.
