Budget 2003 provides for 50 additional police and a specialist mobile DNA squad for Auckland.

Police Minister George Hawkins said 32 of the extra police would be involved with emergency response, providing an extra 49,600 hours annually of police patrol and response time.

"Half of the new staff will come on stream in the 2004 financial year and the rest in the 2005 financial year," Mr Hawkins said. The funding allocated is $13.1 million over four years, plus capital costs of $560,000 over the next two years.

Funding for the squad of three DNA teams is $7.26 million over four years \[operating] and $138,000 in capital costs in 2003-04.

"The three teams, each comprising two sworn and one non-sworn staff, will form a mobile collection capability to attend crimes scenes and offenders in cells. They could generate a further 3500 samples 500 DNA 'hits' a year.

"It is estimated each 'hit' could see between five and 10 offences resolved annually, particularly property offences," Mr Hawkins said.
