Victim Support's plan to improve regional-based assistance to victims of crime has been boosted by funding in this year's Budget, Justice Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Funding of $2 million over the next four years will mean that Victim Support can introduce a regionally-based professional management structure to improve the quality and consistency of the services it offers to victims of crime," Mr Goff said.

“The funding will provide for the appointment of district managers to cover each of the 14 Victim Support districts. Each manager will be responsible for ensuring that victims get the assistance they need, delivered by properly trained and professionally supported volunteer workers. They will also be responsible for organising local fundraising.

“Victim Support has a long-standing goal of providing professional, case-specific support to victims throughout New Zealand.

"The additional funding will help them meet that objective, and it also demonstrates the government’s on-going commitment and support for victims’ rights.

"This funding will complement the extension and strengthening of victims' rights in the Victims' Rights Act passed in December of last year," Mr Goff said.

Victim Support was established in 1986 as a community-based voluntary organisation. It has over 1500 volunteer workers in 67 locations across the country available to support to victims on a 24-hour basis.

Last year Victim Support responded to over 100,000 incidents and provided support and assistance to over 135,000 victims.
