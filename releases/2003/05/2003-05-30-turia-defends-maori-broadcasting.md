Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has called on Maori broadcasters to move forward steadily through turbulent times.

“I support our broadcasters. Maori broadcasting has a proud history of making limited funding go a long way. The hard work, commitment and creative skills of programme makers and broadcasters have changed the face of New Zealand broadcasting over the past 20 years,” she said.

“No-one could be more disappointed by the recent problems at Te Mangai Paho than Maori broadcasters themselves, who have achieved great things for their people on shoestring budgets.

“Nevertheless, I note that representatives of Maori broadcasters have expressed support for Te Mangai Paho. I think that is very significant.

“In the run-up to the launch of Maori television, it seems attacks on Maori broadcasting have increased. Some critics seem to feel threatened by independent Maori media.

“Perhaps they are afraid of tangata whenua being able to project their own view of the world, tell their own side of the story, and defend themselves from unfair criticism.

“I am confident that Maori broadcasters have the strength and courage to withstand the storm, and they will continue to answer their critics by making top quality programmes that interest, enthuse and excite all New Zealanders,” said Mrs Turia.
