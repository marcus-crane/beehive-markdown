About $26 million is to be spent over the next four years to provide an extra 77 community houses above the 214 already planned, Acting Housing Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

"This government has a strong commitment to helping community based groups deliver health and social services. Over the last three budgets the government has committed $87 million in new capital funding for extra community houses. This builds on that."

Steve Maharey said the new houses would available to a range of organisations such as Women's Refuges, community health and support groups offering residential services.

"These houses are used by some of the most vulnerable in our society - people with physical and intellectual disabilities, mental illness and those who are escaping abuse. Many of these groups have great difficulty finding suitable housing in the private sector. Providing more community homes is one way the government can work in partnership with community organisations to help those with special needs."

"In many cases modifications are needed to the houses to suit these special needs, and this funding includes funds to allow those modifications, Steve Maharey said.
