A single Standard Training Measure (STM) rate is to be introduced for all Industry Training Organisations (ITOs), Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The government funds the industry training through a part-subsidy for training organised through ITOs. Employers also make a co-contribution. Funding to individual ITOs is on the basis of a specified volume of training. There is a currently considerable variation in STM rates between ITOs.

Speaking at the Electrotechnology ITO Annual Industry Forum today, Steve Maharey said the decision follows advice from a working group of ITOs and officials which reported to the government in December.

“Shifting to a single STM rate will ensure greater certainty for ITOs, while maintaining the flexibility that has made industry training such a success.

“The transition to the new funding system will be carefully managed to ensure that training participation, quality and coverage are not compromised. The move to a single STM rate is in the best interests of the sector’s goals for industry training and tertiary education.

“A number of ITOs and the Industry Training Federation were concerned about the level of variation in STM rates, which are a consequence of historical factors relating back to the pre-1992 system.

“The working group was set up to advise the government on how we should evolve the funding system for industry training so that it can take its place in a revitalized tertiary education sector. It agreed that a single price was the approach most consistent with sustainable funding principles”, Steve Maharey said.
