Education Minister Trevor Mallard has made preliminary decisions on the future of schools in the Upper Waitaki Valley, based on discussions between the Ministry of Education and the school communities.

Trevor Mallard is now asking for further consultation on the initial findings of the review designed to ensure a strong and viable network of schools in the Upper Waitaki Valley.

The preliminary decisions are:

·The merger of Hakataramea, Otematata School with the Kurow Area School to create a full primary school on the Kurow Area School site;

·The retention of Cattle Creek School as a full primary school;

·Providing secondary pupils with school transport assistance so they can easily access quality schooling in Oamaru.

“The aim of this review is to ensure that quality and sustainable education continues to be provided for the students in this area. I realise the process of change is a stressful one and I’d like to thank all those involved in consultation for their time and efforts,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I’ve been pleased with the level of involvement of schools and the community so far and encourage schools to stay engaged in the process of consultation and to work towards the continued provision of quality education for local children.”

Trevor Mallard expects to make final decisions in July after further consultation with the schools involved.
