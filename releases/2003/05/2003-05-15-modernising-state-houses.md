A major programme to modernise state houses is to be accelerated over the next three years, Acting Housing Minister Steve Maharey said today.

"The average state house is about 36 years old and some are more than 50 years old, so there is a huge need to bring state housing stock up to modern standards both to make them more pleasant to live in and to help maintain the value of our state housing stock.

The work will be allocated $60 million in capital funding is over three years and operating funding of $674,000 over four years.

"A modernisation programme has been underway for two years. We had already planned to spend $30.5 million over the next three years. This new funding accelerates the programme, bring total funding to $90 million."
