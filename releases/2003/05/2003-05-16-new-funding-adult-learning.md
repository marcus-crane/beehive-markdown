New funding of $6.7 million will be injected into Adult and Community Education and Foundation Learning over the next four years, Associate Minister Marian Hobbs announced to the ACE Aotearoa Conference in Christchurch today.

"An effective ACE sector is crucial in building a knowledge society and providing all New Zealanders with accessible opportunities for lifelong learning," Marian Hobbs said. "The government has committed $2.8 million for new ACE Regional Networks to assist in building communication and support among education providers.

"ACE is the area of our education system that needs to be affordable and accessible and the government is committed to achieving these goals.

"The government is also investing $3.9 million over the next four years to develop Foundation Learning and assist providers of non-formal education.

"Employers are continually saying many employees lack the basic skills in reading, writing, computer and communications and this is a real barrier to growth and innovation opportunities.

"Developing these foundation skills is critical to ensuring all young people and adults can achieve to their full potential and contribute to the growth and innovation of our nation.

"All of these changes will help in ensuring we have informed and educated adults.  
"In a society where 'people' are more important than 'things', it will be knowledgeable and skilled people who will be the resource that can rebuild our society to be more inclusive, more productive and extend greater influence in the wider world," Marian Hobbs said.
