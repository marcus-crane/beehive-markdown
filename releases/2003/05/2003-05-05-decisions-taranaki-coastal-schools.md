Education Minister Trevor Mallard has made decisions on the future of schools in coastal Taranaki following further consultation with the community.

“The review of coastal Taranaki schools will result in a stronger and more stable network of schools and provide additional resources to strengthen the delivery of education to Taranaki children,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The process of change is a stressful one and I’d like to thank all those involved in consultation for their time and efforts over the past year and I acknowledge their role in this review.

“I look forward to Taranaki children enjoying the benefits of the additional resources which changes to the network will release.”

The decisions are:  
·To retain Pungarehu School, Kapuni School and Kaponga School as full primaries, until at least the end of 2004, but to include these schools in further network reviews;

·To retain Opunake High School as a Year 9-13 school;

·To retain Rahotu school as a full primary school;

·To retain Te Kura Kaupapa Mâori o Tamarongo;

·To merge Oaonui School and Opunake Primary School on the Opunake School site;

·To merge Pihama, Te Kiri, Riverlea and Auroa Schools on the existing Auroa School site.

Trevor Mallard said he had representations from the schools and primary teacher union NZEI (New Zealand Educational Institute) and had changed his earlier decision to close schools in the area, choosing instead to merge them.

He expects to finally confirm decisions in early June after the schools involved have a statutory 28-day period for final comment. The aim is to have the changes implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
