The news that The Blues Franchise has had to increase the number of trains it is running to Eden Park for the Super 12 final this Saturday bodes well for the future of passenger transport in Auckland, says Associate Minister of Transport and Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“I want to congratulate the Blues Franchise and Tranz Metro for the excellent partnership they have formed during the Super 12 competition to get fans to and from the games,” said Judith Tizard.

“I’m delighted with the popularity of the trains, and of course with the performance of the Blues in the Super 12. As the Blues have progressed towards the final, the number of fans using the trains to get to Eden Park has increased hugely. Tranz Metro tell me the service has been more successful than they had imagined.

“I became aware of how successful this service was when I started getting letters and emails from Auckland rugby fans who were disappointed that they hadn’t been able to get on a train to recent games.

“I would like to acknowledge that this is a free service provided by The Blues Franchise expressly for the Eden Park Super 12 games. It’s always a challenge to move 40,000 fans in and out of central Auckland smoothly, and it’s important for people to have alternative transport plans in order to get to the ground in time for kick-off.”

Judith Tizard said she was pleased to hear that to cope with the service’s popularity, Tranz Metro will increase the capacity of this Saturday’s train service to 50% more than last weekend. This means 2,700 fans will take the train to the game and home again.

“This is fantastic news and shows the potential of passenger transport for the Auckland region. It’s an area where train services can excel in the future, once capacity and frequency issues have been addressed as part of the Auckland passenger rail upgrade.

“Solving Auckland’s transport needs requires a variety of solutions, and rail plays a key part in that. The government is working in partnership with the Auckland region on developing a sustainable, efficient Auckland transport system.

“The recently released draft Auckland Passenger Rail Upgrade Project business plan’s aim to increase annual rail passenger trips from 2.5 million to 25 million by 2015 will, if successful, play a major role in reducing congestion on Auckland’s roads, in addition to delivering major environmental benefits from greater use of trains and other forms of passenger transport.”
