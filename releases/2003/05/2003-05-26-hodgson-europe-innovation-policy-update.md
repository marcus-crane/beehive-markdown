Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson departs New Zealand for Europe tomorrow to study innovation policy developments, especially research-based relationships between industry and universities.

"I will be looking at how various European governments have set out to strengthen the contribution that research, science and technology make to economic growth," Mr Hodgson said.

"I am particularly interested in how they have fostered links between industry and universities to help transform ideas into marketable products. This is an essential area of development for New Zealand, where the successful commercialisation of ideas from publicly funded research is crucial for our country’s future economic growth."

Mr Hodgson also aims to strengthen research links with key European partners. He will visit Stockholm, Brussels, Paris and London, meeting Swedish Science and Education Minister Thomas Östros, European Union Innovation Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, French Science Minister Claudie Haigneré and UK Secretary of State for Education Charles Clarke. He will visit research institutions, science parks and innovative companies.

While in Brussels Mr Hodgson will attend the first International Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition Conference. In Paris he will participate in an OECD Ministerial Round Table on Sustainable Development of Global Fisheries, hosted by Hon Simon Upton.

Mr Hodgson returns to Wellington on Monday 9 June.
