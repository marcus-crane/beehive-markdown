The budget provides $2 million over the next two years to improve water management, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"Water quality and allocation is one focus for the government's Sustainable Development Action Programme and the money will be used to develop and co-ordinate policies across government and the wider community," Marian Hobbs said.

"Clean abundant water is essential to our economic prosperity, health, environment and cultural identity.

"There is likely to be significant increasing demand for water across much of New Zealand over the next 10 years. Irrigation, for example, contributes some $1 billion annually to our economy.

"But we lack strategic national and regional perspectives on water protection and use.

"The Ministry for the Environment will be working across government on new ways to allocate water.

"We are placing particular emphasis on safeguarding values and assets that are of national importance. Strong partnerships with central government agencies, local government, industry, Maori and the community will be a feature of our water programme."
