Budget 2003 shows an integrated, whole-of-government approach to sustainable economic growth and innovation," says Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

"The budget features a cross-portfolio focus on improving skills and talent, developing our international connections and enhancing our innovative capacity - three key elements of the Growth and Innovation Framework.

"This total GIF package of $397 million (including contingencies) over the next four years is supported by sound and smart investment in a substantial education package, in crime prevention and in social development.

"Combine that with existing economic, industry and regional development funding of $112 million, and we have a powerful package for sustainable growth," Jim Anderton said.

- Significant provision has been made to support the work of the GIF industry taskforces, with $15 million allocated in 2003-04, rising to $35 million by 2006-07.
- International e-commerce gets a boost with $1.9 million each year for the marketnewzealand.com website. Established by Trade NZ, this portal brings together New Zealand exporters and potential buyers. Officials will report to government by the end of 2004 on the progress of the portal and recommendations for additional measures to aid international trade matching.
- The small business portfolio will receive $1.84 million in 2003-04 and $96,000 thereafter.
- Trade enhancement will receive around $73 million over four years to support a longer term trade development strategy. (see separate release).
- $550,000 has been provided for an Infrastructure Stocktake into energy, transport, telecommunications and water infrastructure. (previously announced)
- $1.9 million a year for the next three years has been allocated to the sustainable cities work programme, a priority initiative under the Sustainable Development Programme of Action announced earlier this year.
- In addition to these growth related allocations, the capability of the Ministry of Economic Development will be expanded to support implementation of the growth and innovation framework ($7.6 million over four years).

"These measures add weight to the strong portfolio of regional, industry and business development programmes this government has put in place since 1999," Jim Anderton said.
