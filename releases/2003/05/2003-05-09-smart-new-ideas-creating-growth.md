“Commercialising new ideas is a key to New Zealand’s economic future, “said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today in announcing 94 new Enterprise Awards from Industry New Zealand.

“I am pleased to see that the Enterprise Awards lists always feature people and businesses seeking funding for intellectual property protection, developing prototypes and commercialising their new ideas, “ said Jim Anderton.

The total of awards announced today comes to over $1.2 million, and mark over 770 awards granted since October 2000.

Enterprise Awards provide early stage financial assistance for well-defined business projects and concepts. Proposals must have commercial potential and be directed at the creation of a new business or the expansion of an existing one.

The awards are made to businesses with good prospects of making a sustained contribution to the New Zealand economy in coming years,” said Jim Anderton.

Today 38 Ministers and Government MPs are visiting more than 50 businesses (some of them are enterprise award winners), schools and skills training organisations to see growth and innovation at work. Smart Growth Day visits celebrate growth through new ideas in the lead up to Budget 2003. .

Today Jim Anderton and Steve Maharey will announce a Bio Commerce centre supported by $2 million provided by Government in partnership with the Manawatu region. Later Jim Anderton will announce assistance for a world class electronics cluster of companies in Christchurch.
