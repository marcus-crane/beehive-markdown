Ngati Ruanui of South Taranaki filled the public gallery at Parliament after coming to Wellington to witness their Treaty Claims Settlement Bill pass into legislation.

Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said the Bill brings an end to the longstanding and significant grievances of Ngati Ruanui which related mostly to loss of life and destruction of property during the Taranaki wars, and to the loss of land later on.

"The historical background to their claims makes for sombre reading. There is no doubt the Crown behaved atrociously toward Ngati Ruanui and its actions had a prejudicial impact on their development throughout the past 160 years."

Margaret Wilson said the Bill includes a formal apology to Ngati Ruanui for the breaches of the Treaty acknowledged by the Crown, which she will read out publicly at Pariroa Pa near Hawera next month.

Along with this Crown Apology, the Ngati Ruanui Claims Settlement Bill provides cultural and commercial redress.

"The cultural redress recognises Ngati Ruanui's traditional, historical, cultural and spiritual association with places and sites owned by the Crown within the Ngati Ruanui area of interest," Margaret Wilson said.

"The commercial redress includes a combination of cash and Crown-owned land up the value of $41 million."

With the passing of the Bill the people of Ngati Ruanui and the Crown could now build an effective and durable relationship based on goodwill and trust, Margaret Wilson said.
