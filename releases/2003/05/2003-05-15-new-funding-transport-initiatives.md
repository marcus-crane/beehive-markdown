"Budget 2003 contains funding for a suite of new transport initiatives," says Transport Minister Paul Swain.

The new funding includes $1.069 million in 2003-04 and $844,000 a year thereafter for the Ministry of Transport and the Maritime Safety Authority to meet the cost of implementing international maritime security measures when they come into force in July, next year.

"These measures were agreed by the international community post 11 September to combat terrorism and to reduce security risks to shipping," said Mr Swain.

Other budget transport initiatives include:

- $75,000 in 2002-03 and $250,000 in 2003-04 for the Maritime Safety Authority to boost its recreational boating safety programme. The funding this year will go towards the cost of publicising new safety rules that require lifejackets to be carried on recreational craft.
- $500,000 of additional funding per year for the Transport Accident Investigation Commission to hire more investigative staff.
- $1.012 million over the next two years for the continuation of funding to investigate the pricing and regulatory treatment of road and rail, charging for traffic congestion and implementation of the Land Transport Management Bill.
- $190,000 to provide security screening services at the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Auckland in August 2003.
