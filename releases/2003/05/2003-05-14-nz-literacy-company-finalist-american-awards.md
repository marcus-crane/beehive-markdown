Education Minister Trevor Mallard congratulated Wellington-based Learning Media Limited on becoming a finalist for a prominent American educational publishing award.

Learning Media Limited produces world leading literacy materials and programmes, and their website www.orbitforkids.com has been chosen from more than 1,000 entries as a finalist in the 2003 Distinguished Achievement Awards, run by the Association of Educational Publishers (AEP).

"Learning Media Limited's innovative literacy materials are making a difference to kids' reading both here in New Zealand and overseas, and this latest achievement recognises that," Trevor Mallard said.

The website is designed to give online research support to readers of Learning Media's Double Takes literacy series.

"One of the government's key education priorities is to build an education system that will equip New Zealanders with 21st century skills. Our kids need to be familiar with print and electronic information sources, and this website is a good example of information technology being used to further students' learning," Trevor Mallard said.

New York City recently adopted Learning Media Limited's new audio-assisted intervention programme for struggling readers, New Heights, to use in its 11 most challenging school districts.
