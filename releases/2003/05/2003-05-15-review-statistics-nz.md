16 May 2003Media Statement  
Review of Statistics NZ

The extra $40 million for Statistics NZ announced in the Budget will go hand-in-hand with a top-down review of Statistics NZ, Statistics Minister John Tamihere said.

Budget 2003 provides a total of $39.7 million extra funding for Statistics New Zealand over four years, including an extra $17.4 million for the census.  
Mr Tamihere said the review would ensure that money, and future funding to Statistics NZ, was spent in the most effective way.

The review will be conducted by Treasury and the State Services Commission in conjunction with Statistics NZ, and will report to the Ministers of Statistics, State Services and Finance by mid-year.

Mr Tamihere said that while the extra funding in the budget would relieve budgetary pressures that had arisen through increasing demand for statistics and information, the review would reach a more lasting solution to such pressures, reduce overheads and core infrastructure costs, and see that risks were better managed and productivity gains were achieved.

It would ensure that Statistics NZ outputs met as high standards as possible in terms of quality, quantity and timeliness, Mr Tamihere said.  
Over the last decade, there had been increasing fragmentation of official statistics, particularly in the fields of social statistics and sustainable development indicators, he said.

Mr Tamihere said it was important that the review and increase in funding acknowledged and adequately resourced the vital role played by Statistics NZ in informing social, political , economic and business decision-making.
