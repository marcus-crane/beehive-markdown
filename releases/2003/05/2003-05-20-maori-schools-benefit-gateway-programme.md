Thirty-two Kura Kaupapa Maori, Maori Boarding schools, Wharekura and other schools that use Maori language as the primary source of instruction now qualify for funding as part of the government's Gateway programme for schools.

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said the programme prepared young people for the world of work while they are still at school.

"Senior secondary students get to start work-based qualifications and they learn the disciplines of work," said Parekura Horomia.

The Gateway project is part of a $56 million budget package aimed at seeing all 15-19 year olds in education, training or work-based programmes by 2007. The Government plans to make available a range of training options, including expanding the Modern Apprenticeship programmes as well as specialised support from Work and Income.

Parekura Horomia wanted to encourage all eligible schools to be part of the Gateway Programme, which will progressively expand to all 1-5 decile schools taking in 12-thousand students a year by 2007.

â€œThe package also expands the popular Modern Apprenticeships scheme which currently extends to one out of every seven of those taking part in the programme," said Mr Horomia. That is around 750 fulltime Modern Maori Apprentices he said.

â€œI'd like employers and educators to secure as many of these extra Modern Apprentices as possible, as a key contributor to economic growth for Maori."

â€œThese initiatives â€“ and others in the youth training package â€“ mean the government will meet the goal it agreed with the Mayorsâ€™ Taskforce For Jobs that by 2007, all 15-19 year olds will be engaged in appropriate education, training, work or other options that will lead to long term economic independence and well-being.

â€œI welcome this youth training package because it specifically targets those young people who do not go on to university or polytechnic.

"It enables them to learn the skills they need to be part of todayâ€™s workforce,â€? Parekura Horomia said.
