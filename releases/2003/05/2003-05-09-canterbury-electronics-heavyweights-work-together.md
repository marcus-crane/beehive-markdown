The Canterbury Electronics Group (CEG) is a prime example of innovative New Zealand firms working together to boost exports and growth, Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton said today.

Jim Anderton was in Christchurch today (May 9) announcing Industry New Zealand support of $50,000 for the Canterbury electronics cluster. Today 38 Ministers and Government MPs are visiting more than 50 businesses, (some of them are enterprise award winners), schools and skills training organisations to see growth and innovation at work. Smart Growth Day visits celebrate growth through new ideas in the lead up to Budget 2003.

“Clusters such as CEG are critical if we want to grow this highly successful hi tech industry in New Zealand. These companies export 90% of their output and by forming a cluster have collectively identified ways to increase growth opportunities as well remove barriers to growth faced by their industry.”

The CEG cluster, which has been operating for three years, includes Allied Telesyn Research Ltd, Dynamic Controls, Invensys Energy Systems (NZ) Ltd, Pulse Data International Ltd, Tait Electronics Ltd, and Trimble Navigation (NZ) Ltd.

The funding is to be used by the cluster to employ a full-time co-ordinator. The CEG is contributing $85,000 from its own membership.  
The co-ordinator is to establish and implement strategic initiatives aimed at growing the cluster, create savings for cluster members through supply chain initiatives, and promote career opportunities and development in the electronics industry.

Industry New Zealand General Manager Southern Region Paul Claridge said the government assistance for the cluster is a good example of how Industry New Zealand can work in partnership with companies to help them grow their sector.

“The cluster has been operating using its own resources for three years and in that time has carried out an impressive range of joint activities for its membership. In particular, research on the economic impact of the electronics industry in Canterbury and the contribution per employee per annum this hi tech sector makes to New Zealand, very useful. The contribution per worker to the New Zealand economy in these firms is $214,000 per person per annum and is predicted to rise to $230,000 per person per annum in five years. This compares with an average for New Zealand of $61.280 per person per annum.  
“The cluster is now aware that staffing requirements in the electronics industry over the next five years are likely to be in the region of 1750 qualified staff plus over 500 unqualified staff. As this is far in excess of the numbers currently coming out of New Zealand tertiary institutions, the cluster is already working actively with education providers at all levels to encourage more students to study electronics.

“They have a long-term approach and want to be world-class in terms of practices and competitiveness, with the infrastructure to support that goal.”
