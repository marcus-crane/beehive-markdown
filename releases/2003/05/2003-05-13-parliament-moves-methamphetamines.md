Parliament is due tonight to debate the motion relating to the reclassification of methamphetamine to class A from class B as well as classifying four similar drugs.

The motion in Jim Anderton’s name seeks Parliament’s approval of the Misuse of Drugs (Changes to Controlled Drugs) Order 2003. Once Parliament approves the Order it may take as little as two weeks to come into force.

Jim Anderton said the proposed moves will allow stronger penalties for those caught making or possessing these drugs.

“We are committed to greater powers for the Police when they suspect methamphetamine is being manufactured, sold or used,” Jim Anderton said.

This is just the first step against this and other similar drugs. The Ministerial Action Group at its next meeting will be considering for approval a draft Methamphetamine ‘Plan of Action’ which, will detail the scope of the problem, current actions being undertaken and outline recommendations for further efforts to minimise the harm caused by methamphetamine in New Zealand

The Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs chaired by Jim Anderton is responsible for the Government’s campaign to minimize harm caused by alcohol and illicit drug use. The plan will focus on reducing demand, controlling supply and limiting problems associated with alcohol and drug use. The Group includes Associate Health Minister, Jim Anderton; Justice Minister, Phil Goff; Education Associate Minister, Lianne Dalziel; Police Minister, George Hawkins; Youth Affairs Minister, John Tamihere; Customs Minister Rick Barker; and Health Associate Minister Damien O’Connor.
