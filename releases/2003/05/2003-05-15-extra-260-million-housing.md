Nearly $260 million in extra funding for housing low-income people and those at risk is contained in Budget 2003, said Acting Housing Minister Steve Maharey today.

The funding, which is over four years, consists of:

- Nearly $100 million to be spent on providing another 318 state homes as well as extending 80 houses to better suit larger families. This is on top of the state houses that were already planned.
- About $60 million to accelerate the modernisation programme for state houses, on top of $30.5 million already planned over the next three years.
- $63 million to encourage greater involvement in housing by local government and third sector groups such as churches, non-governmental organisations, iwi and Maori.
- About $26 million to provide an extra 77 community houses, to be used by a range of community groups offering residential services such as women's refuge and community health services.
- $5.3 million for a two-year pilot home ownership mortgage insurance scheme. The scheme is scheduled to begin later this year. Details are still being developed.
- $1 million on expanding Ministry of Housing tenancy information and education services, with the focus particularly on "at risk" groups.
  
  The new spending totals $259.39 million.
  
  "This government has already added an extra 3200 homes to the state housing stock since becoming government in December 1999, as well as reintroducing income related rents. These new initiatives further demonstrate our commitment to ensuring decent, affordable housing for all New Zealanders," Steve Maharey said.
