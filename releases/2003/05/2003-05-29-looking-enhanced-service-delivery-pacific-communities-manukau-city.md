More than 100 community, local, and central government representatives are gathering in Manukau City on 9 May to discuss how to improve the delivery of services to Pacific communities.

Hosted by Taito Phillip Field, MP for Mangere and Parliamentary Undersecretary for Social Services and Employment, the forum will seek community views on what is working well in terms of the service delivered to Pacific peoples in Manukau City.

Taito Phillip Field said “The forum will provide Work and Income, Community Employment Group and Child Youth and Family with direct feedback about how they can enhance their response to the needs and priorities of their local communities.

“This consultation meeting will lead to action, as I will be using information from this forum to report to Minister of Social Services and Employment Steve Maharey on these issues.

“I will also be talking with my parliamentary colleagues about issues and feedback from the forum that fall outside Social Services and Employment.

“The regional managers from each of the three agencies will also be working together after the forum to draw up an action plan to address issues raised at the forum in conjunction with the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs Community Reference Group process,” Taito Phillip Field said.
