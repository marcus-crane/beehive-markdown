Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today welcomed submissions made in response to the ‘Better Regulation of the Building Industry in New Zealand’ discussion paper.

The document, prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development, was released for public comment in March.

“Over 300 submissions have been received by the Ministry which signals a high level of interest from the building industry and consumers.

“Ministry officials have analysed the submissions and overall, the proposed changes have been positively received by submitters. It is clear that industry members recognise the need for some change to the current systems and that they welcome the opportunity for an improved regulatory framework.

“The proposals outlined in the discussion document were developed in close consultation with stakeholders who continued to be involved throughout the submission process.”

Lianne Dalziel said that the main themes of the submissions were:

- The need for competent and good quality tradespeople
- Support for building practitioner registration
- The need for better more accessible, good quality information

“These themes support the direction that government is taking in strengthening the regulatory framework without stifling innovation,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Final proposals arising from the discussion paper, the select committee report on weathertightness and the earlier review of the Building Act will be considered by the government within the next few weeks. Legislation is planned for introduction to Parliament by the end of July.
