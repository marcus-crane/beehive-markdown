Details of disclosure obligations for directors and officers are the focus of a discussion document released today, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel said.

"This is part of the government's on-going effort to promote transparency and good corporate governance in securities dealings,” the Minister said.

The discussion document, entitled Details and Form of Disclosure of Relevant Interests by Directors and Officers, considers possible regulations relating to provisions within the Securities Markets Act designed to ensure that information about directors’ and officers’ holdings in securities in listed companies is transparent and current.

“The provisions also deter and assist in monitoring insider trading and market manipulation as the dates of the trades can be checked against the dates that information enters the public domain”.

The Securities Markets Amendment Act 2002 – part of the Securities and Markets Institutions Bill - introduced a requirement that directors and officers of public issuers disclose relevant interests and dealings in securities of the public issuer within five trading days. Implementation of this subpart was delayed to allow development, drafting and public consultation on regulations.

“The discussion paper seeks views on possible regulations which:  
Prescribe further matters relating to a relevant interest, acquisition, disposal of a relevant interest that directors and officers must disclose, and the form of disclosure;  
Consider whether any class or classes of persons should be declared not to be officers for the purposes of the Act; and  
Consider whether any classes of persons or classes of relevant interests, acquisitions, or disposals should be exempted from disclosure requirements.

“After consultation and further analysis by the Ministry of Economic Development, regulations are expected to be in place by October 2003,” Lianne Dalziel said.
