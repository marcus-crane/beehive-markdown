Associate Health Minister and Progressive leader Jim Anderton warned Methamphetamine importers, manufacturers and suppliers that from today they will be risking life imprisonment as Methamphetamine changes from Class B2 to Class A under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

“This is one of the first actions taken up by the Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs under the new Methamphetamine Action Plan which is addressing the growing Methamphetamine problem across New Zealand.

“While dabbling in other drugs might impair people’s performances Methamphetamine is pure evil and can have permanent, serious physical and psychological effects on individuals while creating havoc in families, and communities.

“Class A status means life imprisonment for importing, manufacturing and supplying. It also gives Police stronger powers. They can search and seize without a warrant where they have reasonable suspicion that the drugs are present.

“Last week I announced on behalf of the Coalition Government the Methamphetamine Action Plan which will increase enforcement, reduce supply and have an increased emphasis on helping victims of the drug.

The Action Plan has 19 action points and including greater search and seizure powers for Police and powers for Customs to seize unlicensed imports of the ingredients for Methamphetamine, improved community education and more comprehensive drug monitoring surveillance data to support enforcement.

One of the next moves will be to begin establishing community action groups around New Zealand to address drug abuse.

The Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs is responsible for the Government’s campaign to minimise harm caused by alcohol and illicit drug use. The Group includes Associate Health Minister, Jim Anderton; Justice Minister, Phil Goff; Education Associate Minister Lianne Dalziel; Police Minister George Hawkins; Youth Affairs Minister, John Tamihere; Customs Minister Rick Barker; and Health Associate Minister Damien O’Connor.
