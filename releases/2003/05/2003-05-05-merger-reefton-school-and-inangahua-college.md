Education Minister Trevor Mallard has announced the merger of Reefton School and Inangahua College on the West Coast, to take effect from January 2004.

A projected decline in rolls and financial pressures on both sets of Boards of Trustees triggered initial formal consultation on the future of the schools in late 2002.

“The aim during the review process is to ensure sustainable quality education for children in the Reefton area,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Although the process of re-organisation is tough on schools and their communities, this decision releases resources to re-invest in a new school and presents an opportunity for re-invigorating education in Reefton.”

“I am confident that the local community will welcome the new school as a key and vigorous part of their community.”

More than $850,000 will be available for the enhancement of property at the new school on the Inangahua site.

The Boards of Reefton School and Inangahua College will work together to prepare for the transition and the Reefton School Board will govern the merged school until new board elections can take place in early 2004.
