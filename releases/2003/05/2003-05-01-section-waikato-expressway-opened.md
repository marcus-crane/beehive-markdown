Transport Minister Paul Swain and Hamilton West MP Martin Gallagher welcomed the opening of a section of the Waikato Expressway, south of Rangiriri, today.

The $26 million project involved the four-laning of a 10-km stretch of road, separated by a grass median and wire barrier. The project has eliminated curves in the road where there have been a number of crashes. It is designed to tie in with future adjoining sections of the Expressway.

“This is a very significant step in the completion of the Waikato expressway,” said Mr Gallagher. “The expressway provides much needed relief for road users on the busy highway between Auckland and Hamilton. This section of highway has a high ratio of heavy vehicles. Overtaking opportunities are limited, and frustration is a major contributor to the serious and fatal crashes along this route. This will relieve some of that frustration, and reduce the crash rate.

“Once completed the Waikato expressway will improve safety and efficiency on this very important stretch of road. Waikato is one of New Zealand’s most economically important region’s and improving this road will have positive impact’s on not just the region’s but the whole country’s economy,” said Mr Gallagher

“This government is committed to developing and maintaining the national State Highway network,” said Mr Swain. “It is the backbone of the economic vitality of this region and the nation. Over the next 10 years Transit will spend $1.76 billion on the construction and maintenance of the state highway network.”
