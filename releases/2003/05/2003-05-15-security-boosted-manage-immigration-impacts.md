New Zealand's ability to manage immigration risks will be strengthened with a $19.82 million boost in Budget 2003, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

The funding, spread over four years, will be directed to:

- Strengthening the present immigration intelligence capability (data gathering and trend analysis and dissemination of information to assist decision making).
- Providing more resources for the investigation and prosecution of immigration fraud.
- Increasing the number of removals of failed refugee status claimants.
- Ensuring that any detention of asylum seekers, where identity is in doubt, is humane and effective.

$4.81 million operational spending is allocated in 2003-2004 and outyears, plus $580,000 in capital in 2003-04, to develop a secure intelligence data base.

"This increase in funding underlines the government's commitment to manage immigration risks and reduce potential adverse impacts.

"Enhancing intelligence gathering, fraud analysis, and the prosecution capabilities of the New Zealand Immigration Service (NZIS) are all aimed at reducing illegal activity within New Zealand and actively deterring people targeting New Zealand.

"The measures will also enable our compliance and border security agencies, and immigration authorities from other countries, to liaise and collaborate more effectively in large scale investigations," Lianne Dalziel said.
