Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today congratulated the New Zealand deer industry on its success in winning access for its sliced deer velvet into the South Korean market.

“It has taken many years of intensive effort and it is pleasing that Korea has finally opened the door to the New Zealand industry”.

Mr Sutton said, however, that obtaining registration for velvet processing plants was unlikely to be easy. The Government would continue to work with industry.

“We will continue to monitor this closely, and will push for Korea to recognise the validity of New Zealand inspection and approval systems. The principle of equivalence is important in international trade and I trust that Korea will acknowledge this with respect to sliced velvet.”

Mr Sutton thanked Deer Industry New Zealand for its professionalism in working with Government to achieve the market access for sliced deer velvet.
