Labour Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Paul Montgomery to a three-year term on the Employment Relations Authority in Christchurch, and the reapppointment of nine other Authority members in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

Denis Asher (Wellington), Philip Cheyne (Christchurch), Dzintra King (Auckland), Rosemary Monaghan (Auckland), Yvonne Oldfield (Auckland), Paul Stapp (Wellington), James Wilson (Auckland) and Gregory Wood (Wellington) have all been given further four-year terms. Aucklander Ralph Gardiner has been reappointed for an additional two years.

Margaret Wilson said the decision to reappoint came as a direct result of the satisfactory overall performance of the Employment Relations Authority in its first three years of operation.

“The Authority has worked well in helping parties to resolve employment relationship problems,” she said.
