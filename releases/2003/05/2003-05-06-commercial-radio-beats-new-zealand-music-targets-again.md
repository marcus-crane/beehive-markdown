News that commerical radio has again beaten local music targets augurs well for the growth of the New Zealand music industry, says Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

Statistics from the Radio Broadcasters Association show New Zealand music made up 15.36 percent of the commercial radio playlist in the first quarter of 2003. This is 2 percent ahead of the same quarter last year, and up from the 15 percent share achieved across the year. Broadcasters are working towards a 20 percent contemporary New Zealand music target by 2006 under a voluntary industry code.

Steve Maharey said domestic sales of recordings by local bands and musicans currently account for nearly 10 percent, or $11 million annually, of all sales – and this can only grow because of increased air play by commercial radio.

“Getting more Kiwi music played on radio stations across the country supports the careers of creative New Zealanders and showcases local talent. Locally-produced recordings have grown from 4 percent of the domestic market in 1998 to 9 percent last year.

“Domestic success is the essential first step to gaining a share of the multi-billion dollar international music industry.

"New Zealand music has had its strongest couple of years ever in terms of domestic sales and popularity and many New Zealand musicians are seizing the opportunity to showcase their music on the world stage.

"This year more than 30 New Zealand bands and musicians are on the road gaining exposure for New Zealand music on the international market. This includes composers, vocalists and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, which shows that our musical prowess is across all genres.

"Through NZ On Air's Phase Four scheme, NZ Music Industry Commission, Trade NZ and Industry NZ, we are helping to ensure our music industry is able to make the most of these offshore opportunities.

"Back home, government support through NZ On Air and the NZ Music Industry Commission helps to develop new talent and get them to the stage where they are recording their music for broadcast and sale. This is important because the statistics also confirm that local music is now an established component in commercial radio playlists across the country,” Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey also acknowledged the support of Radio New Zealand, the b.net radio network, Iwi and other community radio stations, which broadcast traditionally high levels of New Zealand music.
