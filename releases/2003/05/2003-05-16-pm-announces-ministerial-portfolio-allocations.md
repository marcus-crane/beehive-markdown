Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced new portfolio allocations for ministers. The opportunity for the reallocations came about as a result of the resignation from the Cabinet of the Hon Mark Gosche.

New portfolio allocations are:

·Hon Steve Maharey becomes Minister of Housing  
·Hon Phil Goff becomes Minister of Pacific Island Affairs  
·Hon Margaret Wilson relinquishes the Courts portfolio but retains an associate role to see through certain projects  
·Hon Paul Swain becomes Minister of Corrections  
·Hon Ruth Dyson takes responsibility for the Children, Young Persons and their Families Service  
·Hon John Tamihere becomes Minister for Small Business  
·Hon Rick Barker retains the Customs portfolio and his associate portfolios, and takes on Courts  
·Damien O’Connor becomes Minister of Racing

New ministers outside the Cabinet are:

·Taito Phillip Field, who becomes Associate Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, and also an associate minister in the area of justice and social development in which he has served as an under-secretary  
·David Cunliffe, who becomes Associate Finance, Associate Revenue, Associate Communications and Information Technology

Winnie Laban becomes Parliamentary Private Secretary to Marian Hobbs, Minister for the Environment and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade (ODA); and to Hon Jim Sutton in his trade-related responsibilities.

Helen Clark said that the Treaty settlements process had gathered considerable momentum, and that Margaret Wilson wished to increase the amount of time she could give to Treaty negotiations. Relinquishing the Courts portfolio enabled her to do that.

The two new ministers will be appointed by the Governor-General at a ceremony at Government House in Wellington on Monday at 2 pm.
