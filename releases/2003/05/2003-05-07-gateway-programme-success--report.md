The government’s pilot Gateway programme which allows senior secondary students to incorporate workplace learning with their school-based studies has been a great success according to an report released today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The Tertiary Education Commission’s Evaluation of the Gateway Pilot found high levels of support and real benefits for the three main participant groups – employers, students, and schools – flowing from their participation in Gateway. More than 1,000 students in 24 schools, and over 200 employers participated in the pilot programme during 2001 and 2002. The Government provided $3.8 million for the pilot programme, which now involves 62 schools.

Steve Maharey said he is confident that Gateway is now ready to be significantly expanded to a much larger group of secondary schools.

“Gateway provides opportunities for senior school students to participate in learning towards national qualifications in real workplaces, and have that learning integrated with their wider courses of study.

13.“Students worked in 50 industries, covering such diverse areas as information technology, boat building, early childhood, and hospitality. The six most popular industries for placements were hospitality, automotive, retail, tourism, engineering, and building.

16.“Schools built on the results from the first year of the pilot and achieved a 60% increase in units and achievements standards in the second year, leading to national qualifications. Demand for the programme from students and parents demonstrates that the profile and reputation of Gateway has grown rapidly.

17.“Following participation in Gateway in 2002, 261 students gained employment and 757 went on to further training opportunities. Eighty-six students were subsequently offered apprenticeship training.

“University and polytechnic-based learning will not be appropriate for all young people. Gateway is one of several new programmes the government is introducing to build up a range of bridges from school to work,” Steve Maharey said.
