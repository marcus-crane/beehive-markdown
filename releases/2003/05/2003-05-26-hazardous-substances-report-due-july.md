The findings from the Inquiry into the Management of Certain Hazardous Substances in Workplaces will now be presented to Labour Minister Margaret Wilson on 4 July, rather than 31 May.

The time extention was requested to allow for further examination of issues raised in submissions and hearings.

The inquiry was prompted by reports of adverse health consequences experienced by persons known to have worked with, and been exposed to the effects of, certain organic compounds, primarily in the health sector, the printing industry, and the manufacturing sector.

Those compounds are the chemicals glutaraldehyde, other aldehydes and solvents.
