An international innovative joint venture research facility is to receive $500,000 from the Government to build international networks, expand their research partners and develop patents for computer technology, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

The HIT (Human Interface Technology) Lab, a joint venture between the University of Washington (Seattle), and the University of Canterbury, is involved in world leading work in virtual reality and the ways in which people interact with computers. It will receive the funds in four instalments tied to the HIT Lab bringing new companies into the consortium, securing patents and signing research contracts. The funding is to come from Industry New Zealand’s, Strategic Investment Fund.

“The funding is to ensure the HIT Lab creates job opportunities and spin-off business possibilities as quickly as possible.

“This ICT Information Communication Technology project is the type of innovative development this Labour Progressive Government is keen to support as part of encouraging innovation.

“Computers and computer technology are increasingly important to our economy and any headstarts we have in these areas will be vital for our future.

“New Zealanders have always been leaders in making innovative technological advances.

“This HIT lab is pioneering new and exciting ways of using virtual reality to help us make the most of the growing power of computer technology.
