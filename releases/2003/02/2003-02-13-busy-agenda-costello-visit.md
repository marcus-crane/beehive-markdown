The future direction of CER will be high on the agenda when Australian Treasurer Peter Costello visits New Zealand next week as the guest of Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

“I am delighted to host Peter to New Zealand on the 20th anniversary of CER and to have this opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest across our two economies.

“We have met several times at international fora around the world and have developed a personal rapport but this is his first official visit to New Zealand,” Dr Cullen said.

Mr Costello will spend Wednesday morning in talks with Dr Cullen, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and officials. Discussion topics will include: triangular tax, progress on the coordination of business law between the two countries and how to progress the CER relationship.

Dr Cullen will host a Ministerial lunch in the Members Only Dining Room for Mr Costello and the Australian delegation. Other guests will include Lianne Dalziel, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton, Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain, Finance and Expenditure Select Committee Chair, Clayton Cosgrove and senior public servants.

Mr Costello will attend question time in Parliament after which he will meet with Opposition Leader Bill English and Opposition finance spokesperson Don Brash before holding a joint press conference in the Beehive Theatrette at 4pm with Dr Cullen.

Mr Costello’s party and Dr Cullen will then fly to Auckland where they will attend a business breakfast on Thursday morning hosted jointly by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and the Trans-Tasman Business Circle.

Mr Costello will meet with Prime Minister Helen Clark before - weather permitting – getting a first hand look at the Americas’ Cup campaign in the company of a group of New Zealand business people. He will then depart for Australia.
