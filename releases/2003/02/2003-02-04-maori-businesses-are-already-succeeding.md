News that Maori producers earn $650 million per annum from exports is no surprise to Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“Up and down New Zealand Maori entrepreneurs and businesses are already making a real difference.

“This Labour Progressive Government is committed to working with Maori in partnership in regional and industry planning, as well as in training and education to ensure that we can improve Maori economic development outcomes,” said Jim Anderton today welcoming the Maori Economic Development report from Te Puni Kokiri and the Ministry of Economic Development.

The report notes that the future success of the economy depends on encouraging Maori entrepreneurs and improving education and skills for Maori.

“The New Zealand economy can’t perform to its full potential unless Maori Economic Development is successful. Maori make up 15 per cent of the population.

“This issue clearly contrasts with the approach of opposition parties. While we in the Labour Progressive Government are busy working with Maori to improve economic outcomes by creating jobs and businesses, they are focused on peripheral issues such as getting rid of Maori electorates,” said Jim Anderton.
