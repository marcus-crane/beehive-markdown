Statistics show that New Zealanders are continuing to return home from overseas in increasing numbers while significantly fewer are leaving, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

"Statistics released today by Statistics New Zealand show that 25 percent fewer New Zealanders left the country last year than in 2001, while the numbers of Kiwis returning increased by eight percent.

"The figures for December confirm a trend that has been consistent now for several months, and the combined effect is that the nett loss of New Zealanders last year was less than half that of 2001," Lianne Dalziel said.

"There was a 20 percent net increase in the number of non-New Zealanders arriving here last year, but that figure has not been disaggregated and is not made up solely of people arriving with residence visas.

"It counts everyone entering the country for 12 months or more, and therefore includes the many thousands of overseas students and people coming here on a work permit for 12 months or more.

"New Zealand Immigration Programme residence approvals have not altered, and remain at 45,000 (+/- 5000) for the 2002/03 year," Lianne Dalziel said.
