The New Zealand Government this week listed the following groups and individuals as terrorist entities pursuant to the provisions of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002:

·Mohamad Izbal ABDURRAHMAN  
·Nurjaman Riduan ISAMUDDIN (aka HAMBALI)  
·Benevolence International Foundation  
·Global Relief Fund  
·Nabil SAYADI  
·Patricia VINCK

These designations follow a decision by the United Nations Security Council to list these groups and individuals as terrorist entities. They take effect immediately for a period of three years, unless extended.

The decision to proceed with these designations was taken by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Attorney General, pursuant to the Terrorism Suppression Act.

ABDURRAHMAN and ISAMUDDIN, who is commonly known as HAMBALI, are both members of Jemaah Islamiyah which has already been identified by the United Nations as a terrorist group, and was designated as such in New Zealand in late 2002.

They were identified by the United Nations as terrorists based on information drawn from a number of sources including Jemaah Islamiyah detainees, confidential reports and media sources. This information also links both individuals, and HAMBALI in particular, to the terrorist group Al Qaeda.

The Global Relief Foundation, and the Benevolence International Foundation are fundraising entities for organisations, including Al Qaeda, that are engaged in terrorist activity. SAYADI and VINCK are known members of the Global Relief Foundation’s European network.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said none of the designated groups or individuals is known to have any current links to New Zealand.

“Nevertheless, designating these individuals and groups as terrorists and terrorist entities will serve to deter New Zealanders from becoming inadvertently involved in their activities,” Helen Clark said.

“It will also make it an offence to participate in both the Benevolence International Foundation and the Global Relief Fund, recruit members to these groups, provide or collect funds for them or make property or financial services available to them.

“The financing of international terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole and one that New Zealand, as a member of that community, recognises the need to effectively address. These designations assist in that process,” Helen Clark said.
