Canterbury’s significant drop in unemployment from 5.6 per cent to 4.2 per cent shows the strength of Canterbury industries and businesses says Economic Development Minister and Progressive Leader Jim Anderton.

“I am pleased to see the region I represent doing so well. It has been 15 years since unemployment was so low and each new job and the opportunity it presents is a life changing opportunity for someone.

“Canterbury’s strong growth in employment shows that businesses in the region are making the most of New Zealand’s strong economic performance and ensuring they get maximum benefit.

“New Zealand is well on its way to being the Pacific Economic Tiger with growth in jobs, flourishing of new ideas and innovative businesses and regions.

“The Progressive Party is committed to full employment and as a first step ensuring all school leavers under 20 years old are in employment, training or further education. We are also committed to increasing the numbers of modern apprenticeships from 3,000 to 6,000 and increasing the numbers in skills training from 68,000 to 100,000 in this term of office,” said Jim Anderton.
