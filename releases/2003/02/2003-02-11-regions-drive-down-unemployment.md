Booming regions and economic optimism are behind the continuing low unemployment rate says Economic Development Minister and Progressive Leader Jim Anderton.

“Up and down New Zealand there are skills shortages and new jobs being created every day and this helps explain why we now have the lowest unemployment rate in 15 years, against a backdrop of a world-wide economic slowdown.

“New Zealand is well on its way to being the Pacific Economic Tiger with growth in jobs, flourishing of new ideas and innovative businesses and regions.

“The Progressive Party is committed to full employment and as a first step ensuring all school leavers under 20 years old are in employment, training or further education. We are also committed to increasing the numbers of modern apprenticeships from 3,000 to 6,000 and increasing the numbers in skills training from 68,000 to 100,000 in this term of office.

“The Labour Progressive Government is working to ensure that the current growth is sustainable and can continue for years into the future. This is just the beginning of an economic upturn that can make New Zealand one of the best performing countries in the OECD,” said Jim Anderton.
