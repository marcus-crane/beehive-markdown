Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the approval of $638,000 for a combined technology facility for Opunake Primary and Opunake High Schools in coastal Taranaki, to be located on the site of the high school.

“I’m pleased to be able to announce this significant amount of extra funding for Opunake schools. There’s been consultation with the local community over the need to modernise the technology facilities and it’s clear that a state-of-the-art combined technology centre for both schools is the preference,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The proposed new multi-purpose facility will substantially enhance technology education for the students in the Opunake district. It also means continuity of programmes for students moving between primary and secondary schools. “

Technology is currently provided for primary pupils at the Opunake Technology Centre and for secondary pupils at the High School. Both these facilities are in need of upgrading and modernising, Trevor Mallard said.

“As a result of this injection of funds, I hope the planning for this new technology block can now get underway as soon as possible,” Trevor Mallard said.
