Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today he was appointing David Salter to the Otago Polytechnic Council.

The Polytechnic Council, which is composed of community, industry, staff, student and Ministerial representatives and appointments, has the responsibility under the Education Act for the governance of the polytechnic and the appointment and monitoring of its chief executive officer.

Steve Maharey said the appointment is amongst a series being made to tertiary councils across the country to ensure that they have the appropriate blend of skills and expertise they need to govern their institutions effectively.

“David Salter will replace Shirley Jones on the Council as she has recently come to the end of her term as Council Chair. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Shirley for her service on the Council.

“David Salter is a solicitor in Oamaru. He has previous educational governance experience through his chairmanship of Waitaki Girls High School Board of Trustees from 1995 to 2001. He is also a trustee of the Waitaki Community Recreation Centre Trust and serves on the Oamaru Care and Protection Resource Panel,” Steve Maharey said.
