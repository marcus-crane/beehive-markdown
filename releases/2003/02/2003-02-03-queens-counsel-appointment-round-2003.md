Attorney-General Margaret Wilson, together with the Chief Justice Sian Elias, today announced a new appointment round for Queen’s Counsel will take place this year.

Changes to the appointment process for Queen’s Counsel have been included in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Bill which is due to be introduced in Parliament this year. In the meantime, the appointments for this round will be made on the same basis as last year. Margaret Wilson will again convene an advisory panel made up of the Solicitor-General and representatives of the New Zealand Law Society and Bar Association to help her, in consultation with the Chief Justice, in the selection process.

Applications for appointment as Queen’s Counsel should be sent to the Solicitor-General no later than 28 February 2003 in accordance with the Practice note, dated 12 August 1991 (published in “LawTalk”, 2 September 1991).
