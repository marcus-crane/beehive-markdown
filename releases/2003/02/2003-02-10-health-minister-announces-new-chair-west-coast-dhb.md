Health Minister Annette King today announced the appointment of Professor Gregor Coster as a member and Chair of the West Coast District Health Board.

Professor Coster is Head of the Department of General Practice and Primary Health Care in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences of the University of Auckland.

Ms King says Professor Coster has extensive experience in the health sector both as a clinician, educator and researcher, and has published extensively in his field of expertise.

“Before making the appointment I consulted the local MP Damien O’Connor, who sees the immediate need for the West Coast is to establish affordable primary health care. Professor Coster is ideally placed to ensure this happens.”

Professor Coster has extensive governance experience, holding numerous directorships on both public and private organisations. He was a director of the Health Funding Authority, a member of the transitional board of Counties Manukau District Health Board, and currently serves on the board of PHARMAC.

“I want to acknowledge and thank Dr Christine Robertson for her excellent job as Acting Chair over the past two months following the departure of Mr Rick Bettle,” said Ms King.
