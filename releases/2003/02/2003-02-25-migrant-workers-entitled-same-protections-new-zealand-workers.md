Lianne Dalziel was commenting on a weekend report that three Ukranians have walked off Ashburton district farms, claiming exploitation.

“It is important to remember that these are only allegations at this stage. The parties involved are entitled to have the opportunity to be heard by the appropriate authorities. However, this does serve as a useful opportunity to reinforce the fact that NZ employment and Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) laws apply to everyone who works in New Zealand, be they permanent or temporary residents,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“I am extremely disappointed in NZ First MP, Ron Mark, who has obviously known about these concerns for several days, if not weeks, and has done nothing to alert the appropriate authorities. It is impossible to investigate allegations without knowing who is involved and the nature of the allegations,” said Lianne Dalziel.

Lianne Dalziel said that the allegations, which still have not been referred to any of the authorities concerned, appear not to centre on immigration matters, but rather alleged breaches of NZ employment and OSH laws.

“The NZ Immigration Service (NZIS) has not approved any scheme as alleged in the Sunday-Star Times. My advice is that the NZIS was approached by a private sector employment agency, Mid Canterbury Employment Service, on behalf of Ashburton farmers, who were having difficulty employing dairy farm workers. The request for an ‘approval-in-principle’ was referred to the Department of Work & Income, which confirmed the labour market shortage in the Ashburton district.

On that basis, NZIS met with Mid Canterbury Employment Service, which was representing the farmers and another recruitment agent, who was liasing with an Agriculture Students Union in the Ukraine to recruit the employees. NZIS advised them that the approvals-in-principle would only be issued to named farmers, who were to be the employers. No agreement was entered into between NZIS and the two recruitment agencies,” Lianne Dalziel said.

‘Approvals-in-principle were issued to individual farmers in the Ashburton area. It is they who are responsible for the salary and conditions of employment, (currently minimum $25,000 per annum plus free accommodation), for meeting other employment law and occupational safety and health requirements, and for guaranteeing the cost of repatriation to the Ukraine if the worker fails to meet that.

“That being said, I have instructed NZIS to suspend the approvals-in-principle that have been granted to these Ashburton dairy farmers in order to ensure no more migrant dairy farm workers are employed while the allegations are investigated by the Employment Relations Services and OSH. This does not affect anyone currently employed under a valid work permit, but means that no further work permits will be issued in accordance with these particular approvals-in-principle for dairy farm workers in the Ashburton district,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel confirmed that NZIS has referred the matter to the Employment Relations Service, and would be looking for confirmation of compliance with New Zealand’s employment and OSH laws before any further permits were granted under these approvals-in-principle.

Lianne Dalziel said that the allegations raised concerns about the role of recruitment agents, but at the end of the day it was the employers who were responsible for ensuring that the law was complied with, and they could not contract out of that responsibility.
