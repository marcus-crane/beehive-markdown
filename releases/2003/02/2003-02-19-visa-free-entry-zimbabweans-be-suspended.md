Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel has announced that the visitor’s visa waiver for Zimbabwe nationals would be suspended for 12 months as of 21 February 2003.

“This means that from Friday, all Zimbabwean nationals intending to visit New Zealand will need to obtain a visa in order to travel here,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel said that the move was not likely to have a significant impact as Zimbabwean nationals transiting Australia to New Zealand have often had to obtain a New Zealand visa since Australia tightened up its transit visa requirements last year.

“Zimbabwean nationals would continue to be eligible for temporary entry or residence under standard policies. “ Lianne Dalziel said.

Lianne Dalziel also announced further special provisions for Zimbabwe nationals in New Zealand, as of Friday, on a temporary permit. Due to the situation in Zimbabwe last year, work permit requirements were relaxed for Zimbabwean nationals who were in New Zealand as at 30 April 2002, who did not want to return to Zimbabwe and who had a job offer in New Zealand.

Today’s announcement means all Zimbabweans in New Zealand on temporary permits will now be able to apply for a 12-month open work permit, regardless of whether or not they have a specific job offer.

Lianne Dalziel said today’s announcement brought New Zealand into line with Canada, the US, Britain and Ireland which no longer provide visa-free entry for Zimbabweans.
