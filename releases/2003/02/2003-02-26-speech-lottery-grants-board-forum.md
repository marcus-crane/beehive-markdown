First of all, I would like to welcome you to this Funding Forum, and say how pleased I am to see you here.

I note this forum is entitled “Investing for the future”, and has as its core three objectives.

Namely:

The taking on board that community funding organisations now operate in a changed environment.

It’s now necessary to identify not just what these changes are, but what they mean to you as members of community funding organisations.

The second objective is to identify areas where you all may co-operate, always with the overall aim of better engaging with providers.

The final objective is to begin planning strategies to put in place greater co-operation between yourselves, for this end.

These seem to me to be challenging objectives.

Perhaps the reason for them needs to be restated.

Meeting these objectives would result in stronger communities.

And this is a Government that puts a high priority on strengthening communities.

You, as community grant makers, are obviously key players in this.

I commend the creation of this Forum therefore, for the simple reason that it’s a chance to work towards strengthening New Zealand’s community, - of which we are all part.

It’s perhaps a chance to look at the wider picture that we may have been operating under, and of finding ways of co-operating to benefit all parties.

I am aware ofcourse, there are difficulties involved around these objectives.

It needs to be said that working towards greater co-operation may mean all involved examining if any issues of self interest exist within their sphere, and if so, whether this is desirable.

I think all of us in this room realise, and certainly as Chairperson of the Lottery Grants Board this applies to myself as well, that the Lottery Grants Board is facing decreasing income.

Not surprisingly, that correspondingly means the Board faces cash flow difficulties.

With less money coming in, the Board knows it’s time to take stock. We need to find ways to revitalise the way things are done.

This Forum has arisen from the Board’s need to face up to a changed environment.

Back in December 2001, the government Statement of Intent for Improved Community-Government Relationships was made.

This Statement included the need to streamline government funding arrangements for community organisations, following that sector saying it found government processes too complex.

Their view was much of their time went on dealing with applications and accountability reports, with the result they had less time for the “real work” of helping people.

Fair enough.

It’s a reminder that while grant makers could stand to benefit from working co-operatively, the real focus should be applicants.

Community organisations will benefit if things are streamlined to the point that they readily know which organisation or organisations they should target applications for funding.

And it should be a straightforward exercise.

I suspect a number of organisations are frustrated, if not defeated, by some of the hoops they’re required to jump through to access funding –and disheartened by associated compliance costs.

This is the first time a Forum like this has been held.

Some present may be suspicious of the reasons setting up of such a Forum, or suspect hidden agendas.

I want to make it clear that as far as the Board is concerned no hidden agendas lie behind the formation of this Forum

The aim is to find ways to improve funding services for applicants, to better serve the community.

This Forum sits within the context of the Board looking at its resources and finding ways to best utilise what’s there to assist the community.

Internal adjustments are one side of the coin, to use a phrase appropriate to all assembled here.  
For its part, the Board has also taken upon itself the need to look outwards, to talk to other funders, big and small, to find common ground and ways to co-operate to benefit everyone.

The speakers and the information package together will cover related subjects, including community plans in the recently amended Local Government Act.

Outlines on the Community Development Group’s work on sustainable communities will also be available.

The hope I have for any direction you may take today, is that it is a forward direction, taken in the interests of the community.

I hope the day goes well. Thank you.
