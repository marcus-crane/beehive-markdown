Health Minister Annette King says 183 nurses will develop their primary health care knowledge through a $850,000 Government postgraduate scholarship fund.

Ms King said the Ministry of Health scholarships, part of an $8.1 million package to support and encourage primary health care nursing, are a significant reward for New Zealand's largest health workforce.

"This is one of the biggest separate investments Government has made into New Zealand nurses' education, since the 1980s,” said Ms King. ”More than 7500 registered nurses work in primary health care, and it is important we invest in their central role, and encourages nurses to build knowledge and expertise.”

Ms King said that later this month, she would also announce the distribution of $7 million for innovative primary health care nursing concepts proposed by nurses and health providers. The total of $8.1 million is part of a $400 million package to implement the Primary Health Care Strategy over the next three years.

"Most nurses work for private providers and may have difficulty accessing ongoing and subsidised education. By helping nurses develop their skills, we want to encourage workforce support and retention, more nurse practitioners, and registered nurses working in primary health care."

Ms King said the scholarships had been awarded throughout New Zealand, with 20 percent from rural areas. Topics to be studied included child health, aged care, managing people with diabetes and working with people who have dementia.

Ms King said she is pleased that educational institutes are recognising the importance of primary health care programmes.

"More are tailoring their courses to incorporate primary health care education in health promotion, advanced assessment, best practice guidelines, age populations such as adolescent, adult, aged care and mental health care."
