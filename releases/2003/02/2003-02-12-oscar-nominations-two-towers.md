“The announcement of six Oscar nominations for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is once again a great achievement for Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Richard Taylor, Weta, New Line and the cast and crew of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy,” said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has been nominated for the best motion picture award in the 75th Annual Academy Awards, alongside Chicago, Gangs of New York, The Hours, and The Pianist. It has also been nominated for Visual Effects, Art Direction, Sound, Sound editing and Film editing.

“Last year The Fellowship of the Ring picked up four Academy Awards for Make-up, Visual effects, Cinematography and Musical score. This was a huge reward for the enormous effort that has gone into this film trilogy, and an important acknowledgement of the creative and technical expertise involved in the films.

“This year’s nominations are further evidence that we are up there with the world when it comes to film-making,” said Judith Tizard.

The Two Towers also received nine nominations in the upcoming BAFTA awards for Film, Director, Cinematography, Production design, Costume design, Editing, Sound, Special visual effects and Makeup/hair, as well as the Orange Film of the Year prize which is voted by moviegoers.

The BAFTAs will be awarded on Monday 24 February (NZT) in London and the 75th Annual Academy Awards take place in Los Angeles on Monday 24 March (NZT).
