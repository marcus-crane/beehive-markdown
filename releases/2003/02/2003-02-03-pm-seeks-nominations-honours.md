Prime Minister Helen Clark today invited New Zealanders to make nominations for consideration for inclusion in the honours lists.

“The cornerstone of the New Zealand honours system is that anyone can nominate someone for an honour. Ours is now a distinctly New Zealand system, designed to recognise the achievements and dedicated service of people from all walks of life.

“Over recent years the number of nominations from which selections are made has increased. I want to continue to encourage members of the public to continue to come forward with nominations of those whose work in the community they feel deserves recognition. I would like the nominations we receive and the honours awarded to reflect and recognise the wide range of contributions made to our community.

“In late March the government will be looking at the nominations received for inclusion in the Queen’s Birthday Honours 2003. All nominations received by the end of February will be able to be considered, ” Helen Clark said.

Nomination forms are available from Members of Parliament and Electorate Offices and from the Honours Secretariat, Cabinet Office, Parliament Buildings, Wellington.

The form and information on the New Zealand Royal Honours System may be found on www.dpmc.govt.nz under “Honours Secretariat”.

Note: The printed nomination forms and website all refer to the closing date as 1 February. In this instance however that date has been extended to 28 February.
