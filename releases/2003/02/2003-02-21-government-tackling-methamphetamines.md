The Labour Progressive Government is cracking down on methamphetamime and other drugs.

Jim Anderton says the Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs has a list of 30 items they are considering in order to address drug and alcohol abuse.

The Cabinet has already approved the reclassification of methamphetamine to class A from class B as well as classifying four similar drugs.

Jim Anderton said proposed moves will allow stronger penalties for those caught making or possessing these drugs.

“We are committed to greater powers for the Police when they suspect methamphetamine is being manufactured, sold or used,” Jim Anderton said.

The Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs is responsible for the Government’s campaign to minimize harm caused by alcohol and illicit drug use. The plan will focus on reducing demand, controlling supply and limiting problems associated with alcohol and drug use. The Group includes Associate Health Minister, Jim Anderton; Justice Minister, Phil Goff; Education Associate Minister, Lianne Dalziel; Police Minister, George Hawkins; Youth Affairs Minister, John Tamihere; Customs Minister Rick Barker; and Health Associate Minister Damien O’Connor.
