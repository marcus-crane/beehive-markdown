A research project to improve Pacific women’s economic well-being has been awarded $180,000 in government funding over the next two years, Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.

Ms Dyson said the primary aim of the research was to enable Pacific women to improve their economic position and that of their families; and develop policies that improve their labour market outcomes.

“In spite of some outstanding successes, Pacific women face more difficulties than other groups getting paid employment. We need to know whether those difficulties are related to their family commitments, educational opportunities, the way the labour market operates – or a combination of these and other factors.”

The research is being led by the Women’s Affairs and will involve a number of other ministries - Pacific Island Affairs, Economic Development, Social Development, Youth Affairs and Education.

“This project is a great example of government departments working together to get a shared understanding of the issues facing Pacific women, and agreement about the solutions. Pacific women will be involved at all stages of the research, both as researchers and on the project steering group,” Ruth Dyson said.

Funding for the research will come from Vote: Research, Science and Technology over two years - $90,000 in 2003/2004 and $90,000 in 2004/2005.
