Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that New Zealand will host the 34th Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland from 12 to 19 August.

More than 400 delegates, including the 16 Forum Island leaders, ministers, observers, officials, and media are expected to participate in the Forum.

“Auckland has been chosen because of its strong Pacific island connections and identity. The city also offers a good range of facilities for the leaders’ meeting and retreat, and for the 12-partner country Post Forum Dialogue,” Helen Clark said.

“This will be the third Forum New Zealand has hosted and the first for more than twenty years. The inaugural Forum meeting was held in Wellington 32 years ago, and we hosted our second Forum meeting in Rotorua in 1982.

“The Forum provides an important annual opportunity for Pacific Islands leaders to discuss the political, economic and developmental issues facing the region in a time of rapid change, globalisation and increasing instability,” Helen Clark said.

She will take over as chair of the Pacific Islands Forum from Fiji at the meeting and retain that position until next year’s Forum.
