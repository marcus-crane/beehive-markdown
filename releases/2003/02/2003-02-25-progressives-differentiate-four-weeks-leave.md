The Progressive MPs will move an amendment to the newly introduced Holidays Bill seeking an entitlement of four weeks leave for all workers.

The Bill, which repeals and is to replace the Holidays Act 1981, was introduced to the House today.

The differentiation has been agreed by the Coalition partners; Labour and the Progressives, according to provisions in the Coalition Agreement and the Cabinet Manual.

“Many employees already have four weeks leave and I believe everyone should get this entitlement as it will help New Zealanders to better balance work and family commitments,” said Jim Anderton.

“If passed, this amendment would match New Zealanders’ leave entitlements to that of workers in many other countries around the world. United Kingdom and Italian workers receive four weeks minimum paid annual leave, while workers in France, Austria, Germany, Spain and Sweden have 5 to 6 weeks paid annual leave entitlement each year.

“We look forward to working with employers, unions and community agencies in support of a campaign for four weeks leave,” said Jim Anderton.

The issue of four weeks annual leave is the first time in this term of Government that the Progressives have signalled they will differentiate from their Labour coalition partner.

Differentiation

The parties in Government have ‘agreed to disagree’ on this issue.

Clause 3.23 of the Cabinet Manual allows for such differentiation.

This policy  
The issue of four weeks leave entitlement, which the Progressives believe is a critical health and safety as well as human rights issue, will continue to be promoted by the Progressives to the community ahead of the 2005 elections.

Supporting Labour while differentiating  
The Progressives believe the overwhelming evidence of the past three years is that working cooperatively within a coalition led by Labour is the most advantageous and productive role for them to play in terms of advancing progressives policies for New Zealand.

There are only two alternative options available to the Progressive Party in terms of our relationship with a Labour-led government.

Either we are a junior partner inside of a coalition government or we stand outside of a Labour-led government as a Supporting Party offering support on confidence and supply.

The latter option makes a lot of sense for a small centrist party, but little for a small center-left one.

All the evidence of the past three years suggests that the Progressives are getting a lot more of their vision and programme advanced by being inside a coalition government.
