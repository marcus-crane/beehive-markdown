Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the Hon Mark Gosche was taking three months leave of absence from his portfolios and that acting ministers for that period have been appointed.

“Since May last year Mr Gosche has managed both demanding portfolios and a very difficult and distressing family situation.

“This leave of absence from his portfolios enables him to focus on his immediate family needs at this time.

“The acting ministers will be: the Hon Steve Maharey, Acting Minister of Housing; Hon Annette King, Acting Minister of Racing; Hon Margaret Wilson, Acting Minister of Corrections; Hon Chris Carter, Acting Minister of Pacific Island Affairs,” Helen Clark said.
