ACC Minister Ruth Dyson and Statistics Minister John Tamihere today announced the appointment of four members and an interim chairperson to a new panel providing independent advice to the government on injury-related information.

The members of the Injury Surveillance Ministerial Advisory Panel, appointed for up to three years, are Molly Pardoe, Paul Cressey, Professor John Langley and Dr Grant Duncan. The interim chairperson, who has been appointed for 12 months, is Hon Stan Rodger, former chair of the Data Warehouse Advisory Panel.

Ms Dyson said the panel would provide independent advice about the Department of Statistics’ new role as manager of all injury-related information held by the government.

“In the past, injury-related information has been collected in a fragmented way by a number of government agencies. The Department of Statistics is now the overall manager of this information. It will set standards, collect and publish information, provide data to researchers and review information requirements.

“This coordinated approach will lead to better understanding of the causes and effects of injuries. In turn, this will help us develop more effective policies and programmes for injury prevention and rehabilitation.”

Ruth Dyson said the panel members had a wide range of expertise in injury surveillance and injury information management.

“As users and providers of injury information, the panel members bring a strong mix of expertise at a strategic, operational and technical level. They will provide useful advice to the government from a stakeholder perspective.”

The panel, which has been set up under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, will also have four government representatives, one each from ACC, the Department of Labour, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Transport.
