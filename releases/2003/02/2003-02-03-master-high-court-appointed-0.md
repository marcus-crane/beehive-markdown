Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Anthony (Tony) Peter Christiansen as a Master of the High Court.

Master Christiansen graduated from Wellington’s Victoria University and practiced initially in Napier and then Taupo.

In 1990 he moved to Auckland, and in 1992 joined the Crown Solicitor’s firm, Meredith Connell & Co, becoming a partner in 1995.

That same year he was appointed to the District Court bench and in 1998 took on the role of Executive Judge for the Napier and Central Region.

Master Christiansen has been with the Legal Services Agency, Wellington since 2001 leading work on legal policy development.

The new Master will sit in Christchurch where he will deal with pre trial, company and insolvency matters.
