In September 2002, the Ministry for the Environment circulated a public discussion paper Improving the operation of the HSNO Act for new organisms.

That paper outlined proposals and options for amending the HSNO legislation in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, to bring zoo and circus animals under the HSNO regime and to improve the way the Act operates for new organisms as a result of experience in this area since 1998.

Public comment was called for and by the closing date of 15 November 2002 the Ministry for the Environment had received 1011 written submissions. Many submissions came from private individuals but there were also a number from groups and organisations. These included universities and the science and research community, the medicines and veterinary medicines sector, agribusiness and forestry groups, organics producers, local authorities, the environmental movement, religious and ethics-related groups and groups from within the Maori community.

A detailed summary of submissions has been prepared and is available on the Ministry for the Environment’s website at:  
http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/organisms/discussion-paper-submissions-feb03/

Copies of the Summary of Submissions are also being sent to every submitter who gave a postal address.

Further copies of the Summary of Submissions can be obtained from:
