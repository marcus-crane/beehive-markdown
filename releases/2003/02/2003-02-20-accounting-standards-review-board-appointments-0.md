Minister of Commerce Lianne Dalziel today announced the appointment of a Chair, Deputy Chair and two new members to the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB).

The new chair will be former Financial Reporting Standards Board chair Liz Hickey, while ASRB member John Spencer takes over as Deputy Chair. Ken Warren and Garry Downs are the new members, with Mr Downs becoming the body's lawyer. The changes take effect from February 17, with the exception of Mr Warren, who joined the ASRB in November last year.

“The ASRB is entering an interesting and challenging period of its history, with the adoption of international accounting standards changing the emphasis for New Zealand bodies from setting standards to influencing international standards. The ASRB has a key role to play in this and in managing the transition period,” Lianne Dalziel said.
