Twelve of the 75 constables who graduated yesterday from the Royal New Zealand Police College are headed for the Wellington police district.

Police Minister George Hawkins said the 12 new Constables included B T Cornelius, winner of the Wing’s Physical Education Trophy and Police Association Prize for Section Achievement winner, D G Himiona.

All would begin duties within the month.

Wellington police district includes Wellington and the Hutt, Porirua, Kapiti and the Wairarapa.

Yesterday’s graduates included 60 male officers and fifteen women. Of these 16 identified as Maori and eight as having Pacific Island heritage.

They now begin a two-year period of on the job training before becoming fully fledged constables with the opportunity to work in range of specialist police careers.
