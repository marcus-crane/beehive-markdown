“Congratulations to Peter Jackson and the cast and crew of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on winning two Bafta Awards and the audience award for best film in London earlier today,” Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said today.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers won awards for Best Costume Design, Best Special Visual Effects and the Orange Film of the Year, which is voted on by the public.

“I’m sure all New Zealanders join me in congratulating Ngila Dickson and Richard Taylor on their award for Best Costume Design, and Jim Rygiel, Joe Letteri, Randall William Cook and Alex Funke on their award for Best Special Visual Effects,” said Judith Tizard.

“The competition at this year’s Baftas was considerable, however The Two Towers picked up more awards than any other film, proving it a hit with the industry and the general public. This is fabulous news for Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Richard Taylor, Weta, New Line and the cast and crew of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.”

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has been nominated for the best motion picture award in the 75th Annual Academy Awards, which take place in Los Angeles on Monday 24 March (NZT). It has also been nominated for Visual Effects, Art Direction, Sound, Sound editing and Film editing.

“I wish The Lord of the Rings team the best of luck for the Academy Awards and congratulate them on their Bafta success,” said Judith Tizard.
