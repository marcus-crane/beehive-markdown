Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said he is delighted that Ngä Moteatea collected by Sir Apirana Ngata and Pei te Hurinui Jones are to be updated.

"Mäori society was traditionally an oral society in which our waiata provided the the explanations for all aspects of life, knowledge, philosophy and wisdom. Today Ngä Moteatea serves as a treasured window to our past so as to guide our future.

"Ngä Moteatea is a hugely significant collection that will always be valued and it is right and timely that new editions are to be produced for all four parts of the collection. The collection continues to be a source of pride for the Ngata whänau.

"I congratulate Creative New Zealand for the insight they have shown in contributing to this Polynesian Society project," Parekura Horomia said.
