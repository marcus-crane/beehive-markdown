A dramatic drop in the number of Aucklanders out of work in the three months to December 2002 is testament of the government’s commitment to driving down unemployment in New Zealand’s largest city, Tamaki Makaurau MP John Tamihere says.

Statistics New Zealand’s Household Labour Force Survey figures out today show the rate of unemployment in the Auckland region dropped 4900 in the final quarter of 2002, bringing the total unemployment rate to 4 percent. In the September quarter, unemployment was at 5 percent in Auckland. For the year ending December 2002, unemployment dropped more modestly from 4.6 percent.

John Tamihere, who is also Ministers of Statistics, said the government’s focus on speeding Auckland’s economy growth had resulted in many local initiatives to boost employment, and that was now being evidenced in the latest figures.

“Auckland has been a standout performer in terms of falling unemployment, and I believe innovative local initiatives can take much of the credit for that. We now have fewer than 25,000 Aucklanders out of work – less than at any time in the last two years.”

Mr Tamihere said schemes to assist migrants with professional qualifications to link up with employers and an emphasis on placing long-term unemployed or at-risk Pacific job seekers into permanent jobs were some of numerous examples of successful Auckland employment initiatives.

Nationally, the HLFS figures show that unemployment has dropped to 4.9 percent – the lowest since March 1988 – and that New Zealand is now ranked 9th on the OECD table of unemployment, ahead of the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.

“This is the 10th consecutive quarter that employment has increased nationally, and this government is commited to ensuring that the trend in employment growth continues,” John Tamihere said.
