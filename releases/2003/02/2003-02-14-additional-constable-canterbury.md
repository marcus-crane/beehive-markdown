Canterbury will gain an additional constable following yesterday’s graduation of Wing 208 from the Royal New Zealand Police College.

Prime Minister Helen Clark attended yesterday’s graduation ceremony of the Wing, along with wing patron Dick Hubbard.

Police Minister George Hawkins said Constable M J Donaldson would begin duties in the district within the month.

Yesterday’s graduates included 60 male officers and fifteen women. Of these 16 identified as Maori and eight as having Pacific Island heritage.

They now begin a two-year period of on the job training before becoming fully fledged constables with the opportunity to work in range of specialist police careers.
