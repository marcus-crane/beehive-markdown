Thirty-four of the 75 police graduating today from the Royal New Zealand Police College are headed for Auckland’s three police districts.

Prime Minister Helen Clark attended today’s graduation ceremony of Wing 208 at the College, along with wing patron Dick Hubbard.

Police Minister George Hawkins said Auckland City would gain 15 additional Constables, Counties Manukau 13 and North Shore Waitakere six following today’s graduation. All would begin duties within the month.

Mr Hawkin’s said it was especially gratifying that the winner of the Minister’s Prize for First in Wing, Constable M R Donaldson, would be posted to Counties Manukau.

Other prizewinners headed for Auckland included Constable A B Styles, winner of the Meltzer Prize for Weapons Training and the International Police Association prize for Driver Training. Constable Styles would also be placed in Counties Manukau.

The Commissioner’s Prize for second in wing was awarded to Constable N M Bryce. He would serve in Auckland City along with Patron’s prize winner Constable S J Walker, and Prater Memorial Trophy winner Constable D B Keogh.

Today’s 75 graduates included 60 male officers and fifteen women. Of these 16 identified as Maori and eight as having Pacific Island heritage.

They now begin a two-year period of on the job training before becoming fully fledged Constables with the opportunity to work in range of specialist police careers.
