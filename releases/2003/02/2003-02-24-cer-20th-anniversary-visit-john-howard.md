Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that Australian Prime Minister John Howard is to visit New Zealand on 8 to 10 March.

“The occasion of the visit is the annual bilateral meeting between the New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers,” Helen Clark said.

“This year’s meeting commemorates the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the CER treaty between Australia and New Zealand. It is also the sixtieth anniversary of the year in which both countries established High Commissions in each other’s capital cities.

“CER is regarded internationally as a model open trade agreement. Our discussions will look at ways of further extending and deepening our two countries’ economic co-operation.

“In addition to CER and bilateral issues, John Howard and I will also discuss regional and international affairs,” Helen Clark said.

The programme for Mr Howard will include weekend engagements in Auckland, including a function with business leaders.

On Monday 10 March Mr Howard will meet with the New Zealand Cabinet and attend a state luncheon.
