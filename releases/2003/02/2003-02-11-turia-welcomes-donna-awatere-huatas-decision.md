Te Tai Hauauru MP Tariana Turia has welcomed news that ACT MP Donna Awatere-Huata has decided not to resign from Parliament.

“Donna is a capable, competent and articulate Member of Parliament who, as an activist, has contributed much to Aotearoa and still has much to contribute as a Maori and a woman in this adversarial environment,” she said.

“Donna clearly has not been able to rely on the other two Maori MPs in ACT to support her, or the interests of tangata whenua.

“I will continue to support her and to remind our people of Donna’s huge contribution to race relations in this country,” said Tariana Turia.
