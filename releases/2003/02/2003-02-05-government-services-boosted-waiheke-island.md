The 20th Heartland Services Centre will be opened on Waiheke Island this Friday by Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“Heartland Services is a government initiative which restores face to face access to a range of government services in provincial communities. The Waiheke Island Heartland Services Centre will be a one-stop shop for the people of Waiheke to get access to the services provided by a range of government agencies.

“While there is a full range of services available in Auckland City, getting there involves added time, coordination and expense for Waiheke Island residents. Bringing government departments to the Island and putting them in the same location makes a lot of sense,” says Judith Tizard, who is also the MP for the Auckland Central Electorate, which includes Waiheke Island.

The Waiheke Island Heartland Services Centre is the 20th Heartland Services Centres to be established in provincial locations around the country. $2.27m was provided in the 2002 Budget to establish and staff the centres over the next four years.

"Heartland Service Centre coordinators will provide the link between local people making enquiries, and government agencies,” says Judith Tizard. “A public telephone and computer is provided at each centre and the coordinator can help with general enquiries, including access to government websites for job searches and other information.

"Government services most in demand on Waiheke Island include childcare and protection, housing, employment relations, career services, adult literacy, tax and family assistance and accident compensation. The centre offers a one-stop shop in a convenient location.”

The Waiheke Island Heartland Services Centre will be based at the Work and Income offices, 116 Ocean View Road, Oneroa. It will be open for business five days a week between 10.00am and 2.00pm. A coordinator will be available to help people in their contact with government departments and agencies.
