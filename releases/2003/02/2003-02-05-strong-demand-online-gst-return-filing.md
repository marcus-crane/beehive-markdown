Filing GST returns over the internet is proving popular with New Zealand businesses since it became possible late last year says Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain.

The electronic GST service was launched by Inland Revenue in early December following a successful pilot last year. It is one of a number of online initiatives being introduced by Inland Revenue as part of its e-enablement strategy.

“Inland Revenue has already received more than 3000 GST returns electronically,” said Mr Swain. “Services likes this are aimed at saving business people time and hassle and making the tax paying process as convenient as possible. However electronic services are not replacing the traditional ways of dealing with Inland Revenue and businesses that prefer to file GST returns on paper can continue to do so.”

To use the e-GST service, taxpayers access the e-GST return form on the Inland Revenue website (www.ird.govt.nz). They are immediately notified electronically by Inland Revenue that the form has been received.

The e-GST return goes straight into the return assessment process without any manual handling. Refunds are usually received earlier, because the return is received and processed without manual handling, and without time spent in the post.

In addition to filing GST returns electronically, customers of WestpacTrust, ANZ or Kiwibank can make GST payments online. These electronic payments to Inland Revenue are made through the banks’ websites.

“It’s encouraging to see business people taking advantage of initiatives aimed at making their lives easier,” said Mr Swain. “I look forward to further innovations from Inland Revenue.”
