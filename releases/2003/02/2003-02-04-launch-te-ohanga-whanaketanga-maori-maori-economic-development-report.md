Minister for Land Information and Associate Minister of Mäori Affairs, Commerce and Small Business, Hon John Tamihere, welcomes today's release of the TPK/NZIER Mäori Economic Development Report.

"It is timely that we acknowledge the contribution of the Mäori economy to the broader New Zealand economy," said Mr Tamihere.

"Contrary to popular perception Mäori control significant assets. As at 2000, the Mäori asset base was worth *at least* $5.2 billion. If we add the housing assets, this grows to over $11 billion."

"A key goal of my work as Associate Minister of Maori Affairs is to encourage Maori to take responsibility for engaging to a greater extent with assets that are already owned by Maori."

"Land ownership is key to the Mäori asset base. Mäori collectively own about 1.5 million hectares, 70 percent of which is owned on the East Coast, the Bay of Plenty, and the Central North Island. However, the limitations of land quality and management reduce the potential for growth. About 600,000 hectares are underdeveloped. About 20% of land has no formal administrative structure, with another 9% managed by the Mäori Trust Office."

"As Minister for Land Information and Associate Minister of Mäori Affairs I am working to assist Maori to bring their land under better management and into greater development. This will assist Maori development in a real, pragmatic way."

"There is a great deal of overlap between my roles in the Mäori Affairs portfolio and in the Commerce and Small business portfolios. I am working to ensure that the programmes of assistance for Mäori business are delivered in a co-ordinated manner that reflects the reality of business. For example, ensuring that the processes of the Mäori Business Facilitation Service, the Mäori Trust Office and the Poutama Trust are streamlined to the extent that applicants are not subjected to pointless bureaucratic hurdles in their applications for funding."

"I join with my colleague, Hon Parekura Horomia, in acknowledging the important message from the report: there is much still to be done and look forward to working towards achieving it."
