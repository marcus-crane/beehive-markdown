Six of the 75 constables who graduated yesterday from the Royal New Zealand Police College are headed for the Central police district.

Prime Minister Helen Clark attended yesterday’s graduation ceremony of Wing 208 at the College, along with wing patron Dick Hubbard.

The Central police district includes Palmerston North, Wanganui and New Plymouth.

Police Minister George Hawkins said all the constables would begin duties within the month.

Yesterday’s graduates included 60 male officers and fifteen women. Of these 16 identified as Maori and eight as having Pacific Island heritage.

They now begin a two-year period of on the job training before becoming fully fledged constables with the opportunity to work in range of specialist police careers.
