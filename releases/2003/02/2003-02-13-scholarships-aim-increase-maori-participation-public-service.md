The Minister for Land Information and Associate Minister of Mäori Affairs  
Hon John Tamihere acknowledged the government’s commitment to increasing the participation of Maori in the public service at the presentation of the Mauriora ki te Ao scholarships in Wellington today.

“Any initiative that helps Maori gain tertiary qualifications and take up leadership roles in the public and private sector is to be encouraged,” said Mr Tamihere.

“Engagement with natural resources is crucial for Mäori economic development. Programmes such as the Mauriora ki te Ao scholarships can make a real contribution to building the skills within our communities to achieve this.”

“At a time when young New Zealanders are often portrayed in a poor light, it was a great honour to be involved in celebrating the success of hard working young kiwis.”

Land Information New Zealand administers the scholarships, which are a joint initiative between five government natural resource agencies: the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry; Fisheries; Environment; Research, Science and Technology; and Land Information New Zealand. The programme offers scholarships worth $2000 each and the opportunity for vacation employment for Maori students studying towards tertiary qualifications in resource management, environmental planning, law and science.

The 2003 Mauriora ki Te Ao scholars are: Harold Smith, Tanira Morrison, Emma Wyeth (Ministry of Research, Science and Technology scholars); Kerry N-Garret (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry scholar); Beth Tupara (Ministry of Fisheries scholar); Huia Pacey, Micaelle Strange, Jaroz Adams (Ministry for the Environment scholars); and Nathanael Maxwell (Land Information New Zealand scholar).
