New statistics showing a dramatic drop in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits will prove embarrassing for the National party as it talks tough about future welfare policies, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

There were 134,416 people receiving unemployment benefits on 31 January 2003, over 16,000 fewer than the 150,880 on the same benefits on 1 February 2002.

Steve Maharey said the fall in unemployment statistics proves the government’s decision to focus Work and Income on getting beneficiaries into work is achieving results. Proposals floated by National to reintroduce work-for-the-dole and to put time limits on benefits put these achievements at risk.

“Dramatically lower unemployment rolls vindicate the government’s approach to welfare. We have freed up Work and Income front line staff to focus on getting people into paid work.

“Under National case managers spent so much time administering the ineffective work-for-the-dole scheme that finding real jobs for beneficiaries was a lesser priority. Worse still, evaluations National themselves commissioned in government showed beneficiaries became attached to their ‘make work’ jobs and stopped looking for real jobs.

“It is therefore astounding to hear the party would reintroduce work-for-the-dole if it were re-elected, and is also considering introducing life time benefit time-limits. Parties which genuinely aspire to form a government have a responsibility to move beyond sloganeering.

“National has constantly refused to acknowledge its welfare policies failed during the 1990s. These statistics make their continued denials much less credible,” Steve Maharey said.
