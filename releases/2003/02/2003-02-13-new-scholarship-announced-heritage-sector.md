A new scholarship for professionals in the heritage sector was announced this morning by Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

The Clark Collection Scholarship has been created by New Zealand financier, art connoisseur and heritage advocate Errol Clark as an opportunity for mid-career heritage and decorative arts professionals to expand their knowledge of built-heritage and decorative arts.

“The Clark Collection Scholarship is a remarkable opportunity for heritage and decorative arts professionals to undertake study in the United Kingdom which will be of benefit to both the recipient and to New Zealand,” Judith Tizard told attendees at the Museums Aotearoa Workshop in Wellington this morning.

The Scholarship will enable one New Zealander to attend the prestigious Attingham Trust Summer School in England and participate in its exclusive three-week study course. The recipient will also be allowed privileged study access to the leading UK heritage and decorative arts organisations, including an internship with English Heritage to study newly re-displayed historic properties in England.

“New Zealand will benefit tremendously from the vision and generosity of Mr Clark,” said Judith Tizard. “Alumni from the Attingham programme are the leaders of major heritage agencies and art museums throughout the world.

“Not only does Mr Clark’s Scholarship enable us to benefit from one of the world’s most respected arts and heritage programmes, but it also encourage those of us in the heritage and culture sector in New Zealand to collaborate more in the application of knowledge brought back to New Zealand.

“The Scholarship is an exciting, creative effort between Errol Clark, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust and Museums Aotearoa. I am most grateful to Mr Clark for his generosity and we applaud such partnerships that so clearly benefit our country’s heritage and culture,” said Judith Tizard

Details of the Scholarship may be obtained from The Historic Places Trust and Museums Aotearoa (which will provide the secretariat for the Scholarship).
