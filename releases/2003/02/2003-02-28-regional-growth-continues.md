Year on year regional growth in all regions is good news says Jim Anderton.

The information is published by the National Bank as part of a quarterly survey of regional trends.

“I am pleased that growth for the December 2002 year was positive for all our regions with three regions growing at over 5 per cent, six at over 4 per cent and four at between 3 and 4 per cent.

“New Zealand’s regions are at an exciting stage of development and if we can remove any obstacles to growth particularly skills shortages and infrastructural barriers, we can make even more progress.

“Although two regions faced a small decline in the last quarter both had year on year growth.

“Only Wellington had less, registering 2.1 per cent. Wellington has been selected as a special case for study by the Ministry of Economic Development and I hope we can identify ways to assist the Wellington regional economy.

“Some time later this year I would hope to have a regional forum in Wellington to bring a whole of government approach to the problems Wellington faces,” said Jim Anderton.
