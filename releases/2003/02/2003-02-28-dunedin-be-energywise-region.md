Dunedin’s Mayor Sukhi Turner today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) to become part of the EnergyWise Councils partnership. Energy Minister and Dunedin North MP Hon Pete Hodgson joined the Mayor for the signing.

Pete Hodgson welcomed Dunedin City Council as one of New Zealand’s fourteen EnergyWise Councils.

“Energy efficiency is a win-win. It’s about doing the right thing for the environment and it makes good business sense. Dunedin City Council has already achieved some energy savings through both community projects, such as the Melbourne Street Flats, and in-house projects, such as the installation of building management systems on major civic buildings. Joining EnergyWise Councils will help Dunedin build on these successes,” Mr Hodgson said.

“Dunedin faces significant energy challenges over the next decade if energy efficiency is to be improved and emissions reduced. Dunedin is a transport hub with both a major port and airport in the region. There is also a high requirement for heating in winter due to the climate and many homes use fireplaces for heating, which not only use energy inefficiently but also expel a lot of emissions.

“More efficient use of energy, that is getting more out of each unit of energy whether it be electricity, gas or petrol, will help Dunedin City Council and the community save money on energy and live in a cleaner, healthier environment,” Mr Hodgson said.

Agreeing to become an EnergyWise Council means adopting the principles of sound energy efficiency and management, both within the council and in the community.
