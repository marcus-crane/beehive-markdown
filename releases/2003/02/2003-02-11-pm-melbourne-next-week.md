Prime Minister Helen Clark will deliver the keynote address at next week’s eighth World Women’s Conference of the ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) in Melbourne.

The conference will host 500 women union representatives from around the world. Its aim is to discuss and develop plans to improve the economic situation of women. Helen Clark will deliver her address at 9.30am on Tuesday (Australian time).

“The ICFTU is the world’s leading global trade union organisation, representing 157 million workers in 148 countries,” Helen Clark said.

“Forty per cent of its members are women, so this conference is a key opportunity to look at ways we can build gender equality in the work place.”

While in Melbourne, Helen Clark will also attend a function paying tribute to Sir Edmund Hillary and meet with key business leaders in Melbourne. She will also call on Victoria Premier Steve Bracks and Australia Labor Party leader Simon Crean.
