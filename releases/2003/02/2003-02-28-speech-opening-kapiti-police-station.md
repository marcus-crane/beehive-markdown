Good morning.

Welcome to you all, and welcome to our line up of distinguished guests.

I see we have a good turnout of locals assembled here, its great to welcome my colleagues Otaki MP Darren Hughes, Mana MP Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, Kapiti Mayor Alan Milne and his wife Mary, and Porirua City Mayor Jenny Brash.

Welcome also the members of the Police family present, Deputy Commissioner, Lyn Provost, Superintendent John Kelly, Inspector John Spence, and Senior Sergeant Mike Coleman.

And a special welcome to the 38 sworn and four non-sworn staff of the Kapiti Police and their friends and families also gathered with us, and the many supporters of the Kapiti Police.

It gives me great pleasure to be opening this very impressive new building.

It’s not so very long ago that many of you last stood with me on this site.

At that time we turned the first sod to mark the demise of the old building and the beginning of the new.

That day it rained if I remember, and we all trudged through mud.

That day would have been one of the few when everyone was desperate to get back inside the old building.

It was probably one of the few times in its history it experienced hordes of people making a beeline for it and fighting each other to get inside.

Those of you who worked in the previous station will remember it as a fairly basic set up.

It was run down and badly showing its age. Some people were as unkind to describe it as unlovely.

I remember it as very cramped, not particularly well lit or welcoming. Staff areas also looked pretty run down and left a lot to be desired.

Staff who worked here over the years had put up with a lot and they had waited a long time for new premises.

Paraparaumu Station had been on the books for replacement for many years.

Certainly, it did not fit the area it was in. This area is one of the fastest growing in the country.

Since the mid-80s Kapiti’s population has grown 2.4 per cent a year on average, or more than twice as fast as the New Zealand population as a whole.

Kapiti District had the sixth fastest growing population of any local authority in the country in that period.

Reasons for the district’s popularity include its lifestyle, its beautiful environment situated between the mountains and the sea, its proximity to major employment centres, and its relatively low housing costs.

Another reason is its appeal as a retirement centre.

It’s mixture of young families, increasing business profile and older residents contribute to Kapiti being on the up and brings unique challenges to Police.

I’m delighted to say Police in this area have a record of which they can be proud.

Crime figures for this station for the year ending June 2002 show a total of 2835 offences, or a 13.7 per cent decrease on the previous 12 months.

A total of 1227 offences or 43.3 percent were resolved.

That result is a tribute to the skills of the sworn and non-sworn staff right here, a staff of which the Kapiti community can be proud.

In some ways today’s opening of Kapiti Station is an historic occasion.

Kapiti is among the first New Zealand Police Station to be completed this millennium.

I’m glad to say there’s others in the pipeline.

While there are many ways government can spend money on police are many and varied, one of the most satisfying is investing in police property.

A solid and committed police capital works programme ensures staff enjoy comfortable, satisfying conditions in which to do their important work.

Unfortunately, investment in police buildings has not always been so solid.

Between 1996 and 1999, for instance, an average of only around $725,000 a year was spent on police property in New Zealand.

That was the sum total of funds made available for every police station and facility in the country.

The Labour-led government elected in late 1999 inherited a situation where there was a lot to do, particularly as regards rescuing the police capital works programme from the doldrums.

I am pleased to say that the current government is investing around $12 million per year on the refurbishment and rebuilding of stations nationwide.

The aim is to reverse the state of disrepair that we inherited.

People sometimes ask me why the commitment to spend around $60 million over five years to rebuild and refurbish police stations?

The answer’s simple.

Police staff need and deserve good working conditions, and this includes modern police stations that will meet their needs.

Today it’s Kapiti’s turn.

Shortly the communities of Manurewa, Howick, Invercargill, and Oamaru, will celebrate opening new stations in their areas.

It’s a pleasure then to see such a striking a contemporary design replace the former building.

·My congratulations to those who worked on the building:

·the contractors and subbies for bringing the building into being well under time. Just over 4 months on a supposed 6 month contract is a great achievement

·the architects and design team at Opus International for a strongly styled building that suits its coastal area well. It looks great from the outside, and I’m told works fantastically inside for both visitors and staff

·to cost consultants Rider Hunt for making sure the $2million budget held

·and to Arrow International for a great job in managing the whole shebang.

Thanks to you all, and here’s to the continuation of excellent policing in the Kapiti area.

I’ve no doubt staff will find their work easier because they have a decent place from which to do their job.

Thank you.
