Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced a further $1.6 million to assist with extending, upgrading and building early childhood education centres, creating 463 extra places for children.

The extra funding has been made available as part of Budget 2003 to increase funding of the early childhood education discretionary grants scheme. The scheme currently provides annual capital assistance of up to $8.8 million to community-based early childhood services.

Trevor Mallard announced the extra money during a visit to Christchurch's Noku Te Au, which will receive more than $330,000 for a new building to create 25 extra places at the early childhood centre.

“This money will not only create hundreds of new places for children in early childhood education centres, it will also ensure that children have access to quality learning environments,” Trevor Mallard said.

“We know that quality early childhood education makes a significant difference to the way children go on to develop and learn throughout their lives. That’s why this government is focusing on a 10-year strategic plan for early childhood education.”

Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Aratki was launched last year and aims to increase participation, improve quality and promote collaborative relationships in early childhood education.

The purpose of the discretionary grants scheme is to assist groups to establish new services or to maintain standards by removing health and safety hazards in existing services.

It also focuses on increasing participation in quality early childhood education services by Maori, Pasifika and children from low socio-economic, rural and isolated areas.

Twenty-two groups have gained funding from this extra discretionary grants allocation. Fourteen grants have been allocated to assist groups establish new services and eight grants have been made to groups to help them address health and safety issues.
