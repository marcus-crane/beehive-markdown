Pacific Forum Foreign Ministers will discuss the plight of the Solomon Islands at a special meeting in Sydney next Monday, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

"Monday's meeting will be an important opportunity for all Forum members to discuss the situation, and the range of assistance that might be provided in response to a request from the Solomon Islands' government and parliament," Mr Goff said.

"New Zealand and Australia have been concerned for some time about the deteriorating situation in the Solomons. Monday's Foreign Ministers meeting will allow Pacific Island nations to express their views on how the Pacific Forum can best respond to this situation.

"The law and order situation in the Solomons has deteriorated to the point where the government has been subjected to intimidation and extortion, is unable to function properly to prevent sharp economic decline and to provide essential education and health services.

"Any assistance which is provided will need to be in response to a formal request from the Solomon Islands Governor General, acting on the advice of the Cabinet with the support of a majority of the Solomon Islands parliament.

"The provision of assistance will also require the active support and involvement of other Pacific Island countries," Mr Goff said.

"Outside assistance will be considered under the auspices of the Forum's Biketawa Declaration."

Mr Goff is in Adelaide today for this weekend's regular six-monthly consultation with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, before traveling on to Sydney for the Forum meeting.
