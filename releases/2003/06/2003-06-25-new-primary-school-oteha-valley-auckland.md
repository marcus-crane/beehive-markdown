A new state primary school will be established at Oteha Valley to meet Albany’s increasing population growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The school is scheduled to open at the beginning of 2004.

The decision to establish a new contributing school, for students from new entrants to year 6, follows consultation with existing schools and the local community.

“I’d like to thank all parents, the boards of trustees and members of the North Shore and Albany groups and communities who participated in the consultation process. I have carefully considered all your views and hope the establishment of this school will be welcomed by parents in the area,” Trevor Mallard said.

The school is being established to take pressure off neighbouring primary schools, particularly Glamorgan, Sherwood and Pinehill Schools. The new school, adjacent to Oteha Valley Road, but with access from Medallion Drive, will ultimately accommodate 520 students.

Five North Shore and Albany residents have been appointed to the establishment board of trustees. They are Laurie Anderson, Adrienne Mawer, Marrianne Reid, Trevor Snookes and Joan Titman.

Nominations for the board were sought from a range of parties including local schools, early childhood centres, residents, community groups, North Shore City Council and local MPs.

“The members of the board were chosen because of their skills and background. I am pleased that the board is comprised entirely of North Shore and Albany residents to ensure the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community,” said Trevor Mallard

The establishment board appoints the principal and other staff, as well as determining school policy, establishing sound governance practices and contributing to the school design. It will be in place until an elected board can take over. School elections are likely to be held within six months of the school opening.
