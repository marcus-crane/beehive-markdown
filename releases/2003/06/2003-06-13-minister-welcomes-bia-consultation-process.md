Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel indicated today that she is pleased that the process the Building Industry Authority is following, in proposing changes to its Approved Documents covering the use of treated timber and management of external moisture in residential buildings, is an open and transparent one.

"This is an important step in resolving the weathertightness problem. The proposals are part of a suite of measures being undertaken by the government and the BIA in addressing this issue. Other significant measures include the review of the Building Act and the establishment of the Weathertightness Homes Resolution Service.

"The proposed changes have important implications for consumers and industry and I would like to emphasise that the release of the proposals is the beginning of the process and not the end. I encourage all interested parties to participate in the consultation the BIA is now running on the proposed changes".

"I am confident that at the end of the process the Building Industry Authority should have a robust Approved Document in which both consumers and the building industry can have confidence", Lianne Dalziel said.
