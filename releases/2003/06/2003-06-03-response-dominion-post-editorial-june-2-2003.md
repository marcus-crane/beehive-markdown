I can't let your editorial "Police need to slow up on speed blitzes" pass without comment.

The most convincing argument supporting the police enforcement of speed limits is the declining rate of death and injury from road crashes.

Surveys by the Land Transport Safety Authority support this approach – 56% of drivers say they want more enforcement on the roads, 39% say they want it kept about the same, and only 3% want less.

Driving too fast for conditions is the single biggest factor in fatal crashes, followed by drink driving and failure to wear seatbelts – all three are targeted by police in a "zero tolerance" approach. No-one has suggested that campaigns against drunk drivers or those who fail to buckle up are motivated by a desire to raise revenue or fill some imagined quota. So why single out enforcement of the speed limits? The answer is some New Zealanders like to drive fast, and as manufacturers produce apparently safer vehicles, drivers believe they can travel at faster speeds and still remain safe.

Unfortunately a driver or passenger is twice as likely to die in a 120 km/h crash as they are at 100km/h. A pedestrian hit by a vehicle travelling at 50km/h has a 60% chance of being killed, which climbs to 90% if the speed increases to 60km/h.

Since the introduction in 2000 of the Highway Patrols, and the zero tolerance approach to drivers travelling more than 10 km/h over the limit, the road toll has dropped from 462 that year to 403 in 2002 – the lowest in 40 years.

I accept that enforcement of the 10km/h tolerance (i.e. any driver caught travelling 11km/h or more over the speed limit will be ticketed) has been met with some resistance. This can largely be attributed to the myths surrounding traffic enforcement, and I hope the resistance will disappear as the myths are dispelled.

The biggest myth seems to centre around a perception that enforcement of speed limits is motivated by a desire to raise revenue, rather than to improve road safety, and that this is met by some sort of quota of tickets. Let me state quite clearly – there is no quota of tickets police must meet.

Government funding for road policing is around $221 million this year – or almost one quarter of all police funding. For this level of funding, I expect results. I measure these results by the reduction in death and injury on the roads. Police are also required to meet performance objectives that I set as Minister of Transport – which includes a set number of contacts per hour with motorists. This ensures they have a high visibility and helps measure whether I am getting value for money from the Transport Vote.

Longer term, the police are working towards an annual road toll of no more than 300 deaths by the year 2010. Critics are being either mischievous or downright misleading by suggesting that other police duties are being compromised by the attention given to road safety. Resources for road safety are channelled to police in a separate funding stream from Transport, so the argument cannot be made that they rightly belong elsewhere.

For the record, the combined revenue from speed camera and other moving traffic offences is estimated at $82.9 million in the 2002-03 financial year, compared to $79.2 million in 2000-01, the year the 10 km/h policy was introduced. This is an increase of $3.7 million, or 4.7%, over two years.

Police will be keeping up the pressure on motorists, in order to keep more of them alive.
