New Zealanders' common sense and public spirit has lowered the risk of electricity shortages this winter, says Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven.

"New Zealanders have responded brilliantly to the call for electricity savings of ten percent," Mr Duynhoven said.

"Reaching the target has been a significant factor in lowering the risk of electricity supply disruptions this winter. Power saving efforts are now paying off and I congratulate everyone who has heeded the Target 10% campaign."

Mr Duynhoven said many New Zealanders had shown ingenuity in coming forward with power-saving ideas.

"New Zealanders are noted for their common sense and this has come to the fore in the effort to save electricity. The wisdom of saving now to avoid difficulties later has been widely seen and acted on."

Mr Duynhoven said that although the risk of shortages had reduced it was important to keep saving power, as winter had only just begun.

"Heavy demand for electricity could still put the system under pressure if people suddenly give up their power conservation efforts. We need to keep up the savings for a few more weeks to make sure we put the risk of winter power shortages behind us."
