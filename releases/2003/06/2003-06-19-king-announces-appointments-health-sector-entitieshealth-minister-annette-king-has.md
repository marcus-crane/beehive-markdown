Health Minister Annette King has announced three appointments or re-appointments of chairs in the health sector.

Ms King said she welcomed the appointment of Peter Glensor as chair of Hutt District Health Board (DHB), the re-appointment of Richard Thomson as Otago DHB chair, and the appointment of Warren Young as chair of the New Zealand Blood Service's board.

The appointment of two new DHB board members --- Harry Burkhardt to Auckland DHB and Dr Robert Logan to South Canterbury DHB --- was also announced today.

“Mr Glensor has played an important role at Hutt DHB since his election in 2001, serving as both a member and as the board's deputy chair. He is replacing Warren Young, who is leaving to chair the New Zealand Blood Service. Mr Young will bring a wealth of experience in board governance to the Blood Service.”

Mr Thomson had been a member and chair of Otago DHB since 2001, and had served on many of the board’s predecessors in the 1980s and 1990s, she said.

“Mr Burkhardt is the managing director of a successful plastics recycling firm with significant experience both in management and governance. He enjoys a team environment and being able to bring innovative, new ideas to the board table.

”Dr Logan is a specialist physician/cardiologist who is Director of Medicine at Hutt DHB and chair of the National Health Committee. He will be able to use his extensive clinical and academic background, his experience in health service management and his time previously spent as a board member of Health South Canterbury to the benefit of the region.”

Ms King said all the appointees brought substantial experience to their boards and had a track record of contributing extensively to their local communities. “I am also pleased to provide boards, where possible, with continuity of leadership.”
