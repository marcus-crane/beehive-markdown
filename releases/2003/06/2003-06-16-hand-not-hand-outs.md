Stunning examples of human innovation have been rewarded today with the announcement of the first round of the Social Entrepreneur Fund in Wellington.

These movers and shakers are the recipients of a government run Social Entrepreneur Fund which provides assistance towards ‘making them more effective in what they do.’ The Community Employment Group, a service of the Department of Labour, administers the fund.

Of the 200 people who applied to the fund, 51 community champions have been successful in gaining support for activities which range from creating change in hardened prison inmates using therapeutic theatre, to researching the use of Maori land for native plants and lavender farming.

Announcing the new Social Entrepreneur Fund recipients Social Development and Employment Minister Hon Steve Maharey laid down a challenge to New Zealand communities.

“The government does not have one panacea to ‘fix’ things. It is the champions, the guiding lights in our communities who can think of bright ideas and inspire others to find solutions to health, education, social and employment problems.

“It is time to support these people and develop their potential so that the government moves from hand outs towards a hand up by investing in people who can make a real difference,” he says.

The fund is ongoing and complements assistance available from the Safer Communities Action Fund administered by Child, Youth and Family.

Several high profile people to gain recognition from the fund are actor and director Jim Moriarty to research the development of his prison programmes; a profoundly Deaf youth leader Sonia Pivac to research digital media impact for the Deaf community; a husband and wife team Puawai and Arahi Hagger to work on a digital archival history of the Ratana Movement and Auckland comedian Phillip Patston to attend a Disability Arts festival in the UK.
