Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is delighted that Wira Gardiner has accepted the role of Chairman at the Maori Broadcasting agency, Te Mangai Paho.

On the 28 May, Mr Gardiner was appointed to the interim position following the resignation of Toby Curtis. Mr Gardiner has been appointed for a 12-month term starting on 1 July and ending on the 30 June 2003.

Parekura Horomia is confident that Mr Gardiner will bring fresh ideas and provide a solid platform for TMP so that it can maintain robust and transparent processes.

â€œThis is an important time for Maori broadcasting especially with Maori Television on the horizon, and I believe Mr Gardinerâ€™s appointment will bring some certainty to the industry.

"In the meantime I look forward to receiving his report into TMP as soon as it is available and will make comment once I have had time to fully consider its wider implications," said Parekura Horomia.
