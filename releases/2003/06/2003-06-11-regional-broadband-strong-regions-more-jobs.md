Economic Development Minister and Progressive leader Jim Anderton is pleased at today's announcement from Telecom that it expects broadband coverage to reach 80 per cent of rural households by June next year.

Jim Anderton says the government's regional broadband project has encouraged telcos, and they are responding with rapid advances.

"As a result of more regional broadband, there will be more opportunities for successful businesses to locate in the regions. That means more jobs in the regions and a better future for the New Zealand economy as a whole."

Jim Anderton said it was important to continue to keep up the meomentum for increased broadband coverage to virtually all households in New Zealand.

"It's also important to ensure that there is choice among providers and technologies."
