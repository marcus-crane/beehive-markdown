Joanna Beresford has been appointed as the new chair of the New Zealand Teachers Council, Education Minister of Education Trevor Mallard announced today.

Joanna Beresford replaces Stan Rodger who stepped in on a short-term basis last year.

“I was keen to appoint a new chair who would continue to provide the council with strong leadership and who would ensure a focus on providing excellent service to its members,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The council has had some teething problems and unfortunately teachers and schools have borne the brunt of these difficulties.

“Earlier this year I put in a Ministry of Education team to assist the council with registration backlogs, and this has resulted in noticeable improvements. However, the council needs to be able to manage its functions on its own, and I’ve been advised that it is now working on its systems to ensure this backlog never happens again.

“Joanna Beresford brings a wealth of experience from both education and the broader public sector. She brings a strong mix of skills in leadership, communication and organisational management, along with sound common sense.

“In addition, Joanna understands what teachers expect of the Teachers Council, as well as what principals, boards of trustees and the general public expect. I am confident she will ensure the council lives up to these expectations,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I’d like to thank Stan for his work with the council during a difficult time, and I wish him well for the future.”
