Educational authorities in the Far North have been brought together in a new office, opened in Kaikohe today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

The office is the shared location for the Ministry of Education (including Group Special Education and Whakaaro Matauranga Pouwhakataki), the Ministry’s schooling improvement project Te Putahitanga Matauranga and the Ministry’s iwi partner Te Reo o Te Taitokerau.

“This is a significant and very exciting step for education in the Far North,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This office, Te Honohonotanga (to come together), shows the Ministry's commitment to work with schools, early childhood centres, iwi and the community on education strategies, activities and services for the children of the Far North,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The majority of Far North students are Maori (60.9%) and increasing the quality of educational services for Maori continues to be a high priority for this Government.

“We want to increase the responsibility and authority Maori exercise in relation to education. Iwi and other Maori organisations are working more directly with the Ministry and Government through formal partnerships such as Te Putahitanga Matauranga.

“In the last year examples of outstanding achievement by many Maori learners can be seen in all areas of education. A significant lift in literacy achievement was recorded across all Year 4 Maori students. Some schools with previous high levels of suspensions of Maori students substantially lowered the rate during the year. An international study of 15-year-olds (Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)) showed Maori girls achieving around the OECD average. Maori participation in tertiary education has also increased substantially.

“There is still work to do and that is why Budget 2003 contained a range of significant opportunities for raising the quality of teaching and learning of school age Maori children,” Trevor Mallard said.
