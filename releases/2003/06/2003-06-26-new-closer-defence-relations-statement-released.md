A new statement on Closer Defence Relations between Australia and New Zealand was released today following the annual meeting between Defence Ministers in Canberra (see attached).

Today’s meeting follows on from the very successful meeting the Australian Defence Minister Robert Hill and New Zealand Defence Minister Mark Burton had in Wellington in September last year. That meeting opened a new chapter in defence ties between the two countries and foreshadowed a revision of the 1998 joint statement on Closer Defence Relations to ensure it provides a contemporary focus for our alliance and security partnership.

The Ministers agreed on the text of the new statement after receiving a report from the Defence Chiefs and Secretaries from both countries, who had their annual consultative committee meeting yesterday. The revised statement recalls the historic, longstanding and close links between our people and Defence Forces, and points to the future by:

·Acknowledging that we are sovereign countries working together for our mutual security  
·Emphasising the need for our Defence Forces to be interoperable so that they can work together effectively, particularly in pursuit of shared strategic interests within our immediate region  
·Acknowledging our responsibility to support the principles of the United Nations Charter  
·Setting out the principles which guide the defence relationship; and  
·Defining the practical outcomes we seek.

The Ministers noted good progress in the eight areas that they identified last year for closer collaboration. These are:

·Increasing training opportunities and exchanges  
·The enhancement of command and control of joint and combined operations between the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces  
·How Australia’s new patrol vessels and New Zealand’s off shore and in shore vessels might complement each other in achieving the most effective outcomes  
·Enhancing land intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance within the Pacific region  
·Complementarity of Army equipment

·New Zealand has the opportunity to learn from Australia’s P-3 systems upgrade and similarly Australia can consider New Zealand’s experience of structural life extension upgrade as these aircraft are considered critical to regional security  
·The usefulness of New Zealand’s C-130 life of type study for Australia’s decisions on replacing or upgrading some its C-130 fleet. Subject to the outcome of the study there is potential for Australia and New Zealand to work together to provide future air lift capabilities  
·Given the similar requirements for the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces to support their highly mobile land forces, there is potential for useful sharing of information about rotary wing requirements.

There are now established liaison mechanisms to ensure that collaborative opportunities are taken into consideration by relevant staffs at various stages of capability development. The new Closer Defence Relations statement will also provide a clearer focus for reporting on these areas as well as broader reporting on collaborative issues.

The Ministers discussed the areas where Australia and New Zealand had worked together and had common interests, including Bougainville, East Timor, the war against terrorism, the impact of the Bali bombing and stabilisation and rehabilitation operations in Iraq.

They also discussed the current situation in the Solomon Islands and the need for appropriate regional responses, noting that further discussion will take place in Sydney next week between regional States as part of the Pacific Island Forum.

The Ministers noted that there will be closer consultation between officials to provide a coordinated and complementary response in assisting regional countries under Australia’s Defence Cooperation Program and New Zealand’s Mutual Assistance Program.

The next annual meeting will be in mid-2004 in New Zealand.

Joint Statement on Closer Defence Relations (CDR)  
June 2003

There is no strategic partnership in our region closer than that between Australia and New Zealand. Bound together by geography and history, by shared values, beliefs and interests, and by the close relationships between our peoples, we have a tradition of mutual commitment to each other’s security. This is the ANZAC spirit. The formal expression of our alliance and security partnership is found in the 1944 Canberra Pact, ANZUS Treaty, and through Australia – New Zealand Closer Defence Relations instigated in 1991. This statement reflects current developments in strategic circumstances and respective national strategic policies. It sets out the strategic context of our Defence relationship, the principles that underpin the relationship and the practical outcomes we seek.

Strategic Context

Australia and New Zealand are sovereign nations, with a long history of partnership. Our defence forces should be able to work together effectively to protect these interests.

It is within the immediate region that our defence forces are most likely to be working together in pursuit of shared strategic interests. Maximising interoperability for regional operations is therefore a priority.

We are conscious that our security is linked to peace and stability in the Asia–Pacific. We promote this through our common membership of the Five Power Defence Arrangements and our active participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum. Our recent operations in East Timor and Bougainville have demonstrated the constructive role our defence forces play in maintaining and promoting regional security.

Australia and New Zealand share compelling global security interests. We uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter and we acknowledge our responsibility to be prepared to make practical military contributions in support of those principles. We each attach the highest importance to pursuing our national goals peacefully, constructively and collaboratively, free from the threat or use of armed force or terrorism against us.

Guiding Principles

Our Defence relationship is guided by the following principles:

·We are sovereign, independent states working together for our mutual security  
·Our defence and security partnership is open, based on mutual respect, and for the long term  
·We will work together to deliver capability in the most cost-effective way  
·We will develop and exploit the skills of our people to enhance cooperation, and  
·We will focus on, and commit resources to, practical collaborative activities to achieve mutually beneficial CDR outcomes.

CDR Outcomes

Our Defence relationship has many dimensions. In seeking to maximise the benefit it provides, we will focus on the following outcomes:

CDR Outcome 1.A mutual understanding of our respective national security policies.  
CDR Outcome 2.Our national force development decisions take into account our need to operate together.  
CDR Outcome 3.We are proficient in combined and joint operations, particularly in our region.  
CDR Outcome 4.Our logistic support and sustainment arrangements will enhance mutual operational effectiveness.  
CDR Outcome 5.Our approaches to Defence assistance in the region are coordinated and complementary.

Implementation

The alliance relationship between New Zealand and Australia is given contemporary substance through CDR and is realised through a program of cooperative activities designed to give the relationship enhanced practical effect. The program addresses a wide range of defence activities including strategic assessment and planning, capability development, combined and joint operations command, control and communications, training, exercising, personnel development, support systems and industry support.

Australia and New Zealand maintain a close dialogue on security and defence issues with both Ministers and senior defence officials of the Australia – New Zealand Consultative Committee meeting at least annually. Ministerial direction is implemented through the Australia – New Zealand Defence Coordination Group and a number of subordinate working groups. The meetings will review and evaluate outcomes, provide direction to future activities and update the joint statement when necessary to reflect national defence policy developments and the current strategic circumstances.
