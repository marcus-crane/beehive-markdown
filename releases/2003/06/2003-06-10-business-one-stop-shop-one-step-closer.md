“The business one stop shop created from the merger of Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand is another step closer today with the second reading of the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Bill,” said Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister, Jim Anderton, today.

“This was one of the Progressive election cornerstone commitments and one which I am pleased to be able to say will be achieved in this term of office.

“This bill is evidence that this Coalition Government listens to business.

“In my many regional development visits up and down New Zealand I have met many businesses and business people who wanted to see business advice and support provided from one agency and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will meet this need.

“Every New Zealand business needs to strive to be internationally competitive regardless of whether it has a domestic focus or it is already trading internationally, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will assist in advising businesses.

“The decision to merge Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand will send a strong message to business.

“The message is that we want businesses to succeed.

“This new organisation will help our businesses to do better, so that New Zealand will perform better.

“We want to see more innovation, stronger businesses and stronger regions all leading to long term sustainable, high quality jobs,” said Jim Anderton.
