A group of Napier schools and early childhood services is to receive funding from the new Collaborative Innovations Fund for a project designed to help children as they move through the education system, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The Collaborative Innovations Fund provides an annual sum of $1 million to support consortiums of schools or early childhood education services which want to develop new styles of teaching and learning that improve educational outcomes.

“For too long schools and early childhood services have tried to go it alone rather than form alliances with others. I applaud these schools and services and their professionals who will provide new opportunities for their students by working more closely with one another,” Trevor Mallard said.

Teamtamatea, a collection of Napier schools and early childhood services, was launched by Trevor Mallard last year. One of their first projects will receive $105,000, equivalent to two years worth of funding, from the Collaborative Innovations Fund.

The Integrated Pathways Project will get local schools and early childhood services working together to share information and develop plans that outline the expected progress of individual students.

The project also aims to help make the journey between early childhood education, primary and secondary schools an easier and more consistent one.

The schools and early childhood services involved in Teamtamatea are: Tamatea High School, Tamatea Intermediate, Tamatea Primary, Tamatea Kindergarten, Tamatea Play Centre, Porritt Primary School, Fairhaven Special School and Whaerangi Kindergarten.
