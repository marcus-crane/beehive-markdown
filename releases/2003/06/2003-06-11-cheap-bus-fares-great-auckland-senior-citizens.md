Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today congratulated Stagecoach Auckland for its bus fare promotion for senior citizens. The bus company is offering one-way $1 bus fares to senior citizens between 9am and 3pm every Monday until the end of June.

“Many older people are limited in their ability to get out and about in our communities, for both financial and practical reasons. Stagecoach’s cheap bus fares will encourage them to use buses for their travel needs, without the hassle of driving their own car or relying on someone else to take them.”

Ruth Dyson said the initiative was a good example of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy in action.

“Affordable and accessible transport is one of the key goals of the government’s Positive Ageing Strategy. I commend Stagecoach for addressing older people’s transport needs, and I am delighted that the company is considering offering permanent cut-price fares to senior citizens.”

Ms Dyson said it was up to older people in the region to ensure the trial was a success.

“I encourage older Aucklanders to get behind Stagecoach’s offer. Make the most of the cheap bus fares, and get out and enjoy Auckland!”
