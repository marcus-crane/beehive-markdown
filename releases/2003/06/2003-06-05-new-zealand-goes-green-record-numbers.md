New Zealander’s commitment to the environment has been highlighted by a record number of entries for this year’s Green Ribbon Awards.

"We've received more than 200 nominations for the awards this year and this reflects the hard work the community is putting in for the environment," Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said.

"People like the Green Ribbon winners are critical in changing community attitudes and behaviours to the environment. The government has a role such as through the Water Programme of Action and through partnerships as in the Clean Streams Accord. But it's people like these who make the difference on the ground day after day.

"The work these people do is often hard, time-consuming and unrewarded. Yet it is vital to improving the quality of our environment.

"All the winners and nominees for these awards are doing their bit and are providing leadership in their communities, inspiring others to follow," Marian Hobbs said.
