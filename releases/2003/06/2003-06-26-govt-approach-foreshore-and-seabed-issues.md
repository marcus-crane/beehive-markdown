26 June 2003Media Statement  
Summary of government approach to resolving foreshore and seabed issues

The essential elements of the government position are:

·The government will act to uphold rights of public access to, and use of, the foreshore and seabed;  
·The government will also act to protect Maori customary rights, to the extent they are not already;  
·A group of senior ministers will be discussing with the Maori caucus, which has an electoral mandate to represent Maori, how to reconcile these two interests;  
·The objective is to acknowledge and protect Maori customary rights while also protecting the public interest, including the ability to enjoy traditional access to the foreshore;  
·The government is looking for a win-win solution where both sides feel that justice has been done;  
·Resolving these issues will require legislation, but the exact form of that has yet to be determined;  
·Work is being done on a statutory framework which ensures that private, exclusive titles are not created over what has always been regarded as the public domain;  
·Customary rights will be provided for in that framework. The question is how they, and the broader public’s rights and interests, can be reconciled;  
·With goodwill between the Treaty partners, the government believes an outcome that is fair to all can be achieved.
