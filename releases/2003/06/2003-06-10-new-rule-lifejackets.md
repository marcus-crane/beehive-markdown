The Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven has launched a new rule that makes it compulsory for every person on a recreational boat to be provided with a suitable lifejacket.

Mr Duynhoven said "last year 25 people died in recreational boating accidents. Eighteen of those lives could have been saved through the single act of wearing a lifejacket.

This rule makes it compulsory for all recreational craft to have a suitable lifejacket for every person on board. It represents an important milestone in the battle to reduce the boating death toll."

A number of regional councils already have bylaws covering lifejackets, along with accompanying enforcement mechanisms. This new Maritime Rule sets the national standard and provides coverage for those areas without regional bylaws.

Mr Duynhoven said "the government has set aside $250,000 in 2003/04 to promote the new rule, so that all New Zealanders understand the importance of lifejackets and boating safety. We know that lives will be saved and therefore some families will be spared the tragedy of losing a loved one on the water."
