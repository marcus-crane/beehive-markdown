Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia will not be drawn into discussion regarding the extended review of Te Mangai Paho CE Trevor Moeke.

"This is an operational matter and as such is a matter for the Board of TMP. Mr Wira Gardiner has been appointed interim chair and I have confidence in whatever action he deems necessary in relation to the operational functions of TMP," said Parekura Horomia.
