A new chair is being sought for the Broadcasting Standards Authority because current office holder, Peter Cartwright, has decided not to seek a second term, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Peter Cartwright was appointed chair of the BSA in June 2000, having had previous experience in tribunal work. He chaired the Indecent Publications Tribunal and the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal during the 1990s.

Steve Maharey said Peter Cartwright's current term has expired but he will continue in office until a successor is appointed.

“Peter Cartwright has presided over a stable Authority during a difficult period when it has had to tackle increasingly complex cases. I want to thank him for his service.

“The process for the appointment of a new chairperson is now underway," Steve Maharey said.
