A group of Invercargill schools has received funding from the new Collaborative Innovations fund to expand a project aimed at reducing student suspensions, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The Collaborative Innovations Fund provides an annual sum of $1 million to support consortiums of schools which want to develop new styles of teaching and learning that improve educational outcomes for their students.

“For too long schools have tried to go it alone rather than form alliances with other schools. I applaud these schools and their professionals who will provide new opportunities for their students by working more closely with one another,” Trevor Mallard said.

After an initial trial last year, the Invercargill schools have received $315,000 from the Collaborative Innovations Fund for the expansion of their RESUS (Reconsideration of the Suspension Process) project over three years.

RESUS aims to provide an education and intervention programme for students who are being considered for suspension, giving schools another option and students another chance, when dealing with this situation.

The project’s aims are widely supported by other Invercargill support agencies.

The schools involved in RESUS are: James Hargest High School, Verdon College and Southland Boys’ High School.
