The Information Technology Minister Paul Swain says the release of the final report of the Electronic Commerce Action Team (ECAT) provides a valuable stocktake of progress by the private sector.

Mr Swain says "ECAT is a successful example of government and business working together to improve conditions for the economy as a whole".

Mr Swain has thanked members of ECAT for their work over the past two and a half years to increase the use of e-commerce in their own sectors.

He says "ECAT has greatly assisted the Government in achieving its vision for New Zealand to be world class in embracing e-commerce for competitive advantage".

Mr Swain says highlights include ten regional e-commerce events; the development of the [www.nzecommerce.co.nz](http://www.nzecommerce.co.nz) website and a freephone service to help businesses increase their involvement in e-commerce; the development of sector-specific action plans; specialised research projects; and the e-commerce guide for small business.

Mr Swain says "we began this in 2000 because we wanted to lift the profile of e-commerce in New Zealand. It is clear that the importance of e-commerce is now well understood, and ECAT can take much of the credit for this."

Mr Swain says "the Government is still doing a lot of work in the e-commerce and ICT area, and the momentum created by ECAT is being continued through the Small Business Advisory Group and government agencies".

The report is available at [www.ecat.govt.nz](http://www.ecat.govt.nz)
