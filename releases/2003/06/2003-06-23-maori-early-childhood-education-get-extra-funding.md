Maori Affairs Minister Parakura Horomia is pleased that Maori early childhood education services will receive almost $400,000 to assist with further development of new and existing services.

The extra funding has been made available as part of Budget 2003 to increase funding of the early childhood education discretionary grants scheme. The scheme currently provides annual capital assistance of up to $8.8 million to community-based early childhood services.

â€œThis extra funding is part of the Government's goal to increase participation of Maori communities in early childhood education and to ensure that all children have access to quality learning environments,â€? Parekura Horomia said.

â€œEarly childhood education is one of the most important areas of education policy, especially with the release of the 10-year strategic plan, Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki, launched last year.â€?

The Discretionary Grant Scheme assists groups to establish new services or to maintain standards by removing health and safety hazards in existing services. The capital grants are focussed on increasing participation of children in low socio-economic, rural and isolated areas as well as in Maori and Pasifika communities.

Of the 22 grants allocated nationwide, 14 are for groups establishing new services and 8 to groups to assist them in addressing health and safety issues.
