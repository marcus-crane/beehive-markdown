Rates of car conversion have dropped dramatically in Mangere in the last eight years, Police figures show.

Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field says police figures for the calendar years ending 31 December between 1995 and 2002, show recorded car conversion offences totalled 554 in 1995, compared with 529 in 2002.

Rates for theft ex-cars in the area rose slightly with 453 offences at the end of 1995 compared with 561 in 2002.

In March 1995, there were 2.06 million licensed vehicles in New Zealand, compared with 2.44 million in March 2002. These included cars, rental cars, miscellaneous including tractors, exempt vehicles, taxis, service coaches and trucks.

A range of factors, including close circuit television monitoring, especially of public car parks and railway commuter parking areas, as well as dedicated police car squads responsible for identifying repeat offenders, had contributed to the fall.

Increased response to burglaries helped both rates, as burglars were often responsible for car conversions and thefts from cars.

Mr Field said the public should also be congratulated for their role. Gone were the days when people regularly left cars unoccupied with the keys in the ignition and the motor running.

People were now much more aware of the need to take, simple, practical steps to protect their property.

“These include not leaving items in cars where they can be readily seen by potential thieves, locking valuables in the boot and making sure unoccupied cars are locked.”
