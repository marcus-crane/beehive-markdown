Education Minister Trevor Mallard has acted on community feedback from a proposed review for Dannevirke schools and today announced some changes to his earlier proposal, to address community concerns.

“I’ve agreed with community wishes for two full primary schools in the town, instead of my original proposal for one town primary school. In addition, instead of closing Awariki School, I have now decided to merge it with three other local schools.”

“The proposal will consolidate and strengthen education in the area and unlock an estimated $5.3 million for the education of local children.

“This is about ensuring local kids receive quality education well into the future. I believe we have received the best advice possible from schools and their communities. I think they agree that it’s better to tackle demographic changes now and plan for a positive future rather than wait until we are on the back foot.

“I now look forward to Dannevirke students enjoying the benefits of the extra operational resources released which will total around $1.6 million,” Trevor Mallard said.

There will also be approximately $470,000 released specifically for joint education initiatives and nearly $3.2 million additional funding available for capital works.

The firm preferences announced today for the schools are:

·To retain Dannevirke South School, Weber School, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Tamaki Nui a Rua and Dannevirke High School as a Year 9-13 secondary school;  
·To merge Dannevirke North and Hillcrest Schools on the Hillcrest site with Hillcrest School being the continuing full primary school;  
·To merge Awariki, Norsewood, Ormondville and Matamau Schools on the Norsewood School site, with Norsewood School being the continuing full primary school;  
·To merge Ruahine and Rua Roa Schools on the Ruahine School site, with Ruahine School being the continuing full primary school;  
·That year 7 and 8 technology provision is relocated to Dannevirke High School.  
The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

Trevor Mallard expects to make his final decisions in about August after further consultation with the schools. The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to ensure a smooth transition and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
