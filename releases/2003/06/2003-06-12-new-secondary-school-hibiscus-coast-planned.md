A new secondary school is being planned for the Hibiscus Coast north of Auckland, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“I have given approval for the Ministry of Education to immediately commence consultation with nearby schools about the opening of new secondary school facilities at Stanmore Bay on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This consultation will be carried out on the basis of a new year 7 to 13 (form 1 to 7) secondary school being constructed on the site occupied by Hibiscus Coast Intermediate School. Under the proposal the Intermediate School will merge with the new school.”

The consultation period ends on 1 July and Trevor Mallard will make his final decision on the type of school after that.

The planned opening date for the new facilities to cater for year 9 (form 3) students is 2005, with another year level to be added each year thereafter.

“This proposal is in line with the intention of the Hibiscus Coast Schooling Strategy developed over the last three years by the ministry together with representatives of all schools in the area,” Trevor Mallard said.

“A key theme of the strategy is to develop parallel form 1 to 7 campuses of similar size at Orewa College and on the Stanmore Bay site.”

Trevor Mallard congratulated Hibiscus Coast schools for the collaborative and visionary way that they have worked with the Ministry of Education to develop a long term plan for schooling in the area.

“In an area which is experiencing considerable population growth, it’s important that provision of education for increasing numbers of children occurs in a planned way across the network of schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I look forward to receiving a report on the views expressed during the consultation process.”
