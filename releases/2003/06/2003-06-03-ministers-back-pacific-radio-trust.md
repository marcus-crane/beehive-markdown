The Broadcasting and Pacific Island Affairs ministers are backing a decision by the National Pacific Radio Trust to cancel the contract it has with an Auckland-based provider for the nationwide Pacific radio network.

The Trust is responsible for overseeing NiuFM, the new nationwide Pacific radio network which commenced broadcasting in August 2002. Auckland-based Pasefika Communications Network Limited was selected through a contestible tender process as the service provider. Following concerns about the provision of governance information, programming issues and an audit which found some questionable expenditure, the Trust moved today to cancel its contract with the provider.

The Trust has put in place temporary arrangements at an alternative location and NiuFM remains on air.

Steve Maharey and Phil Goff said the Trust had kept them fully informed of developments and it retains their full support.

“Ministers have been fully briefed on this issue and we are satisfied that the actions of the Trust have been entirely appropriate. Legal and audit advice sought by the Trust also provides independent verification that it has acted appropriately.

“NiuFM remains on air and the Trust is now working to resolve the remaining issues, including recovering funds,” the Ministers said.
