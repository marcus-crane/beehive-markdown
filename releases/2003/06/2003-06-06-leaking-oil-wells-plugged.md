The plugging and abandonment of two leaking Moturoa oil wells has been completed says Harry Duynhoven, local MP and Associate Minister of Energy.

Work on the second of the wells, the Blenheim Reclamation well, was finished late last month. Drilling equipment has been removed from the Whiteley Street site and site restoration has begun.

“The plugging of the Blenheim wells brings to an end a long drawn out saga that began in August 2001 when the Hoffman family were forced to vacate their Bayly Road home after the Blenheim - 1 well started flowing a mixture of water and small amounts of oil and gas. I am pleased that we have finally completed the work and I am grateful for everyone's patience," Mr Duynhoven said.

Work on the wells commenced in late February and took ten weeks to complete. Ironically, it was the Blenheim Reclamation well, and not the Blenheim -1 well, which threw up the most surprises and this required a number of modifications to the work programme.

Mr Duynhoven confirmed that when the Blenheim Reclamation wellhead was first exposed in March it appeared that the well was not leaking however after close observation it was seen to be weeping a small amount of oil and a decision was made to re-enter the well and plug it back to surface.

"It was never going to be an easy task to re-enter these old abandoned wells and the closeness of the nearby houses meant that the work had to proceed with extreme caution.

“As the local MP I am pleased to see this issue resolved,” said Mr Duynhoven.
