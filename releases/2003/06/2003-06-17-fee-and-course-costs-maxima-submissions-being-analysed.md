Fifty-five submissions have been received on the proposed fee and course costs maxima system that will regulate tertiary fees from 1 January 2004.

Indicative schedules of maximum fees (inclusive of tuition fees and course costs) that can be charged from 2004 through to 2006 were set out as part of the May Budget. Comment was invited on the schedules from interested parties. Submissions were received from student representatives, tertiary education sector bodies, polytechnics, colleges of education, private training establishments and universities.

Steve Maharey said the submissions are now being analysed and will considered as part of the process of finalising the fee and course costs maxima which is due to occur at the end of July.

“The new fee and course costs maxima will provide long term security to students and their families about the costs they will face when embarking on tertiary study. Tertiary providers will also be able to clearly anticipate their likely future income, which is essential for proper planning.

“The Tertiary Education Reform Act, which Parliament passed in December 2002, requires that the indicative fee and course costs maxima set out at Budget time be gazetted so that comment from interested parties could be received prior to them being finalised. This also enables the government to adjust the schedule, as appropriate, in light of these comments.

“Submissions received on the proposed schedules have come from a wide range of viewpoints. My officials are now summarising and analyzing the submissions.

“The government has a statutory period through to July 22 to consider the comments we have received on the proposed schedule. I will finalise the fee and course costs maxima soon after that,” Steve Maharey said.
