The founders of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society would find many of the issues that led to its formation ninety-six years ago still present in New Zealand society today, according to Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey spoke at the opening of the Society’s 56th biennial national conference in Christchurch this evening.

“It is a sad commentary on New Zealand society that we start the 21st century facing the very same parenting issues that Plunket set out to address from its earliest days.

“Poor parenting skills, knowledge about child nutrition and development and inappropriate physical discipline have been with us since Plunket was founded in 1907.

“That those issues remain with us today is largely thanks to society losing its way on parenting and focusing instead on the promotion of the rights of adults.

“Plunket continues to play a key role giving modern parents the skills they need to raise children today – as do a wide variety of community-based social service organisations.

“Better parenting support is a key focus for the current government. Initiatives such as the Families Commission, changes to sole parent benefit rules and the $10.8m positive parenting campaign funded in the recent Budget demonstrate our intention to put parenting issues at the centre of policy development again.

“Truby King would have expected nothing less,” Steve Maharey said.
