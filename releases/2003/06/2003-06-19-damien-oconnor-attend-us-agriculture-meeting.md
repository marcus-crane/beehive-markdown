Associate Agriculture and Rural Affairs Minister Damien O’Connor is to attend [Ministerial Conference and Expo on Agricultural Science and Technology](http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/stconf/conf_main.htm) in Sacramento, United States next week.

Mr O’Connor said the meeting, from June 21 to June 25, would focus on the critical role science and technology could play in raising agricultural productivity in developing countries in an environmentally sustainable way.  
The Conference aims to broaden participants’ knowledge and understanding of relevant science and technology, including biotechnology, and enhance access to new technologies through public-private partnerships. Increasing agricultural productivity through technology adoption is a key means of boosting both food availability and access and improving nutrition.

Agricultural production, processing and marketing technologies from developed and developing countries will be examined, as well as critical issues regarding the transfer and indigenous development of technologies.

He said that these things were important for developing countries, who were heavily reliant on earnings from agriculture.

“Most important for these countries, and for New Zeealand which is also heavily reliant on agriculture, is fair access to international markets for food and other primary industry products.”

Mr O’Connor said New Zealand had improved its productivity significantly through adopting new technology. The Sacramento conference would be a useful opportunity to promote New Zealand export opportunities as well as our experience in primary production, and to see whether there were new things we could usefully adopt.
