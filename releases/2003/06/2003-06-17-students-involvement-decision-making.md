An Education Review Office report has found that effective student participation in school decision-making contributes to better student motivation and learning, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“According to the report, student participation in school decision-making benefits everyone involved. Students learn essential life skills for engaging in public and community life through being representatives at school and through making decisions in their own classrooms,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Student representation on boards of trustees is already mandatory. I will also be commending the ERO report on the topic to schools as it contains very useful examples of how student participation can be promoted.”

In summary the report found that effective student participation in school decision-making contributed to:  
·better student motivation and learning, confidence and self-esteem;  
·better school processes, including more successful implementation of school initiatives, and improvements in student behaviour; and  
·better relationships between students, teachers, parents, whanau and community.

“ERO’s findings indicated that key strengths in our schools are the involvement of students in decision-making at an organisational level through student representative mechanisms, and also the involvement of students at the classroom level in decision-making.

“However the report found that schools need to further develop their current formal mechanisms by making sure all students – regardless of ethnicity, sexual identity, disability, religious belief and gender – have the opportunity to take part,” Trevor Mallard said.

ERO’s report was developed with input from the Ministry of Youth Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Development.

“These ministries are now developing generic guidelines for schools, community and government organisations on how to better involve children and young people in their work,” Trevor Mallard said.
