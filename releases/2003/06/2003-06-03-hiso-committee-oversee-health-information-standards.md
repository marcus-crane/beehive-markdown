Health Minister Annette King today announced 10 appointments to the committee that will oversee the development of health information standards in the sector.

The committee will be chaired by Paul Cressey, Managing Director of East Health Services and Deputy Chair of Counties Manukau DHB.

Ms King said the Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO), announced late last year, will put building blocks in place for current and future health information developments, especially those stemming from the Working to Add Value to E-Information (WAVE) report.

HISO's role will include identifying, developing, publishing, promoting and monitoring New Zealand's health information standards, she said.

"Too much money was wasted in the health sector in the 1990s on inadequate IT systems. With the confirmation of the members of this committee, I am pleased to see that HISO can get underway to oversee the future development of information standards in this country.”

"The committee members have a great deal of experience and represent a range of organisations across the health sector. I look forward to the progress they will make in improving health and participation outcomes through the development of appropriate information management and technology standards."

Paul Cressey said the new committee, which will meet this month, offered an excellent opportunity to make a real difference in developing a better information management environment in the health and disability sector.

“Standards are critical in a co-ordinated, population based approach to health care. I can’t wait for the committee to get down to overseeing and encouraging the development of much needed information management standards.”
