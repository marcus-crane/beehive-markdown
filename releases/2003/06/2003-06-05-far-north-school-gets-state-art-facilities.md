Education Minister Trevor Mallard today opened a new Multicultural Arts and Cultural Centre and a new Science and Mathematics block at Taipa Area School in the Far North.

The opening of Nga Tai Toko – Rua is the culmination of nine years consultation and development. The multicultural community arts centre will be used for concerts, art displays, private functions and day and evening classes by school and community.

“The emphasis shifted from building a school marae to a multi-functional arts and cultural centre for the coming together of all cultures after extensive community consultation in 2000,” Trevor Mallard said.

“At a time when a lot of energy and resources are going into the arts and creative industries, this facility will encourage students to develop their skills and knowledge of the visual and performing arts. It offers inspiration to be life-long participants in the many opportunities that the arts provides.”

The building, based on a design by student Teri Reihana, is next to Taipa beach – a landing place of the legendary Kupe. The new facility is funded by the community (60 per cent) and the Ministry (40 per cent).

Taipa Area School’s new Mathematics/Science building is a state-of-the-art block including two laboratories, three maths classrooms and an editing suite for film making courses.

The school is already at the forefront of supporting students learning on-line through the use of interactive work units, which students and families can access. Every classroom has at least two computers. These new teaching facilities enhance student access to the internet and the school’s large and growing intranet.

“I congratulate the Doubtless Bay community on its foresight in developing Nga Tai Toko Rua. It will provide a stimulus for learning activities for current students and a focus for community wide life long learning,” Trevor Mallard said.
