The May road toll was the lowest on record, Police Minister George Hawkins and Transport Minister Paul Swain announced today.

“While it is a tragedy that 32 people lost their lives on our roads during May, that figure does represent the lowest toll on record,” Mr Hawkins said.

Forty-one people died on our roads during May 2002.

That New Zealand’s road toll was currently at its lowest since 1962 was largely attributable to police and LTSA road safety initiatives, Mr Hawkins said.

Mr Swain said the public must also be given credit.

“Clearly, general road safety messages and ongoing campaigns against drink-driving and speeding are getting through,” Mr Swain said.

Mr Hawkins said last month’s result and the continued annual fall in the road toll was a result of the effectiveness of the Highway Patrol and police.

“While some people may not appreciate getting ticketed for driving infringements, the results are there for all to see.”
