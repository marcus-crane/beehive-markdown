State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today announced that he has appointed Mary Scholtens, QC, to carry out a review of the Protected Disclosures Act 2000.

The Protected Disclosures Act 2000 provides protection for whistleblowers in the private or public sector who disclose information about serious wrongdoing – which is conduct such as fraud or other actions which cause a serious risk to public health or safety, or to the environment.

The Act contains a provision requiring a review by the end of 2003 of the operation of the Act and whether any amendments to the scope and contents of the Act are necessary or desirable.

“We want to make sure this Act is working as intended. Interested members of the public will be able to provide written submissions during the review process. These should be received by 11 July,” Trevor Mallard said.

The Terms of Reference for the review are attached. The review report will be delivered to the State Services Minister by 31 October 2003.
