The Australian Productivity Commission will tomorrow release its draft report on its review of mutual recognition schemes, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

The draft report, which evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian domestic Mutual Recognition Agreement and the Trans Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement, will be available on the Commission’s website from 3am, Friday 27 June 2003.

“Mutual Recognition schemes are a key instrument in reducing the regulatory impediments to economic integration across jurisdictions.

“The TTMRA aims to promote the freedom of movement of goods and skilled people between our two countries. Mutual Recognition schemes address some of the adverse impacts on industry of operating in multiple regulatory environments,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Commission will embark on a six-week consultation period with interested stakeholders in Australia and New Zealand. Submissions on the draft report close on 8 August 2003, after which the Commission will consult specifically with regulators and business stakeholders.

The Commission is expected to publish its final report in October 2003.
