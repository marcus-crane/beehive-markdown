A major waterscreen, light, fire and sound show, a craft village with retail outlets including sales of Maori herbal treatments, contemporary Maori food and tattooing will be developed at Bastion Point as part of a major tourism facility called “Te Pa”. A key feature will be the sound and light journey through time seen through Maori eyes.

“This is a major tourism project which the Government is pleased to support,” said Progressive leader and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“Often Maori business ventures are hard to fund because the collective nature of the projects meant they do not easily fit existing business support programmes. There was therefore the need for a more flexible, targeted approach to major Maori projects involving iwi, and funding was set aside for the current financial year,” said Jim Anderton.

The Government is supporting the development at Bastion Point, Orakei with a $100,000 grant which will be tied to specific measurable milestones.

The Coalition Government is providing funding through the Ministry of Economic Development to further develop technical research, and product development and investor information.

"Te Pa" will be developed jointly by the Ngati Whatua o Orakei Trust Board and  
Oceania Attractions Limited, an Auckland company.
