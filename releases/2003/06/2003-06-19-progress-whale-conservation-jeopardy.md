The International Whaling Commission is balanced on a knife edge after new efforts by pro-whaling nations to stack the membership of the commission, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

“I have just arrived at the IWC meeting in Berlin to find the very real possibility that pro-whalers may win a majority on the commission for the first time in thirty years if, as expected, three new pro-whaling nations join tomorrow.

“Should this come to pass it will be a significant set back for whale conservation. Loss of a pro-conservation majority on the IWC will scuttle further progress at this meeting on a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, supported by every South Pacific nation except the Solomon Islands,” Mr Carter said.

“The Berlin Initiative, another pro-conservation proposal designed by Mexico for this meeting, may also founder should a simple majority be lost. New Zealand is doing all it can to stop this from occurring and we should know by the end of tomorrow whether our efforts have been successful.”

Mr Carter said that despite the lengths being taken by pro-whalers to distort the commission’s membership, the moratorium on commercial whaling remained safe because to lift it required approval of 75 per cent of the IWC’s membership, not just a 51% majority.

“We need to be clear that a change in membership on the IWC does not represent a change in world opinion on the importance of conserving and protecting whales, it is just a culmination of a concerted campaign by pro-whaling nations to satisfy their appetites at the expense of a species,” Mr Carter said.
