The Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Marian Hobbs, will represent New Zealand at the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting in the Marshall Islands this week.

The three-day meeting begins on Tuesday (June 10) and is a forerunner to the Pacific Forum Leaders Meeting being hosted by New Zealand in August.

"The agenda will cover areas directly relevant to aid and the environment, including the development goals set out by the United Nations millenium assembly, economic and social development and the environment ,and governance," Marian Hobbs said. "Through its Pacific programme the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) is working to improve economic governance in the region."

The minister leaves Auckland tomorrow morning (Monday) and returns on Sunday.
