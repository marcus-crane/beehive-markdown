Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his proposal for a re-organisation of Masterton schools, a move that would unlock about $9.5 million for the education of local students.

“This proposal is about strengthening education in the Masterton area and ensuring that local students will receive quality education that is sustainable well into the future,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The area is facing population decline and falling rolls and we must make sure this will not impact on students’ education. The aim is to make sure education money is spent on teaching students, and not on maintaining under-used or empty buildings. If accepted, my proposals will see around $9.5 million ploughed back into local schools.

“I look forward to hearing from the community in the two periods of consultation that will follow from today.

“I know this process can be stressful but I hope the community will understand that it is better to consider the future from a position of relative strength rather than leave it until there is a situation of weakness that could see schools engaged in competition with each other for pupils.”

“This is not about saving money for the Government to spend elsewhere. Under the proposal and using current estimates, $3.5 million in operational funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements. There will be a fund of $1 million for schools to use jointly, and $5 million of extra property funding will be available,” Trevor Mallard said.

Proposals under the review are:  
·The retention of Mauriceville, Solway, Tinui, Wainuioru, and Whareama schools;  
·The retention of Masterton Intermediate and Wairarapa College;  
·The retention of Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Wairarapa;  
·The merger of Miki Miki and Opaki Schools on the Opaki site, with Opaki being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Harley Street and Masterton Central Schools on the Masterton Central site, with Harley Street being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Lansdowne and Totara Drive Schools on the Totara Drive site with Lansdowne School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Fernridge, Cornwall Street and Masterton West Schools as a contributing primary school (ie years 1 to 6) on the Masterton West site with Cornwall Street being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Makoura College and Hiona Intermediate School on the Makoura College site with Makoura College being the continuing school;

It is proposed that changes be formally implemented in time for the 2004 school year but that some building changes would occur during 2004.

The board of each continuing school would manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

Two further periods of consultation on this proposal will follow. There will be about one month of consultation after which Trevor Mallard will announce his firm preference, based on feedback from the local community.

Following that announcement there will be about another month of consultation before a final decision is announced.
