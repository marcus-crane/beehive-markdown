A wide range of non-governmental stakeholders will have a voice on how the ACC scheme is run, following the establishment of two new ministerial advisory groups, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

The two new groups are the ACC Ministerial Advisory Group, and the Ministerial Advisory Panel on Work-Related Gradual Process, Disease or Infection.

The ACC Ministerial Advisory Group, which met for the first time last Thursday (25 June), will provide independent and specialist advice to the minister on the operation, design and performance of ACC. The group is chaired by the ACC Minister. Its members are Associate Professor David Gerrard, Ms Linda Beck, Ms Lorna Dyall, Mr Tim Cleary, Mr Ross Wilson, Dr Aniva Lawrence, and Ms Nicola Drayton-Glesti.

The Ministerial Advisory Panel on Work-Related Gradual Process, Disease or Infection, which will meet for the first time on 23 July, will provide independent advice to the minister on issues relating specifically to work-related gradual process, disease or infection. The panel will be chaired by Wellington Queens Counsel Dr David Collins. Its members are Dr Evan Dryson, Professor Neil Pearce, Ms Hazel Armstrong, Mr David Wutzler, Mr Tony Wilton and Ms Karen Below.

The moves follow the establishment earlier this year of the ACC Consumers’ Outlook Group, which provides ACC with community advice on claimant service issues.

Ruth Dyson said the establishment of the advisory groups would ensure that ACC had access to a cross-section of views from non-governmental stakeholders.

“The Ministerial Advisory Group provides the opportunity for a range of perspectives to be taken into account on any issues concerning ACC’s operation and performance, and on the design of the scheme itself.

“The Panel on Work-Related Gradual Process, Disease or Infection provides opportunities for occupational health and safety experts to provide independent advice in an area where advances in medical knowledge are constantly challenging current assumptions and which requires continuous scrutiny.

“The establishment of these advisory groups is a further move towards ensuring the ACC scheme is fair, and is seen to be fair, for all of those associated with it.”
