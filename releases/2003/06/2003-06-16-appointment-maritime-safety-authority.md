The Transport Minister Paul Swain and the Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven have announced that Ken Gilligan has been appointed to the Board of the [Maritime Safety Authority](http://www.msa.govt.nz).

Mr Duynhoven says Ken Gilligan has a sound knowledge and experience of the maritime industry, and has been appointed for a 3-year term.

Mr Gilligan is a former Managing Director of the Port of Napier, and has also served as General Manager of the Hawkes Bay Harbour Board.

Mr Gilligan replaces Ken Plowman of Westport who has resigned due to work commitments.

Mr Duynhoven says Mr Plowman was a valuable member of the MSA Board through his wide range of experience in the maritime industry.

The Maritime Safety Authority is a Crown entity, with responsibility for establishing safety standards for the maritime transport system, monitoring the adherence to those standards, investigating some maritime accidents, responding to oil spills, and reviewing the system.
