Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard is delighted that the Labour-Progressive Government and government agencies feature prominently in a Top 50 of important people in the New Zealand music industry.

Rip It Up magazine has compiled a list of “The 50 most important people in New Zealand music” for its latest issue.

Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark features in the Top 50, as does Judith Tizard and representatives of the New Zealand Music Industry Commission, New Zealand On Air, TVNZ and National Radio.

“We are delighted and flattered to be in the company of New Zealand songwriters, broadcasters and record labels, but I also take it as the serious acknowledgement it is intended to be of the hard work we have been doing to recognise music’s important place in our economic and cultural growth,” said Judith Tizard.

“In Rip It Up, I also acknowledged the ongoing, invaluable support of other Ministers such as Finance Ministers Michael Cullen and Trevor Mallard, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“I would like to congratulate the New Zealand music industry and the broadcasting industry for the impressive growth in profile, sales, broadcast and confidence that has taken place in the past few years. The relationship between the broadcast and music industries is an example of great creative partnership and I look forward to seeing more relationships develop across sectors.

“The most recent New Zealand Music Month was the most successful yet, and a tribute to the pioneers who have worked so hard, for so long, in relative isolation, in the belief that New Zealanders and the world need to hear New Zealand music.

“I also want to congratulate Rip It Up for celebrating New Zealand music in this way, and thank them on behalf of the government for this acknowledgement.”
