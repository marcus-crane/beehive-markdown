Racing Minister Damien O’Connor today announced the appointment of Warren Larsen as the chairperson of the New Zealand Racing Board. Murray Acklin, Jim Wakefield and Thayne Green are also appointed as board members.

The New Zealand Racing Board, which replaces the Racing Industry Board and the TAB, commences its duties on 1 August 2003, the start of the new racing year.  
The [Racing Act 2003](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=1234529506&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B31C53%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) requires the chairperson to be independent of any particular racing code or sector group. Warren Larsen is an experienced company director and the former chief executive of the New Zealand Dairy Board.

Mr O’Connor said Mr Larsen had a proven track record in business, and the racing industry should be excited at his appointment.

“I am confident that he will prove to be a dynamic, and progressive leader.”

Murray Acklin, Jim Wakefield and Thayne Green are appointed on the nomination of the three racing code bodies – [New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated](http://www.nzracing.co.nz/), [Harness Racing New Zealand Incorporated](http://www.hrnz.co.nz/), and the [New Zealand Greyhound Racing Association](http://www.nzgra.org.nz/) (Incorporated).

Mr O’Connor said the code-nominated appointees would bring a wealth of experience and knowledge of the racing industry to the board table, which would be particularly useful in the initial, transitional period.

“The new board will provide a major opportunity for a fresh look at racing, and to develop a vision for growth as a major export and entertainment player in our economy.”

The remaining three members will be appointed next month, following wide consultation with the recognised racing industry organisations and the meeting of a Nomination Advisory Panel prescribed by the Racing Act.
