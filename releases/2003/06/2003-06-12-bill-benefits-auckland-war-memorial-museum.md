A Bill introduced to the House today will enable a major new development to get underway at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

The Auckland War Memorial Museum Site Empowering Bill will repeal the Auckland Institute and Museum Site Empowering Act 1918 and empowers the leasing of land within the Auckland Domain for the Auckland War Memorial Museum, including an extension to the present site.

“In May last year, the Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark announced a government contribution of $26.5 million over five years from the Regional Museums Fund towards the development of world class facilities at the Auckland War Memorial Museum,” said Judith Tizard.

“It is essential that this legislation be passed before the Auckland War Memorial Museum begins construction of their proposed building extensions, which include the ‘Grand Atrium’ project and a new underground carpark facility.

“Originally the Museum had anticipated starting construction of the underground carpark on 1 July 2003 and the new refurbishment of the building on 1 September 2003, but both of these projects require this legislation to be enacted,” said Judith Tizard.

Auckland War Memorial Museum Director, Dr Rodney Wilson, greeted the announcement that the Bill had been introduced to the House today with pleasure.

"The introduction of the Bill begins the process of clearing the last hurdle to allow construction to get underway on the Museum's ‘Grand Atrium’ project,” said Dr Wilson.

“All going well, construction will commence in October, with completion of the carpark some six months later and delivery of the ‘Grand Atrium’ itself at the end of 2005. When completed, these spectacular additions will allow the Museum to deliver state of the art services and programmes to Aucklanders, more than 70,000 school children each year, and some 250,000 overseas tourists each year.

“We are indebted to the Hon Judith Tizard for her sponsorship of the Bill and look forward to completion of the process in the immediate future.”
