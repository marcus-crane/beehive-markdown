Cabinet Secretary Marie Shroff has been appointed as the new Privacy Commissioner, Associate Justice Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

Marie Shroff will succeed retiring Privacy Commissioner Bruce Slane. Marie Shroff is expected to take up her new role in September.

Lianne Dalziel said the appointment followed a rigorous selection process from among a number of highly qualified applicants.

“Marie Shroff brings with her a formidable reputation from her role as Cabinet Secretary and her wide experience in a number of fields, including teaching and journalism,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“Her 15 years’ experience as Cabinet Secretary and Clerk of the Executive Council has seen her serve six Prime Ministers from both Labour and National parties, and four Governor-Generals. She has successfully supported Cabinet decision-making and constitutional developments under the changing environment of MMP, and published a fully revised version of the Cabinet Manual, the key guide to central government constitutional and administrative policy and practice.

“I look forward to Marie bringing to her new role as Privacy Commissioner her extensive experience in constitutional matters, government decision-making, and an ability to find an appropriate and practical balance on challenging and occasionally delicate issues.

Lianne Dalziel expressed her thanks to Bruce Slane who has served over a decade as Privacy Commissioner.

“Bruce Slane was appointed the first Privacy Commissioner and in that sense had to initiate and develop the role. He successfully established the Office of the Privacy Commissioner as a respected institution supporting the privacy rights and protections available to New Zealanders. He has a high level of dedication and professionalism, and his contribution is very much appreciated.

“I am particularly pleased that Bruce will preside over the 10th anniversary of the Privacy Act 1993, and I am sure that he will also be pleased that someone of Marie Shroff’s stature will carry on this role and that she will oversee the implementation of his recommendations to improve and refine New Zealand’s privacy laws.

“I wish Bruce well for the future. He has been utterly devoted in his service to the legal profession and the law, and I am sure he will continue to be so in whatever role the future holds for him,” Lianne Dalziel said.
