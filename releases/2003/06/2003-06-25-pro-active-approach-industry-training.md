Education Minister Trevor Mallard today commended the merger of two Industry Training Organisations, which he said will help provide a seamless qualifications framework for the civil engineering and related industries.

Design, Construction and Consultants ITO (DCCITO) and New Zealand Contracting ITO (NZCITO) will merge to become InfraTrain New Zealand Ltd.

"This amalgamation shows organisations are taking a pro-active approach to improve their services and make efficient use of resources available," Trevor Mallard said.

"Rapid technological change and global competition are changing the way we do business and demanding a higher level of skills from the workforce. Industry Training Organisations are in a unique position to equip New Zealanders with the skills for New Zealand to become a knowledge society."

"This Government is committed to workplace learning and recent Budget announcements will bring its industry training contribution to $120.6 million in 2006."

InfraTrain will begin operations at an administrative level on 1 July 2003, but with final approval pending from the Tertiary Education Commission.
