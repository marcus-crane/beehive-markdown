New Housing Minister Steve Maharey is visiting a pensioner housing redevelopment in Riccarton today.

The nearly completed Wharenui Road 8-unit development for Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) utilises exisiting HNZC land and recently acquired adjoining land. In partnership with Homecastle Homes, the project has involved demolishing existing dwellings and constructing purpose-built accomodation for elderly tennants.

Steve Maharey said the redevelopment is a good example of how HNZC is responding to demographic changes and better catering for specific housing needs.

“Population projections indicate that by 2021, 20 percent of the Christchurch population will be in the elderly age group (up from 13 percent in 1996). The Riccartion redevelopment is part of HNZC’s strategy to anticipate the housing needs flowing from demographic change in the local community.

“The new units are all two-bedroom residences which are in particular demand in the city. Currently 68 percent of applicants on HNZC’s waiting list in Christchurch are looking for one or two bedroom accomodation. The development also provides HNZC with the opportunity to better use existing homes as some tenants may come from larger homes that are better suited to families.

“The redevelopment cost $99,000 per unit (not including the cost of land) and took six months to build. It is situated close to shops, medical services and bus routes. The properties are of a high standard, well insulated, and overlook a common area which provides a sense of community for the residents.

“These new homes are part of the Government’s expansion of well designed and built State housing,” Steve Maharey said.
