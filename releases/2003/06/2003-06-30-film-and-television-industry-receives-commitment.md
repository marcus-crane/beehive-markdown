Large budget film and television productions are to receive production expenditure grants as part of the long-term development of the New Zealand screen industry, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today.

“A 12.5 per cent production expenditure grant will be available for both local and overseas screen productions that meet the qualifying criteria.

“This grant scheme is an encouragement to attract and maintain the net economic benefits of hosting and producing major film and television projects in New Zealand,” said Jim Anderton.

The grant criteria scheme will mean:

·If production expenditure in New Zealand exceeds $50 million the film or television production will automatically qualify for the grant;  
·If the production expenditure in New Zealand amounts to between $15 million and $50 million expenditure and this equates to at least 70 per cent of the total production expenditure then it will also qualify.

The grant scheme will apply to feature films (including those shot direct to video), television movies, television drama series and mini-series.

“While expenditure on the grants will vary from year to year, in the next financial year $40 million could be available. This figure is based on large-scale film and television productions already considering filming here next year. In total these projects could invest nearly $300 million in New Zealand,” said Jim Anderton.

“The film and TV industry is one of our most vibrant industries, with huge growth potential. By introducing this grant we will encourage more production here which will in turn bring more money into New Zealand, creating jobs and increasing the size of our local screen production industry.”

“Although the scheme is focussed on large budget production there will be many beneficial “spill over” effects including providing local screen producers with continuity of work as well as helping them develop their skills and allowing them to work with top-class directors.

“The government also provides about $100 million a year to the New Zealand film and television industries through New Zealand on Air, the NZ Film Commission, NZ on Air, and other agencies. In addition I expect to announce further measures to encourage the New Zealand film industry in the next few months when the government responds fully to the report of the Screen and Film Production Industry Taskforce.”

“Details of the criteria and administration of the grants scheme will be developed over the next two months,” said Jim Anderton.
