A project to analyse existing Christchurch social services, and identify trends and gaps in services, will help government and community agencies better meet the needs of children, young people and families, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Ruth Dyson said today.

Speaking at a workshop to discuss the Christchurch Community Mapping Project, Ms Dyson said it included useful information on demographic and social trends, social services available in the community, and people’s perceptions of key social service issues and strengths.

“Every community has different social service needs. The project outlines the particular needs of Christchurch children, young people and families, and establishes how well the current range of services meet those needs. It also outlines what has to change to better achieve our shared vision of safe children, strong families and caring communities.”

Ruth Dyson said key issues that emerged from the project included:  
·the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for children and families. (Strengthening Families and Healthy Christchurch are identified in the report as successful examples of collaboration and partnerships);  
·the need for long term solutions to affect sustainable change;  
·barriers for families including poverty, poor parenting skills, lack of knowledge about services and ways to access them;  
·the need for multi-faceted approaches to produce better outcomes;  
·possible improvements in data collection and recording, and increased emphasis on regional service evaluation;  
·the need for more Maori staff and specialists working in the areas of social services;  
·the increasingly diverse nature of the Christchurch population and the need for social services to reflect this diversity;  
·lack of access to services for youth, particularly for mental health and for drug and alcohol services;  
·workforce capacity issues.  
The Christchurch Community Mapping Project is a joint partnership between Child, Youth and Family and the Christchurch City Council. Other participants include He Oranga Pounamu, Healthy Christchurch, Safer Christchurch and the Department of Internal Affairs.

Ruth Dyson congratulated mayor Garry Moore for the council’s involvement in the project and for its Community Plan discussion document focusing on safety and security outcomes.

“The result of this project will be a range of services that meet local needs and reflect local priorities. It will build on, rather than replace what the Christchurch community is already doing, and help us to make a positive difference in the lives of children, young people and families in the region.”

Christchurch is one of six communities around the country initially participating in Local Services Mapping projects. The others are Waitakere, Otara, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay and Nelson City.

BACKGROUND NOTES ON LOCAL SERVICES MAPPING

Child, Youth and Family currently consults with communities before making recommendations on funding of social services. Local Services Mapping adopts a more collaborative approach to that process, in line with government policy, to develop closer relationships with communities.

What is Local Services Mapping?  
Local Services Mapping is about identifying the needs of children, young people and their families and discussing how services, including those provided by Child, Youth and Family and community providers, can be managed to better provide for local needs.

What is the aim of the project?  
The aim of the project is to identify the needs of children, young people and families. It is also designed to provide a forum for discussions on how services, including those provided by Child, Youth and Family; can be managed to better meet local needs.

Who initiated the project?  
The Local Services Mapping project has been initiated by Child, Youth and Family in response to feedback from community groups.

Who have Child, Youth and Family worked with on this project?  
The project has been a partnership between Child, Youth and Family; Christchurch City Council, Department of Internal Affairs, He Oranga Pounamu, Strengthening Families Management Groups, Safer Community Council, Health Christchurch and representatives of various government departments.

Why has the government set up the Local Services Mapping project?  
The government initiated the project for a number of reasons. We hope to work with communities to:  
·better respond to the needs of children, young people and families;  
·develop fairer and more open funding arrangements;  
·better combine statutory and non-statutory services;  
·better balance preventative and remedial work;  
·better align government and community social services for children and families;  
·achieve a better relationship between Child, Youth and Family and local communities;  
·assist the Chief Executive of Child, Youth and Family to meet her statutory duties to encourage and promote cooperation between organisations engaged in providing services for children, young people, families and family groups.

What six communities are initially implementing Local Services Mapping?  
The six communities are Christchurch, Waitakere, Otara, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay and Nelson City. Each of these communities has approached the process in a different way according to their own needs and resources.
