Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson has reviewed and accepted Te Ohu Kai Moana’s quota allocation model.

Mr Hodgson said today the Government accepted that the model, He Kawai Amokura, conformed to the requirements of the 1992 Fisheries Deed of Settlement and the Maori Fisheries Act 1989.

"I congratulate Te Ohu Kai Moana on the development of the model," Mr Hodgson said. "It is fundamentally sound and it provides a just and workable framework for the future. This is a huge step towards the completion of the Fisheries Settlement and the advancement of Maori interests in the fishing industry."

The Ministry of Fisheries will now work with Te Ohu Kai Moana to develop a Bill to implement the allocation model, for introduction to Parliament later this year.

"The Ministry of Fisheries and TOKM will work together to ensure the legislation reflects as clearly as possible the intentions of the parties to the Fisheries Settlement and that it delivers the appropriate benefits to Maori," Mr Hodgson said.

"The Government has identified some elements of the allocation model that will need to be clarified or improved, but we are confident these adjustments can be made appropriately through the legislative process.

"TOKM also has specific tasks it must complete before the legislation can proceed. These include the development of an accepted method of measuring coastline length and the completion of the constitutions and trust deeds for the entities proposed in the allocation model.

"Interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on the Bill at the Select Committee stage."

The Government has given an undertaking to litigants with current proceedings against TOKM’s allocation model that it will inform them directly of the decision to accept the model and Mr Hodgson said he would be doing so as soon as possible.
