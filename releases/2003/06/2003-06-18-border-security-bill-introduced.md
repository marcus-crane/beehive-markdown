The safety of New Zealand from terrorism, trans-national crime and the security of our trade and trading partners are central to the Border Security Bill, introduced to Parliament today by Customs Minister Rick Barker.

“The Border Security Bill is part of a whole-of-government approach toward strengthening New Zealand’s national security in the post-September 11 environment. It will sit alongside the [Counter-Terrorism Bill](http://www.findit.govt.nz/LIBRARY/LIBRARY/DIGESTS/BILLS/943COUNTERTERRORISM.HTM), already before Parliament, and the Maritime Security Bill which is also due for introduction this year.

“The Bali bombings and the recent carnage in Saudi Arabia are reminders that the threat of terrorism and international criminal activity still present clear and present dangers to the people of New Zealand and the vital reciprocal trade our island nation relies on,” Mr Barker said.

The Bill’s proposed changes will improve the security of the global travel and trading environments, while enhancing closer security relationships within the import and export supply chains. The Bill will also allow for increased sharing and gathering of intelligence information between relevant agencies to assess risk.

Internationally, Mr Barker said nations and multi-country organisations were increasingly seeking to provide extra assurance about the safety of travel and trade.

“International bodies such as APEC, the World Customs Organisation, international aviation and maritime bodies and recently the G8 Summit are seeking to develop a consistent and effective approach to minimising the risk of terrorist attacks and other security breaches.

“The Border Security Bill enhances Customs ability to collect and analyse electronic information direct from the source in relation to goods and people travelling into and out of New Zealand.

“It provides the legislative framework for Customs’ innovative Secure Export Partnership Scheme, which sees government and industry working together to secure goods from the point of loading to export.”

“A sense of comfort about the security of our country’s export goods will help ensure that they move expeditiously across the border. Without this assurance our exports could be left sitting on a foreign wharf awaiting Customs clearance.  
Should our exports experience such a delay and our competitors not, we could be at a considerable trading disadvantage.

“The measures in this Bill are designed to ensure that all of our export ports, from Auckland to Bluff are able to meet the requirements of the United States and the other countries that will follow with their own security requirements, thus ensuring that there is no disruption of shipping from our sea ports. Regional issues and regional economies have been very much at the centre of thinking about the structure for New Zealand’s response to container security.

“Future-proofing is another key component. There is little doubt that other countries will tighten their border controls and follow the lead of the United States, requiring confidence about the security of the exports into their country. We need to ensure that we best place ourselves to meet these future requirements as best we are able to determine what they will be”.

Mr Barker said that New Zealand enjoyed a global image as clean, green and secure. “We must do everything we can to maintain our safe reputation, particularly in the changed world environment.”

Mr Barker said the Bill would enhance the powers of New Zealand Customs Service staff in several key areas. In particular, the proposed legislation strengthens controls around people, their cash and their tainted property when crossing New Zealand’s border illegally and undeclared.

“It will help to reduce New Zealand’s exposure to risk from transnational crime and terrorism while at the same time maintaining the high flows of trade and travel vital to New Zealand’s economy.”

Mr Barker said the Border Security Bill would enhance New Zealand’s overall security for the benefit of everyone. Overall, 14 government agencies were involved in that process.

“This legislation must be passed to cement New Zealand’s position in the united world movement against terrorism and trans-national crime. We simply cannot allow our country to be identified as a safe haven for terrorists, transnational criminals and their activities,” Mr Barker said.
