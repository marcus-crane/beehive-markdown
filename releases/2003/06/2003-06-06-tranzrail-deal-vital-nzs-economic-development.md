"New Zealand’s future success in the critical economic, industry and regional development areas are the reasons behind the Coalition Government’s announcement today to buy the rail network for $1, and take a 35 per cent stake in Tranzrail”, said Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development and Progressive leader Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton has played an important role in the Ad Hoc Ministerial committee that has considered the issue along with Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Transport Minister Paul Swain.

“Regions need strong transport networks and the continued presence of rail is vital to assist regional growth and development,” says Jim Anderton.

“Both short and long term considerations will require an integrated transport approach involving rail, sea and road options.

“This decision will allow the government to have a role in ensuring that transport solutions involving rail can be applied to Northland and the East Coast to cope with the upcoming wall of wood, and the South Island Midland line to ensure coal mined on the West Coast can be exported and shipped to the North Island for electricity generation.

“The Progressive Party committed itself during the election campaign to adequate infrastructure for all New Zealand communities and the inclusion of rail as an integral part of a balanced transport strategy and today’s step is part of delivering on that policy,” said Progressive leader Jim Anderton.
