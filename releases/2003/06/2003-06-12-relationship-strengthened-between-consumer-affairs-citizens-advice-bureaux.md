Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard and Nevill Wilson, President of New Zealand Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, signed a Memorandum of Understanding today that reaffirms and strengthens the relationship between the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Bureaux.

“I am very pleased to be signing this agreement on behalf of the Ministry. It recognises that we have the common goal of helping consumers, and that a collaborative approach to that goal is the best way forward,” said Judith Tizard.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Citizens Advice Bureaux have for many years worked closely to provide information and advice to consumers on a wide range of issues.

“The Memorandum of Understanding acknowledges the close and productive working relationship that exists between the two organisations and clearly sets out what each organisation expects of the other.”

The agreement recognises the commitment the Ministry and the NZACAB have to ensuring good communication and support mechanisms exist between both organisations, which in turn benefits consumers. It also sets the minimum standard of service that local CABs can expect from the Ministry’s Consumer Information Service.

“With the new motor vehicle sales law and one on consumer credit in the pipeline, it is important that the Ministry is able to support key organisations like CAB who will often be a first point of contact for consumers wanting to know their rights. This document provides assurance that we both take our roles in that regard very seriously.

“I want to publicly thank Nevill Wilson and Nick Toonan, NZACAB Chief Executive, for their work, and all the CAB volunteers who provide advice and assistance to consumers throughout New Zealand. The signing of this agreement signifies another step in government and community organisations working together for the benefit of consumers,” said Judith Tizard.
