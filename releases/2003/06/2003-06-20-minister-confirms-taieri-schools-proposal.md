Education Minister Trevor Mallard today confirmed his original proposal for the review of schools in Mosgiel and the wider Taieri area will stand, unlocking an extra $9 million for education of local children.

“I believe we have sought the best advice possible from schools and their communities and I’ve been impressed with the depth and amount of their feedback. However I still firmly believe that the initial proposal is the best way forward to consolidate and strengthen education in the area.

“We need to take steps to ensure we can provide our children with a high standard of education now and for the foreseeable future. We also need to make sure we are spending money on teaching children, and not on maintaining unnecessary buildings,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Savings made as a result of the review will be ploughed back into schools. An extra $3.5 million in operational resources, $1 million for joint education initiatives, and another $4.5 million that will be available for capital works will be unlocked if this proposal goes ahead. This is in addition to the $2 million that schools in the area are currently entitled to under their five-year property plans.”

Trevor Mallard said his firm preferences under the review are:  
·The merger of Taieri High School and Mosgiel Intermediate School, with the Mosgiel Intermediate Board governing the new school;  
·The merger of Arthur Burns, Reid Park and North Taieri Schools on the present Mosgiel Intermediate site as a contributing primary school with the Arthur Burns Board governing the new school;  
·The merger of Melville Park, Mosgiel West and Wyllies Crossing Schools on the Mosgiel West site as a contributing school with the Mosgiel West Board governing the new school;

·The merger of East Taieri and Allanton Schools on the East Taieri site as a contributing school with the East Taieri Board governing the new school;

·The merger of Henley, Momona and Outram Schools as a full primary school on the Outram site with the Outram Board governing the new school;

·The retention of Lee Stream and Waihola Districts Schools on their present sites as full primary schools.  
In addition Trevor Mallard has asked the Ministry of Education to work with the Dunedin City Council to address concerns raised over the safety issue relating to Factory Road.  
“Some schools including Reid Park School also have innovative social service programmes and good relationships with their communities,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The ministry will place an emphasis on the maintenance and development of these programmes and relationships during the transition.

“The changes are expected to be effective from the start of the 2004 school year. If the building changes take longer, then the current sites will continue to be used for a short time if necessary. The appointments of staff and principals will continue under the usual merger processes,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard expects to make his final decisions in mid July after further consultation with the schools involved. The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
