Students on New Zealand’s first pilot police trainee scheme graduated today from Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT).

Police Minister George Hawkins presented several of the 90-strong course’s top students with certificates today at a graduation ceremony at the Institute’s marae, Nga Kete Wananga.

The students, aged between 17 and 22 years and from around the country, funded themselves to attend the MIT’s 18-week School of Foundation Studies course with the aim of applying for selection as a police recruit.

Their selection would depend on their final assessment results due next week and the results of a five-day field placement with police beginning this Sunday. A final assessment is expected to be made on or around 14 July.

“If accepted the students will be required to complete the usual 19-week police training course at Porirua Police College,” Mr Hawkins said.

It was the first time Police had taken advantage of such a course to train would-be recruits. New Zealand law, cultural diversity, research, communication, study and interpersonal skills as well as applied mathematics were among subjects covered.

Students had also worked on their personal fitness, completed defensive driving and first aid courses and undertaken police-organised vacation placements.

Mr Hawkins, who visited the students several times during the course, said it was amazing to see the students become increasingly confident during the course.

“That they have made the most of this opportunity is a credit to them and their determination. Even if they decide police is not the career for them, it is obvious that have gained immensely from the experience, “ he said.

Police would take some time to assess the course and no decision had been on similar courses being held.
