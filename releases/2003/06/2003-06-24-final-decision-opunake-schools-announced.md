Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Opunake area, a move that will unlock nearly $3.5 million in extra resources for the education of local students.

“I have been impressed with the level and depth of the advice we have received and would like to thank all those involved in this project,” Trevor Mallard said.

“As a result of the feedback from the consultation process I have asked the Ministry of Education to work with schools to address concerns over the provision of technology education, to ensure that Opunake High School remains the main provider.

“I look forward to Opunake students having access to quality education now and in the future and enjoying the benefits of the operational resources released to individual schools.

“Using current estimates, $1.4 million in operational funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements. There will be a fund of $350,000 for schools to use jointly, and $1.7 million of extra property funding will be available,” Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
·The retention of Pungarehu, Kapuni, and Kaponga Schools pending further reviews of schools network provision in the Northern and Eastern areas of the Opunake district;  
·The retention of Rahotu and Opunake High Schools and Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Tamarongo;  
·The merger of Oaonui and Opunake Primary Schools on the Opunake site with Opunake being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Riverlea, Te Kiri and Pihama Schools with Auroa School on the Auroa School site with Auroa School being the continuing school.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
