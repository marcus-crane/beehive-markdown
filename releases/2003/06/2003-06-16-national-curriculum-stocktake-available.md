The results of a three-year stocktake of the New Zealand curriculum are now available, the Associate Minister of Education, Marian Hobbs announced today.

The study examined the quality, manageability and appropriateness of the curriculum and canvassed a wide range of sources including two international critiques, international and national assessment data, 4000 teachers, meetings with a range of groups, a literature review and submissions.

Among the findings are that the Curriculum:  
·has generally sound structure and expectations;  
·needs to continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of New Zealand students;  
·sets similar expectations to curricula in other OECD countries; and  
·needs to address the ‘unacceptably wide’ disparity in achievement of New Zealand students across all learning areas.

Waikato University researched the experiences of teachers in a 10% national sample of schools, which represents the clearest and most accurate snapshot of teachers’ opinion ever recorded in this country, Marian Hobbs said.

The findings of the Curriculum Stocktake report indicate that  
·Quality teaching makes more difference to student outcomes than any other factor.  
·A renewed focus on quality teaching and empowering schools to meet the needs of all students is called for.  
·The current curriculum be modified to ensure a clearer focus on high expectations for all New Zealand students, and to provide better support for teachers and schools to help students achieve these expectations.

Marian Hobbs said there will be no curriculum changes in schools until well after 2006. Teachers will be involved before a draft revised curriculum is published in 2005.
