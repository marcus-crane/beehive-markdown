Mr Speaker, I move that the Industry New Zealand/ Trade New Zealand Integration Bill be now read a second time.

When passed this Bill will create a one stop shop for economic development and trade promotion.

We are creating this new organisation to integrate the services currently provided by Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand with the aim of making those services as seamless and responsive as possible.

This Coalition government decided early on that it had a smart and active role to play in the economy. The work done by Industry New Zealand and and the Ministry of Economic Development in our regions, the partnerships started with business, communities and local government, with unions, industries, Maori and Pacific peoples are starting to make a real difference.

This new agency establishes a new economic development entity, bringing together Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand.

This legislation will bring together and build on Trade New Zealand’s experience both internationally and in New Zealand export sectors, as well as Industry New Zealand’s experience in working with investors, business and the regions.

This bill is evidence of a Government that listens to business.

In my many regional development visits up and down New Zealand I have met hundreds of businesses and business people who wanted to know why there wasn’t a one stop shop for business advice.

They wanted to see the advice and support which they needed for their growth and development, for increased investment and for export opportunities all integrated into one service.

The Wellington Chamber of Commerce and other business organisations also called for a one stop shop.

During the election the Progressive Party committed to this one organisation approach during this term of office.

I am pleased to announce that the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise entity outlined in this Bill delivers on this commitment.

The purpose of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will be to support the development of internationally competitive New Zealand business.

This role has been very carefully chosen.

Recent consultation with business groups on the aims and objectives of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has shown wide ranging support. This provides a strong platform for the partnerships needed to stimulate business innovation and enterprise.

Every New Zealand business needs to strive to be internationally competitive regardless of whether it has a domestic focus or it is already trading internationally. We clearly need to raise business performance across the whole economy.

Various submissions raised issues at the select committee and these have been given careful consideration.

I hope we will receive New Zealand First support for this bill. In the last term of Government the member for Tauranga spoke in favour of the first bill to create Industry New Zealand, noting that prosperity is dependent upon high sustainable economic growth, and it is dependent upon a sound, wise partnership, which is seen in every other First-World economy.

Trade and Enterprise New Zealand will support the Government’s commitment to developing our economy through innovation and working with key industries which can drive economic growth.

This organisation will deal with businesses across a wide range of areas.

These will include direct development needs of individual businesses and clusters of businesses, industry sectors as well as barriers to growth, by developing individual sectoral and regional strategies, and through initiatives which improve the business and enterprise culture in New Zealand.

The decision to merge Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand will send a strong message to business.

The message is we want you to succeed.

We want you to do better so that New Zealand can do better.

We want to see more innovation, stronger businesses and stronger regions all leading to long term sustainable, high quality jobs.

Mr Speaker, New Zealanders will expect nothing less of this House.
