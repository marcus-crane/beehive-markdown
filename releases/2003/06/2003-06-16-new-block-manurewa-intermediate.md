The Prime Minister Helen Clark has opened a new $2.1m facilities block at Manurewa Intermediate.

The new facility, including the George Hawkins Auditorium, staff room and administration area, was opened last Friday.

Mr Hawkins, as well as Youth Affairs Minister John Tamihere, attended the opening which included most of the school’s 872 pupils, 55 teachers and support staff, members of the Board of Trustees , invited guests, parents, caregivers and friends of the school.

They were entertained by ‘outstanding’ cultural performances by the school’s pupils, Mr Hawkins said.

Having the Auditorium named after him was an honour and also a surprise, he said.

“I really didn’t know the Auditorium had that name until I got to the school on the day,” he said. The facility was equal to any in the Auckland area, and would be a real asset to everyone in the community.

The Auditorium can seat 1450 people and will be used for everything from school assemblies, to cultural and musical performances and exhibitions.

The new facility was designed by architects Colin Pauling Associates, built by Greg Chapman Builders and project managed by Colin Tunnicliffe.
