Minister of Tourism, Hon Mark Burton today launched Towards 2010 – Implementing the New Zealand Tourism Strategy, a publication celebrating the tourism sector’s significant progress made in the last two years in implementing the the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

“The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 was released in 2001 and provides a blueprint for the tourism sector. Two years on, it is time to reflect on how much work has gone into bringing the Strategy to life. Towards 2010 – Implementing the New Zealand Tourism Strategy, records the tourism industry and government projects which have contributed to the implementation of the Strategy,” Mark Burton said.

Speaking from Tourism Rendez-vous New Zealand (TRENZ) in Auckland, the Minister emphasised that the strong partnerships that were built during the development of the Strategy and since, have been the key to the impressive progress.

“Although tourism in New Zealand in the last two years has experienced a period of unparalleled growth, this is not the time to rest on our laurels. A mature industry makes use of the good times to strengthen business foundations for the future. That is why Towards 2010 focuses not only on achievements, but also on challenges laid down in the Tourism Strategy which are yet to be tackled.

“The publication “Towards 2010: Implementing the New Zealand Tourism Strategy” outlines the key progress that the public and private sectors have made in implementing the Strategy.

“The Government is pleased to have the tourism sector as a strong partner to work with as we continue our commitment to the Strategy.”

Mark Burton congratulated the tourism industry on its strongest ever results, with more visitors coming to New Zealand, staying longer and spending more. He encouraged TRENZ to participants to look at the booklet for a full account of what the industry has achieved so far, and where it is heading in the future.

“The progress documented in this publication shows the sector is well on its way to achieving the vision of the Strategy of an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable tourism sector” he said.
