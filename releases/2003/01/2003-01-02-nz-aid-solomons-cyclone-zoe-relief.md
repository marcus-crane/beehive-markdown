The Government is providing $70,000 to pay for a chartered boat to get emergency food and medical supplies to the cyclone-ravaged islands in the Solomons, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“After discussions with the Minister in charge of overseas development and aid, Marian Hobbs, New Zealand will cover the cost of the charter which is scheduled to leave from Honiara tomorrow. The Australian Government is contributing a similar amount to pay for medical and relief supplies.

“This is an initial contribution from New Zealand. Our High Commission in Honiara and NZAID officials are exploring other avenues to provide assistance.

“New Zealand is working with the Solomons Government and Australia in coordinating getting relief to those affected by Cyclone Zoe.

“The chartered vessel, the Isabella, will also be carrying Red Cross and World Vision personnel who will be able to provide medical assistance.

“The charter will travel to the islands of Tikopia, Anuta and Fataka which are in the Santa Cruz group.

“Cyclone Zoe is one of the most intense to have hit the Pacific with winds of up to 350 kmh and will have had a devastating effect on the homes and crops of the local population. We will continue to get assessments on what further assistance will be required,” Mr Goff said.
