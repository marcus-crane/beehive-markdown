Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says that says “moderately positive” growth is likely to come from key sectors of the region’s economy such as retailing, health, education and community and personal services. However it is expected that the East Coast regional economy will slow in 2003 following very strong growth in 2002. This is due to an expected deterioration in export fortunes, in line with economic forecasts for most of the rest of the country.

Key indicators such as consumer and business confidence surveys are mixed but broadly support the positive, but weaker, outlook for the regional economy. Confidence indicators for the East Coast region show good levels of optimism among consumers about the economic outlook and among firms about their own activity, although business confidence is now steeply negative. This supports an outlook of moderate growth over the next year, down from the strong growth of the past year. In particular, firms in Hawkes Bay are pessimistic about general business conditions due to concerns over the rising New Zealand dollar, lower commodity prices, higher interest rates and doubts about the recovery in the world economy.

The regional East Coast economy performed very well over the past year. Latest economic indicators suggest that in the year to September 2002, the Gisborne economy grew by a very strong 5.4 percent, the highest growth of all the regions, and the Hawkes Bay economy grew by 3.5 percent, just below the national rate of growth. Key sectors in the region include agriculture, forestry, manufacturing (mainly primary processing) retail trade, health and education.

Labour Market Outlook  
In line with predictions of moderate but slowing economic growth, the East Coast labour market is expected to weaken over the coming year. Growth in labour demand is already weak, leading to projections that job creation will remain static or decline in 2003. Supporting this outlook, intentions to increase staff numbers among firms are negative and the growth in job advertisements has recently weakened.

The annual unemployment rate in the East Coast area is expected to rise slightly over the next year as a result of more people being available to move into work. There was a steep fall in the number of people receiving the unemployment beneficiaries in 2002, but as labour market conditions weaken in the coming year the number of unemployment beneficiaries is expected to remain steady or possibly show a slight rise.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all.
