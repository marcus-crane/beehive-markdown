Health Minister Annette King says National Party Rangitikei MP Simon Power is talking utter drivel about Government spin doctors.

Ms King, acting as duty Minister, was commenting on a media release by Mr Power in which he alleged the Government spent more than $14 million on spin doctors in the 17 months to November last year.

“The media release was clearly written by his own ill-informed spin doctor,” said Ms King. “Most of the people he refers to are actually state servants. They are not employed by the Labour Government.

“If Mr Power represents the new breed of National Party politician, then he bears an uncanny resemblance to the tired old breed.

“Last year, total Government spending amounted to $37.97 billion over 12 months, so $14 million over 17 months is a mere trickle.

“The figures are manipulated anyway. Many of the communications staff employed by Government Departments and Agencies are involved in internal communications, preparing publications, and other roles that don’t involve media relations. The same situation existed under the National Government.”

Ms King said the communications staff Mr Power refers to are employed in every Government organisation from the National Library to the Land Transport Safety Authority to the Public Trust.

“Does Mr Power suggest there should be no public health messages, or messages telling people not to drink and drive?”
