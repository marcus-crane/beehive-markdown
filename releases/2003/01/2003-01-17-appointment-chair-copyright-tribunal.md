Associate Minister of Commerce Judith Tizard today announced the appointment of Judge David Harvey of Auckland as Chair of the Copyright Tribunal for a five-year term.

“I am delighted Judge Harvey has agreed to serve as Chair of the Tribunal. He brings an impressive range of skills and experience to the position,” said Judith Tizard. “Judge Harvey’s legal background and knowledge of the impact of technology on copyright issues gives him excellent credentials to lead the Copyright Tribunal.”

During 1996 he was a Visiting Judicial Fellow of the Faculty of Law at the University of Auckland. Since 2001 he has been a part-time lecturer in Law and Information Technology. During 2002 Judge Harvey has sat on the Editorial Board of Butterworths Technology Law Forum.
