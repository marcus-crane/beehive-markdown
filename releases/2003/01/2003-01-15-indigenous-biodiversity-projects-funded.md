The first distribution of funding to improve indigenous biodiversity on private land was announced today by the Ministers for the Environment and Conservation, Marian Hobbs and Chris Carter, as part of the continuing implementation of the NZ Biodiversity Strategy.

A total of $625,000 would be spent on a range of projects approved by the Chief Executives of the Environment Ministry and Conservation Department.

The next funding round will have almost four times as much -- $2.3m. Applications will open shortly.

There are two funds - one for condition improvement and the other for advisory services.

"The government is very keen to support private landowners to protect the native plants and animals on their land," the ministers said.

"The allocation of this money is a first step in increasing that support.  
"We were keen to distribute the money as soon as possible. Biodiversity agencies with the experience and capability to proceed with funding bids were asked for proposals at very short notice.

"They responded admirably and we are very pleased that finally the money is going to the people who can arrest the decline in New Zealand's natural environment."

The projects funded include:

1)Pest and weed control on a range of high priority QEII covenants (QEII National Trust)

2)Expansion of a nationwide web-based information/ advisory service (NZERN)

3)Support for regional biodiversity fora in Northland, Auckland, Gisborne, Wanganui/Manawatu, Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury, Bay of Plenty, West Coast, Tasman (NZ Landcare Trust)

The Northland Biodiversity Enhancement Group will receive $29,168 of advisory service funding. The project will involve developing a ‘Self Help Tool Kit’ for Northland landowners who want to enhance biodiversity on their land. The kit will enable landowners to develop and implement their own management plans. The kit will assist landowners with carrying out effective integrated biodiversity protection, including pest control and habitat enhancement.

Northland and Bay Of Plenty, Workshops and Field Days – Advisory Service Funding

The NZ Landcare Trust will receive $11,025 of advisory service funding to organise and convene three public field days (two in Northland and one in the Bay of Plenty) and one target trapper workshop (in Northland). The workshops will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and ideas between landowners and ‘experts’ on these topics.

Coromandel, Moehau Environmental Group - Advisory Service Funding

The Moehau Environment Group in partnership with the NZ Landcare Trust will receive $26,145 of advisory service funding. The project will develop a ‘whole of community’ long-term co-ordinated pest control and biodiversity restoration on private land programme over the northern Coromandel Peninsula. This will result in the protection and restoration of significant biodiversity.

The funding will assist with local facilitation, co-ordination and advice (with other agencies) to get rural landowners involved effectively in the Moehau project.

Rotorua, Te Papa A Ruamoa Project - Condition Improvement Funding

Nga Whenua Rahui will receive $60,000 of condition funding to protect a nationally significant and extremely rare thermal wetland at Te Papa A Ruamoa. The site is on Maori owned land and is adjacent to the south-eastern edge of Lake Rotorua.

Sinter flats, steam vents, mud pools, hot pools and thermal wetlands are significant features of the block. The project will involve fencing scrublands, and revegetation and weed control of the wetland. There are also significant cultural values in need of protection within the block. Funding will be conditional on the site being protected. Te Papa A Ruamoa Trustees manage the block for the Hurungaterangi Hapu.

Gisborne, Pohaturoa Trust - Condition Improvement Funding

Nga Whenua Rahui will receive $46,500 of condition funding for a possum control programme on 990 hectares of land at Pohaturoa, southwest of Gisborne.

The site is one of the largest Maori owned indigenous forest in Ngati Kahungunu and has great cultural and historical significance to the local and wider Maori community. The area of indigenous bush is sited on the southwest slopes of Mount Whakapunake and is part of a ‘Recommended Area for Protection’. It encompasses a range of significant ecological and geological/landscape values. This includes tall forest extending over a wide altitudinal range of 200-961m, extensive areas of regenerating scrub, and a limestone bluff/cliff system. The area also provides important wildlife habitat, particularly for both rare and common birds.

Waikato, Biodiversity Advice Waikato – Advisory Services Funding

Environment Waikato on behalf of the Waikato Biodiversity Forum will receive $110,000 of advisory service funding. The service will meet the regional need for a co-ordinated ‘gateway’ response for Biodiversity information to landowners. It will consist of a toll free number and a website. The operator/s will answer basic questions, send out published information and refer people to appropriate expertise and services. Volunteers will be trained to provide one on one advice and site visits. The service will be based in the Hamilton Environment Centre. It is supported by a coalition of agencies and interested stakeholders.

Tasman Biodiversity Advisory Service - Advisory Service Funding

Tasman District Council will receive $47,531 to support the Tasman District Biodiversity Advisory Service.

The project will involve contracting biodiversity advisors to advise private land managers in the district on the biodiversity values associated with their land. They will also advise on the management options for protecting and enhancing these values. Land managers with high biodiversity values on their land will be targeted. The project is part of a comprehensive package of measures agreed to by the Tasman Natural Areas Enhancement Group. The project is based on a successful recent trial.

Banks Peninsula Condition & Advice - Condition Improvement And Advisory Service Funding

The Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust in partnership with the NZ Landcare Trust will receive $29,318 of advisory service funding, and $30,000 of condition funding.

The advisory services will identify ways that indigenous biodiversity can be integrated into the farm landscape. It will engage farmers and help them to implement these methods. The two organisations have been work in partnership since the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust was set up in 2001.

Condition funding will assist with pest control, fencing and the surveying of covenants for the protection of eight sites, ranging from six to 75 hectares. A total of more than 181 hectares will be protected. The sites are all identified as ‘Significant Natural Areas’ and are remnants of original indigenous bush containing endemic plants - in some cases rare. Condition funding is subject to the sites being legally protected.

Southland, Sherwood Forest Restoration - Condition Improvement Funding

Environment Southland on behalf of the Regional Biodiversity Coordination Group will receive $15,700 of condition funding for restoration of Sherwood Forest.

The project will restore matai dominant podocarp forest, riparian kowhai/ribbonwood forest and aquatic habitat in associated waterways. This site contains the best remaining examples of these threatened ecosystem types in private ownership on the Southland Plains. The principle focus will be weed control and waterway restoration to help repair damage caused by severe frosts in 1996 and to encourage natural regeneration. Sherwood Forest will provide an exemplar for biodiversity protection on private land in Central Southland.

Nation-Wide Projects

QEII Covenants, Weed And Pest Management - Condition Improvement Funding

Queen Elizabeth II National Trust will receive $79,800 of condition funding for weed and pest control of up to 100 sites under QEII Open Space Covenants nation-wide.

The Trust has registered 1,659 Open Space Covenants protecting 60,112 hectares. Most of the covenanted sites have rare biodiversity values and are located in developed landscapes where there is a high presence of weeds. The project will implement a concentrated weed and pest control programme by the existing QEII National Trust Regional Representatives, and with the support of Landowners and associated Councils. Sites with significant weed and pest issues will be targeted. The project will improve the values and integrity of the QEII covenant system by ensuring greater physical protection and natural regeneration of biodiversity.

Developing Biodiversity Fora - Advisory Service Funding

The New Zealand Landcare Trust will receive $20,318 of advisory service funding to support and develop regional biodiversity fora. It will contribute to the support and coordination of four existing fora, and will investigate the feasibility of initiating regional biodiversity fora in six other regions.
