Prime Minister Helen Clark today paid tribute to the late Sir John Turei who passed away this weekend in Auckland.

Helen Clark said Sir John had given outstanding leadership to Maoridom over a long life of full engagement with the community.

“Sir John returned from World War Two, where he was part of the campaigns in Egypt and Italy, to begin a new life in Auckland in the mid 1940s.

“He was involved not only with his own people, Tuhoe, but also on behalf of Maori throughout the city.

“He was a well known resident of Blockhouse Bay, an advisor to the Department of Social Welfare, and kaumatua at Unitech, formerly known as Carrington Polytechnic.

“Sir John served on the Waitangi Tribunal and has been a prominent representative of Maori both nationally and overseas.

“I personally first met Sir John over three decades ago. To all who knew him, he was a kind and courteous man who always made himself available to help and advise on Maori issues.

“He will be sadly missed,” Helen Clark said.
