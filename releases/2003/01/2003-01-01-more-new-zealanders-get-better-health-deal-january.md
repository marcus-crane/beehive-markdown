Health Minister Annette King says nearly half a million New Zealanders will get a broader range of primary health care services, many of them more cheaply, from January 1.

Ms King said she welcomed the announcement that six more Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) were coming into effect from January 1.

"I am delighted to start the new year in health with such good news for so many New Zealanders. I am equally delighted that we are now getting such good traction on implementing the Primary Health Care strategy, which offers us our best chance in decades to make more New Zealanders more healthy."

Ms King said the new PHOs include three in the greater Auckland area (two in South Auckland and one in West Auckland), one each in Hawke's Bay, Waikato, and Turangi-Taupo.

"Their establishment means another 496,000 New Zealanders will be able to get a broader range of primary health care services, many of them at a far lower cost ranging from free to $15 during normal working hours. The lower cost visits for those enrolled with PHOs funded on the Access formula are in addition to the 78,000-odd people already getting free or low cost primary health care through PHOs established in 2002.

"I congratulate the new PHOs for embracing this opportunity to make primary health care more accessible, and the District Health Boards who have worked with them to make this happen," she said.

"Our priority has always been to bring cheaper primary health care to those New Zealanders with the greatest health needs first. The costs of seeing a doctor has in the past been a very real deterrent to many people, and this of course shows when they turn up at hospital very sick."

Four of the six new PHOs - Wairoa, Otara, Turangi-Taupo, and parts of the Waikato PHO - will be funded on the Access formula, which allows them to offer considerably cheaper visits. All existing PHOs apart from that on the West Coast of the South Island are funded this way.

The West Coast, Procare South and Health West (West Auckland) are funded on the interim formula. Over time funding through the interim formula will increase until all New Zealanders have access to low cost primary health care.  
"In the meantime, recognising doctors' concerns that some patients enrolled with interim formula PHOs may still have high health needs and need to see a doctor frequently, I have agreed to an interim formula trial, giving two of the new PHOs extra funding to lower costs for priority patients.

"Procare South and West Health will be getting additional money in this trial. While details of how we use it to benefit patients are still being finalised we expect each priority patient will get a defined number of low cost visits to better plan and manage their illness."

Ms King said she was delighted with the feedback she has received from existing PHOs. "Overall I believe we are getting very good results from the extra money we have invested in primary health care."

Questions and Answers

What is primary health care?  
Primary health care covers a broad range of out-of-hospital services, although not all of them are Government funded. It aims to improve the health of the people in communities by working with them through health improvement and preventative services, such as health education and counselling, disease prevention and screening.

Primary health care includes first level services such as general practice services, mobile nursing services and community health services targeted especially for certain conditions, for example maternity, family planning and sexual health services, mental health services and dentistry, or those using particular therapies such as physiotherapy, chiropractic and osteopathy services.

Chronic diseases, such as diabetes are best managed by primary health care services so that complications can be prevented or mitigated.

What is the Primary Health Care Strategy?  
The Primary Health Care Strategy was launched in February 2001 by Health Minister Annette King. It builds on the population health focus and the objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy and the New Zealand Disability Strategy and outlines how a different approach to primary health care will improve the health of all New Zealanders through:  
·a greater emphasis on population health, health promotion and preventative care  
·community involvement  
·involving a range of professionals and encouraging multidisciplinary approaches to decision-making  
·improving accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of services  
·improving co-ordination and continuity of care  
·providing and funding services according to the population's needs as opposed to fee for services when people are unwell.

What is a Primary Health Organisation (PHO)?  
PHOs are the local provider organisations through which District Health Boards (DHBs) will implement the Primary Health Care Strategy. The essential features of PHOs are set out in the Minimum Requirements released by the Health Minister in November 2001:  
·PHOs will aim to improve and maintain the health of their populations and restore people's health when they are unwell. They will provide at least a minimum set of essential population-based and personal first-line general practice services  
·PHOs will be required to work with those groups in their populations (for example, Maori, Pacific and lower income groups) that have poor health or are missing out on services to address their needs  
·PHOs must demonstrate that they are working with other providers within their regions to ensure that services are co-ordinated around the needs of their enrolled populations  
·PHOs will receive most of their funding through a population needs-based formula (capitation)  
·PHOs will enrol people through primary providers using consistent standards and rules  
·PHOs must demonstrate that their communities, iwi and consumers are involved in their governing processes and that the PHO is responsive to its community  
·PHOs must demonstrate how all their providers and practitioners can influence the organisation's decision-making  
·PHOs are to be not-for-profit bodies with full and open accountability for the use of public funds and the quality and effectiveness of services.

What is the Government's high-level direction for the Primary Health Care Strategy?  
The agreed high-level direction is as follows:  
·Subject to the availability of funding, the public share of primary health care funding will be substantially increased over the next 8-10 years  
·Over time, as PHOs are formed, they will be funded according to the needs of their enrolled populations to provide more effective and affordable care with a population health focus  
·As this happens, reliance on the Community Services Card (CSC) will be progressively reduced  
·As the CSC will still be needed for a number of years, measures will be implemented to improve its take-up in the meantime.

What funding is available for the Primary Health Care Strategy?  
The Government has committed just over $400 million over three years to begin implementing the Primary Health Care Strategy.

Where has the new funding been directed?  
The Government's priorities for the new primary health care funding (in order of priority) are:  
1\. High needs populations: Extra funding will be made available to PHOs covering very deprived populations in order for them to have low fees for all their patients, provide services to ensure care gets to where it is most needed, include services to improve and maintain health as well as restore  
health, and to move to fairer funding allocations on a population needs basis.  
2\. Adjust subsidy for children under 6: The General Medical Services subsidy for children under six years was adjusted in July for inflation since  
1997\.  
3\. Progressively lower cost of access to primary health care: As more funding becomes available from 2003/04, it will start to be applied to extend free or low cost access to primary health care services through PHOs. The priorities will be reducing costs for school-age children followed by the elderly and others with high health needs.  
4\. Sustainable rural services: Measures have been introduced to help implement the Primary Health Care Strategy in rural areas and to retain and recruit the rural health care workforce.  
5.PHOs across the country: Primary Health Organisations are being encouraged to set up across the country; they will be funded according to their enrolled population to provide a range of population based services to improve and maintain health as well as treatment services; and to address  
health inequalities.  
6\. Improvements to CSC and HUHC: A range of measures will be introduced to improve take-up of Community Services Cards until such time as increased funding means cards are no longer needed. Improvements to the High User Health Card will also be implemented.

How are PHOs being established?  
A small amount ($3m-$4m) has been made available to help get PHOs established.

What will happen to the Community Services Card?  
The Community Services Card will be phased out over the next 8-10 years. As it will still be needed by many people over the medium term, improvements will be made to make it more effective. Improvements will include measures to:  
·Increase the numbers of people who get the card automatically rather than having to apply  
·Simplify the process for low-income people to gain a card  
·Make it easier for providers to determine whether an individual has a card.

What initiatives are planned or underway to improve the take-up of the CSC?  
They include a greater promotion of the card, via Maori and Pacific Island networks, as well as employer and union representatives, streamlining the  
application process and greater automation of assessment of entitlement. The Ministry of Health is also continuing to fund a free telephone service for providers to verify patients' card status.

What about changes to General Medical Services subsidy (GMS)?  
The rate of subsidy for children under 6 increased from $32.50 per visit to $35 per visit from 1 July 2002. This accounts for inflation from 1 July 1997 to June 2002.

How are PHOs different from Independent Practitioner Associations?  
PHOs must meet a set of minimum requirements that do not apply to IPAs. Many IPAs would already meet some of these requirements but few would meet all of them at this stage. Several IPAs are considering making the changes necessary to become a PHO while others are supporting the establishment of PHOs locally.

When did the first PHOs begin operating?  
TaPasefika Health Trust and Te Kupenga O Hoturoa, in the Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) region, were established in July 2002.

When did the first PHOs begin operating?  
TaPasefika Health Trust and Te Kupenga O Hoturoa, in the Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) region, were established in July 2002.

How many PHOs are expected to be up and running soon?  
Nearly all the country's 21 DHBs have signalled they are likely to have at least one PHO established by early next year. As many as 1.7 million to two million New Zealanders could belong to PHOs by July next year.

What are the formulae that have been developed to fund PHOs?  
There are two: Access and Interim.

How will the Access formula work?  
It will allow all those enrolled with an Access PHO to be charged low patient fees, or access free care, and there will be no need to use CSCs. In the first instance, the Access formula will be available only for PHOs (or practices/clinics within PHOs) serving populations with high concentrations of NZ Deprivation Decile 9/10 and people with high health needs.

What about the Interim formula?  
Until there is enough funding for all PHOs to be on the Access formula, an Interim formula will apply to other PHOs/practices. The Interim formula  
will continue to use CSC status both for determining funding and setting patient fees. It includes additional funding for a range of new functions such as health promotion and extra services to improve access for high-need groups.

Over time, as funding allows, the per capita amounts in the Interim formula will be increased towards the levels in the Access formula. This will start in 2003/04 with increases for all school-age children, and for older people.

What are the key factors of the two formulae?  
Both the Access and Interim Formulae recognise ethnicity and deprivation, alongside age and sex, as key determinants of population need, and both  
provide increased funding for HUHC-holders. Weightings for ethnicity and deprivation will target extra funding to improve access for high need populations through services such as clinics on marae or employing community health workers. PHOs will need to satisfy their DHB on how the extra access funding will be used.

What alternative funding approaches have been proposed and why?  
Following concerns expressed by some GP groups two of the January PHOs are trialling an add-on to the Interim formula that will give extra funding for people with high health needs. 'Priority patients' are another high need group to be targeted for low cost access to primary health care in the transition to low cost access for all.

The key criterion is likely to be that the person is expected to need at least 2 hours of clinical contact time in the coming 6 months. This need for  
care might be indicated in a number of different ways including that the person is:  
·Suffering from 2 or more chronic illnesses  
·Has a track record of heavy utilisation of primary care (6 visits in the past 6 months to primary care or an Emergency Department)  
·Has a track record of acute hospital admissions (2 non-surgical acute admissions in the past year)  
·Has a terminal illness.

About 6 percent of the population will come into this category.

All 'priority patients' will have a care plan developed for them, including quarterly reviews to check on health status, treatment, medications and so on. The care will be able to be delivered flexibly, using GPs and other members of the PHO team. Capitated funding will facilitate that.

The priority patient concept is complementary to the Access formula in that it targets another high need group to have low patient fees in the transitional period. It is also a way of emphasising the importance of good management of chronic conditions, and implementing the agreed Cabinet priority to enhance the effectiveness of the HUHC.

How much will it cost New Zealanders to visit PHOs?  
All people enrolled with 'Access' PHOs will have low patient fees. Although charges will vary, many Access PHOs may be able to offer free care for  
children, and adults may pay in the order of $10-$15. Each Access PHO will agree maximum patient fees with its DHB.  
In 2003-04, patient fees for under-18s and over- 65s will start to be reduced for people enrolled with PHOs funded under the Interim formula.
