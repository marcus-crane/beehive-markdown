The rights of ACC claimants have been enshrined in a new code that comes into effect on 1 February 2003.

Launching the Code of ACC Claimants’ Rights at Parliament today, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said it spelt out ACC’s commitment to the highest practicable standard of service and fairness when dealing with claimants.

“The code contains eight claimants’ rights, including the right to be treated with dignity and respect, to be treated fairly and have their views considered, and to be fully informed.

“These rights are designed to meet claimants’ reasonable expectations every time they contact ACC, whether by phone, letter or face-to-face. Each right is accompanied by specific obligations on ACC to ensure the rights are met.”

Ruth Dyson said the code was designed to restore confidence in ACC, which had been weakened during the 1990s when the National Government slashed levies, removed lump sum payments and limited rehabilitation.

She said the spirit of the code was as important as the specific obligations.

“The whole future of ACC is about fairness – fairness in the administration and application of entitlements; fairness in dealing with people; a proactive attitude towards assisting them.

“A partnership between ACC and claimants, built on mutual trust, respect, understanding and participation, is critical if injured people are to make the best possible recovery.”

The code sets out a detailed complaints procedure, including a framework for resolving issues and concerns as they arise at the local level. At any point, a claimant can lodge a formal complaint that will be fully investigated.

When a breach of the code has occurred, the complaints service can direct ACC to undertake a number of remedies, including a written or oral apology, meeting with the claimant to resolve the issue, or providing interpretation services. If a claimant is not satisfied with the decision, they can seek an independent review.

Ruth Dyson said the code was in addition to all existing claimants’ rights, and covered the way ACC delivered services.

“The code is about claimants’ relationship with ACC. It does not cover decisions about cover and entitlements, compensation, or treatment for injury, which will continue to be dealt with under the provisions of the Injury Prevention Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001.”

Ms Dyson said the Privacy Commissioner and Office of the Ombudsmen could still be asked to investigate matters relating to ACC’s interaction with claimants after the code came into effect.

“However, I would like to think that the code, and the underlying commitment to build positive relationships, will help claimants to resolve difficulties with ACC without the need for outside intervention.”

The Code of ACC Claimants’ Rights as been developed as a requirement under section 44 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001. It comes into effect on 1 February 2003.
