Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says that robust domestic demand is expected to maintain a positive rate of economic growth in Northland in 2003. While the positive economic growth forecast for Northland will be welcome news for those living in the region, it also comes with a prediction that growth is unlikely to match the previous year’s performance.

A deterioration in exporting fortunes in the year ahead is behind the predicted fall in Northland’s economic growth from past performance, particularly in the large agricultural sector. The anticipated deterioration in Northland’s agricultural exporting fortunes throughout the coming year, in line with most of the rest of the country, will place reliance on other key areas of the local economy such as retailing, tourism, health and education to create positive growth.

Key confidence indicators such as consumer and business confidence surveys support a weaker but positive outlook for the Northland economy. While local firms are pessimistic about general business conditions firms are confident about their own businesses and consumer confidence remains solid. Investment intentions have also weakened but remain positive and both these indicators are consistent with at least a modest rise in regional economic activity during the first half of 2003.

Labour Market Outlook  
In line with the positive outlook for economic growth for Northland, the region is expected to show slowing but positive employment growth this year. Employment intentions among Northland firms have risen sharply, which should ensure that job growth evident recently throughout the region will be sustained in 2003. In the September 2002 quarter, a net 13.3 percent of Northland firms intended to increase employment over the next 12 months, down slightly on the 14.1 percent in the June 2002 quarter but up sharply from a net 2.8 percent in March.

The unemployment rate in the Northland area is tipped to rise slightly over the coming year as more people come into the region and boost the size of the local labour force. However the increase in the unemployment rate is predicted to be only small, as the increase in the number of people in the region looking for work will be only slightly larger than the number of new jobs being created. It is alos expected that the number of people on the unemployment benefit in the region will remain steady or possibly rise slightly.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. Northlanders can look forward to seeing the job growth cotinue, albeit at a slower rate, in 2003.
