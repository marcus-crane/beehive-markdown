Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says that there are signs that Waikato’s economic growth will remain positive although growth is likely to fall further below the national average.

Waikato businesses are pessimistic about the economic outlook, primarily reflecting their concerns over an expected decline in export returns in the year ahead. Firms’ confidence about their own activity in the year ahead is the lowest in the country, as are their investment intentions. However, on the positive side, Waikato’s economic growth is tipped to remain moderately positive due to a lift in domestic demand and driven mainly by the retail, construction, health and education sectors.

Labour Market Outlook  
Matching the slowdown in Waikato’s economic fortunes for the coming year, the region’s labour market is also expected to slow as the weaker regional economy results in low employment growth. However those looking for positive signs in the local labour market may be buoyed by the fact that while Waikato firms’ employment intentions are low compared to their counterparts in other parts of the country, they nonetheless remain positive and therefore suggest a small increase in jobs over the next year.

Waikato’s annual unemployment rate is forecast in the report to remain steady in 2003.

While Waikato’s economic forecast may not be as good as could be hoped for, the news isn’t all bad. According to the report, the anticipated slowdown follows a solid performance this year with economic growth in the Waikato regional economy marginally below the national average. Latest activity indicators suggest that Waikato’s economy grew by 3.7 percent in the year to September 2002, just below the national average of 3.8 percent.
