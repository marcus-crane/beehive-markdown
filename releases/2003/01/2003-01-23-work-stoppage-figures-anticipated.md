The latest work stoppage figures released by Statistics New Zealand are hardly surprising, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“While the work stoppage figures for the September 2002 quarter involve an increase from previous quarters, quarterly figures fluctuate as all data relating to each work stoppage is recorded in the quarter in which it ends, “she said.

“These latest quarterly figures include the teachers dispute. Media reports from the time of the stoppage suggested about 14,000 teachers were involved. If the teachers stoppage was removed from the equation this would leave fewer than 800 employees involved in other stoppages for the quarter.

Margaret Wilson said without the teachers stoppage, the figures would be similar to some of the lowest seen under the Employment Relations Act, and certainly below the averages seen under the Employment Contracts Act.
