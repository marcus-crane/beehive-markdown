Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says a lift in domestic demand coupled with high levels of consumer optimism are expected to maintain a moderately positive rate of economic growth throughout the region in 2003.

The positive economic growth forecast for Otago and Southland comes despite a predicted slowing overall of regional economic growth, in line with developments in the national economy, and resulting from an expected deterioration in exporting fortunes in the year ahead.

Over the past year the Southern regional economy has continued to perform well. Latest activity indicators suggest that both sub-regions showed strong economic growth over the year to September 2002 - 3.9 percent for Otago, a continuation of last year’s trends, and 4.9 percent for Southland, the second highest of all the regions, slightly below previous highs. Contributing to growth in 2003, the region’s key economic drivers include manufacturing (particularly non-commodity sectors), accommodation, cafes and restaurants and retailing.

Confidence indicators broadly support the weaker but positive outlook for the Southern economy. There are good levels of optimism among the region's consumers, but business confidence has fallen, favouring an outlook of moderate growth for 2003, down from the strong growth of 2002.

Labour Market Outlook  
A steady labour market outlook is forecast for the region in 2003, influenced by slow employment growth and a modest rise in the size of the labour force. While growth in labour demand is likely to weaken, employment should still rise slightly in 2003. Employer intentions to increase staff numbers and the level of job ads have declined but remained positive in late 2002  
.  
On the basis of the report’s outlook for the Southern labour market over the next 12 months, the number of unemployment beneficiaries throughout the region is expected to continue to fall.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. Otago and Southland can look forward to seeing further job growth in 2003.
