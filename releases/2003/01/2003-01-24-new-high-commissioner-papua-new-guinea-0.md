Laurie Markes is New Zealand's next High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Papua New Guinea is an important regional partner and the High Commissioner has a key role in maintaining and developing the relationship.

"Papua New Guinea is the largest Pacific Island country, a WTO and APEC member, and plays an important role in regional affairs.

"New Zealand has been closely involved along with other regional partners in  
re-establishing peace in Bougainville. The High Commissioner will oversee  
New Zealand’s involvement in the process of implementing the results of peace negotiations,” Mr Goff said.

Over the past 10 years, Laurie Markes has served as New Zealand's Ambassador in Tehran, Mexico and Riyadh. His other overseas assignments have been to Rome and New Delhi.

His work in Wellington has included being Director of Middle East and Africa Division, and Deputy Director of the Economic and European Divisions.

Mr Markes takes up his posting in March, replacing Chris Seed who is  
returning to Wellington.
