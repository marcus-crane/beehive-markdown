New Zealanders are innovative people with a will to succeed for themselves, their regions and their nation, says Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister, Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton today announced 50 Enterprise Awards totalling $603,127. The awards, to a maximum of $20,000, are made by Industry New Zealand to entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business seeking to develop an idea or a proposal. The grants meet a maximum of 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Jim Anderton said the Enterprise Awards are one of a number of measures the Labour Progressive Government has implemented to assist businesses.

“These awards are to help small businesses get off the ground or take the next step in their growth. Every small business that succeeds has a spin off for the families of the owners and staff and then for their local communities. This Labour Progressive Government is committed to work with business for the benefit all New Zealanders.

“I’d like to acknowledge the energy and innovation of New Zealanders, which is highlighted by those receiving the Enterprise Awards. There is a new sense of purpose in this country about achieving the Labour Progressive government’s goal of getting New Zealand’s economic growth rate back up to the top half of OECD country,” said Jim Anderton.

In total, 691 Enterprise Awards totalling $6.14 million have been made since they were introduced in October 2000.

Details attached of each of those receiving funding from the latest two rounds of Enterprise Awards.
