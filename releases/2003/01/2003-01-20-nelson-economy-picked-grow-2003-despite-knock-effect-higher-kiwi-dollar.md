Advice just received from the Department of Labour’s Labour Market Policy Group (LMPG), predicts a positive outlook for the Nelson economy in 2003. While the region is likely to suffer from a fall in commodity prices and the flow-on impact this will have on consumer spending and investment in the local economy, there are plenty of signs that growth will remain solid to strong.

Key primary sector industries such as agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, forestry, and seafood, as well as tourism, a mainstay of the Nelson economy, are expected to feel the impact of the strengthening Kiwi dollar, although individual firms throughout the region remain very positive about their own business for the coming 12 months.

Sectors predicted to do well in 2003 include Nelson’s forestry, farming, and seafood, tourism, arts, engineering and information technology industries. And while most firms in the region don’t believe that labour shortages, an ongoing issue for some businesses, will be a significant constraint for them, a shortage of suitable staff in the region is likely to constrain job growth throughout the year.

Nelson, with an official unemployment rate of 3.5 percent for the year to September 2002, has the lowest annual unemployment rate of New Zealand’s 12 main regions, well below the national rate of 5.3 percent for the year.

Positive spin-offs from the region’s expected solid economic growth in 2003, include unemployment and labour force participation rates (those who are either employed or who are not employed but are actively seeking and available for work) forecast to be amongst the best in the country. Local labour market conditions are expected to benefit from Nelson’s solid economic growth during 2003, with job growth likely to continue at a moderate pace and a slight reduction in the number receiving the unemployment benefit.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. The Nelson region can look forward to seeing the job growth we have seen in recent years continuing in 2003.
