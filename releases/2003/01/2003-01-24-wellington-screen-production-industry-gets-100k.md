Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development Jim Anderton says ensuring the long term success of the screen production industry in the Wellington region has received a boost with Industry New Zealand’s support.

The Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency (REDA) has received $100,000 under Industry New Zealand’s Regional Partnership Programme to undertake a capability assessment of the infrastructure of the region’s screen production industry.

“Over the past six years Wellington’s film reputation has gone from strength to strength, particularly with the production of the Lord of the Rings.

“Wellington has led the way in trying to address the barriers and issues facing the industry. In addition to establishing a film and television cluster, the Wellington City Council has implemented a number of initiatives including a film friendly policy and established New Zealand's first open all hours film office.

“REDA will be able to carry out a more detailed analysis of the sector and its economic benefits to the region as the creative sector has been identified as a major driver of regional economic growth,” Jim Anderton says.

REDA chief executive Blair McRae says the research will confirm gaps in the production infrastructure, to identify the roles of the key agencies (production, support services, training and others) in filling those gaps.

“REDA sees the screen production industry as a major enabler for job creation and economic growth for the Wellington region and has a range of initiatives underway to facilitate and support this sector.

“One of the things we want to know, for example, is what the current capacity is for making films, what the skill gaps are and what potential international markets there are for region tap into.

“New Zealand and, in particular Wellington, is benefiting from the profile the Lord of the Rings trilogy is bringing with most of the major US production houses either having visited or about to visit. These include companies such as The Walt Disney Company, The Jim Henson Company, DreamWorks, Miramax Films, New Line, Sony, Warners and Village Roadshow. These companies are investigating Wellington and New Zealand with a view to bringing projects here for location and postproduction activity,” Mr McRae said.
