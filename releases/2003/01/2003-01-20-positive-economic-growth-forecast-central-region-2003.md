Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group forecasts higher domestic activity maintaining a positive rate of economic growth for Central in 2003.

While the positive economic growth forecast for Central will come as welcome news for those living in the region , the outlook is for the rate of economic growth to fall from that witnessed in the past 12 months. Deteriorating export fortunes, particularly in the large agricultural sector, a trend expected to impact nationwide in 2003, is expected to slow the Central region’s economic growth. However a lift in domestic demand will maintain a positive rate of economic growth over the coming year.

Growth is expected to come from key sectors of the local economy such as retailing, health, education and community and personal services. Key confidence indicators such as consumer and business confidence surveys support a slowing, but still positive, outlook for the Central region economy.

The Central economy experienced strong growth in 2001 and the first half of 2002 as a result if higher activity in some of the region’s most important sectors. The upturn in the export sector has been a boost to the large agricultural sector, related primary processing and transport and storage services. Retailers have benefited from the spending of higher farm incomes and real estate and construction activity seem to have picked up recently, according to the report. Palmerston North, the region’s main city, has also benefited from the important and growing transport industry.

Labour Market Outlook  
As a result of a slowing in the region’s economic fortunes this year, labour market conditions are also predicted to slow, resulting in a weakening of job growth and steady unemployment in 2003. On the positive side however, labour market performance could turn out to be better than expected if the recent rise in firms’ intentions to increase staff numbers continues alongside the tentative recovery in the number of newspaper job advertisements.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. The region can look forward to seeing further job growth in 2003.
