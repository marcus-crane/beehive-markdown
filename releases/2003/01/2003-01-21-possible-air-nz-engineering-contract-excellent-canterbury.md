Local Wigram MP and Minister for Economic Development Jim Anderton today welcomed news that Air New Zealand’s Engineering Services could potentially win a significant contract to service US Air Force Hercules.

“This would mean supporting around 50 high-skilled local jobs and the $210 million contract would have a positive impact on the Christchurch and Canterbury economy,” said Jim Anderton.

“Criticisms of the possible contract by the Green Party Foreign Affairs spokesperson are bizarre. The Greens would clearly like to see Air NZ turn down lucrative contracts. At the same time they are opposed to any discussions of investment by Qantas. It appears that the Greens are opposed to New Zealand’s economic development and don’t want to see a viable successful national airline owned by New Zealanders.”
