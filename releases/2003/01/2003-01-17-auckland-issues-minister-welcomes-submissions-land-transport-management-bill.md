Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed today’s agreement by Auckland’s Mayoral Forum to develop a comprehensive, citywide and united plan for the region’s transport system.

Judith Tizard noted the Auckland Mayors’ comments on the Land Transport Management Bill, introduced at the end of last year, and welcomes submissions from the Mayors and others on the Bill.

“The Land Transport Management Bill addresses a range of pressing transport issues and is the first step in delivering the structures to allow New Zealand’s, and particularly Auckland’s, problems to be addressed,” said Judith Tizard.

“I hope that local government, the transport industry, the construction industry and individuals interested in Auckland’s transport infrastructure will be putting forward robust submissions on the Bill to ensure that it’s as effective as possible for the region.

“We will also have to work across parties in Parliament to ensure that the legislation does deliver for Auckland,” said Judith Tizard.

“Shortly before Christmas I coordinated a multi-party briefing for all Auckland MPs on Auckland's transport issues at the Auckland Regional Council. The MPs who attended know there's a lot of work to be done and I will be calling Auckland MPs together again when Parliament starts to discuss these issues further.

“The Labour-Progressive Government remains committed to working with Auckland’s Mayors and the Auckland region to help develop the integrated, efficient and sustainable transport infrastructure that the region deserves.”

The Land Transport Management Bill, introduced to Parliament at the end of last year, has been referred to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee and submissions close on February 28. The select committee reports back to Parliament on June 9.
