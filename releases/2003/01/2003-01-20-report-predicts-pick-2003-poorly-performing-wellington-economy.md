Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group anticipates a lift in domestic demand, which is expected to boost Wellington’s rate of economic growth over the coming year. The upbeat economic forecast for the capital and region for 2003 is in stark contrast to economic performance in 2002 when Wellington economy was the poorest performing of all regional economies in the country. Latest activity indicators suggest that Wellington’s economy grew by only 1.3 percent in the year to September 2002, the lowest growth of New Zealand’s regions by some margin.

In 2003 it is anticipated that, unlike many other regions, the Wellington economy will be unaffected by an expected drop in farm incomes during 2003, with the main drivers of capital’s economic growth likely to come from retailing, business and finance, insurance and property services, tourism, communications, health, education and community and personal services.

Supporting the more positive economic outlook for the Wellington region, consumer and business confidence are above the national average and individual firms are very positive about the outlook for their own business.

A dip in confidence about the general business situation by Wellington businesses in late 2002 stems from concerns about a stronger New Zealand dollar and a slower than expected world recovery. However Wellington’s pessimism is less severe than that of the country as a whole perhaps owing to greater concern about declining agricultural commodity prices and farm incomes in regions with relatively larger agricultural sectors.

In the critical area of investment, the report notes that Wellington businesses are signaling strong intentions to invest in 2003. Investment intentions among Wellington firms are now the second highest in the country.

Labour Market Outlook  
The Wellington labour market is expected to improve moderately as higher regional economic growth leads to strengthening of job growth, although unemployment is expected to only fall slightly due to a greater number of people now looking for work. Very high employment intentions among Wellington firms (the highest in the country) suggests job growth, and while they remain relatively low, there are tentative signs that the decline in the number of ANZ newspaper job advertisements is beginning to bottom out.

The region’s unemployment rate is expected to decline slightly on an annual basis, as job growth just outweighs growth in the labour force. The number of unemployment beneficiaries is also expected to show a slight fall. It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. Wellingtonians can look forward to seeing the job growth in 2003.
