The Government has revised the presentation of its travel safety information into a more user-friendly format, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

The new format enables people to easily find summary advice at a glance for a specified country on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade website. It also links directly to any detailed advice New Zealand has issued for that country, as well as to the advice of our consular partners (Australia, the UK, US and Canada.)

“Growing public interest in Government travel advisories has led us to review how we present this information. It is now the most used section of the MFAT website with up to a million hits a month.

“The new format helps people find specific advice quickly and easily and it has received good public feedback during initial trials.

“Our travel safety information is based on our best assessment of the risks to New Zealanders and New Zealand interests. But the advice is not infallible. The unpredictable nature of terrorism in particular makes it very difficult to assess the credibility of the information we receive on such threats.

“We provide the advice to help travellers make their own informed choices. But ultimately, decisions to travel are up to travellers themselves. We strongly advise people considering travelling to high-risk areas to monitor all good information sources, including those provided by New Zealand and other governments.

“Our general advice for countries world-wide is consistent with the advice of our consular partners, with whom we share information. We issue travel safety notices for a limited range of countries where there are a sizeable number of New Zealand visitors and appreciable risk to their safety and security,” Mr Goff said.
