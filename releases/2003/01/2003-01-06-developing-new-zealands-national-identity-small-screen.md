Forget all the hype about the growing power of the internet, television remains the most powerful medium to disseminate ideas, information and entertainment. Despite New Zealand being one of the most ‘wired’ nations on the planet, this statement is as true in our country as it would be in any across the world.

New Zealand moved to one of the most deregulated broadcasting systems in the world during the 1980s and 1990s. Government decisions were effectively relegated to deciding who should be allocated television frequencies and, latterly, who should buy Television New Zealand. The current government has since the end of 1999 reclaimed the right to actively involve itself in broadcasting issues.

The government takes the view that in a globalising world, where CNN reports the news across the planet and internationally-sourced programming is cheaper than locally-produced material, we have a responsibility to ensure our publicly-owned channels reflect New Zealand interests, tell New Zealand stories, and interpret foreign events through our eyes.

New Zealand is an exciting place to live. We have a world-beating natural environment (as any foreign tourist will tell you this summer), we have a ‘can-do’ attitude which sees Kiwis excelling in many fields, and we like to discuss issues particular to our own country. For all these reasons the government is giving our publicly owned broadcaster – Television New Zealand – a new framework within which it will operate. From 1 March TVNZ will be driven by a Charter which requires it to reflect on the expectations of all New Zealanders, rather than only screening those programmes which attract the biggest possible audiences.

Some have assumed moving to more of a public service broadcasting framework will result in hours of worthy but dull programming on television. The government has been clear that we expect TV1 and TV2 to continue to attract large audiences. The key difference is that they will now also be encouraged to provide audiences with a deeper and wider range of experiences than purely commercial broadcasters are able to provide, and also to give greater consideration to the various audiences that make up the larger one.

Nor is the government looking to make programming decisions for broadcasters. We are protecting the editorial and programme independence of TVNZ. Ministers cannot give directions relating to specific programmes or to the presentation of news and current affairs programmes.

So how is the government supporting the transformation of Television New Zealand? In part by investing in their ability to produce more New Zealand-made programming and to showcase the best the world has to offer. An additional $12m will go to TVNZ annually to implement the Charter and New Zealand on Air has received a $6m annual boost to purchase locally-made programmes. We are also reconfiguring TVNZ’s structure so that it can focus on what it puts on screen, while the transmission side of its operations will separately get on with growing its national and international business.

The government has also been working with the entire television industry to get more New Zealand-made programming on air. In December a working group comprising TVNZ, TV3, NZ on Air and the production industry agreed, after talks with the government, to develop a quota system to increase the amount and type of local material on free-to-air television. Audience surveys show New Zealanders like locally-made programmes so this is a good step forward in meeting viewer demands.

Coronation Street, and other Kiwi favourites, will always have a place on our tv screens. This year the government is setting in place a new framework which will ensure that our people and our stories are also guanteed a home on the box.
