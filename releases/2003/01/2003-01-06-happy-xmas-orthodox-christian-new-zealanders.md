Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter wishes a Happy Orthodox Christmas to all New Zealanders who are celebrating the festival tomorrow (January 7).

"There are at least 20,000 people of Eastern European descent in New Zealand, many of them Russian or Serbian. About one third of these people are thought to belong to Orthodox Christian churches that follow the Julian calendar and celebrate Christmas on January 7," Mr Carter said.

"I would like to pass on the best wishes of the Government to all Orthodox communities. May your festivites reflect the significance your religion places on the celebration of Christmas."
