The New Zealand Music Industry Commission has led a successful delegation to the world’s biggest music trade fair for a second year running, says Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

More than 10,000 people in the music business attended Midem 2003, held in Cannes from January 21 – 24, including a delegation of New Zealand record label representatives led by the Music Industry Commission with assistance from Trade New Zealand.

“It is the most important annual opportunity to conduct business with international music industry players under one roof, and this year the New Zealanders have done great business,” said Judith Tizard.

“Cath Andersen from the Music Industry Commission reports that the success of the New Zealand companies this year has been phenomenal, with everyone exceeding their expectations.

“Labels such as Trust Records, Rattle Records, Atol Records, Heart Music and Loop Recordings Aot(ear)oa secured distribution deals and had productive distribution meetings with companies from UK, Europe, Asia and North America. They represent a broad mix of New Zealand music from contemporary to classical.”

Judith Tizard was delighted to hear that many of the delegates who attended the World Series New Zealand music showcases in Auckland last November were at Midem. “Not only did they show their own interest in New Zealand by repeat visits to our trade stand for more information, they also made sure they introduced their international counterparts to New Zealand music.

“Cath Andersen also had meetings with representatives from other countries about the role of the Commission and the support of Trade New Zealand, because they are very interested in setting up similar support structures for their local music industries.

”It’s satisfying to know that the New Zealand music industry has been able to successfully capitalise on the strategy work and project implementation that the government has undertaken so far in recognition of the huge economic returns that can be made from New Zealand’s creative industries.”
