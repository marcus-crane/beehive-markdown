New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Malaysia and Brunei, Mac Price, will be hugely missed by his family, friends and colleagues, said Foreign Affairs Minister, Phil Goff. Macalister Price died last week in Adelaide after being ill for some time. He was 54-years-old.

“New Zealand has lost a highly competent and valued diplomat, who has done a superb job for his country in all his postings.

“Mac had a distinguished 30-year career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade after graduating from Auckland University with a Masters Degree in Political Studies.

“In the past ten years he headed three overseas posts – in New Caledonia, Samoa and Malaysia. Prior to that he was posted to Tokyo, Canberra and Jakarta.

“Mac had a well-earned reputation for his professionalism. He was well informed and respected by both his colleagues and those he dealt with in the countries where he represented New Zealand.

“I worked closely with Mac when he was in Samoa and Malaysia. He did an excellent job for New Zealand. He maintained his strong commitment to his work, even when suffering from his illness.

“When I visited Malaysia last year he discharged himself from hospital to attend meetings with the Malaysian Foreign Minister and Prime Minister. His spirit was indomitable. His death is a huge loss.

“I extend my deepest condolences to Mac’s wife, Nina Sudiono, his three sons Duncan, Hamish and Andrew and other members of his family,” said Mr Goff.

Mac’s funeral will be held at the Anglican Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 9 St Stephens Avenue in Parnell, Auckland on Tuesday 14 January at 1pm.
