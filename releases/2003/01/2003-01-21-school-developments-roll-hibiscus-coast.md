Exciting new developments will soon begin at a number of Hibiscus Coast schools, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Arrangements of an alternative site for the relocation of Orewa Primary School have been finalised so the Hibiscus Coast Schooling Strategy can now be implemented.

“Schools in the region will be looking forward to the improvement in educational outcomes which result from implementation of various elements of this strategy,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Hibiscus Coast schools are to be congratulated on the collaborative and visionary way that they have worked with the Ministry of Education to develop a long term plan for schooling in the area.

“All local school boards have agreed with the strategy. It’s been the subject of considerable discussion and consultation in the community.”

Completion of Orewa Primary School’s site purchase means that immediate planning can commence for a number of initiatives.

Orewa Primary can plan for their move and Orewa College can progress their planning to change classes to include years 7 and 8 and utilise the Orewa Primary site.

Planning can go ahead for the new state of the art secondary school on the Stanmore Bay site adjacent to Hibiscus Coast Intermediate School. The target date for these moves is February 2005.

Trevor Mallard said he was also pleased that the boards of trustees of Orewa Primary, Orewa North, Gulf Harbour and Silverdale Schools had agreed to consider relinquishing their year 7 and 8 students as part of the Strategy.

“Year 7 and 8 facilities to be developed at Orewa College will recognise the latest curriculum needs and future students will have the opportunity to benefit greatly from them. I recognise that discussions about this may take time and I look forward to hearing the outcome.

“In an area which is already experiencing considerable population growth and where more will follow, it’s important that provision for school growth occurs in a planned way across the network of schools,” Trevor Mallard said.
