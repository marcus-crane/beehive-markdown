The government and Television New Zealand (TVNZ) have finalised an agreement for the provision of $12m (GST inclusive) of funding to assist TVNZ to implement its charter.

The funding payments, which have now commenced, are for programmes and initiatives that TVNZ would not have otherwise committed funding to were it not for the requirement to implement its charter.

Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said TVNZ’s charter requires it to reflect on the expectations of all New Zealanders, rather than solely focusing on programmes which attract the biggest audiences.

“Legislation establishing the Charter is a top priority for the government and will be passed early in the year to allow an early start date. It's therefore important that TVNZ has access to the resources it needs to meet its Charter obligations.

“The role broadcasters play in the development and maintenance of New Zealanders’ sense of national and cultural identity is crucial. In a global village where national and international news and drama can be sourced from many hundreds of offshore providers the government has a responsibility to state clearly to TVNZ what it regards as the public interest.

“A memorandum of understanding, now signed, details the range of genre the additional funding will support. It also guarantees that TVNZ will be free from government interference in commissioning programming within these genre.

“The funding shows we are committed to getting programmes on the small screen which meet the diverse interests of New Zealanders,” Steve Maharey said.

TVNZ’s annual report will provide full details on how the funding was invested in programming.
