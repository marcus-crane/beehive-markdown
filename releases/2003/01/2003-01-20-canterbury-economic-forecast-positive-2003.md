The Canterbury regional economy has grown strongly in recent years and indicators point to the continuing, though at a slower rate.

Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group (LMPG), anticipates economic growth is expected to fall from strong rates to solid rates as a result of lower export incomes and weaker confidence among local businesses. However growth likely to continue due to strong population growth, relatively low interest rates and high job and wage growth.

Taking into account Canterbury’s key sectors, the main drivers of the region’s economic growth in the coming year are likely to be centred in the service sector: retail and wholesale trade, business, finance, insurance and property services, construction, tourism and health, education, community and personal services.

Canterbury’s economy grew by 4.2 percent in the year to September 2002, nearly half a percentage point above the national average of 3.8 percent, and up from 3.7 percent in the year to September 2001. However confidence levels among Canterbury businesses and consumers are below the national average and support a drop in the region’s economic growth rate this year. Nevertheless, firms are still quite optimistic about the outlook for their own business and consumer confidence remains fairly high.

Labour Market Outlook  
Canterbury’s labour market is forecast to show a moderate improvement in 2003, with solid employment growth expected to lead to a small fall in the region’s unemployment rate.

Employment intentions among local firms are positive and the number of ANZ newspaper job advertisements are at high levels, despite recent falls. Overall, the Canterbury labour market is expected to show a moderate improvement in 2003.

On the basis of a small improvement in the region’s labour market for 2003, the number of unemployment beneficiaries is expected to continue to fall.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. Cantabrians can look forward to seeing the job growth continuing in 2003.
