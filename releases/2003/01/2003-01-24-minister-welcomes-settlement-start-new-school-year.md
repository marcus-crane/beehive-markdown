Education Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the recommendations of the Alternative Disputes Resolution Panel on the issue of pay for non-degree teachers.

The panel has been considering which non-degree teachers should be able to access the new top pay step and salary increments which were part of last year’s secondary teachers settlement.

“I’m relieved the issue has been settled by the panel and I hope this means that the school year can start next Wednesday positively and with a clean slate, so teachers and students can focus on learning, without any other distractions,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The panel in its report today on the issue of “G3 equivalence” says it believes its recommendations are fair and equitable to both teachers and the taxpayer because they ‘reaffirm the strong incentives for the recruitment and retention of highly qualified and trained staff’. This was also the panel’s position in its recommended settlement to the secondary teachers collective agreement last year.

“I’m totally supportive of this approach and the Government in recent settlements in the school sector has been focused on the recognition of qualifications in both teaching and non-teaching collective agreements.

“The ADR panel has today also recommended that in order to access the new top pay scale, a teacher without a degree must hold a substantive qualification that is assessed at or above level 7 (degree level) on the National Qualifications Framework and separately hold a recognised teaching qualification.

“It’s important to remember that the teachers who do not meet that test will still be able to access the other pay increases contained in last year’s settlement, and they remain in what is known as the G3 salary group.

“The panel also recommended that the matter of salaries for teachers in specialist subjects or curriculum areas and who will not access the new salary step, be referred to the Ministerial Taskforce on Secondary Teacher Remuneration for consideration,” Trevor Mallard said.
