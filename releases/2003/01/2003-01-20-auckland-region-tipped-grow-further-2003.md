The Auckland regional economy grew strongly last year and indicators point to continued robust economic and employment growth in 2003.

Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says that the Auckland region will grow again in 2003 on the back of high net immigration, strong job and wage growth and the America’s Cup regatta. The region’s firms and consumers both anticipate Auckland’s positive economic outlook. Local businesses are very optimistic about the prospects for their own activity, and consumer confidence is the highest in the country.

Sectors of Auckland’s economy that the report says are likely to benefit as a result of high population growth, relatively low interest rates, the strong local labour market and the America’s Cup regatta include retail and wholesale trade, construction, tourism, business, finance, insurance and property services and health, education, community and personal services.

Job growth is expected to continue throughout the region, as employment intentions among Auckland firms remain solid and the number of newspaper job advertisements is still high. However, because more people are expected to be looking for work in the region this year, unemployment in the region is expected to fall only slightly in 2003 despite more people moving into work.

Auckland consumers country’s most positive  
Confidence indicators, such as consumer confidence and business confidence surveys, also support the positive outlook for the Auckland economy. For example, Auckland consumers are the most confident in the country and although Auckland businesses aren’t as confident , individual firms remain very positive about the outlook for their own business. Auckland was one of only three regions to have an increase in consumer confidence from the previous quarter.

Small drop in Auckland unemployment rate predicted  
While the Auckland labour market is expected to remain strong over the coming year, employment growth is not expected to be as strong as it was during the last two years. However, solid growth is still expected. This is likely to result in a small drop in the rate of unemployment.

Auckland’s annual unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent, a low level for the region and below the national rate of 5.3 percent in the year to September 2002, reflecting a steady drop in numbers receiving the unemployment benefit (the average monthly number of Unemployment Beneficiaries fell to 33,500 in the year to September 2002). On the basis of a positive outlook for labour market conditions in Auckland over the coming year, the number of unemployment beneficiaries in Auckland expected to continue falling.

Auckland labour market conditions improve  
Auckland job growth approached three percent in the year to September 2002, an increase of 16,200 people, taking employment to an average of 574,000 for the year to September 2002. It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. Aucklanders can look forward to seeing the job growth we have seen in recent years continuing in 2003.
