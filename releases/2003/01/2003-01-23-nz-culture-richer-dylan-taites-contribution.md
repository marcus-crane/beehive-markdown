“Dylan Taite’s personal passion for music and his unique broadcasting style have left a huge imprint on New Zealand,” said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard said Dylan Taite, who passed away last night, was a generous and visionary music journalist and producer, who has left New Zealand’s culture richer for his contribution.

“Dylan’s energy and enthusiasm, his broad intelligence and his deep respect for musicians and their work has been significant and inspirational.

“From the Sex Pistols and Bob Marley to The Datsuns and Steriogram, Dylan always had his finger on the pulse. He connected New Zealand with world music and the world with New Zealand music.

“From very early on he recognised the important role of the arts and the creative sector, and for many years kept the sector’s issues at the forefront, always in his inimitable, improvisational style. The confidence and success currently being realised in the New Zealand music industry is a testament to his work,” said Judith Tizard.

“He will be greatly missed, and my sympathy goes to his family at this sad time.”
