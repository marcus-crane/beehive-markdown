Commercial radio stations exceeded their New Zealand music targets in 2002.

Kiwi music made up 15 percent of the commercial radio playlist last year – beating the 13 percent target set under the code.

Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today released broadcasting statistics collected by the Radio Broadcasters Association under the voluntary code agreed to by commercial broadcasters in March 2002. Broadcasters are working towards a 20 percent contemporary New Zealand music target by 2006. In 2001, 11.2 percent of music broadcast by commercial radio was of New Zealand origin.

Steve Maharey said the Code’s objective of getting more New Zealand music is being achieved.

“2002 was another great year for New Zealand music. Broadcasters have done a great job and I hope these excellent results do not lead to complacency in the coming year.

“Broadcasting targets were met in all but one format and the overall target of 13 percent Kiwi music was exceeded. This is good news for the New Zealand music industry and radio listeners who are getting to hear more local talent across the airwaves.

“The results follow solid work by commercial radio broadcasters and New Zealand On Air:

- commercial radio, under the umbrella of the New Zealand Music Performance Committee, is working cooperatively to increase the amount of Kiwi music broadcast. Its achievements have been quite spectacular, for example Kiwi music broadcast by rock radio stations increased from 4% in June 1997 to over 25% last year; and
- New Zealand On Air’s Phase Four plan seeks out new Kiwi artists producing music suitable for commercial radio which ‘pluggers’ then introduce to stations. Artists like Carly Binding, Nesian Mystik and Blindspott have been promoted in this way and are now achieving strong air play across the radio formats.

“These results also hold out great promise for increasing the amount of local programming on television. In December the television industry agreed to develop a similar voluntary industry targets for the small screen.

“Increasing the amount of kiwi content we get to see and hear is an important part of developing our national identity and showcasing the work of talented New Zealanders,” Steve Maharey said.
