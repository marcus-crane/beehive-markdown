Advice just received from the Department’s Labour Market Policy Group says that domestic demand will maintain a solid rate of economic growth throughout the Bay of Plenty during 2003. Most significant for the region’s economic growth, is the expected fall in export returns – particularly in the large agriculture sector. Reflecting this, BOP consumer confidence about the region’s economic outlook is below the average for the nation as a whole. Nevertheless, growth is still expected to be solid due to the strength of the domestic sector supported by a relatively positive outlook among firms about their own businesses over the coming year.

The main drivers of regional economic growth in 2003 are likely to be retail, property and business services, health and education. The predicted slowing in regional economic growth should see job growth more subdued compared to the recent past, but the number of people in work is still expected to rise. Employment intentions (the number of firms that expect to increase employment over the next 12 months minus the number of firms that expect to decrease employment, expressed as a net percentage of respondents) is currently just below the national average.

Business Confidence High  
A notable aspect of the report is the confidence local businesses have in their ability to sustain economic growth in 2003. Compared to other regions, firms in the BOP are very confident about their own future despite pessimism about general business conditions as a whole. Firms tend to be more optimistic about their own activity when the general outlook is pessimistic, and in the year to September 2002, a net 35.4 percent of BOP firms said they expected their own activity to be higher during the coming 12 months, the highest in the country and well above the national average of a net 21.7 percent (more than zero means that optimists outnumber pessimists).

Supporting the solid outlook for the region, the report says consumer confidence remains positive despite being below the national average.

Labour Market Outlook  
The BOP labour market is expected to remain strong in 2003, with solid job growth and a steady unemployment rate. The National Bank Business Outlook shows that hiring intentions among BOP firms were just below the national average in late 2002. This suggests that employment will rise at a rate much closer to the national average in 2003.

The number of people looking for work is also expected to increase in 2003, with migrant inflows at a national level expected to boost BOP’s working age population growth.

The number receiving the unemployment benefit is expected to continue a downward trend the report says.

It is important that we continue to see employment growth. The government believes strongly that getting a job is the best welfare policy of all. The Bay of Plenty region can look forward to seeing the job growth in 2003.
