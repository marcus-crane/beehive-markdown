Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia welcomed today’s announcement of a funding increase for the Maori television channel.

“Everyone who watches the channel will benefit from the extra funding, through more and better quality programmes on screen.

“Tangata whenua aspirations for the channel are riding high. Managers and staff, and programme makers, are keen to deliver. Strong support from the government will help bring the whole package together.

“A priority for the channel will be to reflect tangata whenua viewpoints, and provide a platform for Maori contributions to arts, entertainment, news and analysis of current affairs. Tangata whenua are a key audience – but not the only one. Good Maori TV is also good New Zealand TV. The channel will increase our local content and broaden our viewing options.

“The interim directors of the channel have stressed the importance of being able to reach a Maori audience via the chosen broadcast platform. Clearly the government also has an interest in the channel reaching tangata whenua, otherwise its agreed purpose won’t be fulfilled.

“We may never achieve 100% coverage, but I’ll be looking for workable arrangements to be put in place so the channel is available to those who want to watch,” said Tariana Turia.
