Representatives from the prestigious Hong Kong Racehorse Owners’ Association are attending the National Yearling Sales at Karaka for the first time.

New Zealand Bloodstock has worked closely with Trade New Zealand to bring the delegation to the sales this week, said Racing Minister Mark Gosche.

“Hong Kong represents an extremely important market to the New Zealand thoroughbred breeding industry. In recent years Hong Kong has been the second largest export market for New Zealand yearlings. It is great to see the growing ties between our racing jurisdictions,” Mr Gosche said.

“Presently a third of the 1100 Hong Kong Jockey Club racehorses are from New Zealand and there is a strong reputation that New Zealand horses are high performing horses,” said Mr Gosche.

The idea of a Hong Kong delegation visit was first suggested when the previous Racing Minister, Annette King, visited Hong Kong just over a year ago for the Hong Kong International races.

At last year’s Premier Sale, Hong Kong buyers accounted for 50 yearlings with a total value of $7 million, which contributed about 20% of the total Premier Sales turnover. A further $1.2 million was spent at the Select and Festival Sales.

“Despite current world events and international economic uncertainty, it is great to see the Premier Sales getting off to an excellent start yesterday. This kind of international interest in the New Zealand thoroughbred horses is fantastic for the industry,” Mr Gosche said

Mark Gosche will be addressing the Hong Kong delegation at a function this evening.

Attention Chief Reporters: Mark Gosche will be visiting the National Yearling Sales at Karaka tonight at approximately 6:45pm. Directions – turn off Southern Motorway at the Papakura/Karaka turnoff, 1st main complex on the right.
