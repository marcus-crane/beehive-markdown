New Zealand’s cities, particularly Auckland, need to develop and grow in a way that encourages and supports future growth, said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today.

Goals for sustainable cities are part of the “Sustainable Development for New Zealand, Programme of Action” released today by the Labour Progressive Government.

Environment Minister Marian Hobbs launched the overall programme of action which provides a set of guiding objectives and principles to policy and decision.

Jim Anderton says New Zealand needs continuous growth and cannot afford to have growth that stops and starts in Auckland. “Auckland leaders and central Government all know that the Auckland economy needs growth that is sustained and continues in the future.

“Sustainable Cities builds on the central and local Government partnerships this Government has developed with the regions of NZ. We have to ensure our cities are centres of economic growth and innovation while ensuring that they support social wellbeing, quality of life and cultural identity,” he said.

Marian Hobbs said “Eighty-five per cent of our people live in cities and we want them to have exciting and prosperous industries, liveable communities and a clean, healthy environment.

“The sustainable cities programme will initially focus on Auckland. This may involve a presence in Auckland that brings central and local government together, as well as large institutions and business to tackle the issues that are a barrier to growth,” she said.

The programme of action is entirely consistent with the Auckland Regional Development Strategy developed by Auckland regional leaders, which aims to promote growth which maintains and enhances the Auckland region’s natural environment and ensures the region looks, feels and is a great place to live.
