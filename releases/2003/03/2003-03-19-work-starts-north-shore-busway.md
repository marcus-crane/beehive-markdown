Transport Minister Paul Swain and North Shore City Mayor George Wood celebrated the start of earthworks for two stations (Albany and Constellation Drive) on the North Shore Busway this morning.

Once it is completed in 2006, the busway will run alongside the Northern Motorway between Constellation Drive and Esmonde Road. There will be five stations on the busway, two of which (Albany and Constellation Drive) will be ‘Park and Ride’ stations with carparking available. The busway is expected to cost $121 million, excluding stations.

“Improving the Auckland region’s transport network, is a major priority for this government and with several major projects going on at the moment we are starting to make real progress,” said Mr Swain.

“As well as upgrading the region’s roading network, improving the quality and frequency of public transport is essential in reducing congestion. The Busway, which will be the first of its kind in New Zealand, will form the central spine of North Shore City’s planned Bus Rapid Transit system – a kind of train system on wheels – and will interconnect with services from the suburbs. In peak times bus frequencies will range from 2-15 minutes. The busway will link with the Britomart Transport Interchange, due to open in July, and will be an important part of the Auckland region’s transport network.

“The North Shore Busway has been a long time in the planning and is a great example of the Auckland region working together to tackle its transport problems. Transit NZ, the Auckland Regional Council and the Auckland City and North Shore City councils have all worked together on the project. Operators will also have a role to play in delivering services when the infrastructure is in place.

“Projects like this make public transport a real and viable option for more journeys and also reduce the environmental impact of our travel. The busway is for buses and high occupancy vehicles only so the commuter will get there quicker,” said Mr Swain.
