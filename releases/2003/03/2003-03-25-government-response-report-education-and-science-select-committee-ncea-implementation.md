#### Presented to the House of Representatives in accordance with Standing Order 248

**INTRODUCTION**

1. The Government welcomes the Committee's report which constitutes a useful contribution to the debate surrounding the NCEA and assists the implementation of the certificate by raising awareness of the rationale for its introduction as well as highlighting some of the obstacles to smooth implementation.
2. The Government responds to the report in accordance with Standing Order 248.
3. The Government responds positively to the intent of the committee's recommendations.

**RECOMMENDATIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSE**

***Background***

1. The Education and Science Select Committee resolved to conduct an inquiry into the implementation of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) in October 2002 and having received and considered submissions from a number of key stakeholders, it issued its report in mid-December 2002.
2. The committee made four recommendations regarding actions it believes will enhance the ongoing implementation of the NCEA. Its report was not unanimous, there being a minority view to the effect that the policy is seriously flawed and that implementation should not proceed.
3. The terms of reference for the inquiry were to:  
    6.1  identify problems associated with the implementation of Level 1 of the NCEA in 2002;
   
    6.2  evaluate the response of the Minister of Education and officials to these issues;
   
    6.3  assess preparations for the partial implementation of Level 2 in 2003, with reference to the operation of Level 1 in 2002;
   
    6.4  consider any other matter;
   
    6.5  report back by 15 November 2002.
4. The committee later modified the final term of reference to permit a report-back date of 12 December 2003.
5. The decision to introduce the NCEA was made in 1998 by the then Government which intended to implement the qualification from 2001. Its key goals were to improve coherence between curriculum and qualifications in the secondary school, to align (or integrate) senior school qualifications with the rest of the education sector and therefore to provide flexible pathways to both encourage and facilitate lifelong learning. This integration was envisaged by the work leading up to the Education Act of 1989 and is specifically required by the Act[1](#1).
6. The NCEA is one of more than 700 certificates and diplomas registered on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). As such its introduction represents the final phase of the establishment of the Framework. While there have undoubtedly been teething problems during 2002, many of which are identified by the Select Committee's report, Government believes this should be put in context of the complexity of the change and the historical difficulties of making qualification changes in New Zealand.

7. The introduction of NCEA was achieved at a time of significant industrial tension in the sector, and actions which affected the operation of the NCEA were taken as part of industrial action at the time. The effects of this on the NCEA are reflected in the committee's report. These factors have the potential to obscure the considerable successes of NCEA implementation:
   
   10.1  Government has received regular reports from the moderation processes which reveal that schools have developed rigorous systems to ensure the validity of internal assessment and that teachers' assessment judgements against national standards are professional and consistent;
   
   10.2  The examination period was undertaken smoothly despite the complexities of individualised candidate booklets;
   
   10.3  The logistics of distribution of papers to markers and the return to candidates also ran smoothly;
   
   10.4  Candidates and schools received results as in the past by mail, and earlier via the Internet;
   
   10.5  The results provided, as expected, a greatly improved degree of information about individual achievement against specific outcomes. Feedback from students and their families has confirmed that most find the results both accessible and informative;
   
   10.6  The overall rate of achievement against achievement standards was 71%. This confirms that standards were set at appropriate levels of difficulty, as one of the broad aims of level 1 of the NCEA was to set standards that were attainable by about 70% of the cohort.
8. Foremost in any consideration about the success or otherwise of the NCEA must be the needs of the students. The Qualifications Framework is geared to recognising the achievements of learners, encouraging further learning and allowing them to accumulate credits towards a wide range of qualifications. While there were inevitably short-term costs to government, education agencies, teachers and schools in establishing new qualifications in the senior secondary school, these must be weighed against the long-term, permanent gains the change will bring to current and future generations of students.
9. The fundamental principle of the Qualifications Framework is that of assessment against standards. The previous system of secondary school qualifications compared learners' achievements against the achievements of others and ranked them accordingly, but without reference to an agreed standard or point of reference.

**Timing of introduction**

1. When the decision was made to defer the introduction of level 1 until 2002, the intention was that teachers would have the opportunity to improve their understanding of standards-based assessment in a context where the draft level 1 achievement standards and a significant quantity of assessment exemplars were available. This decision was based on the advice of the profession as advocated by the New Zealand Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) and also by principals' groups.
2. While the trial of the moderation process proceeded during that additional year, and two extra days of professional development were provided for all teachers, it appears that not all teachers used the extra time to further upskill themselves.

**Responsibility for NCEA implementation**

1. The Select Committee makes a number of references to what is perceived as confusion over the "dual agency stewardship" of NCEA implementation. The Committee's own report indicates that confusion when it observes, "The implementation of NCEA has been the responsibility of both the ministry…and NZQA[2](#2)."
2. The Ministry of Education is not responsible for NCEA implementation. The Cabinet paper[3](#3) which laid the foundation of the NCEA required the Ministry to establish a project team to "undertake the development". In this respect the Ministry of Education became a standards setter, a role in Qualifications Framework development more commonly associated with Industry Training Organisations than with departments or ministries of the Crown. Once policies are set and standards and qualifications have been developed by standards setters, they are passed to the Qualifications Authority which is responsible[4](#4) for registering them on the Qualifications Framework.
3. The Cabinet paper went on to say that, "Implementation in schools by NZQA would follow the development period." It is the Qualifications Authority which is required to "set and conduct such examinations and conduct such assessments, as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions"[5](#5) , and therefore to implement the NCEA. This responsibility is secured partly by annual purchase agreement with the Government and partly by candidates' fees.
4. Therefore the person responsible for 'making it happen' is the Chief Executive of the Qualifications Authority who delegates the bulk of this responsibility to the Group Manager, Secondary Education Group, NZQA. To clarify any remaining doubt about where responsibility for oversight of NCEA implementation sits, the position will be renamed, Group Manager, Secondary Education and NCEA Implementation.
5. As we enter the second year of the qualification, the Ministry of Education's developmental tasks in relation to NCEA are largely complete. The level 3 and scholarship standards need to be finalised and approved.
6. The Ministry's role is now two-fold. The first is to hold an overarching policy responsibility to monitor and review the performance of the qualification. It will do so in light of government's goal of better aligning curriculum and qualifications in the secondary school. To achieve this, the Ministry of Education and NZQA share joint stewardship responsibility. They will bring together their perspectives in reviewing achievement standards, and identifying areas for further attention.
7. The second part of the Ministry's role relates to ongoing professional development. The Ministry has a mandate to increase the capacity of schools and teachers to enhance learning opportunities. This is the case across all policy areas, not just the NCEA. In this capacity, the Ministry generates resources and provides professional development opportunities for teachers, and for principals and boards. It has done this in the cases of developments in the National Curriculum, the National Administrative Guidelines, Special Education initiatives and many others, and is now doing so for NCEA.
8. Government supports the intent of the recommendation for enhanced coordination, but believes that a different mechanism is needed to achieve the desired result. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between NZQA and the Ministry of Education has been developed to increase coordination between the agencies. This was put in place prior to receiving the Select Committee report, as Government was already aware of the need for increased coordination.

**Communication**

1. The Ministry of Education and NZQA have operated a shared communication strategy since the establishment of the NCEA in 1998. Elements of the strategy have included: regular NCEA Updates delivered to all teachers advising policy and implementation matters in plain language; the SecQual circulars providing detailed information on operational matters; a widely publicised toll-free 'NCEA Helpline' accessed by some 300 callers per month on average; brochures for students, parents and employers; and an annual seminar for Principals' Nominees who are NZQA liaison contacts in each school. The Principal Nominees themselves are a crucial element of the strategy, providing an invaluable linking role between the agencies and teaching staff.
2. This communication strategy has evolved according to feedback and includes: Helpline callers' key issues; the Qualifications Authority's Board and Advisory Committee; discussions between NZQA's School Relationship Manager and National Assessment Facilitators, the Ministry's Curriculum Facilitators and teachers; regular consultation with principals' groups, the PPTA and other stakeholders, such as panels of teachers undertaking development work. Officials of both agencies have regularly addressed boards of trustees, PTAs and other groups of parents. This work has been overseen at all times by a Joint Overview Group (JOG) of Ministry and NZQA officials, as required by the Cabinet decisions of 1998.[6](#6)
3. Despite the shared communications strategy, it is acknowledged that some communications problems arose during 2002. This was in part due to the complexity of having many hundreds of people involved in the professional dialogue and building of common understanding about NCEA.
4. Some of the other the communications problems that arose in 2002 resulted from teachers' industrial action. The Government strongly hopes that this situation will not arise again and therefore that those specific challenges are behind us.
5. The NCEA has benefited from more professional input than any other single education policy initiative. Draft achievement standards were developed over a three-year period and published to all schools for comment. The Secondary Sector Forum was a broad-based consultative group, set up to advise the Ministry on policy and development matters. The Forum resolved such issues as the detail of the moderation process and the design of the Scholarship standards that had not been prescribed by the 1998 Cabinet decisions. That group disestablished itself when it identified that its brief had been satisfied.
6. The Select Committee proposes a broadly-based sector advisory committee to 'provide input into the challenges' that remain. The Government has directed the Secretary for Education to convene and chair a Secondary Leaders Forum which will achieve this purpose. Specifically, they will be asked to focus on informing the Ministry and Minister's decisions on issues relating to realising the potential of the NCEA in the broader context of the outcomes being sought from secondary education, and in relationship with other issues in the sector.
7. In addition, the Qualifications Authority currently has the Learning and Qualifications for Secondary Education Advisory Committee, that provides advice to the NZQA on secondary education matters, including NCEA.
8. A combined sub-group of this existing Committee and the new Secondary Leaders Forum will be formed to ensure congruity between the two groups, and ensure that the issues raised by the select committee are addressed.
9. In addition, an upcoming issue of NCEA Update will be used to communicate the distinct roles of the Ministry of Education and NZQA to reduce any future confusion.

**Teacher Workload**

1. There have been transitional effects for teachers' workloads arising from NCEA implementation. These effects have not been universal in their impact, but the government acknowledges some teachers have had to work very hard to manage the transition.
2. One of the factors that seems to have influenced the ease or otherwise of the transition for teachers is their familiarity with standards-based assessment. Secondary teachers have been moving towards assessment against explicit standards for nearly thirty years, and many embraced the approach in a formal, national context soon after the National Qualifications Framework was established more than a decade ago. The Qualifications Authority provided teacher professional development and support for secondary teachers in assessment for unit standards throughout the 1990s. For these teachers there was little new in the transition to NCEA and the workload increase was less significant than for their colleagues.
3. To ease the burden across the board, the heads of the Ministry and Qualifications Authority were instructed in July 2002 to develop initiatives to identify and counter negative workload effects. They consulted widely with Heads of Department (HODs) about the issues and canvassed solutions. Steps taken by the end of 2002 included the appointment of additional School Relationship Managers (SRMs), substantial improvements to the NCEA website, further developments of the communications strategies including closer links between the central agencies and School Support Services, amendments to the timing of standard and qualification registration and improved communication with software development companies.
4. Steps to be taken in 2003 include the provision of an additional professional development course in Standards-Based Assessment task design and adaptation, as requested by the Heads of Department in consultation meetings last year. This course will be held in term 2, 2003.
5. These ongoing strategies, together with growing teacher confidence, will combine to address workload problems. The most significant workload issue relates to excessive assessment. This issue also lies behind some of the claims of greatly increased costs and, in part, the controversy over further assessment opportunities. Some teachers have approached NCEA internal assessment as single events. They have regarded the exemplars of assessment tasks provided on the website not as models, but as an approved test. They have photocopied full class sets of the downloaded activities and administered them as one-off assessment occasions.
6. Other teachers - usually those more experienced in a standards-based environment - regard assessment, whether for a qualification or not, as an element of the teaching/learning continuum. They are less likely to have found the NCEA's implementation a workload-increasing experience.
7. A year-level NCEA certificate requires 80 credits. Many schools are already beginning to manage the number of standards students enter to more educationally sound proportions than the 144-plus that some entered in 2002.

**Administrative costs**

1. Reports to Government from principals as to any additional costs imposed by the implementation of the NCEA are mixed. Some deny that there are extra costs. Others felt there were. The NCEA has not changed the curriculum, although the emphasis and focus may differ from that traditionally expected for School Certificate. The 'substantial' increases to photocopying costs are by no means universal. The differences schools experienced in this regard could in part be put down to administration practices (e.g. photocopying of full class sets of assessment tasks) and in part to differences in budget planning. The best of administration practices should be shared to ensure schools are not incurring unnecessary costs in the implementation of NCEA. This will be a topic in an upcoming NCEA Update to schools.
2. The Committee acknowledges the increases to school operational funding since this Government came into office. Total entitlement funding[7](#7) was $686 million per year in 1999, and in 2002 it was $837 million. That represents $151 million additional funding or an increase of 22% in straight (nominal) dollar terms. Even when controlled for roll growth and inflation, the increase is still a significant 11.7% in real terms over the level in 1999. Government will again consider operational funding in the context of Budget 2003.

**Training and teacher support**

1. The NCEA training provided by the Ministry has given all secondary teachers five full days' professional development. Had the PPTA not imposed a boycott on these opportunities in 2002, six days training would have been provided. More professional development is planned. Many teachers are making use of contacts with their colleagues in neighbouring schools, their subject associations, NZQA's and MOE's officers, School Support Service advisers and a variety of other contacts to pursue the professional dialogue essential to professional growth.

**Information Technology**

1. Software for schools' administrative purposes is provided by four major commercial suppliers and in some cases developed by schools themselves. As self-managing entities, boards contract suppliers of their choice.
2. The software supplied by these companies is a commercial product and its developers are commercial vendors who seek to maintain both close working relationships with purchasers, and also a clear understanding of the specifications required by the NCEA's introduction. Their responsiveness to changing needs has resulted in regular updates to functionality. To describe this process as 'frequent patching to iron out bugs'[8](#8) misconstrues that responsiveness. Regardless of the purpose of these updates, Government recognizes that repeated updating during the year caused confusion and unnecessary administrative problems.
3. Government has instructed the Ministry of Education to develop a programme for certification of software providers and standardisation of the software update process. To gain Ministry certification, software providers will need to meet a stringent set of standards (some 200 in total), which includes limiting software updates to one set occasion each year. While use of a certified provider will not be mandated, every incentive to use one will be given. For example, schools who need to upgrade their software may be given financial assistance to upgrade to a 'certified' software provider.
4. This process will be overseen by the proposed advisory group referred to earlier. Further initiatives will be considered in Budget 2003.
5. The complexities of recording and communicating student entries and results in the National Qualifications Framework context will continue as levels 2 and 3 are introduced. To simplify the task and make it as manageable as possible, the Qualifications Authority is currently developing web-based capabilities for information management in line with the e-Government policy. This should simplify data collection. These functions will be piloted with schools during 2003.

**CONCLUSION**

1. In summary Government's responses to the recommendations of the report are as follows:
   
   **Recommendation 1:**
   
   *That the Government review operation grants to schools delivering NCEA, to reflect the additional costs that the new qualification system creates.*
   
   **Response:**
   
   Government reviews schools' operational funding constantly in the light of both ongoing costs and the imperatives of Government initiatives such as the NCEA. Consideration has been given to this issue in the Budget 2003 context.
   
   **Recommendation 2:**
   
   *That the Government adopts a preferred provider for school administration software and that it strengthens the Ministry of Education's personnel capacity for software development.*
   
   **Response:**
   
   Government has commenced a certification and standards setting programme for software suppliers, and is moving to web-based qualification entries and results, to meet the intent of this recommendation.
   
   **Recommendation 3:**
   
   *That the Government ensures the appointment of an NCEA Implementation Manager with responsibility for oversight of both the Ministry of Education's and NZQA's NCEA implementation functions.*
   
   **Response:**
   
   The position of NZQA Manager, Secondary Education, will become Group Manager, Secondary Education and NCEA Implementation to clarify any confusion about who has responsibility for NCEA. A memorandum of understanding has been developed to increase coordination between the agencies.
   
   **Recommendation 4:**
   
   *That the NCEA Implementation Manager chairs a broadly-based sector advisory body to provide input into the challenges of NCEA implementation.*
   
   **Response:**
   
   The Ministry of Education will establish a Secondary Leaders Forum. A combined subgroup of this new forum and the existing NZQA Learning and Qualifications for Secondary Education Advisory Committee will be created to provide input in this area.
2. Government accepts that the implementation of the NCEA faced hurdles during 2002, and that the industrial environment contributed significantly to the problems identified. Government and the agencies have learned much from problems encountered and share in the affirmation of belief in the qualification that the Select Committee reports.
