Work and Income will be doing more to help sole parents into work with changes to legislation that comes into effect this month, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

The Social Security (Personal Development and Employment) Amendment Act, which comes into effect on 10 March 2003, delivers on government promises to develop a social security system that responds better to the needs of individuals and their families.

“The legislation abolishes the arbitrary work test on sole parents receiving the Domestic Purposes or Widows Benefits. Currently 19% or 21,924 are subjected to a work test requirement to seek part or full-time work because of the age of their youngest child.

“As a result of the change all people receiving the DPB, Widows or Emergency Maintenance Allowance will receive enhanced case management to help them in training and work planning for their future.

“All 118,098 in the three benefit groups will be required to work with their case manager to develop and implement a Personal Development and Employment Plan. The plan will outline personal development, training and employment goals and the action points required to reach those goals.

“Case loads have been reduced to on average one case manager for every 150 sole parent clients to ensure they receive one-on-one tailored assistance. Case managers have undergone intensive training in the new service model and are well connected to their local communities so they can offer the best information to clients on ways of improving their circumstances and job opportunities.

“Many at home parents find it difficult to reconnect to the labour market. These changes mean sole parents receiving a benefit are from day one moving towards work with good support and information systems around them.

“This new way of working with sole parents has also been accompanied by a change to the abatement rate that allows sole parent clients to retain a greater proportion of any income. All sole parent clients will have their income abated at a single rate. Income under $80 a week is not affected and income between $81 and $180 will reduce by 30 cents in the dollar and 70 cents in the dollar for income over $180 per week.

“This Government is committed to supporting and working with sole parents in a pragmatic and sensible way that identifies barriers to employment as well as identifying opportunities for them to improve their circumstances for themselves and their families,” said Steve Maharey.
