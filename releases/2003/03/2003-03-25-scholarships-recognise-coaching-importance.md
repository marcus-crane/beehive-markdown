Sports Minister Trevor Mallard today announced 63 sports coaches will receive the annual Prime Minister’s Coach Scholarships in recognition of the value and importance of coaches to New Zealand’s sporting success.

The leading high performance scholarships have been awarded in two tiers. Three coaches, Dunedin-based Craig Palmer, (athletics), Auckland-based Brendon Downey, (triathlon) and Cambridge-based Brett Crowe (rowing) will each receive $50,000 and a further 60 coaches from around New Zealand will receive up to $10,000 for professional development.

“Good coaches are integral to our sporting success on the world stage – and that success is important to all New Zealanders,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The scholarships recognise our future national coaches and gives them an incentive and the financial support to get to the next level. The aim is to increase both their knowledge and the standard of our high performance coaching, and to improve the depth of coaches throughout sport.”

“Coaching is a skill. It’s enhanced by learning and improved by practice. We have a lot of talented coaches in New Zealand who are prepared to go the extra mile to improve themselves. These scholarships will help to make our good coaches great,” Trevor Mallard said.

The scholarships programme is being funded by the government agency SPARC (Sport and Recreation New Zealand). SPARC receives $5 million in taxpayer funding for Prime Minister's scholarships, of which $4 million is spent on the Prime Minister's sport scholarships and $1 million on the Prime Minster's Coach Scholarships.

The programme is in its second year. It is administered by the New Zealand Academy of Sport, the high performance division of SPARC (Sport and Recreation New Zealand), which supports athletes nationwide with sports medicine, sports science, career advice and other services.

Coaches had to present a detailed plan for the use of the scholarship money that was considered by a panel administered by the Academy’s senior advisor high performance coaching Don Tricker. Seventy-four coaches from 34 sports applied for scholarships for 2003.
