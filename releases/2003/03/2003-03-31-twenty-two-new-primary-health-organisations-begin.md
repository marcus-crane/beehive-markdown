Health Minister Annette King says one in four New Zealanders, about a million people, will receive their primary health care through Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) from tomorrow.

Ms King said 22 news PHOs would begin operating tomorrow, bringing the total to 34 since the first PHOs were established on July 1 last year. Most of the 34 PHOs are funded using the Access formula that allows patients to be charged low fees.

"What's most significant is that 28 of them are funded in such a way that all New Zealanders enrolled with them will pay $20 or less for a standard visit to see a doctor or other health care worker.

"That means that some 700,000 New Zealanders will not only be able to receive a much broader range of primary health care services through their PHO, but, most crucially, will be able to afford to do so.

"Our priority has always been to bring cheaper primary health care to those New Zealanders with the greatest health needs first. We have known for too long that the costs of seeing a doctor has been a very real deterrent to many people, and this of course shows when they turn up at hospital very sick," Ms King said.

"Through this Government's injection of $400 million in new money for primary health care this year and over the next two years, PHOs are being introduced progressively throughout the country.

"Our eventual aim is to provide accessible and affordable primary health care for all New Zealanders. I am delighted at the progress so far. It exceeds all my expectations.

"I congratulate the new PHOs for embracing this opportunity to make primary health care more accessible and the District Health Boards who have worked with them to make this happen."

Ms King said PHOs are not just there to provide affordable care. "They also aim to ensure that people who haven't traditionally used primary health care services, but who need to do so, are getting access to appropriate care and advice. Even Interim Formula PHOs, that are not yet funded to reduce doctor's fees, have been given more money to get services to these people who have been missing out."

"I have also recognised the concerns of some doctors that patients enrolled with interim formula PHOs may still have high health needs and may need to see a doctor frequently. I have therefore agreed to a trial, giving some interim formula PHOs extra funding to lower costs for those with chronic illness or a history of high service use. If the trials are successful, the funding will be extended to all PHOs.

"Good management of individuals with diseases like diabetes, with regular advice and patient contact can drastically reduce the harm caused by the disease. PHOs allow us to provide more of this sort of care and support around the country."

Ms King said the 34 PHOs were geographically spread over 13 of the 21 DHBs, and more PHOs would be announced on July 1.  
"I am delighted with the feedback I receive from patients enrolled in PHOs and from staff involved in running them." I believe we are getting very good results from the extra money we are investing in primary health care."

A list of all PHOs is attached, plus questions and answers.

**Questions and Answers**

**What is primary health care?**

Primary health care covers a broad range of out-of-hospital services, although not all of them are Government funded. It aims to improve the health of people in communities by working with them through health improvement and preventative services, such as health education and counselling, disease prevention and screening.

Primary health care includes first level services such as general practice services, mobile nursing services and community health services targeted especially for certain conditions, for example maternity, family planning and sexual health services, mental health services and dentistry, or those using particular therapies such as physiotherapy, chiropractic and osteopathy services.

Chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are best managed by primary health care services so that complications can be prevented or mitigated. Not all of these services are yet included in most PHOs.

**What is the Primary Health Care Strategy?**

The Primary Health Care Strategy was launched in February 2001 by Health Minister Annette King. It builds on the population health focus and the objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy and the New Zealand Disability Strategy and outlines how a different approach to primary health care will improve the health of all New Zealanders through:

- a greater emphasis on population health, health promotion and preventative care
- community involvement
- involving a range of professionals and encouraging multidisciplinary approaches to decision-making
- improving accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of services
- improving co-ordination and continuity of care
- providing and funding services according to the population's needs as opposed to fee for services when people are unwell.

**What is a Primary Health Organisation (PHO)?**

PHOs are the local provider organisations through which District Health Boards (DHBs) will implement the Primary Health Care Strategy. The essential features of PHOs are set out in the Minimum Requirements released by the Health Minister in November 2001:

- PHOs will aim to improve and maintain the health of their populations and restore people's health when they are unwell. They will provide at least a minimum set of essential population-based and personal first-line general practice services
- PHOs will be required to work with those groups in their populations (for example, Maori, Pacific and lower income groups) that have poor health or are missing out on services to address their needs
- PHOs must demonstrate that they are working with other providers within their regions to ensure that services are co-ordinated around the needs of their enrolled populations
- PHOs will receive most of their funding through a population needs-based formula (capitation)
- PHOs will enrol people through primary providers using consistent standards and rules
- PHOs must demonstrate that their communities, iwi and consumers are involved in their governing processes and that the PHO is responsive to its community
- PHOs must demonstrate how all their providers and practitioners can influence the organisation's decision-making
- PHOs are to be not-for-profit bodies with full and open accountability for the use of public funds and the quality and effectiveness of services.

**What is the Government's high-level direction for the Primary Health Care Strategy?**

The agreed high-level direction is as follows:

- Subject to the availability of funding, the public share of primary health care funding will be substantially increased over the next 8-10 years
- Over time, as PHOs are formed, they will be funded according to the needs of their enrolled populations to provide more effective and affordable care with a population health focus
- As this happens, reliance on the Community Services Card (CSC) will be progressively reduced
- As the CSC will still be needed for a number of years, measures will be implemented to improve its take-up in the meantime.

**What funding is available for the Primary Health Care Strategy?**

The Government has committed just over $400 million over three years to begin implementing the Primary Health Care Strategy.

**Where has the new funding been directed?**

The Government's priorities for the new primary health care funding (in order of priority) are:

1. High needs populations: Extra funding will be made available to PHOs covering very deprived populations in order for them to have low fees for all their patients, provide services to ensure care gets to where it is most needed, include services to improve and maintain health as well as restore health, and to move to fairer funding allocations on a population needs basis.
2. Adjust subsidy for children under 6: The General Medical Services subsidy for children under six years was adjusted in July for inflation since 1997.
3. Progressively lower cost of access to primary health care: As more funding becomes available from 2003/04, it will start to be applied to extend free or low cost access to primary health care services through PHOs. The priorities will be reducing costs for school-age children, the elderly and others with high health needs.
4. Sustainable rural services: Measures have been introduced to help implement the Primary Health Care Strategy in rural areas and to retain and recruit the rural health care workforce.
5. PHOs across the country: Primary Health Organisations are being encouraged to set up across the country; they will be funded according to their enrolled population to provide a range of population based services to improve and maintain health as well as treatment services; and to address health inequalities.
6. Improvements to CSC and HUHC: A range of measures will be introduced to improve take-up of Community Services Cards until such time as increased funding means cards are no longer needed. Improvements to the High User Health Card will also be implemented.

**How are PHOs being established?**

A small amount ($3m-$4m) has been made available to help get PHOs established.

**What will happen to the Community Services Card?**

The Community Services Card will be phased out over the next 8-10 years. As it will still be needed by many people over the medium term, improvements will be made to make it more effective. Improvements will include measures to:

- Increase the numbers of people who get the card automatically rather than having to apply
- Simplifying the process for low-income people to gain a card
- Making it easier for providers to determine whether an individual has a card.

Even people enrolled with the new PHOs still need their CSCs at this time so that they can get low cost prescriptions or care from doctors who are not part of the PHO.

**What initiatives are planned or underway to improve the take-up of the CSC?**

They include a greater promotion of the card, via Maori and Pacific Island networks, as well as employer and union representatives, streamlining the application process and greater automation of assessment of entitlement. The Ministry of Health is also continuing to fund a free telephone service for providers to verify patients' card status.

**What about changes to General Medical Services subsidy (GMS)?**

The rate of subsidy for children under 6 increased from $32.50 per visit to $35 per visit from 1 July 2002. This accounts for inflation from 1 July 1997 to June 2002.

**How are PHOs different from Independent Practitioner Associations?**

PHOs must meet a set of minimum requirements that do not apply to IPAs. Many IPAs would already meet some of these requirements but few would meet all of them at this stage. Several IPAs are considering making the changes necessary to become a PHO while others are supporting the establishment of PHOs locally.

**When did the first PHOs begin operating?**

TaPasefika Health Trust and Te Kupenga O Hoturoa, in the Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) region, were established in July 2002.

**What are the formulae that have been developed to fund PHOs?**

There are two: Access and Interim.

**How will the Access formula work?**

It will allow all those enrolled with an Access PHO to be charged low patient fees, or access free care regardless of whether people have CSCs. In the first instance, the Access formula will be available only for PHOs (or practices/clinics within PHOs) serving populations with high concentrations of NZ Deprivation Decile 9/10 and people with high health needs.

**What about the Interim formula?**

Until there is enough funding for all PHOs to be on the Access formula, an Interim formula will apply to other PHOs/practices. The Interim formula will continue to use CSC status both for determining funding and setting patient fees. It includes additional funding for a range of new functions such as health promotion and extra services to improve access for high-need groups.

Over time, as funding allows, the per capita amounts in the Interim formula will be increased towards the levels in the Access formula. School-age children and older people will be given priority.

**What are the key factors of the two formulae?**

Both the Access and Interim Formulae recognise ethnicity and deprivation, alongside age and sex, as key determinants of population need, and both provide increased funding for HUHC-holders. Weightings for ethnicity and deprivation will target extra funding to improve access for high need populations through services such as clinics on marae or employing community health workers. PHOs will need to satisfy their DHB on how the extra access funding will be used.

**What alternative funding approaches have been proposed and why?**

Following concerns expressed by some GP groups some of the January PHOs are trialling a scheme called 'Care Plus' that will give improved care, at low cost for individuals, with known with high health needs funding.

The key criterion is likely to be that the person is expected to need at least 2 hours of clinical contact time in the coming 6 months. This need for care might be indicated in a number of different ways including that the person is:

- Suffering from 2 or more chronic illnesses
- Has a track record of heavy utilisation of primary care (6 visits in the past 6 months to primary care or an Emergency Department)
- Has a track record of acute hospital admissions (2 non-surgical acute admissions in the past year)
- Has a terminal illness.

About 5 percent of the population is thought to come into this category.

All such patients will have a care plan developed for them, including quarterly reviews to check on health status, treatment, medications and so on. The care will be able to be delivered flexibly, using GPs and other members of the PHO team. Capitated higher funding will facilitate that.

**How much will it cost New Zealanders to visit PHOs?**

All people enrolled with 'Access' PHOs will have low patient fees. Although charges will vary, many Access PHOs may be able to offer free care for children, and most adults may pay in the order of $10-$20.

For PHOs on the Interim Funding formula charges will start to be reduced during the 2003-2004 financial year. Priority groups will be all school age children and the elderly. Once Care Plus arrangements are able to be widely implemented, costs will be reduced for these individuals whose known health conditions mean they have high needs for care.
