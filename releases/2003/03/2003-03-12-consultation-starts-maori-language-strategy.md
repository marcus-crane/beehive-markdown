Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia encourages whänau, hapü, iwi and Mäori communities to participate in the consultation about 'He Moemoeä Ngätahi mo te Reo Mäori' - A shared vision for the future of Te Reo Mäori' as government seeks to fulfil its responsibilities to revitalise the language.

Parekura Horomia made the statement when he launched the consultation process and consultation document He Reo E Körerotia Ana – He Reo Ka Ora – 'He Moemoeä Ngätahi mo te Reo Mäori' this morning in Palmerston North.

Parekura Horomia said the government is committed to working in partnership with whänau, hapü, iwi and Mäori communities to promote the use of the Mäori language.

"Te Reo Mäori is an intrinsic part of tikanga Mäori. It is also important for all New Zealanders as the Mäori language underpins the cultural identity of New Zealand.

"Te Puni Kökiri has been revising the strategy for some time now and is about to begin a series of regional hui to test the direction and aims of the strategy compliment those of the people.

"I believe the government has a role to play in the promotion of the Mäori language however, it is important the revitalisation of te reo be driven by communities. Reo classes are already taking place in homes, halls, sports fields and many other meeting places as communities strive to strengthen their reo.

“The consultation round will help define the roles of government and Mäori so that we can co-ordinate and focus our resources for the betterment of te Reo Mäori, Mäori communities and the nation as a whole," Parekura Horomia said.
