Health Minister Annette King today announced funding of up to $500,000 over three years to help establish a health centre for young people in Wellington city.

The funding has been awarded to the Wellington Youth Service Project to model new approaches to health care for young people.

Ms King said the funding will provide access to a wide range of health and community development services for young people, and she congratulated the project team for its vision.

“This is not just a project for young people. It has been conceived, designed and developed by young people. Their vision, research, and persistence has got them to this point. I’m delighted we are able to help them make it happen. As a community we have to give greater priority to young people’s health,” she said.

“Our research tells us that up to 40 per cent of 12-18 year olds don’t get health care when they need it. That’s partly because of the cost, but also because many young people don’t feel comfortable about seeking help or talking about the things that worry them. There’s no doubt this project is youth-friendly.”

The Wellington Youth Service Project says it will set up a welcoming space where young people can hang out and make contact with a range of services without feeling self conscious or embarrassed.

“Our aim is to look after the whole person,” project team members Lisa Woods and Paul Zoubkov said. “This service is about more than just physical health. We’ll have couches, pool tables, music and free tea and coffee. People will be able to come in and check us out, and if they want they’ll be able to get help or advice without needing an appointment.”

Lisa and Paul said that thousands of young people in Wellington had had an input into shaping the proposed service.

“We’ve had support from the Wellington City Council and Capital and Coast DHB has committed to ensuring the centre’s ongoing sustainability.”
