Justice Minister Phil Goff today welcomed the use of new legislative provisions which enable the Parole Board to defer hearing and parole applications from an inmate serving a life sentence.

The Parole Board yesterday postponed the parole hearing of rapist and murderer Paul Bailey for three years.

Bailey, serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of Otago schoolgirl Kylie Smith in 1991, became eligible for parole after serving 10 years of his sentence.

"A provision in the new Parole Act allows the Board to defer a parole application for up to three years when the applicant is patently unsuited to be considered for release. I am very pleased to see that provision being put to use," Mr Goff said.

"It lessens the trauma faced by the families of victims in cases where it is pointless having a hearing every year for serious offenders who clearly cannot be considered ready to be released back into the community."
