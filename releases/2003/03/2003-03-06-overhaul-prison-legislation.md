Legislation governing prisons is to be overhauled as part of the government's efforts to reform the criminal justice system.

The Corrections Bill introduced into Parliament today will see existing corrections legislation replaced with a simpler, more modern legal framework - a change Acting Corrections Minister Margaret Wilson says is well overdue.

"The corrections system has changed markedly since the current Act was passed in 1954. Current policy and practice in offender management aims to make communities safer and also to reduce re-offending. The law needs to help the Department of Corrections to achieve these aims."

Margaret Wilson said the new legislation covered administration of community-based sentences and orders, as well as prison administration.

"This Bill is the latest part of the government's reforms to the criminal justice system. Other legislation in that reform package includes the Sentencing Act, the Parole Act and the Victims' Rights Act passed last year. All of these measures reflect the government's commitment to creating a criminal justice system that better protects the public and gives greater recognition to the needs of victims."

"The Bill is balanced in its approach to promoting public safety. It includes provisions that improve the security of prisons, such as enhanced search powers, while recognising that offenders must be treated with fairness and humanity, in accordance with international standards."

A purpose clause and a principles clause to govern the operation of the corrections system are included in the new Bill. Margaret Wilson said there was nothing in existing legislation on what principles should guide the administration of sentences and orders.

"The principles clause states that the maintenance of public safety is the paramount consideration in decisions about the management of offenders, and that victims' interests must be considered. It also emphasises the effective rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders."

The Bill will also see an end to the private management of prisons, reflecting the government's view that running prisons is a core activity of the State. The change will take effect from 12 July 2005, the expiry date for Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd's contract for managing Auckland Central Remand Prison.

"Prisons by their very nature involve the use of highly coercive powers against individuals. This government believes that it is inappropriate for private sector organisations to wield such powers."

The Auckland Central Remand Prison is owned by the Corrections Department and would continue to run as it does now but with the Department taking over the management, Margaret Wilson said.

Other changes in the Bill relate to enhancing search powers.

"Despite our best efforts there is still far too much contraband getting into prisons, including drugs and weapons. These enhanced powers should help us stem that problem."

The Bill will permit regulations to be made authorising the use of non-lethal weapons in prisons, but only where the Minister is satisfied that this is compatible with the humane treatment of prisoners, and that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

"Current legislation is inconsistent on this matter, with a complete ban on some non lethal weapons, such as tear gas, and no restrictions at all on others, such as batons. The Corrections Bill will create a more consistent approach that includes safeguards against unsafe or inhumane weapons."

The Bill requires the Department of Corrections to devise individual management plans for all prisoners, and to provide rehabilitative and reintegrative programmes to sentenced prisoners where their sentence plans require, and within the limits of available resources.

Prisoners' minimum entitlements - currently in regulations - are set out in the Bill which also extends these to meet international standards.

The requirement to have an internal complaints system is elevated from regulations to the Bill, and the coverage of the complaints system is expanded to cover people on community based sentences and orders as well as prisoners. The Office of the Ombudsmen will continue to provide an independent avenue for complaints about the corrections system.

Margaret Wilson said the Corrections Bill had been developed over three years, and had included extensive public consultation. It should also make corrections legislation easier to use, she said.

"This Bill will give us a corrections system for the 21st century. While public safety is the paramount concern the Bill also takes a modern approach to the management, rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders."

**Corrections Bill - Background**

**The Corrections Bill is being introduced for four main reasons:**

- ·
- The legislation needs to reflect modern conditions and practices, in particular that rehabilitation has a place alongside containment and security.
- The law governing the administration of the corrections system needs to be compatible, in its philosophy as well as its specific provisions, with the recently enacted Sentencing Act, Parole Act and Victims' Rights Act.
- The Department of Corrections has introduced a new approach to the assessment and management of offenders, which is aimed at improving the Department's contribution to community safety. The legal framework should support this system.
- The many incremental changes over the years have made the Penal Institutions Act complex and difficult to follow.

**The Bill carries forward some provisions from the current legislation, but also introduces a number of changes, of which the most significant are:**

- Unlike the current legislation, it has a purpose clause and a principles clause which would govern the operation of the corrections system. These statements are consistent with the philosophy of the Sentencing Act, Parole Act and Victims' Rights Act, and include a principle that public safety is the paramount consideration in decisions about the management of offenders.
- Private contracting for the management of prisons is not permitted, beyond the expiry of the current contract for the management of Auckland Central Remand Prison in July 2005.
- The Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections, rather than individual prison managers, is made responsible for the legal custody of all offenders. This is administratively simpler, and avoids the need to continually refer in the legislation to the holders of various positions.
- The Department of Corrections is required to devise individual management plans for offenders, and to provide sentenced offenders with rehabilitative and reintegrative programmes, within the limits of available resources.
- The use of non-lethal weapons in prisons may be authorised by regulations, but subject to stringent restrictions and safeguards.
- Offenders' minimum entitlements are based on current regulations and transferred to legislation in accordance with international standards.
- The complaints resolution system has been extended to cover offenders on community-based sentences and orders as well as inmates.
- There are changes to search powers to improve the capacity to detect drugs and other contraband in prisons. Where there are reasonable grounds to believe an inmate is concealing contraband, the Bill permits an enhanced strip-searching procedure to be used.
- The Bill sets out matters to be considered when transferring inmates, including the desirability of location close to their family, and the purposes for which an inmate may be temporarily released.
- There are significant changes to the prison disciplinary offence regime, including provision for legal representation in certain cases, and a single set of clearly specified offences replacing the current two-tier system. It also provides for legally trained Visiting Justices to hear appeals and the more serious and complex cases.
