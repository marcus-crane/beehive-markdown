Lianne Dalziel was commenting on the external migration figures for the month and year to January, released by Statistics New Zealand.

“The figures are showing a 22% drop in the year to January in the number of permanent and long term departures by New Zealanders,” said Lianne Dalziel.

“The number of New Zealanders departing to Australia is now sitting at an eight year low, with nearly 25 percent fewer leaving in the year to January 2003 than the previous year.

“More New Zealanders are also returning home with the trend of an 8% increase on last year’s figures repeating itself in January’s statistics.

Lianne Dalziel said Kiwis returning home contributed to New Zealand’s 39,000 net migration gain in the year to January.

“It is also important to remember that these statistics include anyone expressing an intention to be in New Zealand for 12 months or more, so it extends to temporary residents, including students and work permit holders.”

While New Zealand had seen an increase in permanent and long term arrivals, the trend was lower than the rise recorded between 2001 and 2002, said Lianne Dalziel.
