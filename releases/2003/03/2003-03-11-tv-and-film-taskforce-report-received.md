Creating an environment where jobs and businesses in New Zealand’s film and television industry can grow, is the aim of the Screen Production Industry Taskforce report, said Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“The release of the Screen Production Industry Taskforce report today, is an important milestone in the growth and development of New Zealand’s film and television industry,” said Jim Anderton at the launch of the report at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington.

The Taskforce, one of four established under the Government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, was convened by Jim Anderton and chaired by Julie Christie. It met for 12 months and has members drawn from the industry representing TV and Film production.

The ICT Taskforce will shortly be issuing its final report while the Biotechnology and Design Taskforces will be releasing their reports in the next two months.

The report will now be open for comment and consultation before the Government gives consideration to its response. The report recommends including a long-term approach to growing the industry and investing in the necessary skills and infrastructure required to achieve the goals which the Taskforce has set. Further comment from the industry and related sectors is sought by 22 April.

Screen Production is already a $1.3 billion industry with TV contributing $711 million, and Film/Video $575 million. The Taskforce has set a growth target which would see the Screen Production industry doubling in size within five years. In practical terms that means sustainable foreign exchange earnings of $400 million per annum; 10 companies with an annual turnover of $50 million and another 20 companies with turnover of $10 million.

“This Taskforce is an example of the Government working with the industry – from broadcasters, to production houses, feature film and commercial makers - to chart out a strategy for the long-term growth and success of one of New Zealand’s most dynamic and vibrant flagship industries,” said Jim Anderton.

“Key ministers will now await comment from the Industry before commencing work on the report’s recommendations. Some of the issues in the recommendations have already been addressed by Government. These include the national rollout of broadband in our regions and the implementation of Inland Revenue’s one-stop shop for film taxation.

“Other recommendations such as the creation of a Screen Council and a new training structure need careful investigation but will receive constructive consideration.

“The report’s strategy outlines how the screen production industry can create economic growth and job opportunities and contribute to New Zealand’s economic and cultural well being under the Government’s Growth and Innovation Framework. I encourage everyone working in screen production and associated sectors to read the report and to give feedback through the industry taskforces website,“ he said.

The Growth and Innovation Framework aims to lift New Zealand’s economic performance. Part of that strategy focuses on developing high growth sectors such as the creative industries, including film and television.
