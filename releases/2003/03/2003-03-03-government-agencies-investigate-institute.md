Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today that government agencies are looking into the circumstances surrounding the Columbus Academy in West Harbour.

“The death of a Japanese national at this institute has exposed some worrying concerns both about the facility and the wider immigration issues,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This facility is not registered as a private training institution and has not been approved as an education facility.

“No immigration visas have been issued on the basis of people attending the Columbus Academy, but at least some of the individuals involved do have student permits to attend registered educational facilities. This raises questions as to the status of the institution, and exactly what services it was providing to people attending it.

“Officials from agencies including immigration and education have been brought together today in Auckland to investigate and will report to ministers by early next week.

“Because a police investigation is underway, I cannot comment on the status of individual students and the director of the facility who have been charged with various offences,” Trevor Mallard said.
