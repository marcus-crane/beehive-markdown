The Government today announced a significant new partnership with global IT solutions giant EDS which will see a major client contact centre and software applications development centre being hosted in New Zealand. The development will serve leading international companies and if it meets its targets will see 360 jobs created over three years.

“This is an international vote of confidence in New Zealand’s economic stability and our commitment to partnerships with high growth industries,” says Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton.

The deal announced by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton and EDS sees $1.5 million provided by Investment New Zealand to ensure that the development takes place here in New Zealand.

“If EDS doesn’t meet its targets the money will be refunded.

Jim Anderton said the partnership makes good sense, “this deal is expected to lead to the creation of 360 high skilled ICT jobs over the next three years and will generate more than $200 million of foreign exchange earnings over the next eight years.

“Auckland and Wellington will see direct benefits from the new business that will be attracted to New Zealand, and cities like Christchurch could stand to benefit as well. EDS’ Christchurch centre is already one of the largest BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) centres in the southern hemisphere.”

The capital grant will allow EDS to receive special status, EDS Best Shore , from its parent in the United States. Best Shore status allows EDS (NZ) to attract significant foreign exchange earnings from new and existing international clients as well as EDS businesses worldwide in the client contact and applications development centre areas.

“It’s a welcome investment in the future growth of our information and communications technology (ICT) sector,” Jim Anderton said.

“EDS’ investment means job creation and technology being passed on that will help our efforts to ensure New Zealand capitalises on the innovative, knowledge based sectors in our economy,“ Jim Anderton said.

Intelligent client contact centres, unlike call centres, are at the high end of ICT operations, requiring skilled staff that can offer effective solutions to global clients.

Jim Anderton said that he was particularly pleased that Investment New Zealand will work with WINZ and the Tertiary Education Commission to assist EDS fill up to 30 per cent of the new jobs with unemployed job seekers and migrants who are qualified for this kind of work.
