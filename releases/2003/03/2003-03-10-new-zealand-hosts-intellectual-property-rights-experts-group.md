“I am delighted that New Zealand is hosting the sixteenth meeting of the APEC Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group,” said Associate Minister of Commerce Judith Tizard today.

Judith Tizard opened the meeting this morning of the Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG), which takes place today and tomorrow at the Heritage Hotel, Christchurch.

“The government has identified intellectual property rights as a key feature of its Growth and Innovation Framework,” said Judith Tizard.

“As a small economy, which relies heavily on international trade, New Zealand has a strong interest in promoting effective intellectual property rights at both the domestic and international levels”.

“Intellectual property rights help protect the interests of innovators and creative people in New Zealand. They also help to create an environment that is attractive to investment and to economic growth.”

The Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG) co-ordinates and undertakes the work of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) in relation to intellectual property issues. Hosted by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand, it will be attended by some 47 delegates from 13 countries.

The meeting will focus on a range of policy and technical issues, including:

\- enforcement of intellectual property rights;  
\- new developments in national intellectual property laws;  
\- best practice in the granting and administration of intellectual property rights;  
\- the interface between intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge;  
\- facilitating technology transfer through intellectual property rights.

“Intellectual property issues are increasingly important in international and trade relations. This meeting provides an opportunity for continuing dialogue between intellectual property experts from APEC Economies,” said Judith Tizard.

“As an active participant in the international dialogue on intellectual property rights, New Zealand looks forward to contributing to the work of IPEG in Christchurch and in the future.”
