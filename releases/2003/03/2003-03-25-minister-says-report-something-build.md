The report was tabled in Parliament today along with the 2001/2 financial review of the Building Industry Authority.

Lianne Dalziel says the weathertightness report provided further ideas for the government to consider and develop as it moves to comprehensively address the issues of weathertightness.

“The report has a number of points in common with the discussion document, Better Regulation of the Building Industry in New Zealand, which I launched a fortnight ago.

“However, I make the point again. Weathertightness is a symptom of a much wider problem and we must focus on the broader issues that have been raised before the select committee and elsewhere.”

“The Select Committee made its recommendations after a major exercise which saw it sitting in a number of centres and receiving more than 200 submissions. It has deliberated at length and made more than 60 recommendations.

“I am confident that many of the committee’s recommendations will find their way into the recommendations that I will take to Cabinet as a result of the review of the Building Act,” said Lianne Dalziel.

“I wish to thank the committee and its chair, Hamilton East MP, Dianne Yates, for the work they have put into their weathertightness report,” said Lianne Dalziel.
