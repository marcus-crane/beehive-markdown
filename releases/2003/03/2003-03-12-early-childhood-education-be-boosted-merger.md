Education and State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the integration of the Early Childhood Development agency into the Ministry of Education in a move designed to provide a more cohesive service delivery in early childhood education.

“Last year I announced the ten-year strategic plan for early childhood education which reflects this Government’s desire to significantly increase the participation in and quality of early childhood education services. We know that if kids have the right start in life, and early access to education, the benefits will last a lifetime,” Trevor Mallard said.

“For this reason, this government wants to ensure there is a cohesive, integrated and streamlined approach to the early childhood education strategy, with all the relevant education experts in the public service under the one roof.

“The expertise of the Early Childhood Development agency staff will be critical to delivering on our goals for early childhood education. The agency’s work has focussed on meeting the needs of groups with lower participation rates, and working directly with families – an integral part of the new direction in early childhood education.

“The integration of the agency’s staff into the ministry will enable everyone who works in the area to work closely alongside each other, and will ensure a consistent approach throughout the organisation so everyone will benefit.”

The Early Childhood Development agency, which has around 85 staff nationwide, has operated as a Crown entity since 1990.

“I expect to receive a report on the implementation process for the merger by the end of May and the merger to occur by September 30 this year. The Ministry of Education and State Services Commission will be working closely with the agency, and its staff to make sure the transition is smooth.

“This review also fits in to a work programme of reviews of the state sector which I announced today as State Services Minister. The aim of these reviews is to improve the delivery of government services by identifying opportunities and new approaches for working together,” Trevor Mallard said.
