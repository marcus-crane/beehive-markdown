Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey confirmed that the Cabinet has agreed to a request from Child, Youth and Family (CYF) to conduct a baseline review of the department.

His comments follow a media statement from Green MP Sue Bradford suggesting that a ‘secret’ review of CYF is underway and that no involvement is being sought from the community sector on it.

Steve Maharey said the baseline review is a normal occurrence for a new department and it is proceeding well and will involve seeking the views of the department’s stakeholders.

“The Chief Executive of CYF is on the review team and in fact it was CYF which asked for the baseline review. CYF’s is a new agency and has only been in operation as a separate department for a few years. It is therefore a good time to review it.

“The purpose of the baseline review is to ensure that CYF has the appropriate level of resource to carry out the activities for which it is responsible.

“Both staff and key stakeholders have been kept informed of the existence and progress of the review. A document setting out the objectives, scope and expected outcomes is freely available and has been circulated widely.

*The review will examine what services Child, Youth and Family Services needs to provide or fund, and how these are to be delivered, in order to achieve the desired outcomes. The review looks at how much money is needed to fund these services and how services can be delivered*, the Outline document states,” Steve Maharey said.
