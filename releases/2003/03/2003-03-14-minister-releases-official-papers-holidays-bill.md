Labour Minister Margaret Wilson today released official papers relating to the Holidays Bill on the Beehive website.

“The Holidays Bill completed its first reading in the House last week,” she said, “and I have decided to make the papers publicly available in the spirit of honest and open government.”

The information contained in the papers could also aid public submissions to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee on the Bill, Margaret Wilson said.

Submissions close on Friday, 30 May with the select committee due to report back to the House within six months.
