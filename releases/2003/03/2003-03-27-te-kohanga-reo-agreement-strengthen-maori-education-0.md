Education Minister Trevor Mallard, Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Te Köhanga Reo National Trust executive chair Timoti Karetu today signed a new agreement aimed at strengthening Mäori education and development.

“This Tripartite Relationship Agreement marks a significant opportunity for Government and the National Trust to strengthen its relationship so that quality results - for both whänau and mokopuna - are delivered in Köhanga Reo, as recommended by the joint working group chaired by Sir Rodney Gallen,” the ministers said.

“The agreement focuses on the future and on support for Köhanga Reo whänau. It is strongly linked to the Government’s goal of increasing participation in quality early childhood education, so children have solid foundations for learning and for work later in life.

“The parties to this agreement have a shared vision for the future and this Government is committed to working closely with the trust to deliver on our shared goals,” the ministers said.

In particular, the agreement aims to:

·foster the participation of children and adults in quality early learning within a whänau and Mäori cultural environment,  
·ensure the survival of te reo Mäori and its use within whänau and early childhood education, and  
·foster the participation of Mäori children and adults in quality early learning within a whänau and Mäori cultural environment.

The Gallen report recommended that the broad Mäori development and education aims and objectives of the National Trust and of Köhanga Reo could be better facilitated through a tripartite relationship agreement, involving Te Puni Kökiri.

Under the agreement, a three-year business plan is to be developed. Parties to the agreement will also meet each year to establish, discuss and/or review policy priorities to achieve the goals set out in the agreement.

The ministers also paid tribute to former chief executive of the National Trust Iritana Tawhiwhirangi.

“Over the past 20 years the Köhanga Reo movement under Iritana’s leadership has made a significant contribution to the education and development of children and their whänau. The Government is pleased to be part of these new shared plans to strengthen Mäori education, as Köhanga Reo move into the future,” the ministers said.
