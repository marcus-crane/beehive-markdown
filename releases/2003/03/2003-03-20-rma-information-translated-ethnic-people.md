New Zealand's ethnic communities now have easier access to information on the Resource Management Act (RMA).

The Resource Management Act Education and Advisory Fund has supported 'SustAin', the resource management advisory service provided by the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Centre, to translate leaflets on the RMA into Maori, Samoan, Chinese, Korean, and Hindi.

"This fund helps organisations expand public understanding of the Resource Management Act and improve community access to low cost resource management legal and planning advice," Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said.

SustAin, based in Auckland, works with ethnic communities to help them understand their legal rights.

The translations answer common questions, such as what is a resource consent and how to apply for one, how to prepare an Assessment of Environmental Effects, what is meant by giving affected party approval, how to make a submission, and also includes information on council hearings.

Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said the information gave ethnic people the same tools as the rest of the population.

"It's fantastic to see the Education and Advisory Fund and SustAin working together to meet the needs of ethnic communities," he said.

The leaflets can be obtained from the SustAin office.

The next round for the RMA Education and Advisory Fund closes on May 2. Projects can receive up to $50,000. Information can be obtained from www.mfe.govt.nz (under Working with You) or by contacting Helen Yorke on direct dial (04) 917 7549 or by email helen.yorke@mfe.govt.nz
