Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey today announced the make-up of the boards of Television New Zealand and Transmission Holdings Limited.

Following the passage of the Television New Zealand Act two separate broadcasting and transmission companies will come into effect on 1 July 2003: Television New Zealand (TVNZ), a Crown-owned public broadcasting company responsible for delivering against its charter; and Transmission Holdings Limited (THL), a state-owned enterprise responsible for running a national and international transmission business. Each company is governed by a separate board of directors.

Steve Maharey said the government has reappointed all former TVNZ board members to one or other of the new boards to provide stability as the new company structures bed in, as well as appointing several new members to ensure that the new companies have access to specialist skills at a governance level.

“The separation of TVNZ and THL enables each company to exclusively focus on their core roles. The primary objective of TVNZ will be to give effect to its charter while maintaining commercial performance. THL's purpose will be to operate as a successful business.

“Acting Television New Zealand chair Craig Boyce has been confirmed in the television chair role and will be joined by exisiting board members Dame Anne Hercus, Sarah Reeves, Paul Smith and Trish Stevenson. The government is also appointing Auckland businessman Robert Fenwick (Deputy Chair) and former Reuters senior manager Philip Melchior to the board.

“We have appointed Wayne Brown to chair Transmission Holdings Limited. The board will also comprise exisiting TVNZ board member Russell Hewitt (Deputy Chair) and telecommunications specialist Tony Baird, law partner Wendy Brandon, company director Taari Nicholas, University of Auckland ‘UniSat’ manager Brian Oliver and business consultant Janine Smith.

“In the future we intend to stagger board terms to ensure stability and continuity of both companies’ governance arrangements are maintained when new appointments are made,” Steve Maharey said.
