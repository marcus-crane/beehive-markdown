Health Minister Annette King says a critical step toward improving the mental health of young New Zealanders has been made today with the launch of a new academic centre in Auckland.

The University of Auckland's Werry Centre: for Child and Adolescent Mental Health will provide first-class training and support for the workforce, as well as promote high-quality research into child and youth mental health.

At the same time as launching the new centre today, Ms King also released the report of the Ring-fence Protection Project into the mental health spending of six District Health Boards, saying that child and adolescent mental health was highlighted in the report.

While the report shows that the six DHBs had protected the ring-fenced funding, only 95.5 percent of contracted services were delivered, and overall DHBs incurred deficits in their provider arms, she said. The most significant under-delivery was in the area of child and youth mental health services.

Ms King says the centre is a particularly important development for young New Zealanders, of whom a quarter will experience a significant mental health problem by adolescence, with the workforce currently struggling to meet their needs.

"Workforce levels are still considerably below expected Mental Health Commission Blueprint levels, especially in areas like child and youth community services teams. This centre aims to make a positive difference by fostering innovative workforce development and training opportunities, using sound research so the workforce can respond appropriately to young people's needs and provide the best advocacy possible," says Ms King.

To develop the centre further, a Chair in Child and Adolescent Mental Health will be created with support from Auckland Downtown Rotary and the Ministry of Health. "This person will support the expansion of current research activities and with the further development of teaching already underway it's hoped that in time it will become a 'centre of excellence'," says Ms King.

Child and youth mental health has been a priority area for funding, but the project has shown a significant gap between funding and delivery. Capital and Coast was the only DHB that did not show a shortfall. The shortfalls ranged from 19 percent in Canterbury to 49 percent in Counties Manukau DHB.

"I know the Ministry plans to follow-up on under-delivery in this area and will closely monitor service delivery to ensure we get the services we need. Further work will also be undertaken by the Ministry to improve understanding of why costs are greater than expected," says Ms King.

The project was established after the Mental Health Commission and Ministry raised concerns last August that some DHBs might be spending ring-fenced mental health funds in other health areas. It has reported back that the ring-fence around mental health spending has, in 2001/02, been maintained around mental health money in the six DHBs audited.

Ms King says the six DHBs selected, Capital & Coast Health, Canterbury, Auckland, Waitemata, Counties Manukau and Waikato, were chosen because together they accounted for more than 60 percent of mental health spending.

"I am relieved that the review team says it has been assured that in 2001/02 funds provided for mental health were applied to mental health services.

"While that provides a level of reassurance, identifying and tracking the ring-fenced money remains a very complicated process. The ring-fence is crucial for DHBs and they need to have a transparent system that shows they are meeting their responsibilities.

“The review also looked at DHB plans for mental health service spending in the current financial year. Two of the DHBs, Waikato and Capital & Coast, had approved plans that were within the ring-fence funding expectations. Since then Canterbury DHB has also had its plan, which is within the ring-fence funding expectations, approved. Of the other three Boards reviewed, Auckland and Counties Manukau are changing their draft District Annual Plans to meet the minimum ring-fence expectations. Waitemata is continuing to work with the Ministry through the District Annual Planning process.

"The project has shown how serious we are about this issue. It is very important that the extra money that has flowed into mental health is being spent as intended to improve mental health services," says Ms King.

Ms King says the University of Auckland's new centre should strengthen collaboration between all those in the mental health sector, Government providers, academic institutions, employees and others. "This will lead to a youth mental health workforce well able to meet the expectations of the Blueprint."

Questions and Answers

What are the objectives of the Werry Centre: for Child and Adolescent Mental Health?  
The aim of the Werry Centre: for Child and Adolescent Mental Health is to improve the mental health of young people in New Zealand by  
·providing first-class training to the workforce nationally  
·promoting research of a high quality into child and youth mental health  
·advocating for the mental health needs of children and adolescents.

To develop the Centre further a Chair in Child and Adolescent Mental Health has been created with support from Auckland Downtown Rotary and the Ministry of Health.

Where will the centre be based?  
The Centre is based at, and supported by, Auckland University.

What role will the Ministry of Health and other organisations play in the centre?  
The Ministry of Health is the principal funder of the Werry Centre, and will have a major role monitoring the work to ensure it aligns with the strategic directions of Government. The Centre has a sector advisory group comprising representatives from the child and youth mental health sector (DHB and NGO) as well as specific Maori, Pacific, adolescent consumer and parent representatives. This group will help define the direction of the Centre.

Who can be trained at the centre and what will they learn?  
The Centre provides training opportunities around the country for child and youth mental health workers. A number of notable presenters have already toured the country providing training in areas including parent management training and eating disorders as well as running training days for child and youth mental health workers on a range of topics.

What type of research will be carried out at the centre?  
The Centre will carry out a range of research aimed at improving knowledge about the workforce and training needs of the child and youth mental health workforce as well as improving the quality of service provision. The Centre has just completed a review of the barriers to the development of a psychology workforce, the results of which will inform future workforce development.

Why were only six DHBs chosen for the ring fence review, and what were the criteria?  
In June 2002 six DHBs were selected: Waitemata, Auckland, Counties Manukau, Waikato, Capital & Coast, and Canterbury. They were selected based on the  
following criteria:  
·relative size of the funding levels 2002/03  
·Ministry knowledge about DAP (District Annual Plan) financial planning information supplied by the DHBs  
·Ministry knowledge about funder's reallocation of unspent funding  
·Ministry knowledge about provider financial management proportion of adult population accessing services as reported to the NZ Health Information Service (MHINC database), and  
·completeness of contract delivery data returns to the Ministry.

To what extent were DHBs involved in the project?  
DHBs were intimately involved in this process. The Ministry initially collated information DHBs had provided to the central systems and DHBs were then given the opportunity to verify that information and provide additional information as required. DHBs were then given the opportunity to review and comment on the findings of the analysis of the DHBs information by the Ministry and the Commission. They were then provided with a copy of the report prepared from the updated analysis and given the opportunity to comment. The final report was then prepared.

Why was the project such a complex process?  
The review looked at financial information, contract information and service delivery information. A number of elements were reviewed and or verified.  
The data is held in a variety of different systems, subject to complex accounting conventions, and changes over time. This all required a detailed understanding of the different factors affecting each individual DHB.

What will the Ministry of Health, Mental Health Commission and DHBs be doing next?  
The Ministry will continue its routine monitoring functions on DHB performance and Blueprint implementation. In addition the Ministry will undertake work to improve understanding of the underlying cost structures in DHB mental health services. The Mental Health Commission will continue working with DHBs to develop a better understanding of mental health issues.

What money has the Government set aside for expanding mental health services in New Zealand?  
In the 2000 Budget the Government confirmed it would spend $257.4 million more over the next four years as it implements the Blueprint. The Blueprint  
is already two-thirds implemented.

How much is spent on mental health services each year?  
Spending on mental health has doubled in the last decade. In 1997/98, expenditure was $524 million, including GST. Last year, the Government spent $780 million on mental health services. By 2003/04, it is estimated spending on mental health will stand at about $900 million.

What did the Government do late last year to address delivery of mental health services in Auckland?  
Auckland mental health needs had been outstripping its mental health services, despite significant investments that had been made. As a result, the  
Government authorised $2.8 million in funding tagged for 2003 to be brought forward and used immediately to purchase 20 packages of care in the  
Auckland region. The packages represent services aimed at individuals needing care, rather than concentrating on particular beds in one facility or another. To improve service co-ordination in the area, a Regional Director Mental Health is to be appointed. Interviews are scheduled and will take place shortly.

The Government also brought forward a further $10million, which is available to facilitate service expansion in the Northern and Midland DHBs.

How many people use mental health services in New Zealand?  
On average DHB mental health services across the whole of New Zealand see around 31,500 people (about 0.8% of the population) per month.
