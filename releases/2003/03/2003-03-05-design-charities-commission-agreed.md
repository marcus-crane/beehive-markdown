5 March 2003Media Statement  
Design of Charities Commission agreed

The new Charities Commission should be operational next year after the Cabinet this week signed off the design details, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

“The commission developed out of a recommendation from the charities working party in their report to me last year, and I am delighted to be able to deliver on it,” Dr Cullen said.

“The commission will be responsible for registering organisations seeking charitable status, monitoring their activities, receiving annual returns, providing advice and support to the sector and advising the government on charity-related issues.

“It will be a Crown agent and will have statutory independence in relation to registration decisions but will operate under the aegis of the Minister of Commerce and the Ministry of Economic Development.”

Dr Cullen said the government hoped to have the necessary legislation in the House by mid year.
