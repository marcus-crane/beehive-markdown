New Zealand musicians will perform at major North American music industry showcases this year with the government’s assistance, America’s Cup Minister Trevor Mallard and Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said today.

The government, through the America’s Cup leveraging fund and government agencies, supported the World Series New Zealand music showcases held in Auckland last November for music industry ‘powerbrokers’ from key music trade markets in North America, UK, Europe and Australia.

“Since the successful World Series event, invitations have been extended to New Zealand to showcase at several key music industry events in the strategically important North American market, including South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and Canadian Music Week,” said Trevor Mallard.

“The friends we made through the World Series are helping to open the door to these events. They are enormous allies for getting our bands playing to the right people.”

Judith Tizard said the South by Southwest conference was arguably the most important Artists & Repertoire market in the world. “Proof of its capability to expose new artists to the influential ears of the international music industry is in the success over the past year of two New Zealand bands, The Datsuns and The D4, who performed at SXSW 2002 and will be performing there again this year.

“In addition, goodshirt, Evermore, 8 Foot Sativa, betchadupa and Damien Binder will perform at SXSW. 8 Foot Sativa are currently showcasing their music at Canadian Music Week and Evermore will showcase in Canada after SXSW. Many of the artists have organised further business opportunities and showcases around the world to complement their SXSW appearances.”

The New Zealand Music Industry Commission, Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand are assisting the New Zealand delegations to these events. Additional funds have been allocated from the government’s America’s Cup leveraging fund to capitalise on these opportunities to showcase New Zealand and New Zealand music to the world.

“These showcases are becoming a crucial part of the New Zealand music export calendar. They enable New Zealand bands to travel offshore and showcase to the right people without having to move overseas,” said Trevor Mallard.

“Our agencies are aware of a number of potential licensing, distribution and record deals that are likely to be sealed upon the successful showcasing of New Zealand artists at these events. We also expect further showcase opportunities to arise during the year.”

Judith Tizard said as a small nation with a unique musical voice, it was vital for New Zealanders to use every opportunity to perform our music to a wider audience.

“I’m delighted that the work we have done to boost New Zealand’s music and creative industries through setting up the Music Industry Commission, increasing funding to NZ On Air and supporting the World Series is paying off with these fantastic international opportunities.”
