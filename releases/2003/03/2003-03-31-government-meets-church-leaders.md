Church leaders’ representatives met Acting Housing Minister Steve Maharey today in the first of a series of meetings on housing issues.

Mr Maharey said that the meeting discussed fostering stronger cooperation between the churches and the government, including sharing more information.

“The churches have a vital role to play in providing third sector housing. They are also in a strong position to alert the government to issues they identify through their community work.

“By sharing information through these meetings church leaders can be assured that their work is complementary to the government’s housing work, and that their views inform that work.”

Today’s meeting included representatives from the Anglican, Presbyterian, Catholic, Baptist and Methodist churches, as well as the Salvation Army.

One of the church leaders present, Major Campbell Roberts from the Salvation Army, said the meeting had been a productive one.

“Today’s meeting focussed on how we can build a better partnership between the government and churches on housing issues. The discussion was a fruitful one and we are looking forward to continuing it in subsequent meetings.”

Mr Maharey said that future meetings are to be held quarterly, initially in Wellington with the possibility of alternate meetings in other regions.
