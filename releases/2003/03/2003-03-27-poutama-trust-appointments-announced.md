Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced the appointment of five members to the Poutama Trust responsible for providing business development services to Mäori.

Shane Jones has been reappointed and is Chair for a further four years and Rangimarie Parata has also been reappointed for a further year. John Kahukiwa, Matene Love and Mavis Mullins are new and have each been appointed for four year terms.

"It is critical that government assist and support Mäori in developing their business and enterprise skills. I am keenly aware of the role economic development plays in advancing Mäori development aspirations.

The Poutama Trust was set up in 1988 as a Charitable Trust to focus on the development of micro and small Mäori businesses to foster an enterprise culture among young Mäori.

It is currently involved in a wide range of activities that strive towards these goals through working strategically with businesses, enterprise agencies, government agencies and key organisations.

"Poutama Trust since its establishment has been an important vehicle for developing the business talents and skills of Mäori, so they can fully participate in the economic growth of Maori and the country as a whole.

"I would like to thank Ray Chappell and Ben Paki for their contribution during their time as Trustees," Parekura Horomia said.
