Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia suggested that whanau development calls for a revolution in the thinking of tangata whenua, in her closing address to the Hui Whakapumau Whanau (National Whanau Development Hui) in Otaki.

Summarising discussions among 250 community leaders and whanau members, Mrs Turia said tangata whenua ‘have to change our mindsets, as does the Crown.’

“The Crown needs to consider the whole range of programmes that it is imposing on our people. It is timely that we should heed the voices of the people in the hui and enable them to develop, and to heal and resolve the issues within whanau, and to build their capability so that they can liberate themselves.

Tariana Turia said tikanga Maori, or Maori values, suggest the best approach is to focus on strengths, potential and talent in whanau.

“Only you, in the end, can develop yourselves,” she said.

“I am inspired by the call to unlock the creative potential, and liberating ourselves as tangata whenua – realizing how much we have developed ourselves already and capturing the excitement that drives us today.

“The Prime Minister made an important policy statement at last night’s dinner, in reference to the Waiapu Work Trust. She said that we need to find ways of ensuring better delivery to people like these.

“Liberation may mean we need to disengage from the prepackaged interventions that are currently on offer. Feedback from many of the workshops questioned the nature of state intervention – as someone said earlier in the hui:

‘Is it for Maori by Maori with someone else’s approval?’

Mrs Turia also noted that the hui had raised the question of what part tikanga Maori played in developing a framework for Maori liberation.

She warned against adopting terms like whanau to cover Maori groups that were based on common interests, rather than whakapapa or kinship.

“I get tired of those who talk of romanticised notions of whanau. Being whakapapa based is not a soft option – it does not mean that you accept everyone’s behaviour.”

“While I have referred to the notion of kaupapa whanau, it is a notion that I do not subscribe to myself. We have to look for new words, or revive old ones as Hana O’Regan said, to define our current relationships.

“Who do we become when we redefine the concept of whanau?”

Mrs Turia thanked participants, their hosts at Te Wananga o Raukawa, and Te Puni Kokiri officials who organized the hui, for launching an ongoing debate.

“I want to tell you that our korero is only beginning.

“I want to involve many more people back in the waa-kainga and we would like your support for a series of hui in each of our regions.

“We have recorded all the korero in speeches and the workshops and you will all receive copies of this material in the post, to discuss further with your whanau.

“You will see from these notes that there is a lot we need to do.

“We intend creating an action plan and we will continue to keep in contact with you about this. I encourage you all to keep in touch with us as well.

“I don’t think any of us can say that we have all the answers – but we can commit to working together to find them,” she said.
