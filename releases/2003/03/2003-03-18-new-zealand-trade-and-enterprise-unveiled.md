The new organisation formed by the merger of Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand would be called New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Ministers Jim Anderton and Jim Sutton said today.

The bill to bring about the merger, ‘The Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand Integration Bill,’ was introduced to Parliament by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton two weeks ago.

“This Labour Progressive Government promised businesses a one stop shop for seeking advice and information on how to develop their enterprises. We know this can maximise jobs and business growth and that businesses will benefit from having advice under one roof,” said Jim Anderton.

“We are committed to assisting exporting businesses make the most of their opportunities. Amalgamating business capability advice along with exporting support will be beneficial to trading ability,” said Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton.

The board of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will announce the appointment of its CEO in a separate statement.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, which will be established on 1 July 2003, will deliver the services currently provided by Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand through the new integrated organisation.

Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand will be dissolved under the Bill, which provides for the repeal of the New Zealand Trade Development Board Act 1988 and the Industry New Zealand Act 2000.

Jim Anderton said the Crown entity structure was seen as the most appropriate for NZ Trade and Enterprise because it would allow it to develop a strong commercial culture and to build and maintain credibility with business networks. Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand are also both Crown entities.

NZ Trade and Enterprise will be governed by a board appointed by the responsible Ministers. A new board governing the operations of Industry New Zealand, Trade New Zealand, Investment New Zealand and overseeing the establishment of the new organisation, was set up late last year.

Both the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be responsible for purchase advice, monitoring and evaluation. These functions will be strengthened with the appointment of the chief executives of both Ministries as advisers to the Board of NZ Trade and Enterprise.

Jim Anderton said NZ Trade and Enterprise will be responsible for developing and implementing trade, industry, and regional development policies in partnership with industry, businesses, iwi, central and local government, and relevant community groups.

The functions of NZT&E include:  
·contributing to a supportive environment for sustainable economic growth  
·providing a conduit for input and advice from industry, local government, and relevant community groups on programmes to implement the Government’s policies for economic, industry and regional development  
·enhancing industry, regional enterprise and entrepreneurial capabilities by providing information, and facilitating access to skills, expertise, and resources  
·contributing to increased exports from, and investment in New Zealand by strengthening global linkages through trade and investment promotion and providing targeted market development assistance

Jim Sutton said New Zealand businesses and our economy would benefit from an organisation that provides seamless, flexible and responsive service delivery to businesses throughout their life cycle, from start-up to global player.

“A substantial service network will be maintained within and outside New Zealand to deliver the level of service required by New Zealand business,” he said.
