Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard today congratulated Alinghi on its successful challenge for the America’s Cup and paid tribute to Team New Zealand for its efforts in defending the cup for New Zealand.

“The Alinghi team, skippered by Russell Coutts, showed expertise and determination on the water. Their experience and the decisive nature of their victory is something all New Zealanders can admire,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Team New Zealand, with Dean Barker at the helm, fought hard, displaying courage in challenging circumstances.

“The fact that we were in a position to defend the cup twice is a testament to New Zealanders’ international prowess in yachting’s most elite competition, and that is something we can all celebrate.

“I’m sure New Zealanders will be disappointed that Team New Zealand lost this particular battle.

“But kiwis are good sports at heart and we can appreciate and respect the skills and resolve of both teams in what has been a dramatic contest on the Hauraki Gulf.

“We can all be incredibly proud of Team New Zealand who brought the America’s Cup to New Zealand and who have been fantastic ambassadors for us internationally.

“Their knowledge and talent puts them amongst the best in the yachting world, and I’m sure that New Zealanders admire them both as a team and as individuals.

“Team New Zealand has brought permanent economic benefits to New Zealand with the focus that has gone on New Zealand’s high value tourism and our world-class boat building industry, in particular. The spin-offs from New Zealand hosting the Louis Vuitton and America’s Cup regattas will be enduring.

“Thanks also to Aucklanders who have played host to our international visitors and helped make this event,” Trevor Mallard said.
