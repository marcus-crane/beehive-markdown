National MP Richard Worth claims 85% of the Auckland District Law Society's 3500 members support the retention of appeals to the Privy Council.

The Auckland District Law Society has advised the Attorney-General's office that:

It has around 3600 members.

That it received 610 responses to the survey about Privy Council appeals, ie from about 17% of it's membership.

Of those, 85% of the 610 responses supported retention of appeals, ie about 14% of the ADLS membership.

And that about 55 ADLS members were present at Wednesday's ADLS AGM, ie about 1.5% of the ADLS membership.
