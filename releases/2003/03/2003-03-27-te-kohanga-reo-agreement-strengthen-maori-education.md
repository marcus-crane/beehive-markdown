Education Minister Trevor Mallard, Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and Te Köhanga Reo National Trust executive chair Timoti Karetu today signed a new agreement aimed at strengthening Mäori education and development.

"This Tripartite Relationship Agreement marks a significant opportunity for Government and the National Trust to strengthen its relationship so that quality results - for both whänau and mokopuna - are delivered in Köhanga Reo, as recommended by the joint working group chaired by Sir Rodney Gallen," the ministers said.

"The agreement focuses on the future and on support for Köhanga Reo whänau. It is strongly linked to the Government's goal of increasing participation in quality early childhood education, so children have solid foundations for learning and for work later in life.

"The parties to this agreement have a shared vision for the future and this Government is committed to working closely with the trust to deliver on our shared goals," the ministers said.

In particular, the agreement aims to:

- foster the participation of children and adults in quality early learning within a whänau and Mäori cultural environment,
- ensure the survival of te reo Mäori and its use within whänau and early childhood education, and
- foster the participation of Mäori children and adults in quality early learning within a whänau and Mäori cultural environment.

The Gallen report recommended that the broad Mäori development and education aims and objectives of the National Trust and of Köhanga Reo could be better facilitated through a tripartite relationship agreement, involving Te Puni Kökiri.

Under the agreement, a three-year business plan is to be developed. Parties to the agreement will also meet each year to establish, discuss and/or review policy priorities to achieve the goals set out in the agreement.

The ministers also paid tribute to former chief executive of the National Trust Iritana Tawhiwhirangi.

"Over the past 20 years the Köhanga Reo movement under Iritana's leadership has made a significant contribution to the education and development of children and their whänau. The Government is pleased to be part of these new shared plans to strengthen Mäori education, as Köhanga Reo move into the future," the ministers said.

**SHARED VISION FOR THE FUTURE**  
"Whänau ana te tamaiti, me rarau atu, whakamau ki te u, kei reira ka timata i te korero Mäori"

'The Köhanga Reo movement is a living expression of the dreams of the Old People. It is also a means of preserving the tongue of the Land without which a whole dimension of our country would be lost'[1](#1)

1. Both the Government/Crown and Te Köhanga Reo National Trust share a vision of the future where:
   
   - mokopuna are provided the early foundations necessary to grow into successful and contributing adults of the future in both Mäori and Pakeha worlds;
   - mokopuna grow within a supportive and flourishing community (whänau, hapü and iwi); and
   - te reo me ngä tikanga Mäori is vibrant and celebrated within New Zealand.
2. This vision is important for building New Zealand as a nation and strengthening New Zealand's participation in a global society both now and in the future. Whänau are the starting point for the future survival of Mäori culture.
3. Köhanga Reo is integral to the achievement of this vision for the future. Köhanga Reo provides an opportunity whereby mokopuna at an early age have the opportunity to understand that they are Mäori, to be immersed in their language, customs and values, and to celebrate ähuatanga Mäori within the bosom of their whänau, hapü and iwi.
4. Iwi and hapü are fundamental to the cultural integrity and kaupapa of the köhanga movement and it is recognised that they form part of the community in which Köhanga Reo exist. This agreement aims to strengthen relationships with iwi, hapü and kaupapa Mäori-based education sector organisations and to build on each other's respective aspirations to support the early learning and development of Mäori children.
5. This agreement acknowledges each party's autonomous governance role. It recognises that by using our combined strengths and resources in a way that is collaborative and constructive, we are able to pursue multiple pathways to achieve a shared vision for the future.
6. Giving effect to this vision reflects the principles inherent in the Treaty of Waitangi.

**SHARED OUTCOMES**  
*"Kia tu rangatira ai te ao Mäori"*

1. To achieve our shared vision for the future both the Government/Crown and the Te Köhanga Reo National Trust agree to work together in a way that provides greater recognition and support for the following shared outcomes:
   
   *Mäori Language Development* - Ensure the survival of te reo Mäori and its use within the whänau and early childhood domains.
   
   *Mäori development* - Recognise and support the holistic development of köhanga reo whänau as integral to the development of the child and as a fundamental aspect of Mäori development.
   
   *Education* - Foster the participation of Mäori children and adults in quality early learning within a whänau and Mäori cultural environment.

**SHARED GOALS**  
*"Ko te pae tawhiti, whaia kia tata; ko te pae tata, whakamaua kia tina"*

1. The Government/Crown and Te Köhanga Reo National Trust's shared goals are to:
   
   - Promote participation and quality learning in te reo Mäori within köhanga reo for köhanga whänau.
   - Support the development of strong, skilled and vibrant whänau that contribute positively to society (whänau development).
   - Support and strengthen the capacity of whänau to ensure quality services are delivered in köhanga reo that benefit mokopuna.
   - Work collaboratively with other sectors in the community where possible to ensure the health and wellbeing of mokopuna is maintained.
   - Strengthen relationships with iwi, hapü and kaupapa Mäori-based education sector organisations in recognition of each other's respective aspirations for the early learning of Mäori children
2. These goals will form the basis of a shared and more operational agreement (three-year business plan) reviewed annually that will support the Tripartite Relationship Agreement.

**SHARED PRINCIPLES**

1. All parties to this Agreement recognise and accept the following principles as underpinning the tripartite relationship:
   
   - That meeting the early learning and development needs of the child within a kaupapa Mäori/whänau development model is at the crux of this Agreement.
   - The role of whänau in nurturing and caring for mokopuna within a learning environment is vital.
   - The needs of köhanga whänau include but go beyond education.
   - Recognition and mutual commitment to a formative but enduring relationship that requires open dialogue, growth and commitment to change where change is required to ensure the best interests of the whänau and mokopuna are being met.
   - A need to continuously set and reflect on mutually desired outcomes and strategies for sustainable improvement supported by sound research, accurate and informative data (both qualitative and quantitative), and robust monitoring and evaluation information

**SHARED VALUES**  
*"Näu te rourou, näku te rourou, ka ora te manuhiri"*

1. The following values underpin the Relationship Agreement and will guide the interactions between each party to the Agreement both now and in the future.
   
   - He taonga, he mokopuna - children are a taonga to be nurtured and cherished and our work will ensure their best interests are paramount.
   - Ko te pae tawhiti whäia kia tata - focusing on the bigger picture.
   - Kia tika o mahi - having confidence in each other.
   - Ma pango, ma whero, ka oti te mahi - working together, sharing knowledge and advice.
   - Nau töu rourou - bringing solutions.
   - Whaia te iti kahurangi - seeking high standards, focusing on quality and learning from mistakes.

**SHARED VALUES**

1. The Government/Crown and Te Köhanga Reo National Trust:
   
   - acknowledge and respect this arrangement in utmost good faith and will endeavour to keep each other informed about important education and Mäori development policies and issues, particularly those that might impact on each others core business;
   - recognise that differences in views, understandings and priorities will be an ongoing part of the relationship but that a willingness to listen and be inclusive of a diversity of views is expected from all parties;
   - have a good understanding about what each other is able to bring to the relationship and share the best both parties have to offer;
   - share a responsibility towards each other and to whänau, hapü and iwi to ensure the early learning and development needs of the child/whänau are met.
   - value their relationship and recognise the role each other plays in contributing to the development of whänau, hapü and iwi, to language revitalisation, and to ensuring the best early learning outcomes for Mäori children under 5.

**IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AGREEMENT**

1. Representatives from each party to this agreement will meet annually to establish, discuss and/or review policy priorities to achieve the shared goals and expectations established through this Agreement.
2. As a result of this meeting a business plan will be negotiated, resourced and reviewed annually. It will also include each party's roles and responsibilities in delivering on the actions in the business plan.
