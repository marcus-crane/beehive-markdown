Health Minister Annette King says she is pleased to announce that all 21 District Health Boards have now agreed to adopt national arrangements for the National Pharmacy Contract.

Until now only 15 of the DHBs had accepted the arrangements.

“The six DHBs will start working with the pharmacies immediately to complete this process, which will provide national consistency,” said Ms King.
