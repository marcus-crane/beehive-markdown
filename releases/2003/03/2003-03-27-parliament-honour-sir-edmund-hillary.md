Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that official functions will be held in Wellington on Monday to honour Sir Edmund Hillary and his fifty years of achievement since ascending Mt Everest.

At midday on Monday, Sir Edmund and Lady Hillary will travel from Ballance St on to Lambton Quay in central Wellington, and then on to Parliament. They will be accompanied by members of the Nepalese, Indian, Sikh, and Solomon Island communities, and representatives of the mountaineering community.

At Parliament the party will be met by Helen Clark, followed by a powhiri and speeches. Following that, there will be an official luncheon in the Beehive Banquet Hall.

Helen Clark said that Sir Edmund’s achievements as a climber and explorer were immense.

“He has also made an enormous contribution to the people of Nepal through his charitable works. All New Zealanders can take huge pride in his achievements.

“Monday’s parade and luncheon are part of a series of events organised in New Zealand and overseas around the fiftieth anniversary of Sir Edmund’s ascent of Mt Everest on 29 May to honour his achievements.

“These events are evidence of the enormous regard and affection in which Sir Edmund is held, not only in New Zealand but also throughout the world where he is regarded in the highest esteem.

“Monday’s ceremony gives the people of Wellington and New Zealand an opportunity to thank Sir Edmund for the contribution he has made to New Zealand, and to wish him, Lady Hillary and his family, all the best for the years ahead,” Helen Clark said.

Members of the public are invited to be part of Monday’s parade through central Wellington, and to witness the ceremony on the steps of Parliament.
