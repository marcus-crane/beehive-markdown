The report, by Infometrics, was commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Development to provide independent input into the Post-2005 Tariff Review to assist officials in developing recommendations.

Ministers said the release would give all stakeholders equal access to the same information.

“The Tariff Review has been an open and consultative process – hence our decision to release this document.

“The Infometrics Report is an important part of the information base for the Review and will be one of a number of sources drawn on in the officials’ report. I must stress, however, that the report does not represent Government policy on tariffs,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Ministers said anyone wanting to make further submissions to the Tariff Review in light of the release of the Infometrics report, should do so by 10 April 2003.

Submissions on the report can be made in writing to the Ministry of Economic Development or by visiting the tariff review webpage at: www.med.govt.nz/buslt/tariffs/review/ where a copy of the Infometrics report is also available.
