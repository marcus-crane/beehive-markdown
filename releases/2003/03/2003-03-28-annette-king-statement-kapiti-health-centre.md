Health Minister Annette King says the Government will not tolerate an agreement that apparently bans women from the construction site of Capital and Coast District Health Board’s new Kapiti Health Centre in Paraparaumu.

Ms King said the agreement had apparently been reached between the contractor and Te Ati Awa ki Whakarongotai kaumatua.

“While this Government respects the views of others, we live in a modern secular society.

“It is not acceptable in this day and age, when we have women cabinet ministers, women chief executives, and women builders, to ban women from a construction site.

“It will not be tolerated, and the Government will not accept that such an agreement is binding.

“I will expect to see women going about their business on the site when I make my own visit to it at some time in the future,” said Ms King.

Ms King said any further comment on the issue would be made by Capital and Coast Health chief executive Margot Mains.
