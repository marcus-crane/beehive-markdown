“The multi-million dollar painted apple moth eradication campaign is being carried out because of the projected cost to the environment and the economy,” says Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard.

“I am aware of the health concerns of central Aucklanders and I am sympathetic to those concerns. The government is not ignoring Aucklanders’ health needs. It is important to remember that of the $90 million being spent on the PAM eradication project, around $10 million is being spent on health.

“Meanwhile the Ministry of Health is commissioning another independent study on the health effects of the campaign,” says Judith Tizard.

“The painted apple moth represents a projected cost to the economy of up to $358 million over the next 20 years. New Zealand’s indigenous forests, including the Waitakere Ranges, are also at threat from damage caused by the moth.

“We can’t afford to be complacent about biosecurity, which is why we have so far spent $50 million more on biosecurity measures than the previous National-led government.

“We have also spent $1 million on research about sea containers to work out how pests are coming in this way, how to contain them and how to stop them coming in and establishing.”

Because of recent finds of painted apple moth caterpillars in the Point Chevalier-Westmere area, the aerial spraying zone was extended into the Auckland Central Electorate, including the top of Point Chevalier, Westmere, parts of Ponsonby, Grey Lynn and Herne Bay.

“Our original eradication programme, which started in January 2002 covering 600 hectares, has reduced the moth population dramatically.

“I encourage Auckland Central residents who have questions to get in touch with the free advisory service set up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for people in the immediate spray and potential spray drift area. Appointments can be made by phoning 358 3206, between 7am-7pm and from 6am on spray mornings.”
