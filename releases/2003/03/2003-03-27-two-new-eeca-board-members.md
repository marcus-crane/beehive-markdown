Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today announced the appointment of two new members to the board of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA).

One new member, Dennis Parker, is a self-employed sustainable business consultant. He was general manager of Macpac Wilderness Equipment Ltd from 1998 to 2002. Mr Parker has significant experience in planning and strategic development in an innovative organisation.

The other new member, Russell Longuet, has a strong background in industrial processes and large scale production. He is employed by Carter Holt Harvey as energy manager, based in Auckland. Mr Longuet's background is in electrical engineering, merchant banking and consulting. In his current role he represents industry, business and consumers interests and will bring an understanding of viable energy efficiency options to the board. He is also on a number of key advisory groups to the Electricity Industry Governance Project.

Mr Hodgson said the high calibre of nominations for the board positions reflected the increasing importance of energy management in the New Zealand economy.

Mr Parker and Mr Longuet replace two board members, Jan Wright and Gerry Ryan, who have resigned from the EECA board after serving almost three years.

"I am very grateful for Jan Wright's and Gerry Ryan's contribution and I welcome the new members to the board," Mr Hodgson said. "I am also pleased that EECA chairman Mike Underhill, who had given notice of his resignation, has agreed to extend his term to oversee 2003-04 business planning and contribute to winter 2003 electricity management."
