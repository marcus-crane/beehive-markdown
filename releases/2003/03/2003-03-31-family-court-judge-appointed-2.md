Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Vivienne Ullrich QC as a Family Court Judge.

Ms Ullrich, who was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 2000, has practised as a barrister sole since 1990. She was a part-time member of the Removal Review Authority and the Residence Appeal Authority from 1993 until 2001 when she was appointed to the Law Commission.

Her career has been mostly in litigation, principally in family law, but also in the employment and commercial law areas. She has also taught in the Auckland and Victoria University Law Faculties and briefly lectured in London.

Ms Ullrich has written extensively on family law issues in legal journals and texts. She has been actively involved in Law Society Committees and was a founding member of the Executive of the Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society.

The new judge, who will be sworn in on 2 May, will sit in Wellington.
