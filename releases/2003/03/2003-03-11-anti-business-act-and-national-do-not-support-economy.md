Anti business parties ACT and National have shown they really aren’t committed to our economy says Jim Anderton.

Rodney Hide has again attacked this Labour Progressive Government working with business to create jobs.

“When ACT was supporting the National Party led Government there was no support for businesses or jobs. But the ACT-supported 1999-2000 budget included $12.9 billion on welfare spending, or 37 per cent of total government spending at that time, a legacy of the unemployment created by policies of the 80s and 90s.

“ACT and National clearly support government’s "intervening" in the economy but not if it involves making the economy stronger.

“The 2002-2003 budget which I am proud to be associated with, will spend $112 million on Vote Industry and Regional Development, equal to about 0.3 per cent of total government spending in this financial year which ends on 30 June.

“What this Labour-Progressive government is doing to encourage growth in this area isn't a major intervention in the economy. It is a sensible and targeted effort to bolster development which will help create jobs and reduce the size of future years' unemployment costs - both human and financial,” said Jim Anderton.
