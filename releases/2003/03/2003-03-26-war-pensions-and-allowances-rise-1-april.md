All war pensions and associated allowance payments will rise from 1 April as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, Veterans’ Affairs Minister George Hawkins says.

“The increase of 2.72 per cent in net rates equates to the increase in the cost of living for the year to December 2002 as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI),” Mr Hawkins said.

Examples of the increases in the weekly rates include:

·An increase of $4.23 to $159.76. for veterans on a 100 per cent War Disablement Pension  
·$6.77 to $255.62 for veteran in a 160 per cent War Disablement Pension For a person receiving a Surviving Spouse’s Pension the increase is $3.12 to $117.85.  
·An increases of $7.84 to $295.90 in the Attendant’s Allowance

In line with the CPI increase, the Clothing, Travel and Funeral Grants allowances will also rise.

Adjustment of war pensions and allowances occur annually.

As well as an increase in war pensions and allowances, preferential health care is available to veterans on a War Disablement Pension for a recognised disability.

“Treatment costs for recognised disabilities are fully funded, including the cost of pharmaceuticals and appliances as well as access to surgery in private hospitals if public hospital care is unavailable,” Mr Hawkins said.
