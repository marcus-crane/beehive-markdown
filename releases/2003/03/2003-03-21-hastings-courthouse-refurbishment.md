The long-awaited upgrade of the Hastings courthouse has been given the green light, Courts Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

Planning work should commence in May or June this year.

Court users will be consulted about their needs and options for upgrading will be developed from those discussions.

The Department for Courts hopes to be in a position to call tenders for construction work next year, once plans have been finalised and costed.

Margaret Wilson visited the court in Hastings today.

"This coalition government is committed to investing in regional communities, where infrastructure has been allowed to decay for too long. Upgrading work is also planned for courts at Gisborne, Greymouth and Dargaville.

"I am well-aware that extensive upgrading of the Hastings courthouse is very much needed," Margaret Wilson says. "The court carries the workload of a larger town, similar to Palmerston North's, and this workload puts considerable strain on existing limited facilities."

Originally a one-storey structure, the Hastings courthouse is a traditional 1960s design and was opened in 1972. The building was modernised in 1988 to allow for two additional Judge's Chambers and a staff room on what is now the second floor. The administration area on the ground floor was also extended and a Family Court added.
