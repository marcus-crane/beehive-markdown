Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming the formation today of the Parenting Council – a new lobby group which aims to empower parents and give a higher public profile to the importance of positive parenting.

Foundation members of the Council are the Parents Centre, Parenting with Confidence, the Pacific Foundation, Parent to Parent and “Triple P”. The Council is being financially supported by the Tindall Foundation.

Steve Maharey said the government agrees that sound parenting is essential if children are to grow up to be dependable and successful adults.

“The knowledge economy is born in the home, is nurtured by parents and supported by strong families. Parents in New Zealand have a critical role to play, so raising public awareness and improving public understanding of family issues are vital tasks.

“The formation of the Parenting Council signals a resurgence of interest in parenting issues which the government welcomes.

“We currently invest around $43 million in parent support and education and we expect this investment will grow with the formation of the Families Commission which will have a very strong positive parenting focus.

“The formation of the Parenting Council will ensure that there will be another independent voice advocating on the importance of parenting to the future of our society,” Steve Maharey said.
