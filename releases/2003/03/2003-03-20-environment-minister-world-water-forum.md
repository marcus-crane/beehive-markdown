Environment Minister Marian Hobbs leaves tomorrow to attend a two-day ministerial conference of the third World Water Forum in Kyoto, Japan.

This year is the United Nations International Year of Freshwater and the conference will be the largest international water-related event of the year. More than 100 ministers are expected to attend.

"Our participation demonstrates our commitment to the sound management of fresh water and conveys a sense of solidarity and cooperation with countries facing water problems," Marian Hobbs said. "The conference theme, 'Water for the Future', fits well with the government's Sustainable Development Programme of Action where water is identified as one of the four priority areasa for action."

The minister returns to New Zealand on Monday morning.
