Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced his preliminary decisions about the review of Taranaki coastal schools in Opunake, aimed at ensuring high quality education for young people in the area.

“It has been a long process for Opunake schools, but the consultations have now got to the point where I can make my preliminary decisions known, ” Trevor Mallard said.

“I want sustainable schooling well into the future, and I want to create the conditions which will give the best chance for quality education for young people in coastal Taranaki.

“With that in mind, I am proposing to reduce the number of state schools in the area from twelve to nine. I am also proposing to create fresh starts for the five schools which face change, by closing each of them rather than merging them, and re-establishing new schools in their place.

“I have taken this preliminary decision because of falling rolls in the Opunake area, which look set to continue to fall into the future. There are also a number of small schools in relatively close proximity to each other which are using more resources than a smaller number of larger schools would use. Smaller schools are also known to be more vulnerable in terms of the quality of education they can consistently deliver,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard also announced that two further reviews would take place in Taranaki in 2003/4.

“The current review has highlighted that coastal schools are not alone in the challenges and change they will encounter over the next few years. I have therefore asked the Ministry of Education to initiate two new reviews of schools, between Pungarehu and Omata and in the primary schools to the east of the current review area between Hawera and Stratford.”

Some of the schools which are left unchanged in the Minister’s current proposals would be involved in the future reviews.

The coastal schools are now invited to comment on the Minister’s preliminary decision.

“The Ministry of Education will consult schools on my behalf and at this stage I am still open to further information and opinions,” Trevor Mallard said.

(i)retain a full primary school at Pungarehu until at least the end of 2004, but include this school in a further network review of schools between Pungarehu and New Plymouth;
