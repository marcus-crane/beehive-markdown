Today's announcement brings together the hard work that Auckland and the government have undertaken over the last four years to resolve the region's infrastructure and population needs, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

"I want to thank Auckland's local leaders past and present for the huge amount of energy and planning they have put into the work we are announcing today," said Judith Tizard. "I believe that the will to find a way forward has always been there, but the existing structures have made it difficult to effectively implement improved services and infrastructure.

"This funding and governance package amounts to an extra $1.62 billion over ten years for Auckland. It recognises that planning, funding, integration and governance limitations have all been part of the problem, and that resolving those issues will be the way to find the solution."

Judith Tizard said she expects the new level of commitment to start making a real difference within five years to how Aucklanders live, work and play in their region. "As an Aucklander I am determined that the beautiful city I grew up in will be clean, accessible and still beautiful into the future.

"I want to assure the hundreds of Aucklanders I have met with over the last four years and the many more who have written to the government that today's announcement is not 'more of the same'," said Judith Tizard. "This work represents a tangible shift in focus - it's about getting the human scale back into planning, and making this region work for the people who live in it.

"The next step is for all Aucklanders to put serious consideration into what this package means for them. Decisions need to be made quickly and Aucklanders have a role in that decision-making during next year's local body elections.

"We've got years of neglect to catch up on. It's vital that we continue to work together to ensure that Auckland, which is New Zealand's only internationally-competitive region, can go back to supporting development across the whole of New Zealand in the shortest time possible. Auckland is pivotal to the economic and social wellbeing of the whole country."
