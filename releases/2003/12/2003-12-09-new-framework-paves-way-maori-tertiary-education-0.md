A framework to improve the responsiveness of tertiary education to Mäori was launched this evening by Associate Education Ministers Parekura Horomia and Steve Maharey.

The Framework builds on the work started through the Hui Taumata Mätauranga held in Taupo earlier this year and brings together thinking on Mäori tertiary education developed by Mäori from throughout the country. It was developed independently by a Mäori Tertiary Reference Group chaired by leading educationalist Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith.

Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia said the Framework is an exciting development for Mäori education.

“This is the first resource of its kind to be developed to connect Mäori communities, tertiary education organisations, industry and business together.

“It highlights the need for greater representation of Mäori in positions of authority and leadership within the tertiary sector. Tertiary education also needs to provide positive experiences for Mäori,” Parekura Horomia said.

Steve Maharey said the government anticipates that the framework will stimulate debate and discussion amongst iwi and Mäori communities and that this will in turn lead to richer discussions with tertiary education providers.

"We want this Framework to act as a catalyst for change in the tertiary sector. Following the passage of the tertiary education reforms there is widespread community expectation that tertiary education will more closely meet workforce development, industry and community needs.

“Mäori have been very clear that they want educational development to address their needs. The strength of this Framework is that it has been developed independently of government and is now being presented to the tertiary education sector as a guide for its future development,” Steve Maharey said.
