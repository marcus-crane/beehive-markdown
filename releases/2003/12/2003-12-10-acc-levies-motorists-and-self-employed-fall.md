Motorists, the self-employed, earners and businesses will welcome [ACC levies for 2004/2005](http://www.acc.co.nz/productslevies/news/acc-levy-rates-2004-05/) that are lower or the same as the current levies, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

- The average total levy for motor vehicles (made up of the licensing fee and petrol excise tax) will fall by 6.8 per cent from $211.95 to $197.50.
- The average total self-employed levy will drop by 2.2 per cent from $3.17 to $3.10 per $100 of liable earnings.
- The average total employers’ levy (which funds all work-related injuries except to the self-employed) will remain at $1.21.
- The total earners’ levy (which funds all non-work injuries to earners) will remain at $1.20.

All rates exclude GST, except the earners’ levy.

Ruth Dyson said this year's levy rates, which were recommended by ACC in October, continue a trend of stable or reducing levies.

"The new levies will provide ongoing stability for businesses and the self-employed so that they can plan ahead with certainty. At the same time, they will enable ACC to carry on with its strong injury prevention focus, and provision of effective rehabilitation and fair compensation for people who are injured.”

Ms Dyson cautioned that, in spite of the overall trend for lower levies, some industry groups would face rate increases because of their injury experience.

She said ACC levies were low compared with overseas premium rates, including those in Australia.

“Average employer premium rates in Australian states over the last two to three years range from $A1.55-$A3.04 per $100 payroll, compared with ACC's total employers’ levy of $1.21.”

The new rates come into force on 1 April 2004, except for the motor vehicle levy which applies from 1 July 2004.

The new levies by industry classification are available in the Products and Levies section of ACC's website: [www.acc.co.nz](http://www.acc.co.nz)
