Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor is challenging his Parliamentary colleagues and all adults to moderate their drinking behaviour this holiday season, as a model to young people.

At a Beehive function today, Damien O’Connor challenged his parliamentary colleagues to take the lead and model the kinds of drinking behaviours that communities want young people to adopt.

Mr O'Connor said that binge drinking by young people often attracted strong media interest, but that young people themselves regard media interest as hypocritical.

"Research has shown that the drinking habits of young people are often very similar to those of their parents and other adult role models. It's just that young people more often drink in public places.

“My challenge is this; don’t give young people the excuse to binge drink. If our children see us drinking too much they’ll ask, ‘how come it’s not okay for me?’”.

Damien O’Connor said that adults in the thirty-plus age group usually spoke about their drinking behaviour light-heartedly, talking about getting hammered, plastered, off their face.

"The fact is that if we drink enough on one occasion to deliberately get drunk, that’s binge drinking,” said Damien O’Connor.

“Everyone should think about how we organise our Christmas and New Year parties. Offer non-alcoholic drinks. Limit the amount you drink.”

“I’m taking the first step and encouraging those attending my end of year function to limit the amount of alcohol they drink. I am writing to my Parliamentary colleagues asking them to be responsible hosts this holiday season”, said Damien O’Connor.
