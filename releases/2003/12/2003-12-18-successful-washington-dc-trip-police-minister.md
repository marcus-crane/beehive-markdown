Police Minister George Hawkins’ recent visit to Washington DC may lead to closer co-operation between the two countries regarding sharing of information and training of police.Mr Hawkins was in Washington DC between 8 –11 December. While there he met a number of senior Government officials and law enforcement agency representatives, including Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge.

“The American’s expressed their appreciation for New Zealand’s contribution to national security with legislation, overseas police liaison posts and police assigned to the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea,” Mr Hawkins said.

The Minister also briefed senior Senate Government Affairs committee staff on measures New Zealand is taking to improve our domestic, regional and international security.

Meetings were also held with representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, Secret Service, Washington Metropolitan Police and Capitol Police - the agency responsible for US Senate Security.

An offer made during a visit to the Drug Enforcement Agency training facilities to upskill New Zealand police officers in methamphetamine investigation and rendering safe clandestine labs, will be looked into, Mr Hawkins said.

As Veterans’ Affairs Minister, Mr Hawkins met Deputy Secretary designate Gordon Mansfield, which resulted in an invitation to Veterans’ Secretary, Anthony Principi, to visit New Zealand.
