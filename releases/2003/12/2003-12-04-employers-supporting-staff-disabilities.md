The New Zealand Police’s Tauranga office is the winner of the State Services Commission’s 2003 Mainstream Employer of the Year Award, recognising its work supporting an employee with a disability.

State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today presented the New Zealand Police with their award at a celebration at Parliament, which also acknowledged yesterday as the International Day of Disabled Persons.

Trevor Mallard said this employer went the extra mile to provide a supported employment placement for a young man with significant intellectual disability, over the past two years.

The Mainstream Employer of the Year Awards are presented each year in recognition of employers who have supported employment, training and career development opportunities for people with significant disabilities participating in the Mainstream Programme.

Trevor Mallard said the Mainstream Programme operates in line with United Nations objectives for the employment of people with disabilities, as well as Government’s own Disability Strategy goals.

“The Mainstream Programme illustrates what can be achieved, with some thought and a bit of lateral thinking,” Trevor Mallard said.

"The programme's goal is to help people with significant disabilities gain meaningful long-term work. It is clearly working well and is a great example of a collaborative venture between the State and disability sectors."

Recently released research data shows that 69 per cent of Mainstream participants maintain long-term employment, well after the conclusion of their initial placements.

Merit awards were also presented to Community and Public Health, Christchurch DHB and the Lincoln University Library and Massey University Library (Wellington campus).
