South Auckland children are to benefit from $1,641,434 in extra government money for early childhood education facilities.Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field said that projects include four new centres - Awhi Early Childhood Centre ($388,800), Fetu I Saesae ($448,000), Mataliki Tokelau Akonga Kamata ($277,917), and St Marys ($83,092). Planning Grants of up to $15,000 will go to Papakura Wesleyan Mission Papatoetoe Footsteps, Akoteu Fetu'u Moana, Akoteu Niumui, Matua Samoa Aoga Amata. Barnardos Mangere is set to receive a grant of $371,625 for building alterations. Almost $500,000 of the money comes specifically from the Ministry's Pasifika funding pool. "The grants will help finance a total of around 180 new places in South Auckland," said Mr Field.Annual funding from the government Discretionary Grants Scheme is creating more than $8 million for preschools across the country. Mr Field said that the 10-year strategic plan for childhood education, Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki, was part of the government's commitment to building a strong and confident nation.“We want to ensure all children get the best possible start to learning, giving them a leg-up to future achievements. "Early childhood centres celebrate diversity and embrace learning. That's why we're aiming this funding at people from low socio-economic and rural backgrounds — and Mäori or Pasifika communities in particular."The centres have also been allocated funds to prioritise health and safety measures to bring them up to the highest standards.
