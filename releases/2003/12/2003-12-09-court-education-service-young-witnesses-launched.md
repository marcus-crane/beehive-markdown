A new education service designed to help familiarise young victims and witnesses with the courts environment was launched in Wellington this week.

Courts Minister Rick Barker said the Court Education Service for Young Witnesses provided personalised education for young victims and witnesses about how courts operated.

“For young people, and for children in particular, the court environment is scary and intimidating. The aim of the service is to remove that fear.”

The service is delivered by trained courts’ Victim Advisers and does not discuss any aspect of the child’s evidence. Instead it focuses on familiarising the child with the court environment and processes.

The service also involves the young person's primary carers and the people who support them in court. It is available for both prosecution and defence witnesses.

Overseas research showed that such programmes reduced the stress on children and could enhance the accuracy and credibility of their evidence.

Mr Barker said information was provided to the young witnesses and their families early in the court process, and if the case proceeded to trial, the court education service would be offered in the three weeks prior to the trial.

The service is designed to meet the needs of children within a range of ages and cultural backgrounds. A set of age-appropriate resources, including activity books, has also been developed for the service.

“There was unanimous support for the service to go nationwide after successful pilots in Manukau, Whangarei and Christchurch,” Mr Barker said.

The service was developed collaboratively by the Ministry of Justice and a range of agencies and individuals including Child Youth and Family Services, the Law Society, Crown Law, the Commissioner for Children, members of the judiciary and the Police.

Individuals with experience in assisting child victims and witnesses also helped develop the service and supporting resources.

Mr Barker said it was estimated that about 2,500 children, young people and their families were involved in the court process each year.
