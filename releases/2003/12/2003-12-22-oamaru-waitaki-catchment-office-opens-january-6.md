A new Ministry for the Environment office opens in Oamaru on January 6, giving the community easy access to information and assistance on the Waitaki water allocation process, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

This office extends the Ministry's Catchment Waitaki support services, run out of Christchurch.

"We are setting up the Oamaru office in response to community demand," Marian Hobbs said. "We want to make it as easy as possible for interested people to get the help and advice they need on all the proposals for the Waitaki River and catchment."

These include the government bill introduced this month to improve the process to decide the use of water from the Waitaki catchment, and consent applications.

The Ministry's Catchment Waitaki special adviser for community services, Jane Whitlock, will provide outreach support right across the district. Ms Whitlock is a resource management, environment and sustainable development expert, who will coordinate assistance to the community on all parts of the water allocation process.
