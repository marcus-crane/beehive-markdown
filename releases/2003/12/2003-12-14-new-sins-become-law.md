Consumer Affairs Minister Judith Tizard will be inspecting SINs at a motor trader in Auckland as the new Motor Vehicle Sales Act comes into effect.

Supplier Information Notices (SINs) are one of the new measures designed to boost consumer protection when buying a car under the new Act. SINs must be displayed from today on all used motor vehicles being sold by motor vehicle traders.

“The new SINs replace the old window cards that appeared on vehicles. These new SINs give consumers better information about the used cars they are buying from motor vehicle traders,” said Judith Tizard.

The Motor Vehicle Sales Act, which comes into force on Monday 15th December, has brought in three important law changes consumers need to know about when buying a motor vehicle. It has also brought in significant changes for motor vehicle traders.

“Buying a vehicle is a major purchase for most of us, and if something goes wrong we want it to be resolved as quickly and as smoothly as possible,” said Judith Tizard.

“The Motor Vehicle Sales Act is a good example of the government working in partnership with industry and consumer groups to provide modern, straightforward legislation which will strengthen the motor vehicle sales industry and improve consumers’ confidence in the process of buying a vehicle.”

Key provisions mean that:

\- motor vehicle traders must register on the Motor Vehicle Traders Register - including car market operators and auctioneers, even if their business is transacted online

\- Supplier Information Notices must be displayed on all used vehicles for sale by a motor vehicle trader whether the trader is registered or not (and private sellers at car markets)

\- Notices make it easier for consumers to see whether a trader is registered or not

\- Notices will also tell consumers if there is money owing on the vehicle and give them a summary of their rights as a buyer

\- consumers will be able to check if traders are registered (or banned) through the online Motor Vehicle Traders Register that will be available free of charge 24 hours a day, seven days a week at  
[The Motor Traders Register website](http://www.motortraders.med.govt.nz).

\- consumers will have direct access to the Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal which will deal with unresolved disputes with motor vehicle traders, and it can hear claims up to $50,000. The tribunal can also now hear claims under a wider range of laws, including the Consumer Guarantees Act, Fair Trading Act, and Sale of Goods Act.

The Commerce Commission will be enforcing the requirements of the Supplier Information Notice, which is a regulation under the Fair Trading Act.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs is undertaking a public awareness campaign about the Motor Vehicle Sales Act to inform consumer and motor vehicle traders about the new Act.

Motor vehicle traders can start registering on the Motor Vehicle Traders Register from today and have until 15 March 2004 to register.
