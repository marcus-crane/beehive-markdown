Associate Minister of Health Damien O'Connor welcomes today's passing of crucial new smoke free legislation, which he says we all stand to gain from.

The Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act 2003 will not only enhance protections against exposure to second-hand smoke - which kills an estimated 388 people annually - but also promote a smoke-free lifestyle as "the norm", says Mr O'Connor.

"All New Zealanders will gain from the Act, from workers who will be protected against second-hand smoke, to employers who will benefit from reduced staff turnover and healthier staff, to smokers who will benefit from clear boundaries about where they can and can't smoke, and may feel more supported if they decide to quit," says Mr O'Connor.

"Also, taxpayers will benefit with long term continued decreases in smoking rates and the estimated $200 million per year tobacco-related costs to our society."

Mr O'Connor says that there are some misplaced fears in the hospitality sector that the Act will cause economic loss.

"The fact is that overseas studies have shown again and again that the economic impact of smokefree provisions is likely to be neutral at worst, and positive at best. A review of nearly 100 studies internationally found that every objective study, including ones in the United States, Canada, and Australia, showed a neutral to positive economic impact for businesses from smoke-free provisions. Several studies found that smoke-free legislation was good for business, because non-smokers (who are in the majority) eat out and drink out more often."

Mr O'Connor says overwhelming public opinion has been listened to in New Zealand, with calls for comprehensive protections from second-hand smoke resulting in today's passing of the Act.

"It's crucial that there are smokefree, family-friendly public environments available for people to use and enjoy, and that we can set a good example for our children and youth by providing the opportunity to grow in safe and healthier environments."

Mr O'Connor says the new Act further cements New Zealand's reputation as one of the world leaders in tobacco control, and also reflects international trends towards smoke-free measures and regulations," says Mr O'Connor.

"California, New York, Sweden, and Norway are living with or about to live with smoke-free pubs. ACT in Australia is phasing out "exemptions" for bars and restaurants, and will be smoke-free by 2006, while South Australia has just last week signalled a phased move to to lock in dates to totally ban smoking in all enclosed workplaces and public areas, and in pubs and clubs from 2004 - 2007. Ontario in Canada is proposing to be the first Canadian province to go smoke-free. And Ireland plans to introduce smoke-free protections in 2004. We have international consensus that the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke are too great to ignore."
