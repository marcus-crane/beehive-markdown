Health Minister Annette King says the [Waikato District Health Board’s](http://www.waikatodhb.govt.nz/) Hamilton and Thames-based hospitals [redevelopment project](http://www.waikatodhb.govt.nz/WDHB/default.asp?Content=481) has cleared a major hurdle following National Capital Committee (NCC) approval for the board’s plans to redevelop the two hospitals at a cost of $215M.

“Ministers have already supported the strategic direction and objectives of the board’s proposal and recognise that redevelopment is needed at both hospitals,” she said today.

“Now the NCC has recommended funding should be approved. This is an essential step toward getting final go-ahead, and means the NCC believes these projects are quality, well-developed proposals ready for full Ministerial approval. I hope to able to take a recommendation to Cabinet immediately after Christmas.

“Waikato DHB’s focus on delivering health services in a safe, modern way and improving links with primary care has produced excellent results. The DHB has also secured regional support from the Midland Regional Capital Committee. This case is strongly supported and is expected to advance quickly."

Ms King said the Waikato business case proposes progressive redevelopment of all significant components of the two hospital campuses. “The redevelopments are driven by the need to replace and up-grade aging facilities and plant at both sites, neither of which has had major investment for many years.

“The redevelopment is also driven by the need to expand Waikato Hospital in Hamilton to cope with future health demands. At Thames the original 1890s facility and later additions need replacement by a facility designed to provide modern services.”

Ms King said the NCC also considered proposals for hospital redevelopments at Tauranga and Kaitaia at this week's meeting. "Business cases for these other important developments are very well progressed and I will be making further announcements in the New Year."
