Joint statement by New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer

New Zealand and Australia have appointed co-chairs for next year’s inaugural Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum.

The announcement of Margaret Jackson (Chair of Qantas) and Kerry McDonald (Chair of BNZ) as co-chairs was made today by Foreign Minister Phil Goff and his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer at the end of their six-monthly consultations, which were held at Portage in the Marlborough Sounds today.

The first annual Leadership Forum is planned for May next year in Auckland. Senior political, business and opinion leaders from New Zealand and Australia will gather to discuss issues of mutual concern in our rapidly changing world.

The forum aims to ensure that the already close and dynamic relationship between our two countries continues to flourish. It will enable robust discussion of new approaches to the many challenges our nations face.

Mr Goff and Mr Downer discussed a range of issues during today's consultation, including the successful commemoration this year of the 20th Anniversary of CER. They agreed to examine further opportunities to extend this economic co-operation and joint effort within the region.

Mr Downer briefed Mr Goff on progress in Australia’s negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with the United States.

Mr Downer briefed Mr Goff on Australia’s enhanced cooperation package with Papua New Guinea. The Ministers also discussed the good progress made so far by the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), to which Australia and New Zealand are the largest contributors.

They agreed that with the success of immediate security stabilisation, RAMSI’s focus would shift to the hard, long-term tasks of economic and governance reform. They reaffirmed their commitment to restoring the integrity of government institutions and strengthening the Royal Solomon Islands Police.

The two Ministers underlined their commitment to working with other members of the Pacific Islands Forum to review and strengthen the organisation so that it would meet the needs of the Pacific in the 21st Century. They expressed confidence that the report being drafted by the Eminent Persons Group would help meet that goal.

The two Ministers had a broad-ranging discussion on regional and global issues including the Campaign against Terrorism, and the situation in Iraq.

They expressed concern about moves in Taiwan that threatened to upset the basis on which relations between Taipei and Beijing had proceeded in recent years.

The Ministers confirmed that both Australia and New Zealand continued to adhere to a One China policy and urged both sides to avoid any actions or statements that would further increase tensions in cross-straits relations.
