The Skilled Migrant Category promoting the active recruitment of skilled migrants to New Zealand is officially open for business, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

Changes to skilled immigration policy were announced by the government in July after a comprehensive review of the General Skills component of the Skilled/Business stream of the New Zealand Immigration Programme.

“The new Skilled Migrant Category shifts the focus from the passive acceptance of residence applications to the active recruitment of the skilled migrants that New Zealand needs,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“From today, prospective migrants can submit expressions of interest based on an enhanced points system. Points are allocated for skilled employment, work experience and qualifications, with a particular emphasis on identified areas of growth or skill shortages. Bonus points will be awarded to those who, for example, have a skilled job offer outside Auckland or who have a recognised New Zealand qualification gained after at least two years’ study in New Zealand.

“This enables us to prioritise applicants who best meet New Zealand’s needs.

“Once they have been invited to apply for residence, it is expected that the application will lead to residence, either:

- Directly, where there is a demonstrated ability to settle here, or
- Indirectly, through a two-year work-to-residence programme where the applicant has good settlement prospects despite not having a relevant job offer, or history of studying or working successfully in New Zealand.

“This policy is designed to end the ‘professional-driving-taxi’ scenario, which resulted from a flawed policy focussed solely on migrants gaining residence by meeting the set points, regardless of whether or not their skills were needed here.

“The new Skilled Migrant Category is a win-win for skilled migrants and for New Zealand,” Lianne Dalziel said.
