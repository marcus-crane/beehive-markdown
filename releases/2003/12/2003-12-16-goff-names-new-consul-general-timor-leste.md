New Zealand’s next Consul-General in Timor-Leste (East Timor) will be career diplomat Peter Guinness, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Mr Goff said Mr Guinness’ role would involve fostering relations with the government of Timor-Leste; overseeing the NZAID development programme there, and building on the strong people-to-people links.

“Since it achieved independence last year, Timor-Leste has made considerable progress in establishing democratic institutions of governance and laying a platform for economic development," Mr Goff said.

"New Zealand has been happy to work with Timor-Leste in this process, through our peacekeeping support and NZAID's development assistance programme."

Mr Guinness’ previous postings include Paris and Kuala Lumpur and until recently he was working in the Ministry’s Economic Division. He will take up his new position this month, replacing Susannah Gordon who returns to Wellington.
