Education Minister Trevor Mallard today launched three new storybooks for young children, two of which are not only in English but in six Pasifika languages and te reo Maori.

The picture books are designed for parents to read to their children and aim also to show parents the benefits of early childhood education. All the stories are set in or around early childhood centres.

Trevor Mallard welcomed the multiple language books as a valuable contribution towards the government's goal of increasing participation in early childhood education.

"We know quality early childhood education makes a life-changing difference to the way children develop and go on to learn. Making books that are accessible and enjoyable to a range of New Zealand families is a positive step in encouraging participation.

"Many early childhood centres use both English and Pasifika languages but there are few resources to support that approach."

Leilani and the Cicada is one of the first New Zealand children’s books to be published in six Pasifika languages, as well as English. The Outing is set around Maketu's kohanga reo and is available in te reo Maori as Te Haereere. Uncle Hòne’s Cloak is in English, and all three books were inspired by real children.

The books, published by Learning Media on behalf of the Ministry of Education, are part of the ministry’s Promoting Early Childhood Education Participation project.

Other books in the Participation series are published in Cook Islands Maori, English, Fijian, Maori, Samoan, Tokelauan, and Tongan.

Trevor Mallard launched the books at Naenae A'oga Amata in Wellington.
