Unspent funding intended for private training establishments (PTEs) will be redistributed to new or growing PTEs in 2004, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

The funding, worth at least $19 million next year, will be allocated through a Strategic Priorities Fund to PTEs offering qualifications in priority areas of tertiary education and training. Funding allocated in this way comes from the $150 million of ring-fenced funding for PTEs.

Steve Maharey said the announcement would provide stability and predictability to the PTE sector in 2004.

“Most PTEs will be able to continue their courses without change into 2004. In particular, most courses funded through the Strategic Priorities Fund this year have had their funding renewed for 2004.

“However, some PTEs under spent their allocations – often for very valid reasons – and others exited the system in 2003. To avoid this happening again in 2004, the Tertiary Education Commission will be working with some PTEs to manage their funding requirements. The government wants to ensure that unallocated funds are reallocated to the more successful PTEs who have the ability to offer extra education for students.

“I’m asking under-spending PTEs to do the right thing and volunteer to reduce next year’s funding caps. It deprives other New Zealanders of opportunities for education and training when available funding is under-utilised,” Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey stressed the under spending only refers to theoretical allocations not being taken up by some PTEs, rather than actual payments for 2004.

In addition to renewed funding for PTEs continuing to operate in 2004, an additional contestable funding round will be held in March 2004 to distribute the remainder of the Strategic Priorities Fund. The Tertiary Education Commission will invite applications for this funding later this month. The eventual size of this funding pool will depend on the success of the redistribution call.
