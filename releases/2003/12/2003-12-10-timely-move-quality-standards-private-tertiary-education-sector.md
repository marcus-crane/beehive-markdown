Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming plans to establish a Quality Commissioner for the private tertiary education sector.

The New Zealand Association of Private Training Establishments (NZAPEP) announced the plans this afternoon. The Association intends developing a new code of ethical practices towards students, model grievance processes and spearheading the introduction of Quality Mark standards to NZAPEP members. The Association represents providers who cater for over 60 percent of the students studying with private training establishments.

Steve Maharey said the move was timely following high profile collapses of some private training establishments this year.

“This is a welcome move by the private training sector to get its own house in order. It compliments other initiatives taken by the government in recent years to protect students, including the introduction of quality assurance audits and the development of the Code of Pastoral Care for International Students.

“Post-school education is the norm in New Zealand these days and we need to ensure that students are investing their time and money in courses that will properly equip them for today’s workforce.

“The Tertiary Education Commission, Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority will continue to work with NZAPEP on the development of this proposal. The government would welcome other private trainers organisations working with NZAPEP on the proposal so that they can also offer greater protection to their students,” Steve Maharey said.
