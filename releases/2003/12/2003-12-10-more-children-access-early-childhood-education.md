Funding of $8 million will create an extra 1236 new places for children in licensed and chartered early childhood education centres over the next year, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

"This funding is a significant way to increase participation in quality early childhood services, especially amongst children from low socio-economic, rural, isolated, Mäori or Pasifika communities," Trevor Mallard said.

"As part of the annual Discretionary Grants Scheme (DGS) 72 community-based non-profit early childhood services will receive this funding to establish new early childhood education centres, extend existing buildings or remove health and safety hazards.”

Trevor Mallard said the 10-year strategic plan for early childhood education, Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki, showed the government’s strong commitment to have all New Zealand children participating in quality early childhood education.

"We know that quality early childhood education makes a significant difference to the way children develop and achieve later in their lives.

"Research also shows access to quality early childhood education has the greatest benefits for children who are the least likely to participate, including those from low socio-economic, rural, Mäori or Pasifika communities.

"The discretionary grants scheme is particularly targeted to increasing participation amongst these groups.”

“Throughout New Zealand communities are working hard to raise the funds required for projects to enable their children to participate in quality early childhood education.

"I congratulate these communities for their work and dedication and believe the discretionary grants scheme is a major way government can provide assistance particularly for those communities who find fund-raising difficult."

Trevor Mallard said the scheme is divided into three pools: Mäori, Pasifka and General.  
·Mäori Pool - a total of 19 grants were made creating 497 new places in kohanga, immersion and bilingual services  
·Pasifika Pool - funding allocated to 12 Pasifika groups to establish licensed and chartered early childhood education centres will cater for approximately 120 children  
·General Pool, 27 grants have been allocated providing 619 new child places.

"Together these grants assist us to meet the needs of New Zealand children and their families in a range of early childhood education services.

"On top of this 15 grants have been allocated to remove health and safety concerns in existing services which could put the health of children attending at risk."
