New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Mexico will be career diplomat George Troup, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The relationship between New Zealand and Mexico has advanced significantly in the last few years on all fronts, reflecting the importance accorded to the region by the Government’s Latin America Strategy," Mr Goff said.

“Mexico is our major trading partner in Latin America, with exports each year worth over NZ$400 million, and both governments have commissioned studies into the possibilities of a closer economic partnership (CEP).

“On a policy level, we also cooperate significantly in trade forums such as APEC and the WTO, where Mexico has become a key participant in recent years.

“We also work together with Mexico in a wide range of other international forums, including on nuclear disarmament, the environment, human rights, and the reform of the United Nations.

“Given the breadth and depth of the ties between our countries, and the many opportunities to build on these in the future, I’m delighted to announce the appointment of an experienced and talented diplomat to this important role.”

Mr Troup is currently director of the trade and economic division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and is also New Zealand’s Senior APEC Official. He joined the Ministry in 1986 after working at Treasury, and has had previous postings in Paris and Washington.

Mr Troup will take up his appointment in April, replacing Paul Tipping who is returning to Wellington.
