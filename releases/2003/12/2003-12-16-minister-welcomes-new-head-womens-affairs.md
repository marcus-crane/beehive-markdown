Ruth Dyson today welcomed the appointment of Shenagh Gleisner as the new chief executive of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs.

“Shenagh Gleisner will bring enormous expertise to the job of chief executive. She has extensive management and change management experience, is highly regarded in both the public and private sectors, and has strong leadership skills. I welcome her to the job and look forward to her taking up the role in February.”

Ruth Dyson said Ms Gleisner would be responsible for implementing the recommendations of a recent review of the ministry.

“Ms Gleisner is well-placed to build the ministry’s capability, improve its reputation and credibility, and work closely with other departments to support and encourage their active participation in policy programmes impacting on women. This is crucial if New Zealand is to achieve equality of outcomes for women.”

Ruth Dyson thanked Anne Carter for her work as acting chief executive over the last six months.

“Anne Carter took over the job of acting chief executive at short notice. She has provided stability, sound leadership and goodwill during this interim period, and I wish her all the best for the future.”
