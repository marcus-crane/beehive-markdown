A partnership agreement signed last night between the National Road Carriers Inc and Work and Income aims to help alleviate a growing shortage of truck drivers while providing job seekers with a long-term career opportunity.

Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Rick Barker launched the new government and industry jobs partnership on the back of a large trailer at Carrolls Cartage in Auckland and said that the agreement was essential for the well-being of the transport sector.

“Industry research shows that the sector has a current shortage of over 1000 drivers nationwide, a figure that if left unchecked could grow to 10,000 by 2010.

“The Job Partnership will help the industry to close current skills gaps and ensure skilled workers are available in coming years.”

Job Partnerships are designed as industry-led strategies, in which Work and Income works closely with industry to research skills needs, assess and select Job Seekers, and provide the appropriate training and follow-up support.

The new partnership with National Road Carriers Inc involves a range of initiatives designed to open up career opportunities in the transport industry and provide skilled workers from the Work and Income pool of Job Seekers.

Mr Barker said the partnership was a prime example of an industry-led approach.

“The transport sector has experienced strong growth in recent years, and that’s presented the industry with a lack of skilled workers. Recruitment and retention are big issues affecting the transport industry and National Road Carriers has stepped right up to the meet those challenges.

“Unemployment is at a 16-year low, we have skills shortages and with partnerships like this we can do even better and reduce unemployment further.

“Getting people into employment changes their lives, it can change families and by reducing unemployment we can change communities for the better.”

The Government’s first Job Partnership with Industry was launched earlier this year with the Hospitality Association.

Work is already well underway on further partnerships with the retail and tourism sectors. Job Partnerships are a key plank of Jobs Jolt, a $104.5 million package designed to move thousands of Job Seekers into employment over the next five years.
