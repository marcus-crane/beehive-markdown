Auckland's transport will be governed by a single business-like organisation under proposals presented to Auckland's councils by Local Government Minister Chris Carter today.

"I think everyone agrees that present governance arrangements for Auckland's transport are confused, inefficient and ineffectual. The Government believes these arrangements must be clarified so the extra transport funding earmarked for Auckland can be used in the best possible way," Mr Carter said.

The Government proposes that responsibility for Auckland transport issues, such as rail, bus, ferry, pedestrian and cycle transport, reside with one organisation to be called the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA).

The authority will be accountable to the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) for developing and implementing a transport plan for Auckland. It will receive government and local money to implement the plan and will contract with Auckland transport companies.

The authority will be run by a board, the members of which will appointed by a panel representing the ARC and the seven Auckland city councils. The ARC will have a majority on this panel.

"Appointing the board of the authority in this way preserves the input of local government in Auckland while putting administration of transport on a business-like basis," said Mr Carter.

"Members of Auckland councils, including the ARC, won't be eligible for appointment to the authority. The appointees will not be representatives of sectional interests. Their responsibility will be to the Auckland region as a whole, and for the good governance of public investment in Auckland transport."

Another body, tentatively called Auckland Regional Holdings, is proposed to govern other regional infrastructure, such as the assets of Infrastructure Auckland.

Mr Carter and other Ministers told Auckland local body leaders today that the Government's funding package for Auckland transport depended on Auckland councils accepting that ARTA would administer Auckland transport.

"Voters in the 2004 elections need to know what sort of structure their elected representatives will govern," Mr Carter said.

"Councils have until the end of January to respond. I believe that Aucklanders will be relieved that central government is helping to sort out the baffling lines of responsibility and accountability for Auckland transport which have hampered progress to date."
