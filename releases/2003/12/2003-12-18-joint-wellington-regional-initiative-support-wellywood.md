A world-class screen production facility is to be built in the Wellington region with support from Positively Wellington Business and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, Minister of Economic, Industry and Regional Development Mr Jim Anderton and Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast announced today.

Positively Wellington Business, the region's economic development agency, is to receive $2 million dollars under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's Regional Partnership Programme towards the development of a screen production facility, including a new purpose-built sound studio.

The facility is to be established at Miramar in partnership with Camperdown Studios. The studio is to be a soundproofed warehouse-style space in which filming can take place uninterrupted by weather and other noise.

"Film and television production is a key driver in Wellington's regional economy but the lack of a world class screen production facility has meant some offshore productions have chosen not to come here.

"This facility will mean New Zealand can attract more big budget films more often, and attract studio-based productions which don't currently consider New Zealand as a location," Mr Anderton said.

Wellington Mayor, Kerry Prendergast, is delighted that the studio will be built in Miramar. "We must take advantage of the success of the New Zealand film industry while we have such high levels of international recognition following the success of the World Premier of the Return of the King. The film industry is a crucial one for the Wellington region and, on behalf of the regional Mayors, I applaud Government involvement in this important partnership. It will benefit all New Zealanders and will ensure that the Wellington region continues on its path to becoming one of the leading Creative Capitals of the World. I also congratulate Positively Wellington Business in identifying this opportunity and in bringing the public and private sector partners together to make this happen."

An economic impact assessment study commissioned by NZIER estimates that the impact on the regional economy will be an injection of $250 million over ten years if the new facility attracts one mid-budget film every 24 months, and $650 million if it attracts one high-budget film over the same time period.

The impact on the national economy, assuming the same scenarios, is estimated at $450 million over 10 years and $1.2 billion over 10 years respectively.

Mr Anderton said the facility complements the steps taken to build New Zealand's screen production industry nationally.

"The screen production industry cannot grow without investment from the private and public sector."

"Making it more attractive for offshore productions to take place here will build the capability of our film industry, cement it as an important earner for the region, and accelerate the growth of the screen production industry both regionally and nationally," Mr Anderton said.
