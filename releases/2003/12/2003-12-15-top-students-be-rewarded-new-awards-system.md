A new prestigious awards system recognising New Zealand students who excel in NCEA and the new Scholarship qualification is to be introduced from 2004, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

"I have always said that the new qualifications system would reward excellence and challenge our very best scholars. These awards are further proof that this government is committed to excellence and intends to recognise top achievers in tangible ways," Trevor Mallard said.

“Awards will continue to recognise top scholars nationally. But for the first time, top scholars in individual schools will also be recognised under the new awards system. Awards will go to the top student in each school who has achieved Scholarship standard in three subjects. This will enable schools to celebrate their top achiever on the national stage," Trevor Mallard said.

"The New Zealand Scholars award will recognise all students who gain "outstanding performance" in three New Zealand scholarship subjects."

The new awards will replace the existing A and B Bursaries and the existing top scholar awards, which will be phased out over the next three years.

From 2004 bursaries will be replaced by two qualifications, level 3 of NCEA and the New Zealand Scholarship qualification.

"The new Scholarship is a level 4 qualification, clearly in advance of what we have now to challenge students in their final year of schooling, so it is appropriate that the monetary awards are substantial," Trevor Mallard said.

“To receive the cash awards students will have to be involved in successful study in a tertiary institution in New Zealand. This is because we think it’s appropriate that such prestigious awards should go to young New Zealanders who are pursuing tertiary courses in New Zealand.

The new awards will be:

·Two Top Overall Scholars in New Zealand Scholarship  
1st award $15,000 per year for three years  
2nd award $10,000 per year for three years  
·New Zealand Scholars (To all students gaining "outstanding performance" in 3 NZ Scholarship subjects)  
$5,000 per year for three years  
·Top Scholar in each subject in NZ Scholarship or in NCEA Level 3 where there is no Scholarship assessment  
$3,000 per year for three years  
·School Awards: For the top student in each school who achieves NZ Scholarship in 3 subjects  
$1,500 per year for three years

“These awards are for subjects that have Achievement Standards in the New Zealand secondary school Curriculum,” Trevor Mallard said.

“There are also some subjects which are particularly important to New Zealand's economy, such as the information technology and electro technology subjects.

"In 2005 and 2006, a pilot will be undertaken for awards jointly funded by Government and industry, that recognise excellent performance in some of those areas."
