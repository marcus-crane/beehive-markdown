Appointments to the Board of Radio New Zealand have been announced today by Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.

Radio New Zealand is a public service broadcaster, operating in accordance with its Charter, providing four networks: Concert FM, Parliamentary Radio, Radio New Zealand International and National Radio.

Steve Maharey said current Board chair Brian Corban has been reappointed for a further three year term and EDS managing director Rick Ellis has been appointed to the Board, also for a three year term.

“Through its four networks, Radio New Zealand provides an essential service reflecting and analysing our people and their culture and issues.

“The reappointment of Brian Corban will provide the company with stability as its new chief excutive, Peter Cavanagh, takes up the reins.

“Rick Ellis brings his extensive knowledge of the New Zealand broadcasting scene to the Board. He was previously Chief Executive of TVNZ and currently chairs the Television Local Content Group, which is working on the development of industry-led voluntary targets for locally-made programming on New Zealand’s major free-to-air networks. He replaces Liz Hickey who has resigned from the Radio New Zealand Board,” Steve Maharey said.
