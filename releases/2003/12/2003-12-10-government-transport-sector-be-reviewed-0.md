The government is to review its agencies in the transport sector, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard and Transport Minister Paul Swain announced today.

The ministers said the review would explore opportunities to improve performance in the sector.

"With the development of a comprehensive and long term transport strategy for New Zealand, it is now timely to review the effectiveness of the sector as a whole.

"The scope of the review comprises the Ministry of Transport and the six transport crown entities: Civil Aviation Authority (includes the Aviation Security Service), Land Transport Safety Authority, Maritime Safety Authority, Transport Accident Investigation Commission, Transfund New Zealand and Transit New Zealand.

"The purpose of the review is to:

- consider whether the government transport sector is best arranged and has the capability to implement the New Zealand Transport Strategy and to carry out its other requirements and obligations;
- consider ways to enhance the performance of the sector; and
- propose any necessary changes.

"A range of options will be considered including the status quo, more effective and better integrated provision of policy advice and service delivery, shared services, the transfer of functions between entities, and structural change," the ministers said.

"The government is committed to a strong state sector and to improving the delivery of government services for New Zealanders.

"We do not wish to undertake wholesale reform of the state sector. But we are always looking for improvements and will take opportunities to make changes when we believe it is timely and appropriate to do so. The transport sector review is part of this ongoing process," the ministers said.

Sector reviews were suggested in the government's 2001 assessment of New Zealand's public management system, the Review of the Centre. The Review recommended a series of initiatives to address fragmentation and improve the alignment of state sector agencies with government objectives.

The review team has been asked to provide the Ministers of State Services and Transport with a draft report by mid-April 2004.

Questions and answers, the relevant cabinet paper and terms of reference are attached. The cabinet paper and terms of reference are also available on:
