A Conflict Prevention and Peace Building fund has been established as part of New Zealand's $8 million plus annual bilateral aid programme to Indonesia, Aid Minister Marian Hobbs, announced today.

The new facility aims to distribute up to $2.4 million in Indonesia over the next three years, in support of projects dedicated to conflict prevention and peace building.

"One of the first grants will go to the International Crisis Group (ICG) in support of one of its projects addressing the causes of instability in Indonesia," Marian Hobbs said. "The purpose of the project is to contribute to the prevention and resolution of conflict and terrorist-related violence in Indonesia. New Zealand will contribute $100,000 to the project.

"We have seen the devastating effects terrorist-related violence has had in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. New Zealand is providing funding to support the ICG project and to reinforce international efforts to prevent and resolve conflict of this type in Indonesia."

ICG is a private, non-profit international organisation based in Brussels. This project in Indonesia will involve broad consultation and engagement including with Indonesian decision-makers and the wider international community. This will assist the ICG to carry out in-depth research into the potential for conflict with a view to developing practical policy recommendations on preventing conflict from erupting, escalating or recurring.

The project is also aimed at highlighting policy recommendations towards curbing the operational capabilities and support for terrorist groups active in Indonesia and neighbouring countries.

New Zealand's bilateral aid programme to Indonesia, which is administered by NZAID, totals over $8 million per annum. In addition to conflict prevention and peace building the aid programme also provides assistance to Indonesia in the sectors of education, the environment, good governance, community development and human rights.
