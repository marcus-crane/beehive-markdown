Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is urging marae committees around the country to pay special attention to the new fire safety booklet being launched in Rotorua today.

"This Christmas many of the country's marae will be used to accommodate whanau gatherings and it is important that whanau are prepared for emergencies," said Parekura Horomia.

"So far this year five meeting houses have been damaged or completely destroyed this year and with the summer holiday season quickly approaching, Marae committees must make arrangements to ensure their facilities are safe."

The Fire Service has Iwi liaison staff working throughout the country who are available to talk to marae representatives free of charge.

Fire Service statistics are sombre and show:  
·Five marae are damaged by fire each year;  
·66 percent of all Marae fires happen in buildings built from 1900-1969;

"Fires can also damage irreplaceable taonga which whanau hapu and Iwi have a responsibility to preserve, for that reason the Historic Places Trust is also part of this strategy.

"It is important that good safety systems like sprinklers are placed in Marae to avert disaster," said Parekura Horomia.
