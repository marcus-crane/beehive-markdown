Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, said today that the New Zealand Historic Places Trust was looking at ways to recognise the heritage importance to New Zealanders of Anzac Cove, Gallipoli.

Helen Clark said Gallipoli was a place of great significance in the history of New Zealand, Australia and a number of other countries.

“Given their place in New Zealand’s World War I history, the Gallipoli Peninsula and Anzac Cove have immense heritage importance for New Zealanders. The events at Gallipoli helped shape our sense of national identity.

“That is why the Historic Places Trust is exploring ways to recognise more formally the cultural and heritage significance of the Gallipoli campaign to New Zealanders.

“It is a project that many New Zealanders will welcome and I look forward to receiving further details as work progresses.

“The Trust’s initiative will lead to non-statutory recognition of Anzac Cove and will be consistent with the purposes and principles of New Zealand’s heritage legislation, the Historic Places Act 1993,” Helen Clark said.

Meanwhile, the Australian government has announced new legislation to identify and protect places of national heritage significance to Australians, including sites in other countries. Australian Prime Minister John Howard has indicated he will nominate Anzac Cove as the first site for consideration under the new legislation.

The Australian legislation provides for the listing of overseas sites to be undertaken only with the co-operation and agreement of the country in which the site is located.

The Prime Minister said she appreciated that the Australian Government was moving to recognise the heritage significance of the site in a manner that complements Turkey’s and other nations’ interests in the area.

“The experiences shared by New Zealanders and Australians at Gallipoli have left us with an important shared legacy,” Helen Clark said.
