Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter has asked New Zealand's ethnic communities for patience in the wake New Zealand First's latest misinformation campaign about immigration.

"Ethnic people everywhere may be feeling appalled and angry about the kind of gross propaganda that is being distributed by Winston Peters and NZ First at present. I want ethnic people to know that the Government is also appalled and angry," Mr Carter said.

"The claims that NZ First have made in its propaganda are inaccurate and deliberately misleading. The party appears incapable of sensible, rational debate about immigration and is reduced to wild ranting.

"Offensive as this propaganda is, I urge ethnic people to simply ignore it. The vast majority of New Zealander's do not support NZ First or their hysterical and prejudiced policies. Most people welcome and support the contribution migrants make to society and the economy. NZ First and its leader are just a minor stain on the political landscape."
