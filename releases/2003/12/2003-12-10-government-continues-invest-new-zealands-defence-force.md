Minister of Defence Mark Burton has today announced Cabinet approval for several Army acquisition projects outlined in the Defence Long Term Development Plan (LTDP), including the purchase of the first tranche of Light Operational Vehicles (LOVs), 24 Javelin medium range anti-armour weapon systems (MRAAWs), and an identification, alerting, and cueing system to complete New Zealand’s very low-level air defence capability (VLLAD).

Cabinet has also approved the Ministry of Defence to advance another major project to the next stage and invite proposals for the supply of Air Force utility and training helicopters.

Mark Burton stressed that today’s decisions continue to move New Zealand towards the goal of having a modernised, well-equipped, and sustainable Defence Force.

“Cabinet has agreed to the purchase of 175 non-armoured LOVs and 13 Special Operations Vehicles (SOVs). The acquisition processes have shown that the best match for New Zealand’s capability needs is the Pinzgauer vehicle, supplied by Automotive Technik Ltd. The Pinzgauer will offer the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) an enhanced off-road load carrying capability that exceeds that available from the current Landrover fleet, with low maintenance overheads and low through-life support costs.

“These 175 vehicles represent the non-armoured component of the Army’s overall requirement of 321 vehicles. Currently, the problems involved in maintaining the Army’s current fleet of Landrovers are impacting on its ability to train and conduct exercises. By purchasing this first tranche now, we can make the initial non-armoured vehicles available as soon as possible, while decisions on the armoured LOVs are being finalised.

“Alongside the recent purchase of Light Armoured Vehicles (NZLAVs), the purchase of the LOVs is another significant move towards the modernisation of the Army’s capabilities,” said Mark Burton.

“Cabinet has also approved the purchase of 24 Javelin MRAAW systems—a critical component of operations where land forces may face an armoured vehicle threat. The Javelin’s updated technology will provide our forces with a greater range of defensive capability than the Army’s current short-range anti-armour weapon. We expect the Javelin will enter service by mid-2006.

“We will also be purchasing equipment to complete the Army’s VLLAD system. This additional equipment will provide our forces with a ‘friend or foe’ identification, alerting and cueing system to detect aircraft and to determine if they are friendly or unknown. The VLLAD system will be linked through the recently purchased Tactical Mobile Communications System radios (TMCS), and is expected to be in service by the end of 2005.”

Mark Burton also announced approval for the next step in replacing the Iroquois utility helicopter and the Sioux training helicopter.

“Following a project to scope the future operational, policy, and training requirements for the RNZAF’s helicopter fleet, the Ministry of Defence will now be seeking further information from potential suppliers on the capability, availability, price, and supply of replacement helicopters. I expect to bring preferred options to Cabinet late next year.

“Today’s announcements reinforce once again the positive progress we are making in re-equipping all three services of the NZDF. In addition to ongoing deliveries of new TMCS radios and NZLAVs, 16 major Long-Term Development Plan projects have been actioned by the Ministry of Defence and the NZDF over the past twelve months.

“We have completed the upgrade of the runway at Ohakea Air Base and replaced the RNZAF’s aging 727s with 757-200 jet aircraft. The tender process for cargo conversion for the 757s is scheduled to begin next year.

“Tenders are currently being evaluated for Project Protector, the $500 million project which will see the Navy replace the aging frigate Canterbury with a new multi-role vessel, off-shore and in-shore patrol vessels. Also in the tender evaluation phase are the C130 Hercules 15-year Structural Life Extension Project, C-130 and P-3 Communication And Navigation Systems Upgrade, and the P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade. Decisions on all of these projects are expected during the second half of next year.

“The LTDP has enabled this government to make decisions on defence acquisitions over the next decade in the context of defence policy, priority of projects on a cross-service and cross-agency basis, and affordability within the budget set by Cabinet in May 2002.

“I’m proud to say that we have effectively brought an end to the neglect and ad-hoc spending experienced by our Defence Forces throughout the 1990s. Our service men and women are respected around the world for their outstanding work. They deserve a systematic and ongoing acquisition plan that will keep them well equipped for the extensive variety of tasks they are called upon to do,” said Mark Burton.
