New Securities Markets (Disclosure of Relevant Interests by Directors and Officers) Regulations 2003 were approved today and will come into force on 1 March 2004, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel has announced.

"This is part of the government's on-going effort to promote transparency and good corporate governance in securities dealings,” Lianne Dalziel said.

Amendments to the Securities Markets Act 1988, enacted last year, introduced a requirement that directors and officers of public issuers disclose relevant interests and dealings in securities of that public issuer and any related body corporate within five trading days.

"The purpose of these provisions is to improve transparency, ensuring that information about directors’ and officers’ holdings is up-to-date and relevant to the market, which should reduce opportunities for insider trading and market manipulation.

"The regulations clarify who is considered to be an 'officer' for the purposes of the Act, as well as setting out the details of disclosure requirements. The regulations also include a set form for disclosure, which will minimise compliance requirements,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The regulations also provide exemptions for situations where disclosure is required, but would not convey any relevant information to the market. This includes exemptions for "technical" interests and employee share schemes.

The statutory obligations will replace those currently found in the NZX Listing Rules that were introduced by NZX following the amendments to the Securities Markets Act, in anticipation of these regulations.
