Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Helen Clark today opened the new John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery, saying it will be a valuable addition to Southland’s cultural infrastructure.

The Prime Minister opened the new wing at a ceremony in Gore this afternoon, two-and-a-half years after launching a public appeal to raise money for the project.

Helen Clark said the redevelopment will enable the gallery to display the world class art collection gifted to the gallery by John Money, the New Zealand-born professor of medical psychology at John Hopkins University in theUnited States.

“The new wing’s collection was made possible by the generous bequest from John Money. He has donated to the gallery his extensive art collection, which includes Australian Aboriginal, African, and indigenous and contemporary American works, along with works by significant New Zealand artists, such as Rita Angus and Theo Schoon.

“The gallery’s extension is a wonderful development, and the government is pleased to have been able to assist with $30,000 from the Regional Museums Policy, along with $50,000 from a Tourism Facilities Development grant, and $400,000 from a Lottery grant. In addition, the government has donated four Ralph Hotere works to the gallery.

“But this has been, above all, an important community project. It has seen the Gore and wider Southland community working together to raise the $1.2 million to build the new wing.

“There will be numerous benefits back to the community. Institutions like the Eastern Southland Gallery not only service their own communities, but also will attract national and international visitors. It is a valuable addition to Southland’s cultural infrastructure,” Helen Clark said.
