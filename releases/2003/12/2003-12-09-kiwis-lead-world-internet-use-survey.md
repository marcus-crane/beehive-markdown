State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the results of a comprehensive international survey that indicates New Zealanders are leading the world in their use of the Internet.

“The study found that 75 per cent of those surveyed in New Zealand had used the Internet in the previous month, an increase from 71 per cent in 2002. New Zealand’s usage rate was the highest of the 32 countries surveyed (which include Australia and the United States).”

The GO2003 survey was carried out in 32 countries by Taylor Nelson Sofres, a global market information group. One thousand New Zealanders were surveyed during August 2003.

Trevor Mallard says the survey indicates the increasing demand for government services online, and how much they are valued.

“The survey found that almost half of New Zealanders are using e-government services (such as finding out about laws and regulations, getting exam results, or paying GST) with 45 per cent of those surveyed having used e-government in the previous 12 months. This is higher than the 40 per cent reported in 2002, and well above the global average of 30 per cent.

“High Internet use, training programmes for young and old, and increased access to computers means it’s easier than ever for the public to use government services online.”

The survey also indicates a strong interest in online government services that save people time, such as being able to find all government information in one place. The government portal www.govt.nz provides online access to more than 5000 central and local government services and resources.

More than 70 per cent of people surveyed who had used the portal reported that the information was easy to find, easy to understand, and was what they were looking for.  
The State Services Commission’s E-government Unit commissioned New Zealand’s participation in the survey as part of the E-government Strategy (http://www.e.govt.nz/programme/strategy.asp).
