The Minister for Regional and Industry Development, Jim Anderton and Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey today announced the results of the third round of funding under the Polytechnic Regional Development Fund.

"The level of interest among polytechnics and institutes of technology in addressing local skill and development priorities remains strong with nine polytechnics having had funding approved this round for a wide variety of initiatives," said Jim Anderton

Whitireia Polytechnic, WELTEC, Open Polytechnic, Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, Tai Poutini Polytechnic, Telford Rural Polytechnic and Southern Institute of Technology will receive funding totalling $1,133,266.

"This commitment by polytechnics and institutes of technology shows that they are keen to ensure they meet the long term needs of industries in their regions and play a key role in regional economic development," said Steve Maharey.

The fund is designed to enable and encourage polytechnics to collaborate with local industry and enterprise to develop skills-related initiatives that will support regional economic development.

Two million in 2002/2003 and in 2003/04 and $1 million for 2004/05 has been allocated to the fund.

All applications were considered by the Regional Partnerships Programme Assessment Panel which is chaired by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and includes representatives from the Ministry of Economic Development, the Tertiary Education Commission, Te Puni Kokiri and two independent members.

Two funding rounds occurred in the 2002/2003 financial year with $1,304,189 approved for nine polytechnics in November 2002 and $702,000 approved for seven polytechnics in May 2003.
