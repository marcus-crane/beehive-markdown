The first reading of the Maori Fisheries Bill in Parliament this afternoon is a cause for celebration given that is finally before the house after more than 10 years debate.

Associate Fisheries Minister Parekura Horomia said its passage will begin a new era of Maori participation in the fishing industry, enabling the beneficiaries of the 1992 Fisheries Settlement to receive the assets and use them for the economic and social benefit of all Maori.

"This is a settlement worth more than $700 million, more than all other Treaty settlements combined," Parekura Horomia said.

"It was indeed heartening to lead the bill through the legislative process and I noted the presence of some of the Maori Fisheries Commissioners in the public gallery, all of whom have worked extremely hard to advance this issue.

"This Bill is reflective of that hard work and is supported by more than 90 per cent of Iwi, which in itself is a significant achievement.

"Parliament, the Fisheries Commission and Maori now have the chance to bring the 1992 Deed of Settlement to a conclusion and usher in a new era of opportunity for Maori in the fishing and seafood industry.

"I am satisfied the Fisheries Commission will continue to have a role to play as outlined in the legislative framework," said Parekura Horomia.
