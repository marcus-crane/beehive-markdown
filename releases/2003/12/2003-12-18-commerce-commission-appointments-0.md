Paula Rebstock and David Caygill have been appointed as the Chair and Deputy Chair respectively, of the Commerce Commission, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

“I am pleased to be able to welcome Paula Rebstock, who has been Acting Chair for several months, and David Caygill to these positions. I am confident that they will continue the excellent standard of work of the Commerce Commission.

“Paula has extensive experience in economic regulation, proven ability and the vision to lead the Commission. She is well placed to step up from the Deputy’s position, to the Chair, ” Lianne Dalziel said.

Ms Rebstock has been with the Commission since 1998. She was originally appointed as an associate member of the Commission, and has graduated to serving as a full member and then as Deputy Chair. She took up the Acting Chair duties following John Belgrave’s resignation earlier this year. Her appointment is for three years.

Ms Rebstock’s governance experience includes acting as the Chair of Local Media Group and as a Director with the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.

“David has a mix of legal, regulatory and governance experience as well as a strong knowledge of the Commerce Act of which he was an architect,” Lianne Dalziel said.

His extensive governance experience includes chairing the Grid Security Committee and the Electricity Governance Establishment Group. As chair of the Accident Compensation Corporation he has led the organisation through a substantial period of change. More recently he has been a member of the State Services Commission’s Crown Entities Review Panel and the Review of the Centre Advisory Group. Mr Caygill’s appointment is for five years.
