Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard said a record 86 Prime Minister's Coach Scholarships have been awarded to support high performance coaches next year.

Trevor Mallard said the Scholarships are a significant resource to ensure that professional development opportunities for coaches actually happen.

“This government is committed to nurturing sporting excellence in New Zealand and it’s heartening to see coaches recognised for their hard work and vision for the future," Trevor Mallard said.

"Coaches play a critical, and too often criticised, role in the success of our athletes and sports teams. Investing in coaches is a smart way to enhance our top athletes of tomorrow."

The Prime Minister’s High Performance Coach Scholarship programme, in its third year, helps New Zealand’s high performance coaches gain the knowledge and experience needed to inspire our potential sporting stars of tomorrow.

Kerry Hill (Athletics), Terry Gyde (Bike New Zealand), Erik du Vander (Equestrian), Shane Scott (Men’s Golf), Paul Derham (Hockey), Judith Hamilton (Rowing), Robbie Wyatt (Squash), Jenny Rose (Triathlon), and Shelley Duncan (Women’s Golf) each receive scholarships of $50,000.

The government has committed $1.2million to the programme this year, with the remaining 77 scholarships worth up to $10,000 each.
