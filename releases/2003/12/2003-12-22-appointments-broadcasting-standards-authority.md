Former television executive Paul France has been appointed to the board of the [Broadcasting Standards Authority](http://www.bsa.govt.nz/) and current member Diane Musgrave has been reappointed, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The BSA is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints after determination by broadcasters, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

Paul France has been appointed under [section 26 (1A) of the Broadcasting Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3397316009&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&jump=a1989-025%2Fs.26&softpage=DOC#JUMPDEST_a1989-025/s.26) ‘after consultation by the Minister with representatives of the broadcasting industry’.

Steve Maharey said his media background makes him an ideal member of the Authority.

“Paul France has an extensive background in television management and journalism. He worked in television journalism from 1970, including as editor of TVNZ’s news and current affairs programme Eye Witness News in the 1980s. From 1993-2000 he was CEO of Singapore based Asia Business News and then president of CNBC Asia after its merger with ABN. He has been a member of the Singapore Broadcasting Authority.

“Diane Musgrave has been a valuable member of the Authority since she was appointed to complete the remainder of a retiring member’s term in August. In particular she has brought her background as a television producer and media studies academic to the role,” Steve Maharey said.

“Paul France replaces Rodney Bryant whose term has expired. Rodney Bryant has been a thoughtful and dilligent contributor to the Authority's deliberations and I want to thank him for his service,” Steve Maharey said.

Paul France and Diane Musgrave have been appointed for three year terms.
