Aucklander James Wilson has been appointed the new Chief of the Employment Relations Authority, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson announced today.

Already a member of the Authority, he takes over from Alastair Dumbleton who has been both chief and an Auckland member since the Authority was established in 2000.

Alastair Dumbleton will remain a member for a further four-year term.

James Wilson served on the Employment Relations Authority from October 2000 to August 2002, when he resigned to take up a strategic employment relations role in the Health Sector. He was subsequently reappointed to the Authority in May 2003.

As Authority Chief, James Wilson will provide professional and strategic leadership to Authority members located in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. His term runs until May 2007.

The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand were consulted and support the appointments, Margaret Wilson said.
