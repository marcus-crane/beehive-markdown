Making sure that up-and-coming companies are best utilising the capital  
markets is an important factor in the drive to improve our economic and  
social performance, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton said today.

"Responsible governments should make a positive contribution to  
business development which is why I am pleased that New Zealand Trade and  
Enterprise has today launched a service designed to improve entrepreneurs'  
understanding of, and success from participating in, capital raising," Jim  
Anderton said.

The new Escalator service is designed to assist entrepreneurial New  
Zealanders and innovative small-to-medium sized companies better access  
investment capital and strategic partners.

"Ensuring efficient means for innovative growing companies to access  
capital is critical to the creation of high quality jobs for all of our  
people and building the conditions for long-term sustainable economic  
development," the Progressive leader said.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise earlier today launched the Escalator  
service, replacing the Investment Ready Scheme successfully operated by the  
Economic Development Association of New Zealand (EDANZ) and I Grow New  
Zealand Ltd. since July 2000.

The Escalator service will be managed by EDANZ and Deloitte and delivered  
in association with three independent brokers, providing companies with  
enhanced tools and training to better win either new equity partners or new  
strategic partnerships. Some companies will get assistance brokering deals.

The new enhanced service complements other New Zealand Trade and Enterprise  
services such as the nationwide Enterprise Training Programme and the  
Enterprise Development Fund.
