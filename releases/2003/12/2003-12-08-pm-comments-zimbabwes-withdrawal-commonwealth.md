New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said today that the decision of Zimbabwe’s government to withdraw from the Commonwealth showed that Zimbabwe was determined to fly in the face of international opinion and concern about its abuses of democratic and human rights.

Helen Clark said that the statement from Commonwealth leaders yesterday made it clear that the Commonwealth wanted to engage with Zimbabwe in a process which would bring it back into compliance with international norms.

“Zimbabwe’s government seems determined to thumb its nose at international opinion.

“The door is still open for the good offices of the Commonwealth to be used to improve the situation in Zimbabwe in the interests of all its people.

“It is unfortunate that President Mugabe has decided to shut the door on those who could help him rehabilitate his nation in the eyes of the world,” Helen Clark said.

“The Zimbabwe government’s decision to withdraw is not a disaster for the Commonwealth. It is an indictment of Zimbabwe’s government that it has chosen this path.

“Not withstanding Zimbabwe’s decision, the New Zealand Government hopes that Zimbabwe will reconsider and take the necessary steps to enable it to return to the Commonwealth as quickly as possible,” Helen Clark said.
