Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson has welcomed the release of three reports by Child, Youth and Family, along with the department’s responses.

The reports are:  
·the chief social worker’s review of the department’s involvement with Kelly Gush;  
·the chief social worker’s review of the department’s involvement with Tamati Pokaia; and  
·Ailsa Duffy QC’s review of Child, Youth and Family’s response to a telephone call received from Ron Burrows in January 2003.

“The three reports identify aspects of Child, Youth and Family’s social work practices, management systems and policies that need to be improved. Many of these issues have also been identified in the Baseline Review.

“Plans to employ 90 extra social workers, greater support for regional delivery of services, and more resources for family group conferences are among new measures that will help address concerns raised in these reports.”

Ruth Dyson said the Baseline Review recommendations would lead to further improvements within the department. The review, released in October 2003, recommended that Child, Youth and Family:  
·clarify its roles and functions;  
·address demand for services;  
·improve relationships with other agencies;  
·adopt a whole-of-organisation approach to service delivery; and  
·build corporate and business systems, information and workforce capability.

“In line with its commitment to support and strengthen the department, the government has agreed to invest additional funding for Child, Youth and Family over the next three years of up to $111.3 million for operational spending and up to $7.4 million for capital spending. In addition, up to $8.5 million will be invested in implementing the Care and Protection Blueprint.

“This investment will enable Child, Youth and Family to better work with families, communities and other agencies to protect children who are powerless to protect themselves.”
