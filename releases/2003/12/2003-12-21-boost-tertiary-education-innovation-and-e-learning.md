The approval of projects to promote e-learning and innovation in tertiary education totaling almost $34 million will be a significant boost for the sector, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The [Tertiary Education Commission](http://www.tec.govt.nz/) (TEC) today announced funding for 15 projects from its e-Learning [Collaborative Development Fund](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/strategic/ecdf/ecdf.htm) (eCDF) and 9 projects from its [Innovation and Development Fund](http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/strategic/idf/idf.htm) (IDF).

Steve Maharey said the projects are a shot in the arm for e-learning development, as well as being excellent examples of collaboration between education providers, business and industry.

“It was good to see the level of collaboration demonstrated in these applications, with a range of tertiary education providers and other organisations working jointly for the first time. Getting this kind of collaboration has been a focus of the tertiary education reforms.

“For example, eCDF funding will enable Te Tauhihu o nga Wängana, in collaboration with the two other wänanga, to work towards establishing a resource centre for Mäori in e-learning, make te reo Mäori language courses available online and increasing Mäori communities’ capability to drive their own educational research.

“Improving workplace e-learning is behind the initiative by the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology to deliver applied e-Learning in the workplace. This venture continues the successful relationship established between polytechnics and industry training organisations and will deliver improved electronic unit standards into an applied workplace setting.

“A number of important regional initiatives are also being funded. One excellent project is a Quality Training and Assessment Ltd initiative proposed for Manukau which will encourage sole parents in low socio-economic communities into tertiary education. This project will involve working with community partners and the local technical institute.

“These projects are a significant step towards realising the objectives of the Tertiary Education Strategy - greater collaboration between education providers, the community and industry,” Steve Maharey said.
