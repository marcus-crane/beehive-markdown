Free post for business tax payments

Businesses will be able to free post their payments of GST, PAYE and fringe benefit tax from the beginning of next year, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

“The move is part of the government’s ongoing project to reduce compliance costs and is a way of recognising the work business does on behalf of the tax system,” Dr Cullen said.

Free postage was provided on a three-year trial basis between 1995 and 1998 but was then discontinued.

“This government has carried out extensive research into the compliance cost concerns of small and medium-sized businesses and what they see as priority issues. Having to pay postage on tax payments is a recurring gripe.

“For many, it is a matter of principle. They see themselves as unpaid tax collectors who should at least be compensated for the price of the stamp to post their payments.

“The government has taken this concern on board and is funding reply-paid envelopes as part of its continuing work in simplifying the tax system and reducing business compliance costs,” Dr Cullen said.
