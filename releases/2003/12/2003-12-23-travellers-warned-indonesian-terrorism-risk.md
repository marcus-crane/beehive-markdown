New Zealanders travelling to Indonesia over the Christmas/New Year holiday period should be aware of the heightened risk of terrorist activity in Jakarta, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Recently-received information indicates that the risk of terrorism in Jakarta will be especially high during the holiday period,” Mr Goff said.

“The Indonesian Government has stepped up its security activity in response to the threat.

“New Zealanders visiting Jakarta are advised to take particular caution in shopping centres, places or worship, hotels and other places where westerners are likely to gather.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be reviewing and reissuing its [Indonesian travel advisory](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/travel/countries/indonesia.html) tomorrow to note the heightened threat.

"The Ministry will continue to advise against all non-essential travel to Indonesia, and against all travel to certain parts of Indonesia where there is civil unrest,” Mr Goff said.
