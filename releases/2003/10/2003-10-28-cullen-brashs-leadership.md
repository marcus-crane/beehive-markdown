Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen today congratulated Dr Don Brash on his election as the new leader of the National Party and challenged him to clean up National’s performance in the House.

“In my role as Leader of the House, it seems to me that Dr Brash has one very important job that he has to do.

“Under Bill English, National’s conduct in Parliament has gone from bad to worse. It has been dominated by adolescent tantrums and very bad behaviour particularly with respect to the Speaker.

“Dr Brash needs to bring some of his much proclaimed gravitas to this role and to start reminding his colleagues that their job is to attack the government, not the referee.

“I also congratulate in advance the fourth National finance spokesperson I have faced as Finance Minister and the seventh since I took over the finance portfolio for Labour in 1991.

“I trust whoever gets the job this time survives somewhat longer than their predecessors,” Dr Cullen said.
