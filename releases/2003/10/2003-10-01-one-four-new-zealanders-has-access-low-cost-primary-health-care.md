Health Minister Annette King says more than two million New Zealanders belong to Primary Health Organisations from today, with more than one in four New Zealanders now having access to low-cost primary health care.

Ms King visited one of New Zealand’s largest PHOs, HealthWEST in West Auckland, today to announce the establishment of seven more PHOs, bringing the total to 53 PHOs since the first were established on July 1 last year.

“This Government is absolutely committed to building strong public services, and primary health care is one of the most important of those services,” said Ms King.

“Today is particularly significant in the short history of PHOs, because from today all 6-17 year olds enrolled in PHOs will be funded to receive low-cost health care.

"This new initiative will affect an estimated 297,000 more young New Zealanders covered by PHOs.

“From July 1 next year all over 65s enrolled in PHOs will also be funded to receive low-cost health care. By then, it is estimated more than 200,000 older people will be in that category. We are now really making strides in our ambition to make quality primary health care affordable and accessible for all New Zealanders.”

Ms King said that the fact that PHOs now covered more than two million New Zealanders was a major achievement after just 15 months, and reflected the enthusiasm and efforts of many people in the health sector.

“PHOs have the very real potential to improve the overall health of all New Zealanders and reduce the unacceptable health inequalities that affect different groups of New Zealanders, particularly Maori, Pacific and low-income people.

“From today, there will be a total of 34 PHOs with extra Government funding to look after our high-need population groups, making a real difference with those people who need it most.

“But the significant investment this Government is making into the future health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders is not only about dollars and how we deliver affordable health care. It’s also about primary care providers in PHOs changing the way they work to find innovative approaches to keep their populations well within their community and out of hospital,” she said.

“Already we’re seeing exciting new plans around chronic disease management for conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. We’re also seeing good examples of teamwork with a variety of health professionals working together.”

Ms King said the potential benefits for New Zealanders who enrol with and stay with their regular primary health care provider are huge.

“International evidence backs up the importance of this sort of continuity of care where the PHO team gets to know their regulars and better understands and caters for their health needs, and people enrolled with PHOs can tell them about the services they want.’’

Seventeen of the country’s 21 district health boards (DHB) now have at least one PHO and Ms King said PHO plans were underway in the remaining DHB areas.

PHOs beginning October 1, 2003:

Questions and Answers

What is primary health care?  
Primary health care covers a broad range of out-of-hospital services, although not all of them are Government funded. It aims to improve the health of the people in communities by working with them through health improvement and preventative services, such as health education and counselling, disease prevention and screening.

Primary health care includes first level services such as general practice services, mobile nursing services and community health services targeted especially for certain conditions, for example maternity, family planning and sexual health services, mental health services and dentistry, or those using particular therapies such as physiotherapy, chiropractic and osteopathy services.

Chronic diseases, such as diabetes are best managed by primary health care services so that complications can be prevented or mitigated.

What is the Primary Health Care Strategy?  
Launched in February 2001 by Health Minister Annette King, the strategy builds on the population health focus and the objectives of the New Zealand Health Strategy and the New Zealand Disability Strategy. It outlines how a different approach to primary health care will improve the health of all New Zealanders through: a greater emphasis on population health, health promotion and preventative care; community involvement; involving a range of professionals and encouraging multidisciplinary approaches to decision-making; improving accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of services; improving co-ordination and continuity of care; providing and funding services according to the population’s needs as opposed to fee for services when people are unwell.

What is a Primary Health Organisation (PHO)?  
PHOs are the local provider organisations through which District Health Boards (DHBs) will implement the Primary Health Care Strategy. The essential features of PHOs are set out in the Minimum Requirements released by the Health Minister in November 2001:  
·PHOs will aim to improve and maintain the health of their populations and restore people's health when they are unwell. They will provide at least a minimum set of essential population-based and personal first-line general practice services.  
·PHOs will be required to work with those groups in their populations (for example, Maori, Pacific and lower income groups) that have poor health or are missing out on services to address their needs.  
·PHOs must demonstrate that they are working with other providers within their regions to ensure that services are co-ordinated around the needs of their enrolled populations.  
·PHOs will receive most of their funding through a population needs-based formula (capitation)  
·PHOs will enrol people through primary providers using consistent standards and rules  
·PHOs must demonstrate that their communities, iwi and consumers are involved in their governing processes and that the PHO is responsive to its community  
·PHOs must demonstrate how all their providers and practitioners can influence the organisation's decision-making  
·PHOs are to be not-for-profit bodies with full and open accountability for the use of public funds and the quality and effectiveness of services.

What is the Government's high-level direction for the Primary Health Care Strategy?  
The agreed high-level direction is as follows:  
·Subject to the availability of funding, the public share of primary health care funding will be substantially increased over the next 8-10 years  
·Over time, as PHOs are formed, they will be funded according to the needs of their enrolled populations to provide more effective and affordable care with a population health focus  
·As this happens, reliance on the Community Services Card (CSC) will be progressively reduced  
·As the CSC will still be needed for a number of years, measures will be implemented to improve its take-up in the meantime.

How are PHOs different from Independent Practitioner Associations?  
PHOs must meet a set of minimum requirements that do not apply to IPAs. Many IPAs would already meet some of these requirements but few would meet all of them at this stage. Several IPAs have made the changes necessary to become a PHO while others are supporting the establishment of PHOs locally. PHOs are also expected to develop as multi-disciplinary teams (eg doctors, nurses, Plunket, pharmacists, etc).

When did the first PHOs begin operating?  
TaPasefika Health Trust and Te Kupenga O Hoturoa, in the Counties Manukau District Health Board (DHB) region, were established in July 2002.

Is it important that people enrol with a single practice in a PHO?  
Yes. Enrolment with one practice offers huge potential benefits to people who use their services, but it also requires a two-way commitment. It means the team of health professionals will work to maintain and improve the health of those people enrolled with them. The PHO will work with other health services in the area to make sure patients get the most benefit from good quality health care.

What benefits will people get if they keep visiting the same PHO practitioners they’re enrolled with?  
·They’ll help them to better understand the health needs of the enrolled population, leading to improved health and wellbeing.  
·Regular visitors will be able to tell those caring for them about the services they want.  
·People enrolled will be able to visit whenever they want information on keeping well – they don’t need to be sick to visit for wellness checks.  
·Those people with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes will have better managed care.  
·We’ll be able to measure how well PHOs are doing looking after those groups of New Zealanders who have high health needs.

What are the formulae that have been developed to fund PHOs?  
There are two: Access and Interim.

How does the Access formula work?  
It allows all those enrolled with an Access PHO to be charged low patient fees, or access free care, and there will be no need to use CSCs. In the first instance, the Access formula will be available only for PHOs (or practices/clinics within PHOs) serving populations with high concentrations of NZ Deprivation Decile 9/10 and populations with high health needs.

What about the Interim formula?  
Until there is enough funding for all PHOs to be on the Access formula, an Interim formula will apply to other PHOs/practices. The Interim formula will continue to use CSC status both for determining funding and setting patient fees. It includes additional funding for a range of new functions such as health promotion and extra services to improve access for high-need groups.

Over time, as funding allows, the per capita amounts in the Interim formula will be increased towards the levels in the Access formula. This starts on 1 October 2003 with increases for children and young people. All New Zealanders enrolled in PHOs aged 65 years and over will be eligible for low-cost primary health care from 1 July 2004.

How are the existing PHOs funded?  
From October 1 2003 there will be 34 Access-funded PHOs, eight interim PHOs and 11 mixed (Interim PHOs with some practices in the area that qualify for Access funding).

What alternative funding approaches have been proposed and why?  
Following concerns expressed by some GP groups, several PHOs are trialling an add-on -- Care Plus -- that will give extra funding for another group with high health needs.

To be deemed a Care Plus patient, an individual must fulfill one of the first five criteria and criterion number six:

Any one of the following:

1.Has had six primary care visits in the past six months;  
2.Has had two acute non-surgical admissions in the past twelve months;  
3.Has a terminal illness;  
4.Has two or more chronic conditions;  
5.Is on active review for elective services;

And

6.Is assessed by the General Practice team as being expected to need ‘intensive clinical management’ (at least two hours of clinical management) over the following 6 months.

About five percent of the population will come into this category. All 'Care Plus’ patients will have a care plan developed for them, including quarterly reviews to check on health status, treatment, medications and so on. The care will be able to be delivered flexibly, using GPs and other members of the PHO team. Capitated funding will facilitate that.

How much will it cost New Zealanders to visit PHOs?  
All people enrolled with ‘Access’ PHOs will have low patient fees. Although charges will vary, Access PHOs should be able to offer free care for children under six. School-age children will generally be charged less than $10 while most adults will pay an average of $15 and no more than $22. Each Access PHO will agree maximum patient fees with its DHB.
