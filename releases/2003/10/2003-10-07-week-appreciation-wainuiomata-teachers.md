Education Minister Trevor Mallard officially launched Wainuiomata Teacher Appreciation Week today and thanked the area's teachers for their efforts during the recent area review.

"This is a wonderful opportunity to take time out and thank teachers for their work and dedication to quality education. Teachers can and do make the difference in students' success," Trevor Mallard said.

"Initiatives introduced in 2000 as part of the Wainuiomata network review have resulted in an enhanced sense of cohesive school identity and increased staff morale. This positive attitude can be seen in the efforts the community is going to for their teachers."

The Wainuiomata celebration is a nation-wide first, designed for the whole community to honour the work of their teachers and to raise the profile of education in the area.

The week involves a range of activities so students, families and the wider community can show appreciation for their teachers.

The week will include car washes, gifts such as plants, flowers, balloons, chocolate fish and cards, special breakfasts and school netball games.

"This government believes getting the right start in education is critical to students' success later in education and in work, and teachers are a vital part of this process.

"I recently released the 'Best Evidence' research reports which show that the quality of teaching is the most important school-based determinant of student outcomes. Quality teaching can result in significant gains in achievement for all students, regardless of their background."
