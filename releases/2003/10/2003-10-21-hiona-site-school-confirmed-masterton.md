Acting Education Minister Steve Maharey announced today that the new school created by the merger of Totara Drive School, Lansdowne School and Hiona Intermediate School in Masterton would be sited at Hiona Intermediate School.

A decision on the site was deferred from the final decisions on the Masterton schooling network review because of concerns over the possible existence of a faultline at the Hiona site. Following advice from the Ministry of Education, Education Minister Trevor Mallard signed off on the Hiona site shortly before leaving on an overseas education mission.

“The ministry has discussed the faultline concerns with the Masterton District Council, the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences and structural engineering consultants,” Steve Maharey said.

“The ministry has advised that there is currently no geophysical evidence confirming the existence of a fault on the site so the most prudent approach is to acknowledge the possibility and manage the possible risks.

“The buildings currently on the Hiona site have reinforced concrete foundations, light timber wall and roof framing and proper bracing. They are considered not to present a risk to the occupants in the event that the fault does exist and there is movement on the fault line.

“Despite the very low risk level, the Masterton District Council is undertaking a programme of further geophysical investigation.

“If the presence of the fault is confirmed, then a programme of gradually moving the affected buildings could be undertaken over a period of time based on further engineering advice,” Steve Maharey said.

Issues were also raised concerning the traffic safety environment of the Hiona site.

An investigation by traffic engineering consultants has found that potential safety problems can be managed by a combination of measures such as drop off and pick up lay-by/waiting areas; additional off-road car parking; and initiatives to encourage alternative modes of transport to and from school such as walking or public transport.
