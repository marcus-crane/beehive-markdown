Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed Child, Youth and Family’s decision to hold an independent investigation into their handling of a phone call to the department by Ron Burrows, father of Coral Burrows.

“An independent investigation is essential to maintain public confidence in the department’s ability to provide care and protection for our children and young people. It will establish whether the department’s system for recording phone calls is adequate, whether Mr Burrows’ call was dealt with appropriately, and whether this incident is symptomatic of wider problems in the department.

“The investigation will be undertaken by Auckland QC Ailsa Duffy. An announcement about the terms of reference will be made early next week. The investigation will begin as soon as possible and its findings will be made public.”

Ms Dyson said she deeply regretted any distress to Mr Burrows and his family.
