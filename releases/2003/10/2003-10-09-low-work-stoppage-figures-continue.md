[Latest work stoppage figures](http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/web/Hot+Off+The+Press+Work+Stoppages+June+2003+quarter?open) released by Statistics New Zealand continue to show a low level of industrial action, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“There were five work stoppages recorded in the June 2003 quarter, the second lowest number under the Employment Relations Act,” she said.

“Just the one work stoppage was recorded for the March 2003 quarter, which is the lowest result since the recording of quarterly figures began in 1945.”

Margaret Wilson said June 2003 year-end figures also make good reading with 31 stoppages recorded, which is 15 fewer than the previous year, and comparable to other recent June years.

“The yearly figures for numbers of employees involved, and losses in person days and wages are all lower than the previous year, although they are relatively high when compared with other recent June years.”

Media reports would suggest the Carter Holt Harvey and teachers’ disputes largely drove this year’s figures, Margaret Wilson said.
