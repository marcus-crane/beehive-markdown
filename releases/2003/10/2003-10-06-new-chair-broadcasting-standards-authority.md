Wellington-based barrister and solicitor Joanne Morris OBE has been appointed as the new chair of the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA), Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Ms Morris replaces Peter Cartwright whose term has expired. The BSA is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints after determination by broadcasters, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

Steve Maharey said Joanne Morris’ considerable experience of tribunal work and her knowledge of broadcasting issues make her an ideal chair for the Authority.

“In 1989 Joanne Morris was appointed as a foundation member of the Broadcasting Standards Authority and was closely involved in its early development. She was reappointed twice during the 1990s.

“She has since had wide experience of other quasi-judicial bodies. She is a current and long-standing member of the Waitangi Tribunal and was previously the chair of the Police Appointment Review Committee.

“She has also held key policy development and reform roles, including membership of the Law Commission (1994-1999) and is a member of the establishment board of the new Legal Services Agency. In 1993 she was awarded an OBE for public services.

“There has been a trend of more complex cases coming before the Authority. Ms Morris’ considerable legal expertise and interest in broadcasting issues will continue to ensure the Authority has the right mix of skills and experience to adjudicate them.

“In order to ensure a smooth transition the outgoing chair, Peter Cartwright, will be available to complete outstanding matters that were previously commenced, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act,” Steve Maharey said.

Joanne Morris’ appointment is for three years. She is married with two school-aged children.
