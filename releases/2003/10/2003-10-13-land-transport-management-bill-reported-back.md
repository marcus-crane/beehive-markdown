The Transport Minister Paul Swain says the key purpose and principles of the Land Transport Management Bill have been strengthened by the work of the Select Committee, which has just reported the bill back to Parliament.

"I want to thank the members of the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee, and the officials who supported their work, for the effort they have put into this bill," says Mr Swain.

"This is a better bill as a result of the changes made by the Select Committee, which has listened to the public submissions."

"This bill was introduced because of the need to take a multi-modal approach to the transport sector, to bring consistency to long-term planning of the networks, to have an integrated transport infrastructure, and to provide new mechanisms for funding roads."

"These key principles will be reinforced by the changes, which are designed to make the bill work better."

Mr Swain says the changes can be grouped into six key areas: -

- **Consultation**  
  Consultation requirements have been simplified and made consistent, with the removal of overlap and duplication - e.g. consultation on long-term financial forecasts and land transport programmes has been combined.
  
  Provisions have been made consistent with the new Local Government Act 2002, clarifying what principles should be applied to consultation, and setting out clear processes for organisations to follow.
- **Efficiency**  
  Efficiency is now to be taken into account when Transfund assesses funding applications or activities. Clause 20(3)(c).
  
  While efficiency has always been a key aspect of the bill, many submissions asked for efficiency to be specifically referred to in the bill.
- **More flexible tolling arrangements**  
  Many submissions made the point that tolling should be extended to include existing infrastructure.
  
  The government has decided the broader issue of tolling existing infrastructure, which is being addressed by the joint officials group on Auckland issues, is better suited to a later bill if necessary.
  
  However the Select Committee has decided to include a degree of flexibility in the bill in response to the submissions.
  
  In essence, this flexibility will only apply in exceptional cases where the existing road is a vital component of the new roading project. All such exceptions will require the specific approval of the Minister. Clause 53(2)
- **Public Private Partnerships - PPPs (Concession Agreements)**  
  PPPs are arrangements where the private sector and public agencies work together to bring forward projects that are difficult to fund under existing funding arrangements.  
  Many submissions on the bill said there needed to be more flexibility if PPPs were to be an option for New Zealand.
  
  Under the changes made by the Select Committee, PPPs will be easier to finance and undertake, with the bill changed to make them more workable, and reduce uncertainty.  
  Some of the more onerous provisions have been removed, and the bill allows for early conditional approval from the Transport Minister.
  
  Leasing has also been made possible, and this type of arrangement has worked well overseas - such as in the Melbourne City Link project.
  
  It allows parties more flexibility to set up commercial arrangements that best suit their needs and their views about risk.
  
  The public sector will still own the land throughout the term of the agreement. Clause 61A(2)(b)
- **Regional planning**  
  Regional transport planning has been improved by emphasising the strategic focus of Regional Land Transport Strategies, and by clarifying the relationship between various planning organisations.
- **Regional councils**  
  Regional Councils will be able to own and operate public transport services and infrastructure. Clause 32(3)
  
  This is a manifesto commitment by Labour.
  
  The complicated approval process in the bill as introduced has been removed, and the bill now clarifies that regional council acquisitions of this nature will be undertaken consistent with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2002.

Mr Swain says the LTMB is a major step forward to address New Zealand's transport infrastructure.

"However this bill is not the end of the story."

"Currently the government and the Auckland region are working on proposals that will provide further funding options for transport."  
"Further legislation may be needed next year depending on what is agreed from the Auckland work."

"This work is being kept broad enough so that it could also provide solutions for all of New Zealand, if needed."

"Announcements on this programme of work are due in mid-December," says Mr Swain.
