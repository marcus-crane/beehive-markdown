Hon Jim Anderton, Minister for Economic Development, signed an  
arrangement on Technical Barriers to Trade with Chinese Minister Li  
Changjiang today.

"This is a welcome development. With global tariffs coming down,  
reducing technical barriers to trade has become the focus of  
international effort", Jim Anderton said.

Technical regulatory requirements can impose considerable transaction  
costs on companies operating across borders. Companies are faced with  
having to comply with different standards or specifications for their  
products and, in some cases, are required to double test their  
products.

Jim Anderton noted that this arrangement with China would provide New  
Zealand with the opportunity to develop a cooperative relationship  
with Chinese counterparts and improve knowledge and understanding of  
our respective technical and regulatory regimes.

"It will help build confidence in the strength of each other's  
technical infrastructure and regulatory approaches and will find ways  
to reduce compliance costs faced by New Zealand businesses which  
export to China," Jim Anderton said.

The first meeting of senior officials in terms of the arrangement  
will be held next year.
