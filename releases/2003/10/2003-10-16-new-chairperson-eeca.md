Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today announced the appointment of Mark Ford as chairperson of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority ([EECA](http://www.eeca.govt.nz/)).

Mr Ford is the chief executive of Watercare Services, Auckland's publicly-owned water and wastewater company. Previously he has been chief executive of the New Zealand Forestry Corporation and the Auckland Regional Services Trust and managing director of New Zealand Timberlands. He has also held senior positions in the petroleum industry in Europe and the United States. Mr Ford is a trustee of WWF New Zealand and a member of the executive council of the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development.

"I am very pleased to have secured Mark Ford's services as chair of the Authority," Mr Hodgson said. "EECA is the lead agency implementing the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, which is crucial for New Zealand's progress towards a sustainable energy future. I am sure that Mr Ford's leadership and strategic skills will help EECA build on its achievements."

Mr Ford succeeds Mike Underhill, chief executive of Waikato electricity lines company WEL Networks, as chairperson. Mr Underhill has been on the EECA board since October 1995 and in the chair since June 2000.

"Mike Underhill's enthusiasm and vision for energy efficiency and conservation have been a real asset for EECA," Mr Hodgson said. "I am very grateful for the great energy and commitment Mike has consistently brought to his work with the Authority."
