A new state primary school will be established at Baverstock Road, Flat Bush to meet projected population growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The school is scheduled to open at the beginning of 2005.

The decision to establish a new primary school, for students from new entrants to year 8, follows consultation with existing schools and the local community.

"I have indicated that the school will almost certainly become a Year 1-6 contributing school as further schools are opened in the area," Trevor Mallard said.

"I'd like to thank all parents, the boards of trustees and members of the Flat Bush community who participated in the consultation process. I have carefully considered all your views and hope the establishment of this school will be welcomed by parents in the region."

The school is being established to take pressure off Willowbank School and provide additional school capacity in this rapidly growing area of Manukau City.

The new school on the Baverstock Road site, which was purchased in 2001, will be able to accommodate up to 700 students.

Following this announcement, the establishment board of trustees will be appointed for the new school. Nominations are being sought from a range of parties including local schools, residents, community groups, Auckland City Council and local MPs. It is anticipated that the members of the board will have a range of skills and background knowledge, and reflect the needs and aspirations of the local community.
