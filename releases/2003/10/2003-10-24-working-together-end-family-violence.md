Comments at a Family Violence Focus Group meeting. Palmerston North City Council building.

Introduction

\[Slide one]

It is a privilege for me to see the number and range of organisations represented at this morning’s workshop. Palmerston North’s Safer Community Council and Family Violence Focus Group are clearly committed to working together to reduce family violence, and to help the families who suffer from it.

Congratulations to you all, and many thanks to Marilyn Brown of the Family Violence Focus Group for organising this workshop.

The topics you have covered today could not be more timely or important. Family violence directly affects the well-being of families and their ability to participate in society. It creates high personal costs for the people involved, and significant social and economic costs to society as a whole.

\[Slide two]

In New Zealand, an average of 12 women a year are killed by their partners.

Each year – in Auckland alone - over 30,000 people are reported as affected by incidents of family violence.

And, each year, the fall out from family violence costs this country anything between 1 billion and over 5 billion dollars.

What we know about family violence

\[Slide three]

We know that family violence takes many forms: verbal, physical, sexual, and psychological. We know that the victims of the most severe and lethal cases are predominantly women and children, and the perpetrators are predominantly male. We also know that Mâori are significantly over-represented as both victims and perpetrators of family violence.

\[Slide four]

But family violence is a wider phenomenon than these broad statements suggest. It touches families from all cultures, classes, backgrounds and socio-economic circumstances.

\[Slide five]

Spouse or partner abuse includes both male and female, and lesbian and gay. Violence can be perpetrated by a child against their parent or against a sibling. Family violence also includes the abuse and neglect of the elderly.

I know you are here to stop one more New Zealander from suffering physical abuse; one more New Zealander from suffering emotional abuse. I know you want to see a stop to the chain of violence passing from one generation to the next.

\[Slide six]

The wellbeing of New Zealand families is a high priority for this Government. But we know that finding effective solutions to complex social problems requires more than law and regulation.

Much of the work in prevention, support and restoration takes place outside government reaches.

Only our combined strength will stem the increase in violence inside our homes, in our backyards, and over the fence.

This morning I want look at where we are at in understanding and preventing family violence in this country and the progress that we can achieve together.

The shame of family violence

\[Slide seven]

I began my address with a few statistics. Unfortunately, there are plenty more.

·In the year 2000, 52% of murders related to family violence.  
·The same year, 9 children were murdered as the result of family violence.  
·Recent studies have found that a third of women report physical or sexual abuse by their male partners.  
·38,000 children witnessed the over-30,000 incidents attended by police between 1996 and 1997. A significant proportion were under 10 years old.  
·Nearly 8,000 women and over 9,000 children accessed Women’s Refuge services during 2000 and 2001. 44% of the women and 49% of the children were Mâori.  
·Just over a third of women seeking the help of the Refuge referred themselves. Police referred another third.

These statistics reveal the shame of family violence in New Zealand society. It’s the side that many New Zealanders don’t want to look at, let alone acknowledge.

\[Slide eight]

But it’s not something we can ignore. The effects of family violence, especially on children, are far reaching and multi dimensional.

Children experiencing family violence are more likely to develop severe cognitive and behavioural problems. They are more likely to become violent in adolescence, and so continue the cycle of violence.

What works?

\[Slide nine]

So, what works when it comes to preventing family violence?

Firstly, we know that any approach must be multifaceted. We must meet the challenge at all the different levels at which it strikes. There is general agreement about the broader elements within such an approach. These include:  
·using education to prevent family violence occurring in the first place  
·strengthening community action and responsiveness  
·preventing reoccurrence by providing appropriate crisis intervention and treatment services  
·identifying violence early and intervening immediately  
·using culturally relevant approaches  
·recognising and providing for diverse needs and circumstances  
·developing healthy public policy aimed at fostering equality, reducing socio-economic disparities and providing adequate support for families and whânau.

\[Slide ten]

Also, there needs to be a means of maintaining an ongoing high level of commitment to preventing violence in families and whânau. And this needs to happen across the family violence prevention sector. That’s across Government and across community.

To successfully curb family violence requires an integrated, co-ordinated and collaborative approach.

This is where Te Rito comes in.

A strategy for prevention

\[Slide eleven]

Te Rito New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy was launched in March 2002. It is the Government’s official response to the family violence prevention plan of action released a year earlier. Te Rito builds on progress already achieved by government and community in the prevention of family violence in New Zealand, while determining the way forward.

Te Rito’s foundations are rooted in the very collaboration it seeks to engender. The strategy was developed by the Ministry of Social Development in collaboration with a large group of government and non-government agencies. This was in recognition of the knowledge, expertise and experience that communities offer.

\[Slide twelve]

At Te Rito’s core is a vision of a New Zealand where families and whânau are living free from violence. From there, the strategy sets five key goals.

\[Slide thirteen]

It seeks to encourage intolerance to violence in families and whânau as a way to effect attitudinal change. This requires New Zealanders to understand its dimensions and manifestations, and play their part in preventing it.

It targets a co-ordination of response efforts to ensure that quality services are available and accessible to all.

Te Rito seeks to provide preventive education and support to children, young people and their families and whânau. And it promotes the early identification of violence.

Te Rito aims to ensure prevention approaches are culturally relevant and effective for our diverse populations. And it targets consistent and ongoing commitment to family violence prevention.

\[Slide fourteen]

Te Rito has 18 specific areas of action. Staged over a 5-year period, these areas are all interrelated. Gains made in one area will spark gains in others, fuelling the progress towards a society living without violence.

Let’s take a few minutes to review some of the progress.

Greater communication and collaboration

A key thread to Te Rito is the critical need for collaboration. Enhanced collaboration is a core principle of the strategy. It is also a deliverable of the strategy – area of action 14.

\[Slide fifteen]

Under this area, Budget 2003 funding was secured for Child, Youth and Family to resource existing collaborative prevention initiatives and to support community involvement in the Family Violence Funding Collaboration Project.

This Project involves the five main government agencies who fund family violence: Child, Youth and Family, Courts, Internal Affairs, Corrections, and ACC: developing a shared accountability for the way funding is allocated.

This is aimed at supporting the capacity and sustainability of the community organisations who provide family violence prevention services, and on reducing compliance costs for service providers who are funded by more than one agency.

Meanwhile, planning hui with community networks and iwi will help determine the funding priorities for each region.

\[Slide sixteen]

Progress on yet another area of action of Te Rito demonstrates how the strategy is fostering collaboration across the family violence prevention sector generally.

A police-led project is seeking to address Te Rito area of action 3 - enhancing the screening and risk assessment mechanisms used by people working with children and families. The project aims to ensure the mechanisms are robust, and that people know what to do when they identify a risk of family violence.

The power of research

\[Slide seventeen]

Information is power. Budget 2003 recognised this, providing funding for the establishment of a research and best practice information service on family violence. Delivering on area of action 8 of Te Rito, the purpose of this service is to co-ordinate, promote and distribute information on family violence.

A Family Violence Clearinghouse will be formed to provide a comprehensive information resource for community organisations. This answers a direct need raised by community organisations and will span national and international family violence prevention research and evaluation.

Part of the service’s role will be to identify gaps in New Zealand research and evaluation and to propose ways of plugging them.

Progress for self-referred victims and offenders

\[Slide eighteen]

Funding has been made available for services to help victims and offenders who self-refer for programmes funded through the Domestic Violence Act. Significant numbers of people affected by family violence self-refer to these programmes.

In the past, these services were only funded for clients who had protection orders or were mandated by the Court.

With ongoing Budget funding secured since 2002, Child, Youth and Family has now contracted 68 provider organisations to offer services to self-referring victims and offenders. Funding has been targeted to existing programmes for men, women and children affected by family violence.

Reducing violence in Mâori communities

\[Slide nineteen]

Many of Te Rito’s areas of action focus on the unique needs of Mâori, Pacific and other ethnic communities. A key principle is recognising, providing for and fully engaging the structures and practices of whânau, hapû and iwi. This principle applies to all of the areas of action across the strategy.

Area of action 5 specifically aims to prevent violence in Mâori communities. Te Puni Kokiri is drawing on, refining and developing a Whânau Violence Conceptual Framework. The Framework was developed by a Ministerial Mâori Taskforce on family violence appointed by my colleague Hon Tariana Turia. It includes a specialist training programme to respond to, address and monitor whânau violence.

Reducing violence in Pacific communities

\[Slide twenty]

A framework for preventing violence in Pacific communities has been developed by the Ministries of Pacific Island Affairs and Social Development. This task was undertaken in collaboration with Pacific peoples and progresses area of action 6 of the strategy.

The framework seeks to harness the strengths of Pacific communities in addressing the key issues and priorities identified. Particular focus is on strengthening leadership, knowledge and partnerships as the foundation for combined government and community action.

Awareness of, and education about, family violence in Pacific communities is another key strand. An action plan is under development to implement the aims and goals of this specific framework.

Strengthening New Zealand families

Though not specifically part of the Te Rito strategy, other cross–sectoral work is focused on strengthening the wellbeing of children and families.

\[Slide twenty-one]

The Care and Protection Blueprint 2003, was launched in February this year.

The Blueprint extends the entire care and protection community to provide an integrated approach for preventing and addressing child abuse and neglect. It provides a vision and a plan of action for agencies, organisations and individuals involved in some way in addressing and preventing abuse and neglect.

Its focus is to provide a way for all those involved to work effectively together.

A Blueprint steering group of government and community representatives is now providing leadership and oversight of the promotion and ongoing development and implementation of the Blueprint.

Alternatives to physical punishment

\[Slide twenty-two]

All this work is aimed at creating a society that has zero tolerance of family violence.

The Government is investing $10.8 million in a public education campaign to influence attitudes and behaviours away from physical punishment of children. The strategy will promote the benefits of positive parenting, emphasising safe, effective, non-physical ways of disciplining children, appropriate to the child’s stage of development.

Early evaluations on the two-year campaign will be available in 2005. The Government has agreed that it will then consider legislative options about section 59 of the Crimes Act.

A role for us all

\[Slide twenty-three]

Stemming a culture of abuse is a challenge for us all. Singularly and collectively, individuals, agencies, advocates, communities and government have a role to play. Especially so that our children have the best opportunities to realise their potential, and participate fully in society.

I hope each of us leaves here today with a renewed sense of our achievements, and of the importance of our future work in removing the threat and incidence of violence from every New Zealand home. It is something our children, families, communities, and country need us to do.

A quote from Confucius is as true in New Zealand today as it was in China over two thousand years ago.

“To put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order. To put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order. To put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life. We must set our hearts right.”
