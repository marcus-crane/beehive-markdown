Pupils and teachers at five schools in and around Wellington will benefit from an expanded nationwide information and communications technology (ICT) programme, Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs says.

The use of ICT in classrooms has been given another significant push with the addition of an extra 249 schools into the ICT cluster programme.

Before the end of this year, 40 clusters of schools will have joined the existing 43 clusters already on the national programme for professional development. The number of schools involved in the programme since it began now totals 1044, or about forty per cent of schools.

“This programme is benefiting four schools in Wellington as their teachers, through the ICT clusters, develop greater skills and confidence with the technology in the classroom. It’s a major investment by the government, worth $9.8 million nationally in the next financial year,” Marian Hobbs said.

“ICT is one of the keys to growing a more innovative economy. Ensuring our students are equipped with 21st century skills is a top priority for the government in education, as it has become an important and very successful tool for students’ learning.

“The schools involved in the existing clusters are improving teacher capabilities; they're already successfully using ICT to enhance learning and teaching," Marian Hobbs said.

Each school cluster will have $120,000 available each year to support ICT professional development activities. The programme will:  
·help teachers use ICT for teaching, learning and administration;  
·meet important learning outcomes through activities that integrate ICT into teaching and learning;  
·explore new ways to use ICT in educational activities – especially with the education website Te Kete Ipurangi (www.tki.org.nz) for students, teachers and communities;  
·establish new ways for the Ministry of Education to distribute information;  
·use ICT for administration;  
·develop methods for ICT technical support; and  
·form policies and sustainable development plans for ICT.

The new schools involved in the ICT clusters in Wellington city are Scots College, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Nga Mokopuna, Samuel Marsden Collegiate, and St Mary's College, with a total of some 1,924 students enrolled. Also Te Kura Maori o Porirua, with 172 students.

Greater Wellington schools previously announced as cluster leaders are Brooklyn, Evans Bay Intermediate, Rata Street, Heretaunga College, Karori West Normal, Houghton Valley and Porirua.
