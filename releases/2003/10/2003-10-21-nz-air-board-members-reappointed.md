Professor Albert Wendt, Gaylene Preston and James Coleman have been reappointed to the Board of NZ on Air for a further three years, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

NZ on Air is a Crown entity established under the Broadcasting Act 1989 to support local content on radio and television. In 2003-04 it will distribute $101.8 million of funding to National Radio and Concert FM; for locally-made television programmes; the promotion of New Zealand music on commercial, access and community radio stations; radio programming; transmission coverage to remote areas and the archiving of television programmes and radio broadcasts.

Steve Maharey said New Zealanders are strong supporters of locally-produced television and radio programmes and are great supporters of the flourishing Kiwi music industry.

“New Zealanders consistently tune in in large numbers to Kiwi talent. Supporting broadcasters to get more local performers to air demonstrates the government’s commitment to developing a more creative and confident nation.

“All three board members have made a significant contribution to the Board and the government is fortunate to have secured their involvement at this level for a further three-year term:  
·Professor Albert Wendt is being reappointed as Deputy Chair. He has a strong background in the arts and his reappointment also reinforces the importance of bringing a variety of ethnic perspectives to the Board;  
·Gaylene Preston is one of New Zealand’s leading film-makers and brings wide knowledge and experience of programme making to the Board; and  
·rising Auckland radio star James Coleman brings his practical experience of being behind the mic and, in particular, his knowledge of the youth-oriented broadcasting.

“Other members of the NZ on Air Board are Don Hunn (Chair), Edie Moke and Judy Callingham,” Steve Maharey said.
