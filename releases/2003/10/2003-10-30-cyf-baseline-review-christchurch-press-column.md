Children and young people are our future. We need a strong safety net to care for and protect them when families are in difficulty. That is Child, Youth and Family’s role, and it must have the resources and systems in place to to do a good job.

That’s why we called for a ‘whole-of-organisation’ review of the department at the end of last year. By that time, it had been in operation for two full financial years. This was long enough to give us a good knowledge of the real issues facing it. To conduct the review any earlier may simply have highlighted teething problems caused by it becoming a stand-alone department in 1999 under the previous government.

By the time the review was completed, we had already brought in a number of measures to strengthen the department. We had increased Child, Youth and Family’s baseline funding by more than 50 per cent, strengthened the social work profession by introducing a system of formal registration, and greatly improved our relationships with the community sector.

The review team – made up of Treasury, Ministry of Social Development, State Services Commission and Child, Youth and Family - showed that the department is struggling to do a difficult job and meet community expectations which are often unrealistic. It has systemic problems, its priorities are unclear and the quality of its services are variable.

The department’s primary roles are to investigate and respond to concerns about the care and protection of children and young people, and deal with young offenders. It also manages adoption services, contracts with and funds community service providers, and runs public education programmes designed to raise awareness of child abuse and neglect.

The review has given us the information we need to make positive changes. Child, Youth and Family have already prepared a detailed plan of action to implement the review’s five key recommendations, namely to:  
·clarify the expectations, outcomes, roles and functions of the department; address the demand for services;  
·improve the department’s interaction with other agencies and sectors;  
·adopt a whole-of-organisation approach to service delivery; and  
·build corporate and business systems, information and workforce capability.

Child, Youth and Family’s immediate priorities are to relieve the pressure on staff by employing more than 100 extra front-line social workers, develop ways to better manage demand for its services, and give greater support to regional delivery of services.  
Money alone will not solve Child, Youth and Family’s problems, but it will help, alongside other improvements in systems and structures. That’s why we have allocated up to $111.3 million more for operational spending in the next three years, and up to $7.4 million more for capital spending.

In addition, we will invest up to $8.5 million more in implementing the Care and Protection Blueprint, including improved education services and mental health services, and improved support for people with disabilities.

The department successfully helps thousands of New Zealand children, young people and families every year. But it can’t do its job alone. There are no simple solutions to many of the problems facing families. Protecting children and young people is a broad community responsibility. As former family court judge Mick Brown has said,” Child abuse is about adult behaviour.”

Child, Youth and Family will continue to have strong relationships with community providers. Current funding arrangements for existing services will remain in place for the time being. However, over time, the department will focus on funding services that are more closely in line with its primary role of ensuring the safety and security of children and young people. As a result, some community organisations may end up being funded by other government agencies.

At the same time, we need better coordination of all the services that support our families. The Ministry of Social Development will pick up this new role. It already has a strong platform of broad-based family support, including responsibility for the Strengthening Families initiative between the health, education and social service sectors.

An advisory group of Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development and the State Services Commission has been set up to advise us on the implementation of the review’s recommendations, and to support Child, Youth and Family. This is in line with our view that the department cannot operate effectively in isolation. It needs wide support from both government and non-government organisations.

It is in all our interests to ensure that our children and young people are cared for well. Blaming individuals for Child, Youth and Family’s failings is not helpful. Clarifying the department’s role, improving its processes and systems, and investing in services, is the best way to build a strong, effective and accountable organisation that families and communities can rely on.
