Two hundred and seventy applications have been received for a share of the $34 million the government is investing in the transformation of tertiary education organisations and the development of e-learning capability.

The contestable $20 million Innovation and Development Fund (IDF) and $14 million e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund (eCDF) have been established to improve the connectedness of tertiary education organisations with the needs of business and the community, and to foster the use of technology-based learning tools. Both capital and operational funding is available for projects to be undertaken during the period 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said the funding shows the government’s commitment to achieving the goals set out in the Tertiary Education Strategy.

“The number of applications received for this new funding, and the calibre of the individual applications, demonstrates that tertiary education organisations have been carefully thinking about their future role in the new system and how they could make use of new learning technologies. The government has provided this new funding to support them to do so.

“One hundred and thirty nine applications have been received for the funding from the IDF. It supports new and innovative ideas to improve the operation of the tertiary education system, and initiatives to help tertiary education organisations deliver on the Tertiary Education Strategy and national goals.

“One hundred and thirty one applications were received for funding from the e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund (eCDF). It supports e-learning projects that improve access to education and/or raises the quality of education offered to learners.

“The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is responsible for assessing the applications and allocating the funding. Applicants will be notified by 22 December 2003 as to the result of their application,” Steve Maharey said.
