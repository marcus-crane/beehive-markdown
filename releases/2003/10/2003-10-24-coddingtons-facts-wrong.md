Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard said former journalist Deborah Coddington is demonstrating why those who can do and those who can’t go into Parliament in minor parties.

“Ms Coddington’s latest accusation towards the New Zealand Film Commission is wrong. In her attempt to jump on the anti-Film Commission band wagon she has failed to check her facts.

“IMDb, a film industry website, has unfortunately made an error in its information on various New Zealand films, including Geoff Murphy’s latest New Zealand film Spooked. The website lists NZ Film Commission chief executive Ruth Harley as a producer of this and other films.

“The Commission has never supplied such information and they don’t know where IMDb got it from. The information is incorrect, and obviously is a serious error, as the Commission acts not as a producer of films, but in a supporting role through investment, marketing, industry support and other activities.

“Had Ms Coddington bothered to ask me, I could have told her. Instead, she chooses to ignore the good work that the NZ Film Commission does on New Zealanders’ behalf, and focuses on petty, incorrect details.”

Judith Tizard said for more than a quarter of a century the Commission has had a central role in supporting and promoting New Zealand films such as Whale Rider, which has won several major international awards. The Commission’s development role has been essential in the early careers of major New Zealand filmmakers such as Peter Jackson, Jane Campion and more recently Christine Jeffs.

“This is a social, cultural and economic investment in our own culture and New Zealanders like seeing their stories on the big screen. Whale Rider – the first film to be assisted by the government’s $22m Film Production Fund – is still screening 38 weeks after its local release, and has earned nearly $6.5 million at the New Zealand box office.

“The New Zealand film industry is going from strength to strength. Next month, the London Film Festival opens and closes with films by New Zealand directors, and features the UK premiere of Gaylene Preston’s Perfect Strangers. I’m proud, New Zealanders are proud. It’s a pity Ms Coddington can’t be proud of our achievements.

“Her chilly reaction to the success of New Zealand filmmaking indicates to me she might be in need of a woolly scarf.”
