Greetings to the Prime Minister, Mayors from Southland, Invercargill and Gore; Tuatapere Community College Board of Trustees, principal, staff and students; representatives from Venture Southland and Whoosh Wireless - Rod Inglis

Sustained economic development doesn't just happen: today invention, innovation and creativity need the support of a coherent infrastructure.

The foundation of that infrastructure today is undoubtedly fast, reliable, affordable broadband access to the Internet, which is what Project Probe provides.

Southland is the first to fulfill the Government's aim that every school and surrounding community in each of the 14 regions involved in Project Probe will have access to this technology.

And it is significant that schools, so often the centre of rural communities, have such an integral part to play, because provision of the services is only part of the process.

Learning how to use them effectively is equally essential and over $6 million will be invested in developing effective e-learning practice in schools.

It is interesting to note that the Chinese government, in exploring how to role out broadband in their regions, have read all the Probe documentation available on New Zealand websites. T

Their conclusion is that the success of Probe so far has been due to the resolve and determination of local leaders.

They state in a report that the lesson from New Zealand is that local leaders need to have the vision to understand how the technology can be used to make a difference to local communities.

In this area, Southland has been particularly proactive. Southland was one of the five regions which participated in the broadband pilots I initiated in 2001, and which the Ministry of Economic Development funded.

Steve Canny was a leading light in that project and due to his vision Southland established the template and methodology for other regions to follow.

Ensuring our children have access to the tools of the twenty-first century was a key reason the Government was happy to put up tens of millions of dollars for Probe, and I'm sure that it was a key reason why local communities have pulled up their sleeves and gotten involved.

There is ample evidence to show that New Zealanders are very quick to access technology where it is available, just as there is a clear correlation between technological proficiency and wealth.

Our tradition of innovation is testimony to the fact that much of our creativity lies in the heartland - in isolated rural communities where practical solutions to problems are a matter of course.

These are the very people we need to drive economic development and broadband access ensures their participation
