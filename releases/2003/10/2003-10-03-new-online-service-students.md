Students are being urged to apply online and get their finances sorted early, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

A new online student loans, allowances and bursary application system for tertiary students was launched at StudyLink’s Palmerston North office this morning. The new site is quick and easy to use and will help ensure StudyLink processes student loan and allowance applications speedily.

Steve Maharey watched as Massey student, Jackson O’Riley, applied for his Student Allowance online.

“Students can complete their loans and allowances applications in one session if they have all the required information.

“However, the real advance with the new online system is that students can begin their application process, then save it while they get more information, or call the StudyLink helpline to ask questions. They can return to their application at any time, add some more information and then send it when they are ready to do so.

“The new service will help students to get their finances sorted out and it’ll also help StudyLink smooth out the big spikes in the flow of applications.

“Students will still be able to apply in the more traditional ways, in person and by post, but applying online will certainly be the easiest and quickest way,” Steve Maharey said.

A nationwide advertising campaign aimed at students begins with advertisements in campus newspapers, on the web and student and mainstream radio this week. The campaign runs form October to February. A supplementary campaign aimed at parents and others will be running simultaneously from December to January.
