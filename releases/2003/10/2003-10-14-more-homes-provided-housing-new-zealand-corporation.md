Almost 30,000 people were assisted into housing and an additional 2,500 state rental properties provided last year, Housing Minister Steve Maharey said today.

These are some of the highlights noted in the Housing New Zealand Corporation 2002-03 Annual Report tabled in Parliament today. The report shows the breadth of work now carried out by the Corporation. In 2002-03 this included installing insulation in more than 2,600 older homes, modernising nearly 450 houses and opening the door to home ownership for low-income earners through the rural regional loans programme.

Steve Maharey said there is a continuing high demand for state housing, especially in Auckland, and as a result HNZC is developing new ways to assist people into housing.

“HNZC has new funding worth $63 million over the next 4 years to partner with local government and non-government organisations on the provision of rental housing and home ownership opportunities to low-income earners. Workshops are now underway across the country with interested groups to introduce these initiatives.

“HNZC has also increased its number of properties by 2521 during the year, with 1,666 of those through the purchase of former Auckland City Council units. Some 29,400 people were assisted into housing through the creation of nearly 10,000 new tenancies.

“Other projects the Corporation has been involved in include:  
·the community renewal programmes now underway in five communities, with a further project under development;  
·the Healthy Housing programme operated in partnership with District Health Boards; and  
·partnerships with community-based iwi groups to improve housing in their areas,” Steve Maharey said.
