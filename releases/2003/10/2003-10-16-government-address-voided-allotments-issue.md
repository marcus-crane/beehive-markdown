The government is seeking to address the voided allotments issue through a Supplementary Order Paper to the Business Law Reform Bill, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel announced today.

“Problems have arisen with the interplay of the Securities Act 1978, the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 and in some circumstances, the exemption notices granted by the Securities Commission for overseas collective investment schemes. There are also procedural difficulties in obtaining Court relief under the Securities Act

“This has left overseas and domestic issuers without an effective avenue to seek relief. Under present law, a number of overseas collective investment schemes risk losing millions of dollars for what can be described as technical breaches of the exemption notices.

“Such overseas collective investment schemes may be reluctant to extend offers to the New Zealand market because of the perception that technical breaches lead to severe penalties, with no avenue for relief. The potential impacts on our financial markets is another reason why it is important that we resolve the issue.”

The Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) amends the Securities Act to enable the Courts to grant relief where it is just and equitable.

Speculation around this issue has suggested the government would consider retrospectively validating the breaches of the overseas issuers.

“We have not gone down this track. This SOP does not provide automatic legislative relief for overseas issuers who have breached the Commission’s exemption notices, but it does provide a mechanism that allows both issuers and subscribers to go to Court to seek relief. Although the recent problems have been highlighted with overseas issuers, this procedure is designed to address potential problems for domestic issuers as well.

“I believe this measure provides an appropriate balance between the interests of investors and issuers. It will allow the Court to consider prejudice to investors as well as the materiality of the breach in deciding relief orders,” Lianne Dalziel said.
