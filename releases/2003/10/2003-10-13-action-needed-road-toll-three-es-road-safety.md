The Transport Minister Paul Swain says the government will this week take the first step in a package of measures to improve road safety, built around the "three Es of road safety" -- Engineering, Education and Enforcement.

"We have to act to bring down the road toll. Currently it stands at almost 50 more deaths than at the same time last year, and about 20 higher than for the same time in 2001."

"Every death represents a terrible family tragedy, and it's time to act."

"This week I will make the first announcement, relating to the first E --Engineering."

"This will target accident blackspots on the country's roads."

"While New Zealand roads are generally good, they can be unforgiving. A moment's inattention by a driver may lead to a fatality, because of roadside hazards such as culverts, lamp-posts or trees, or a lack of a median barrier."

This week's announcement will address these problems.

Mr Swain says that in November, there will be announcements on the second E - Education.

"Most drivers don't give the road code a second thought once they gain their licence."

"We're looking at ways to offer drivers an incentive to voluntarily sharpen up their understanding of the road rules, to make themselves safer drivers and the road a safer place."

Mr Swain will be addressing the third E, Enforcement, in December.

"The government will consider a range of tougher measures, and our targets include repeat drink drivers and speed.

"The three Es package is crucial if we are to get serious about meeting our road safety goal of no more than 300 fatalities by 2010."
