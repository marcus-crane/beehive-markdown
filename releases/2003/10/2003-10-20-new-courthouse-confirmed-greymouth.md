A new courthouse will be built at Greymouth on the site of the current Supervalue Supermarket bordered by Herbert, Guiness and Tarapuhi streets,  
Courts Minister Rick Barker announced today.

“An agreement has been signed to purchase the property from Maybelle Properties Ltd and the new Courthouse is expected to be completed around mid 2005.

“Work on the site is expected to start around August next year, once a replacement supermarket is built elsewhere.”

Mr Barker said this would allow sufficient time to finalise plans and call tenders for construction so work on the new courthouse could commence as soon as the site was accessible.

The new facility will replace the existing Courthouse, built in 1908, which is now too small for its current demands and is long overdue for replacement.

“The new Courthouse will be 1500 sqm, more than double the size of the old building. It will also have two courtrooms, allowing other hearings to take place while a jury trial is sitting,” Mr Barker said.

The new Courthouse would also have improved security systems and separate waiting areas and entranceways.

“Finding a suitable site in Greymouth has not been easy and I’m delighted that we have been able to reach agreement for the new Courthouse. I’m sure it will serve the community’s needs for many years to come” Mr Barker said.

A feasibility study has already been completed on the new site.

The exact cost of the new courthouse is not yet known but the total investment is expected to be around $4 million.

“Under the Maori Reserved Land Act the property purchase agreement has to be approved by the Mawhera Incorporation within four weeks, which has the “first right of approval,” Mr Barker said.
