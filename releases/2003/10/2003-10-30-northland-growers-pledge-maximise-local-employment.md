Northland fruit growers have agreed to maximise seasonal employment of local people after meeting in Kerikeri with Associate Minister for Social Services and Employment Rick Barker to discuss continued labour difficulties.

Mr Barker said Tuesday’s meeting, attended by growers, orchard contractors, packhouse operators and Work and Income staff, provided an excellent opportunity for the positive airing of local seasonal work issues.

“The meeting followed several seasons of continued labour shortages in a region of high unemployment, an imbalance that I’m keen to see rectified.

“The assurance from growers that they will engage constructively with Work and Income to maximise seasonal employment opportunities for locals is certainly a good start.”

Mr Barker said the long-term seasonal labour solution for Northland growers was to employ as many locals as possible.

“Local people who are employed and treated fairly will come back year after year and develop useful industry skills.”

New Zealand Fruitgrowers Federation Northland Director Rick Curtis said that with the commitment of Work and Income staff and growers, it should be possible to maximise the employment of local people by finalising workforce demands ahead of the 2003-04 picking season.

Mr Curtis said that would allow growers to make alternative arrangements for legally employing overseas pickers to fill the demand above what the local labour market could supply.

“The partnership we are developing with Work and Income is the best hope we have of solving the bulk of our employment problems. It’s not an easy issue and it won’t be solved quickly but I’m happy with the recent progress.”
