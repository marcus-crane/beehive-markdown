The Electricity and Gas Industries Bill introduced to Parliament today will set the legal framework for the next phase in the development of New Zealand's electricity and gas industries, says Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

"The Bill puts in place all the decisions made by the Government this year on electricity supply security and the governance of the electricity and gas industries", Mr Hodgson said.

"The electricity and gas sectors are critical to New Zealand's economic growth. We face continuing challenges to ensure security of supply in both sectors at the best possible prices. These include the depletion of the Maui gas field, our vulnerability to dry hydro years and growth in demand for electricity. At the same time we aim to make continuing progress towards a sustainable energy future. This Bill is a key part of the Government's response to these challenges."

The Government's decisions on electricity supply security and the establishment of the [Electricity Commission](http://www.electricitycommission.govt.nz/index.html) were announced in May this year. A draft Government policy statement on electricity governance, revised in line with these decisions, was released for comment in September.

A Government policy statement on the development of New Zealand’s gas industry, released in March, sets out the Government’s expectations for better gas wholesale market arrangements and industry governance. The industry is working on plans for a new self-governance structure and the Bill contains backstop regulatory powers in case this work fails to deliver results.

"The Bill's regulatory powers in respect of the gas industry may be further refined as we work through the legislative process in parallel with the industry's efforts," Mr Hodgson said. "The Government and the Gas Industry Steering Group, led by the Rt Hon Jim Bolger, have an open and cooperative working relationship. I will be open to considering proposals that emerge from the industry as it works through the issues and clarifies its views.

"The Government's objectives for both electricity and gas are to have energy delivered to consumers in a safe, efficient, fair, reliable and environmentally sustainable way. This Bill will enable further changes to be made to the electricity and gas sectors to take us further towards that goal."

The Bill:

- updates the Electricity Act to reflect the establishment of the Electricity Commission;
- provides enhanced powers for ensuring security of electricity supply, including enabling the Electricity Commission to contract for reserve energy supplies;
- provides further electricity regulation-making powers relating to consumer protection, promotion of retail competition, improved information for market participants and development of distributed generation;
- amends the Commerce Act to clarify the interface between the functions and powers of the Commerce Commission and the Electricity Commission in relation to control of electricity lines companies;
- provides regulation-making powers for use if the gas industry does not deliver improvements on certain specified issues;
- enables the Electricity Commission to take on responsibility for gas industry governance if the gas industry's proposed self-governance arrangements do not deliver on the Government’s policy objectives, and for the Commission to be renamed the Energy Commission in that event;
- provides regulation-making powers under the Crown Minerals Act to require more extensive disclosure of information relating to gas and oil reserves.

The Bill is expected to be referred to the Commerce Committee for consideration.
