Rau rangatira maa,  
tenei te mihi ki a koutou i runga i te kaupapa o te ra.  
Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.

\[Distinguished guests, greetings to you gathered here for this purpose today. Greetings once, twice, three times to you all.]

Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to celebrate with you the official launch of these two great initiatives – Presbyterian Support Community First Health Services and the Assessment of Services Promoting Independence and Recovery in Elders (ASPIRE).

It would probably be more accurate to say this is the launch of the union of these two initiatives, since Community First has already been in operation since last October. In fact this is the third of a trio of launches that bring together the ASPIRE research project with a community initiative to promote “ageing in place”. More on that later.

Both of the projects we are celebrating today have come about from the sort of collaborative efforts that I am keen to see develop throughout (and at every level of) the health and disability sectors.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organisations – the Waikato District Health Board, Presbyterian Support and the University of Auckland – and all the individuals involved in the development of Community First and ASPIRE, for their dedication and commitment to seeing these initiatives get off the ground.

Community First  
Community First is partly about developing good links and cohesion between the various health and disability support services that an older person may need at any time.

It uses the “key worker” or “care management” model in coordinating a support package for older people in the community. It enables the older person to have a choice to remain in their own home, to be as independent as possible, and to enhance their lifestyle in their own community.

During the 12 months that Community First has been operating, 30 older people have chosen to remain in their own homes supported by this service.

It offers a genuine alternative to rest home care for people as their support needs increase. A number of people who would have previously received hospital level care have also been able to remain at home.

Client choice, needs in relation to the whanau, individual packaging of services based on client goals, and a strong focus on rehabilitation and habilitation form the key service concepts of Community First.

By focusing on the whole person (not just clinical needs), and the fundamental principle of supporting people to achieve what is important to them, Community First offers a truly client focused option.

These principles are vital to successfully supporting people to maximise their independence.

Independence is about supporting people to support themselves, so that they retain a sense of control and choice over what is happening in their lives. In fact, early on, there is a strong suggestion that by focusing on promoting a person’s independence, the person’s actual support needs may significantly decrease.

In the Community First model, people are able to identify the goals that are important to them. Services, which are individually tailored to the older person’s changing needs, then support them to achieve these goals, thus restoring hope and dignity.

Family, whanau and informal carers often play an important role in this process. By supporting carers in this way, families have experienced a significant decrease in the levels of stress and positive differences for the whole family.

Health of Older People Strategy  
The Community First model sits perfectly with the aims of the Health of Older People Strategy, which sets out the Government’s policy for the future direction of health and support services for older people.

As you know, the strategy identifies the need for significant change in the way health and support services are provided for older people.

Two of the key objectives are that:

“Older people, their famiies and whanau are able to make well-informed choices about options for healthy living, health care and disability support needs.” And that:

“Funding and delivery will promote timely access to quality integrated health and disability support services for older people, family, whanau and carers.”

In order to facilitate older people having their needs better met, with health and support services being integrated and continuous, without any gaps or overlaps, funding and planning for older people’s disability support services has been separated from that for younger people with disabilities.

As from the beginning of this month, funding for those aged 65 and over has been devolved to DHBs on the basis that each DHB has demonstrated a minimum level of capability in developing an integrated continuum of care appropriate to meet the needs of older people.

What this means is that DHBs are now responsible for funding both health and disability support services for older people. This includes home support and residential care services. DHBs in the future therefore need to understand both the needs of older people plus the cost-factors behind various service delivery options.

Some of you may remember the Assignment programme that screened on TV around the middle of last year, which presented an emphatic message that older people who need support, prefer to remain in their own homes or with their family, when given the choice.

This reinforces a national study carried out in the United States which shows the desire to remain at home for as long as possible increases markedly as people grow older.

In fact the desire for independence and wider choices of living arrangements are likely to be even stronger when the baby-boomers hit their 70s and 80s.

There is no clear evidence about whether or not packages of care in the community for older people who would otherwise need to be in residential care are in fact cheaper when all the cost factors are considered – although there is Canadian research that is very clear that home care is a more cost-effective option.

Mostly it is assumed that if older people can be kept well and supported safely in the community – even if frail – this may be a cost-effective option because of the reduced need for high cost accommodation facilities. This assumption must be tested so that DHBs can be given guidance for future funding of services.

“Cost-effective” is not, as people often assume, double-speak for “pay-less” and “cost-shift”. In the case of the Ageing In Place Initiatives, of which the Community First project is a part, this is certainly not the motivation.  
Early last year a British study* reported that there are five key areas older people are mainly concerned with beyond their medical care. These are:  
·food and nutrition;  
·personal care (such as bathing, dressing etc);  
·safety;  
·social participation and involvement; and  
·control over daily life.

Evaluating outcomes for older people in each of these areas will be part of the evaluation of all the ageing in place initiatives.  
The aim is of course to get the best possible support for older people from the dollars available, but there is absolutely no desire or intention to shift the cost of care on to the family and whanau and volunteer workforce.

The aim is to assist integration of services and to trial various alternative service delivery approaches, so that in the future older people will be able to “age in place”.

“Ageing in place” is defined in the Positive Ageing Strategy as having “choices in later life about where to live, and to receive support to do so”.

In the case of the Ageing in Place Initiatives, which will provide information to assist DHBs in implementing the Health of Older People Strategy, ageing in place stands for what the Canadians call the “long-term care substitution function of homecare”. It is where home care meets the needs of people who would otherwise require institutionalisation.

Research repeatedly highlights the significance of the older person’s home for promoting independence, maintaining social networks and quality of life and in allowing the person to remain integrated within the community.

ASPIRE  
Which brings me to the second of the duo of initiatives we are celebrating today – the Assessment of Services Promoting Independence and Recovery in Elders (ASPIRE).

ASPIRE, which has received $1 million in government funding, is a collaborative research project involving Auckland University, the Ministry of Health and district health boards in Canterbury, Hutt Valley and of course the Waikato.

This is the largest study to evaluate health services for older people that has been undertaken in New Zealand, and is one of the most significant in the world to evaluate alternatives to residential care for older people.

ASPIRE will evaluate the effectiveness of three ageing in place initiatives. The Community First model we are celebrating today, the COSE model in Canterbury, and the Masonic Promoting Independence model in the Hutt Valley.

All of these models have case or care management as a common feature, but vary in how support and rehabilitation services are delivered.

Among the question being explored through the evaluation are:  
1.What is the impact of the initiative on the older person’s independence, quality of life and social support systems?

2.What is the impact of the initiative on carer stress levels?

3.Is the initiative effective in terms of improving cost effectiveness to the client, family, funders and providers?

4.What are the factors that:  
a.Enable older people at risk of entering residential care to age in place? and  
b.Indicate whether residential care is an appropriate option for older people?

I am sure you all agree that all these questions are very important.

The data generated from this project will then inform the development of an evaluation toolkit that can be used by district health boards when evaluating future initiatives. The toolkit will provide a way to identify the factors behind successful outcomes, and to compare the outcomes of different interventions.

Conclusion  
Today we have come together to celebrate the start of this very exciting work. ASPIRE will give us clear evidence about what services and combinations of services produce good outcomes for older people and their families. This will enable us to be sure in the future that the health system is working to deliver what people actually need to have a good quality of life.

We are also celebrating the drive and creativeness of all the people who have developed Community First, but above all we celebrate that for older people this new alternative offers them the possibility of the support they want to stay in their own homes when that is what they desire.

I congratulate all involved, and it is now my great pleasure to declare Community First and ASPIRE officially launched.
