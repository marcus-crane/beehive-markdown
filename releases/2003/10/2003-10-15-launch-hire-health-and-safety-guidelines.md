ACC Minister Ruth Dyson  
Launch of On-hire employment industry health & safety guidelines  
Level 3, East Lounge, Westpac Stadium, Wellington  
4.30pm, 15 October 2003

As the Minister for ACC I applaud the industry’s efforts to significantly reduce serious injury in the workplace. The “Health and Safety Guidelines for the On-Hire Industry” is a significant foundation document for the industry and sets out the first step of many initiatives yet to come to reduce injuries for this important part of the New Zealand workforce.

The guidelines set out the accountabilities of the temporary employee, the agency and the client. They set out the agreed minimum acceptable standard for all parties in the employment arrangement and, for the first time in the history of the industry, the roles of each member are clearly defined and agreed to by all industry participants. That is momentous in itself.

This has been achieved through the forum’s great collaborative effort, bringing together representatives from the recruitment and consulting services, the unions and the government agencies – ACC & OSH – to work towards the common goal of reducing injury and illness in the workplace.

This collaborative approach is consistent with the Government’s new health & safety in employment legislation, which recognises that hazard management is most effective when it is jointly owned, and driven by those who have the most practical knowledge and experience of the workplaces involved.

It is my great pleasure to launch these guidelines. They will be a great asset to the industry.

I wish the On-Hire Employment Health & Safety Forum all the best with this initiative and with all its future endeavours to reduce the human trauma and industry costs associated with injuries.
