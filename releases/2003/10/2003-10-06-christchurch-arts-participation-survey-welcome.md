Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard has welcomed a Christchurch City Council study showing that Christchurch people place a high value on the arts.

“Looking after the cultural wellbeing of communities is one of the new purposes of local government under the Local Government Act 2002, and I’m delighted that Christchurch City Council is taking this purpose seriously,” said Judith Tizard.

“The Arts Scene in Christchurch: A Survey of Arts Participation was commissioned by the Council to provide a more accurate picture of arts activity in the city, to assist the Council with implementation of its Arts Policy and Strategy.

“The findings of the study show that Christchurch people are active participants in the arts, think public art works are a good idea, and support rates being used to support the provision of arts activities. These findings give Christchurch and other cities a good indication of the importance of arts activities in the community.

“I look forward to seeing how the Council will apply the findings in this study. The Christchurch City Council and community’s commitment to the arts is already highly visible in the impressive fundraising efforts for the city’s major museum and art gallery developments.”

Judith Tizard said strong regional arts activities were integral to the government’s vision of a well developed arts and cultural sector.

“The government supports regional arts and cultural development through programmes such as the Regional Museums Fund, which the Canterbury Museum has benefited from, and Creative New Zealand’s Creative Places and Creative Communities schemes.

“Arts activities impact positively on many areas including employment, economic, regional and community development and I’m delighted that we are seeing a strong and confident cultural identity emerging through the regions.

“Congratulations to Cantabrians on being such active arts-lovers!”
