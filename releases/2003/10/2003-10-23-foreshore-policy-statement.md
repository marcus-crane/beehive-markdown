Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia believes the announcement today by Michael Cullen outlining the government's timeframe for developing a legislative framework on the seabed and foreshore issue will be welcomed.

"The government is continuing to consult with whanau hapu and iwi and expects to make a policy announcement before Christmas," said Parekura Horomia.

"Of the more than 2-thousand submissions received, around 200 were tabled during the Maori consultation round at the 10 major hui throughout the country.

"I am keen to ensure the sentiments expressed during these hui will be reflected in the legislative framework which is not likely to be introduced until the House resumes after the summer break.

"The government also welcomes the opportunity to dialogue further with whanau hapu and Iwi during the select committee stage of the process, bearing in mind that these hearings will not necessarily be restricted to Wellington," said Parekura Horomia.
