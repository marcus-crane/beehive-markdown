High speed Internet access is about to move into four more regions as part of Project Probe, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton, Education Minister Trevor Mallard, and Information Technology Minister Paul Swain announced today.

Project Probe is a multi-million dollar government initiative, aimed at boosting education and economic development in regional New Zealand through the delivery of broadband technology.

The ministers today named ThePacific.net as preferred supplier for the delivery of broadband into the Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough region, Woosh Wireless as the preferred supplier in Canterbury, and Telecom as the preferred supplier in the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne/Hawkes Bay regions.

“Today’s announcement sees us on target to bring high speed internet access into every New Zealand region, opening up significant and exciting opportunities for businesses, schools and rural communities,” Jim Anderton said.

"This government is keen to break down the digital divide between metropolitan and rural communities by providing affordable and reliable broadband services. That’s why we are investing tens of millions of dollars into this project. It’s an important part of our strategy to grow a more innovative economy.”

“ICT is also a crucial tool in schools. A report out today, 'ICT in Schools', has found that ICT is making a difference to quality teaching and learning for students, with two thirds of school principals reporting that it is resulting in major improvements to the quality of curriculum delivery in schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

"Project Probe is a critical infrastructure investment to ensure students and families, businesspeople and employees will have the same opportunities in education and in economic development, regardless of where they live and work.

“Our government is keen to see broadband extended as far beyond schools as possible and funding assistance from businesses, regions, community trusts and local government is helping this process. Close liaison with regional groups is an important part of Probe.”

The rollout to the four regions will benefit about 300 schools, and about 29,000 students. Announcements about the Project Probe rollout to the four remaining regions - West Coast, Otago, Manawatu, and Auckland - will follow shortly, as will a decision on a satellite provider for difficult to reach schools and communities.

Communications and Information Technology Minister Paul Swain welcomed the announcement.

“Information and communication technology has been identified as an area of considerable growth potential by the government alongside biotechnology and the creative industries in the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework.”

These announcements follow on from the first announcement in July this year of the broadband rollout to the Waikato, Wellington and Taranaki regions, and the launch by Prime Minister Helen Clark on Friday (10 October), of the Southland Project Probe rollout.

Questions and Answers

What is Project Probe?  
Project Probe is a major government initiative. It stands for Provincial Broadband Extension and has been developed jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economic Development.

What are the benefits of having high speed internet access?  
Rural businesses will be able to tap into the same internet capability as businesses in the cities. Broadband is a major tool for businesses in terms of accessing information, opening up new markets, enabling access to world markets, and driving increased efficiency through e-commerce.

Broadband internet opens up huge opportunities for students and schools in remote and isolated country regions – opportunities that students in urban areas already have. Through broadband students in Wairoa will have access to the same information as students in Wellington or New York. Broadband-enabled two-way video conferencing can allow school subjects like advanced sciences and mathematics and te Reo to be taught to learners in very remote schools.

The extension of broadband coverage will also bring enhanced benefits to rural communities in the form of improved access to health and social services and to a range of other public services and information already on the internet.

How much is Project Probe costing?  
The tender process remains commercially sensitive and while it is still in progress no figures for the overall cost of the project will be released.

How does Project Probe work?  
Fourteen geographical regions have been established throughout New Zealand, with a 15th region to provide national satellite coverage for those schools where a terrestrial solution would be impractical.

The 14 regions are: Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawkes Bay/Gisborne, Taranaki, Manawatu/Wanganui, Wairarapa, Wellington/Kapiti/Horowhenua, Nelson/Tasman/Marlborough, West Coast, Canterbury (including Chatham Islands), Otago, and Southland.  
Telecom, in conjunction with BCL, is the preferred supplier for the Waikato, Taranaki and Wellington regions.

Three of the regions – Southland, Wairarapa and Northland, elected to proceed with independent tendering processes with the understanding that, provided government objectives for Project Probe were met, funding from the Probe project would be available to meet at least some of their costs. These three regions are working with Woosh Wireless, formerly WalkerWireless.

See www.probe.govt.nz for more information.

Regional information- preferred supplier details

Telecom in conjunction with BCL  
The selection of Telecom in the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne/Hawkes Bay regions builds on the company's earlier selection as preferred supplier in Wellington, Taranaki and the Waikato. These regions will each be entering into a joint partnering programme with Telecom to reach agreement over priorities and services.

The Bay of Plenty and Gisborne/Hawkes Bay are large, difficult to serve regions, particularly around the East Cape. Telecom’s combination of cabinet mounted mini-DSLAMs and the BCL BWA wireless provides an effective solution offering a high level of school and community coverage.

ThePacific.net  
ThePacific.net has been providing wireless solutions in the Nelson region for some time and has already proven its ability to provide high quality broadband services to a number of schools and business customers in the region.

Locally-based in Richmond, ThePacific.net is owned by Tasman Solutions and Westport-based lines company Buller Electricity Limited. These companies are fully committed to fund the rollout and company expansion required to extend the network to provide services to all the identified Probeschools and communities in the Nelson/Tasman/Marlborough region.

The choice of The.Pacific.net has the endorsement of the Nelson region through the Probe regional coordinators, led by the Marlborough Economic Development Trust that is contributing to the cost of the service rollout.

Woosh Wireless  
Woosh Wireless has already been selected as preferred supplier for the three regions undertaking their own tender selection process: Southland, with the initial services launched on 10 October 2003; Northland; and Wairarapa/Tararua. The Woosh Canterbury proposal uses the same broadband wireless technology from American company IP Wireless. Woosh Wireless was planning a commercial rollout in Christchurch and with the Probe subsidy this will now encompass a wider coverage area and provide service to all the identified Probe schools and communities in the region.

The choice of Woosh Wireless has the endorsement of the Canterbury region through the Probe regional co-ordinators, led by the Canterbury Development Corporation and the Mayoral Forum who will be contributing to the cost of the service rollout.

“We welcome the selection of The Pacific.Net as the preferred tenderer for Probe in the Tasman/Nelson/Marlborough region," says Peter Johnstone, Probe Regional Liaison Coordinator.

"Our region had a number of priorities in addition to the basic goal of broadband to all schools; these included affordable connection and data charges, local control, wide geographical coverage, and access to all community sectors. The Pacific.Net was the tenderer that came closest to meeting these requirements.

"The Pacific.Net will also provide customers in Tasman, Nelson and Marlborough with another choice of broadband supplier and broadband technology.
