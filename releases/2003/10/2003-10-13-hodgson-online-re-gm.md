Cabinet Minister Pete Hodgson will take part in an online chat session on [Labour's "Heads Up" website](http://www.headsup.co.nz/index.php) on Wednesday, 15 October from 7 – 8 pm.

Mr Hodgson will be taking questions about the expiry of the GM moratorium at the end of the month. He will also take questions on other matters in his major portfolios — energy, science, fisheries and climate change.

The chat follows other successful sessions on the same theme with Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and Health and Food Safety Minister Annette King.
