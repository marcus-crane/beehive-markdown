Foreign Minister Phil Goff is to represent the government at next Sunday's commemoration service in Bali for victims of last year's nightclub bombings.

The October 12 attack on Paddy's Bar and the Sari Club in the popular Kuta district of Bali killed 202 people, including three New Zealanders and 88 Australians. A number of New Zealanders were among the hundreds injured.

Many Balinese were killed or injured by the attack, which has also devastated the island’s important tourist industry.

Mr Goff will attend the formal commemoration service organised by Australia, and then host a lunchtime gathering of remembrance for New Zealand victims. The Balinese community has organised a flower ceremony in the early evening.

"With a large number of New Zealanders caught up in the bomb attacks, we were fortunate that there were not more casualties," Mr Goff said.

"For those directly involved, it was a traumatic event, both physically and psychologically. The commemoration services will hopefully help with their healing process.

"In recognition of the importance that many victims and relatives of victims place in being in Bali for the anniversary of the attack, the government is assisting around 75 New Zealanders to attend the commemorations.

"Other New Zealanders, who do not want to travel to Bali, are being assisted to attend a memorial service at St Pauls cathedral in Wellington.

"The services will be an opportunity to express our condolences to those who lost family in the attack; our support for those who were injured or who had to witness the suffering the attack caused, and our thanks for those who helped in the aftermath of the attack," Mr Goff said.
