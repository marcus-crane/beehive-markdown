The government is working with both the Greens and United Future to take into account the public submissions on the Land Transport Management Bill.

I am waiting for the bill to come back from the Select Committee – of which Mr Sowry is a member – and it is under wraps till then.

I note that Mr Sowry is enthusiastic about doing something about transport now, when between 1990 and 1999 he didn't do a thing.
