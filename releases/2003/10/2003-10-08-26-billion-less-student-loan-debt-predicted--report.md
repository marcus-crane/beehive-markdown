The latest Student Loan Scheme Annual Report, tabled in Parliament today, shows a $2.6 billion fall in debt forecasts, largely as a result of government policies.

The Ministry of Education now estimates that the overall gross student loan debt by June 2020 will be $14.4 billion. This compares with an estimate of $17.0 billion last year. The decreased loan forecasts are credited to policy changes introduced in the 2002 and 2003 budgets, especially the new fee and course costs maxima. Student debt forecasts were estimated at $19 billion in 2000, but, while they have reduced since that year, previous reductions have been primarily due to data improvements.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey welcomed the findings, saying they are concrete sign of the government’s ongoing moves to make tertiary education more affordable for students.

“As a result of moves to cut the costs to students of tertiary education, like the introduction of no-interest-while-studying, three years of fee freezes and the new fee and course costs maxima system, total student debt is now expected to rise more slowly.

“We can also see changes emerging in the profile of the scheme, now over a decade old, as it starts to mature. The amount repaid since the scheme began – more than $1.9 billion - is around a quarter of all the debt that has been incurred, with more than 120,000 New Zealanders having now fully repaid their student loans. Nearly $400 million was repaid in 2002/03.

“There is no room for complacency, however. The Labour-Progressive government is committed to further improvement to the student support system that will continue to reduce projected debt, in particular by widening eligibility for student allowances,” Steve Maharey said.

The report contains the audited financial statements for the year to 30 June 2003, as well as a range of other information. It includes data from Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Education, and Inland Revenue records in line with the Auditor-General’s recommendations in 2000 to improve the information available about the student loan scheme.

This year’s report also includes some early results from the integrated data-set developed by Statistics New Zealand as well as the first actuarial valuation of the scheme.
