Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is thrilled at the new additions to the [Maori Language Commission](http://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/).

Mr Horomia believes Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, Wayne Ngata, Hana O'Regan and Ruakere Hond will bring fresh ideas to the Commission, which will once again be chaired by Dr Patu Hohepa.

"All of the new commissioners have shown a keen interest in developing te reo Maori in their respective fields and their collective skills are welcomed," said Parekura Horomia.

On 14 September 1972, a Mâori language petition (containing 30,000 signatures) was presented to Parliament, asking for Te Reo Maori to be taught in schools.

Parekura Horomia says te reo Maori has come along way since then and it is great to have commissioners of this calibre who have battled away over the years to ensure the survival of the language.

"Their work has built on the base that has been created to secure the future of te reo Maori," he said.
