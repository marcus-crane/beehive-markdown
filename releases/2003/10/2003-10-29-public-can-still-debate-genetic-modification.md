With the moratorium on applications for the general release of genetically modified organisms expiring tonight, the debate will now shift to specific applications before the Environmental Risk Management Authority, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

"We have established a system that allows people to have their say on these applications, and I encourage those wishing to do so to use the system," Marian Hobbs said.

"The Green Party and others have said they will oppose every application. I say they should make their case as applications arise, so that ERMA can make a decision with all the facts on the table.

"As ERMA makes its decisions in an open and transparent manner, I believe New Zealanders will come to trust the process and gain a greater understanding of the types of issues it has to consider.

"Over the past few months we have seen a lot of emotive and sometimes misleading debate based on hypothetical propositions. Now we can move on to real applications, real science and real life situations.

"I look forward to ERMA considering all the information.

"We will now be able to move away from blatant and misleading politicking to focus on the facts surrounding applications."
