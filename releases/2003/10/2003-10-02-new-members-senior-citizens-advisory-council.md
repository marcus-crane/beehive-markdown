Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today announced the members of the re-established Advisory Council for Senior Citizens. They are Edith Ieremia, Christchurch; Marlene Mulholland, Wellington; George Potae, Coromandel Peninsula; and Jim Ross, Waikanae.

Edith Ieremia works in community health in Canterbury providing support for Pacific Island people. She has worked extensively in the Pacific Island community and has developed networks with health professionals and mainstream organisations. Ms Ieremia has also worked as a Volunteer Community Co-ordinator with the Office for Senior Citizens.

Marlene Mulholland has worked as a community-based general and psychiatric nurse, where she introduced innovative measures to develop support networks to assist people to remain in their own homes.

George Potae has worked for many years on a variety of Mâori business ventures, and has been involved in local body affairs as well as supporting the development of the Positive Ageing Strategy.

Jim Ross has a background in education, retiring as Assistant Director General of Education. Since retirement, he has had an extensive involvement in organisations representing the interests of older people, both at local and national levels.

Ruth Dyson said she looked forward to working with the council.

“The members have been chosen because of their experience and involvement in senior citizens issues. I am confident they will continue the tradition established by previous council members, of providing informed and timely advice on a range of issues affecting older people.”

The council was set up in 1992 to provide advice to the Minister for Senior Citizens on issues affecting older people. The re-established council will hold its first meeting in October. Up to two people may be co-opted to provide expert advice on particular issues.
