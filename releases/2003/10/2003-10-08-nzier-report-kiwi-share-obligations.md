The Communications Minister Paul Swain is welcoming the release of an NZIER report on the economic impact of the Kiwi Share Obligations (KSO) for local residential telephone service.

The report, commissioned by Vodafone New Zealand, considers the case for retaining the KSO.

“While the government has no plans to make any changes to the Kiwi Share, the report is a useful contribution to the debate about how we should approach universal service obligations, at a time of rapid technological change and industry development” says Mr Swain.

Mr Swain has asked his officials to consider the report as part of their work on assessing the merits of introducing contestability to the provision of KSO service in commercially non-viable areas.

Contestability would potentially give the opportunity for other service providers besides Telecom to provide KSO service in commercially non-viable areas.

Under the KSO framework around 4% of total residential telephone customers are classed as commercially non-viable, and are subsidised through a TSO levy on telecommunications service providers.

"This report is a useful contribution, but I want to emphasise that there are no plans to change the Kiwi share obligation in New Zealand."
