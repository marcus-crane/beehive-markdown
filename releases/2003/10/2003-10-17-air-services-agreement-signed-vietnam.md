The Prime Minister Helen Clark has witnessed the signing in Ha Noi of the first Air Services Agreement between New Zealand and Viet Nam.

The Agreement was signed for New Zealand by its Ambassador Malcolm McGoun and for Viet Nam by the Vice-Minister of Transportation, Mr Nguyen Tien Sam.

"It is timely that the signing took place on the eve of the APEC Leader's Meeting in Bangkok," says the Transport Minister Paul Swain.

"Our agreement with Viet Nam means New Zealand now has air services arrangements in place with all but one of its APEC partners, the sole exception being the Philippines."

"Viet Nam is a country of almost 80 million people and is enjoying strong economic growth. Opportunities exist for further enhancing trade, tourism and investment links between New Zealand and Viet Nam, and it was with this in mind that the Air Services Agreement was negotiated", says Mr Swain.

New Zealand airlines now have the opportunity to commence services to Viet Nam on a code-share basis.

There are no limits on the number of services that may be operated where the code-sharing involves New Zealand and Vietnamese airlines.

A significant feature of this Agreement is the basis for acceptance of airlines nominated by the other country to provide services. This is referred to as "designation".

Usually the rules are more restrictive and a country can refuse to accept the designation of an airline that is not "substantially owned and effectively controlled" in its home country.

The Air Services Agreement with Viet Nam is the first New Zealand agreement that allows for such designation.

The new criteria were agreed, in March this year, by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), at its Worldwide Air Transport Conference.

New Zealand now has air services arrangements in place with 47 bilateral or multilateral partners.
