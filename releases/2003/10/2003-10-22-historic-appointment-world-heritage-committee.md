Mâori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia believes the World Heritage Committee will benefit greatly now that Ngati Tuwharetoa paramount chief Tumu Te Heuheu has been appointed as New Zealand's representative.

The [World Heritage Committee](http://whc.unesco.org/nwhc/pages/home/pages/homepage.htm) is the global watchdog for cultural and natural heritage and aims to protect the world most outstanding and precious monuments and heritage sites.

"Tumu recognises the magnitude of protecting sites of real importance especially within an indigenous paradigm," said Parekura Horomia.

In 1887 Tumu's ancestor Te Heuheu Tukino IV (Horonuku) gifted the peaks of Ngaruhoe, Tongariro and Ruapehu to New Zealand to protect them and the surrounding area from subdivision and sale. This was subsequently legislated for in 1894 and gazetted as such in 1907.

"Given this historic significance I believe Tumu will represent New Zealand with distinction," said Parekura Horomia.

The Committee has many duties, among them; assessing applications for sites to be added to the World Heritage List, monitoring sites to ensure they are properly managed and it also allocates funding to restore and repair recognised sites.
