A new [website to celebrate Children’s Day](http://www.childrensday.org.nz/) focuses on the importance of listening and talking to children, and encourages them to have their say.

Launching the website in the Beehive today, Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson said children needed to be nurtured by everyone.

“Listening and talking to our children costs nothing but time. It makes children feel valued and respected, and teaches them about the world we live in.”

Children’s Day is on Sunday, 26 October. The website has information about special events around the country, and suggestions for celebrations at home and school.

This year’s mascot is the Pekapeka, the indigenous bat. The website has a number of ‘bativities’ within a ‘bat cave’ – including sending e-cards, creating comic strips, colouring in, and listening to recordings of well-known New Zealanders talking about their childhoods.

Children are encouraged to send in their comments, which currently include:

- “The reason why we have this day is because children need to be loved at all times and because we are a big part of our nation’s future.” (May, 12);
- “To let children know they are special and to have some fun!” (Siobhon, 7);
- "Children’s Day is a day that parents can get to know their children better.” (Ben, 9)

Ruth Dyson said the site gave children an opportunity to learn about safety in cyberspace, and she was delighted that it had the support of Internet Safety Group director Liz Butterfield.

Ms Dyson congratulated the government and non-government agencies involved in setting up the website, led by [Child, Youth and Family](http://www.cyf.govt.nz). She also commended DNA Design and BearingPoint for sponsoring the site design and development.

Ruth Dyson will launch the Children’s Day website, with a group of children, in the Beehive, 4.1 at 1.00pm, Wednesday, 1 October.
