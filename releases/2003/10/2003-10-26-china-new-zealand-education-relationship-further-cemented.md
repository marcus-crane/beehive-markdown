New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and Chinese President Hu Jintao today witnessed the signing of an Arrangement on Mutual Recognition of Academic Degrees in Higher Education between the Chinese and New Zealand Ministries of Education.

"This mutual recognition of academic degrees at tertiary level further cements the strong academic ties we have with China," Associate Education Minister Tertiary Education Steve Maharey said.

“This arrangement confirms both China and New Zealand are firmly committed to our joint education relationship, and wish to see this relationship deepened and enriched."

Steve Maharey said the Arrangement sits under the framework for education co-operation created by a 2002 Memorandum of Understanding between the Chinese and New Zealand Ministries of Education.

"The purpose of this Arrangement is to facilitate the mutual recognition of degrees awarded to students by higher education institutions in New Zealand and China, and to make it easier for students with qualifications from one country to pursue further academic studies in the other.

“The Arrangement will encourage New Zealand students and scholars to spend time in China, and vice versa. To support this, co-operation between tertiary education organisations in relation to the transfer of academic credits will occur," Steve Maharey said.

Ministry of Education representatives worked with the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to develop this Arrangement.

Acting Secretary for Education Barbara Disley and the Chinese Ambassador Chen Mingming signed the Mutual Recognition Arrangement in Auckland.
