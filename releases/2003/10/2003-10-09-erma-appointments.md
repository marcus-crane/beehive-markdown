Environment Minister Marian Hobbs has announced two appointments to the Environmental Risk Management Authority, the decision-making body regulating hazardous substances and new organisms, including GM.

Marie Dziadek, an Associate Professor at Auckland University's School of Biological Sciences, replaces Mrs Jane Lancaster, whose term expired. Professor George Clark, from Auckland University's Chemistry Department, has been reappointed. Both appointments are for two years.

Marian Hobbs said the recent review of ERMA and decision-making challenges offered by genetic modification were significant factors in considering the make-up of the Authority.

"Among the areas of expertise the review identified as needing strengthening were molecular biology, gene technology and biotechnology," Marian Hobbs said.

"Marie Dziadek has specific expertise and experience in molecular biology, gene technology and decisionmaking. She is well versed in technologies relating to GM organisms. Professor Dziadek has also been involved in animal ethics committee work.

"The re-appointment of Professor Clark will provide continuity on the authority and maintain its level of expertise in hazardous substances. Professor Clark provides particular depth of knowledge about chemistry and the management of hazardous substances."
