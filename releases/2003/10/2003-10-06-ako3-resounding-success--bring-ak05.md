Auckland Issues and Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today congratulated all involved in the new Auckland Festival on the successful completion of AK03.

“It’s been a fantastic 16 days and I am delighted with the response of Aucklanders and out-of-towners I have talked to who all enjoyed what was on offer at this first Auckland Festival of the 21st Century,” said Judith Tizard.

“In particular I want to congratulate Festival Director Simon Prast on his passion, vision and determination.

“Auckland City as the festival’s core funder also deserves hearty thanks and congratulations, as do the councillors who have supported the festival from its inception.

“Looking after the cultural wellbeing of communities is one of the purposes of local government under the Local Government Act, and I’m pleased Auckland City and other councils in the Auckland region have recognised this through their support of AK03. Their investment will see cultural, economic and social returns that I expect will continue well into the future.”

Events that Judith Tizard attended included the unveiling of Art on the Buses, the NZSO and APO concert Twin Peaks and the NZSO’s Off to Japan performance, the Auckland Chamber Orchestra’s The End of Time concert, Vagabond Tales, Deb Filler’s Filler Up, The Songmaker’s Chair, New Gold Dream, and the closing session of the Aotearoa Playwrights’ Conference.

“The festival provided something for everyone and carried a distinctly ‘Auckland’ feel. It also offered a showcase for many of Auckland’s venues, including the refurbished Wintergarden beneath The Civic, which was home to the AK03 Heineken Festival Club.

“The breadth and depth of AK03, which was pulled together so rapidly by Simon Prast and his team, has provided a great template to build future festivals on. Bring on AK05!”
