The coalition government has agreed to support all the initiatives recommended by the Design Taskforce with an allocation of $12.5 million over four years, Economic Development Minister, Jim Anderton, said today.

Speaking at the Young Designer Awards in Christchurch this evening, Jim Anderton said the apparel industry had shown New Zealand how the application of design could transform a sector from producing commodities to producing high value world leading goods.

"Labels like World and Nom D, design led companies like Fisher and Paykel and Formway show us how good design can be applied to all aspects of the economy. We want to see more of that," Mr Anderton said.

The investment will be used to implement the strategy set out in the Design Taskforce report, Success by Design, released in May this year. Key initiatives include the establishment of a design conference and resource directory, mentoring programmes as well as enhancements to design education. There will also be practical programmes to be delivered through New Zealand Trade and Enterprise including design audits and financial assistance for an initial design project.

The Design Taskforce, convened by Jim Anderton and chaired by Ray Labone of Designworks, consisted of thirteen leaders from the design industry including business leaders and academics. Rather than develop a strategy for growing the design industry itself, the taskforce identified design as a key input into innovation and helping to create sustainable competitive advantage for New Zealand firms.

It has set an objective summarised as 5 x 50 x 500 x 5: in the first 5 years, at least 50 existing businesses made internationally competitive through design leadership, generating an additional $500m per year in export earnings, growing at 5 times the targeted Gross Domestic Product growth rate to produce $1.5 billion by Year Ten.
