New Zealand and the People's Republic of China are renewing an agreement to increase their cooperation in science and technology.

The agreement, which renews one signed in 1987, lists priority areas for cooperation between the two nations and provides some clear guidelines for the disposition of intellectual property rights arising from research.

The priority areas include animal husbandry, environmental and ecological protection and restoration, forestry and the preservation of natural resources, information technology, biotechnology, geophysics, Antarctic and health research.

"Strengthening science and technology links between New Zealand and China will promote R&D co-investment, more effective innovation and enhanced capabilities within our research and innovation communities," said Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson.

"This agreement emphasises our commitment to science and technology partnerships with China. It facilitates the organisation of funding for joint collaborative projects, provides clearer guidelines for researchers envisaging cooperative activities and highlights the importance of science and technology to the relationship between our two nations."

The agreement is being signed today at AgResearch Ruakura, with President Hu of the People's Republic of China and New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark present during the ceremony.
