Minister of Consumer Affairs Judith Tizard advised today that the Motor Vehicle Sales Act is likely to come into effect on Monday 15 December 2003.

“In April I announced that this legislation would come into effect by the end of the year. I am mindful that people in the business of trading in motor vehicles have been waiting for the announcement of this date,” said Judith Tizard.

“It’s important that motor vehicle traders have enough time to plan for this change in law, which affects the way they do business. The law introduces a new registration regime for people involved in the business of motor vehicle trading.”

Traders also have a key role in ensuring that this important piece of consumer legislation, which protects and promotes the interests of consumers when buying a motor vehicle, is successfully implemented.

Starting next week the Ministries of Economic Development and Consumer Affairs will be providing training seminars throughout the country to ensure that motor vehicle traders are prepared for this new law.
