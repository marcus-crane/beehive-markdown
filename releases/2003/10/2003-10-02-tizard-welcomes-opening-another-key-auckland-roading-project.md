The opening of the Wellesley Street Bridge is another sign for Aucklanders that the region’s transport needs are being seen to under the leadership and partnership of the Labour-Progressive Government, says Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“Because Auckland’s transport needs were ignored for so long by successive governments, it’s understandable when I hear from Aucklanders who are sitting idling in congested traffic in their vehicles or on buses, surrounded by road-works, wanting to know what is happening in Auckland transport,” said Judith Tizard at the official opening of the Wellesley Street Bridge today.

“It’s great for Aucklanders to be able to see some physical evidence of the major progress that is underway across the region.

“For example, the Grafton Gully Project is already 85% completed. The Wellesley Street Bridge, which opens to the public on Monday, is a significant part of that project.

“Other major projects underway in Auckland include improvements to the Central Motorway Junction, the stretch of motorway from the Harbour Bridge to City, the North Shore Busway, the Upper Harbour Motorway and SH20 linking Auckland’s Southern and Southwestern motorways.

“These projects are well underway as a result of this government putting Central Government resources firmly alongside Auckland’s resources. We have got Transit and Transfund working alongside the Auckland Regional Council and local authorities to get Auckland moving.

“This partnership would not have happened without Helen Clark’s commitment to Auckland in 1999 to provide the region with the infrastructure it needs to be the economic hub of New Zealand.

“We need Auckland to be a strong, confident and sustainable contributor to New Zealand’s economic, social, environmental and cultural growth. Good infrastructure is a vital component in that growth and the completion of each transport project takes us all another huge step forward.”
