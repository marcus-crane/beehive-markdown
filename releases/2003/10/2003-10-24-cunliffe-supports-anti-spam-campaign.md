The Associate Minister for Information Technology David Cunliffe says he wants strong industry/government co-operation to beat the spam sham.

"I commend InternetNZ for taking positive steps to combat spam and fully support their anti-spam campaign", the Minister said.

"Beating spam is a high priority for the government, and as well as supporting actions such as this, officials are actively investigating best-practice legislative options", the Minister said.

"Together we can send a message to spammers that their trade is not acceptable and we will take action to stop them".

"I am keen to continue the strong working relationship we have with the Internet industry on the anti-spam campaign", the Minister said.

"I will be working with InternetNZ to see what assistance can be provided for their anti-spam education initiatives and will explore the option of holding a joint government and InternetNZ workshop on the issue of spam legislation early next year".

The Minister also recognised the efforts of ISP's. "I am pleased to see that nearly all New Zealand ISP's have now implemented anti-spam filtering tools", the Minister said.

"At a time when around half of all emails are now spam, we are giving this matter a high priority," the Minister said.

"Some web analysts are predicting that 60-70% of all email by mid 2004 will be spam".
