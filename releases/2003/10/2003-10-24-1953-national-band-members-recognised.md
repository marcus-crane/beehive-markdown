Members of the 1953 National Band of New Zealand will be given government certificates of appreciation at their 50th anniversary reunion in Blenheim tomorrow (Saturday 25 October 2003).

Government Ministers Lianne Dalziel and Judith Tizard are presenting the unique certificates to the 22 surviving members of the band, and to the family of 19 band members who have passed away.

The band toured the United Kingdom from May to September in 1953. The band, although not part of the official Coronation procession, did participate in several Coronation related activities.

“This has never been formally recognised, nor was their remarkable achievement, which was to win the 101st British Open Brass Band Championship on 5 September 1953,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“I believe it is important to recognise achievement, and I was quite surprised to learn that the achievements of the 1953 National Band of New Zealand had never been formally recognised,” she said.

Lianne Dalziel and Judith Tizard said they were honoured to be able to make these presentations on such an important anniversary.

The certificates, which bear the New Zealand Coat of Arms, have been signed by Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright and Prime Minister Helen Clark.
