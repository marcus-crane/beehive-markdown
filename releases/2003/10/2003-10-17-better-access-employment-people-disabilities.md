The government is promising improved support to ensure people with disabilities successfully make the transition from school to work.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey spoke at a Wanganui community transition forum attended by young people with disabilities, their families, and providers of transition and supported employment services.

Steve Maharey reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to provide employment opportunities for young people with disabilities.

“We want all young people with disabilities to have access to employment, and to the right to seek employment. For many of this country’s young people the passage from school to work is taken for granted, but unfortunately that is not the experience for many students with disabilities.

“Young people with disabilities need to know that the Sickness or Invalid’s Benefit is not their only option after they leave school.

“Several initiatives in the recent Jobs Jolt package will assist sickness and invalids beneficiaries who are able to work. This includes more active support by Work and Income case managers and the expansion of Job Clubs, including here in Wanganui.

“Successful transition support relies heavily on partnerships with parents, whanau, and support agencies. The thrust of the government’s efforts is to see employment not as a privilege but as part of an ordinary life—for all New Zealanders,” Steve Maharey said.
