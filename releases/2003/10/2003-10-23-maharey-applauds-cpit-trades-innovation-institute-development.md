Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve is applauding Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology’s new Trades Innovation Institute, which is being launched this evening.

The Trades Innovation Institute will see the consolidation of CPIT’s trades education at its Sullivan Avenue campus, which is to be upgraded and significantly expanded.

A key feature of the development of the Institute is the formation of a new Advisory Board drawn from local industry that will ensure its qualifications remain relevant and keep up with industry trends. The Board is to carry real weight and oversight to the directions and offerings of the Institute.

Steve Maharey visited the Trades Innovation Institute last week and said its development is a very important move for the Canterbury, and wider South Island, economy.

“Improving the quality and availability of trades education is absolutely essential if we are to achieve the vision of returning New Zealand to top half of the OECD.

“The knowledge society is built as much in the factories and design shops of New Zealand, as it is in university classrooms. CPIT’s Trades Innovation Institute sits alongside many of the initiatives the government has developed to profile the importance of trades education.

“We’ve developed programmes like Modern Apprenticeships and Gateway because we know that young people entering trades education have a very bright and lucrative career ahead of them – and that for our economy to prosper, we simply must encourage more young people to take the trades option.

“The development of the Institute follows several years when the viability of trades education was regularly questioned by tertiary institutions. The significant development CPIT is committing itself here clearly demonstrates those concerns are now history.

“I congratulate CPIT as it launches the Trades Innovation Institute and wish it every success for the future,” Steve Maharey said.
