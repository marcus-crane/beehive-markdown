Minister of Defence Mark Burton today released a discussion document for public consultation, which is seeking the views of the local community, central and local government agencies, industry, and iwi/maori groups on the site’s future use.

The consultation process, which is likely to comprise two rounds of public submissions, is expected to continue until February 2004.

Mark Burton said that the discussion document was an integral step in deciding Whenuapai’s future.

“Decisions on the future of the Whenuapai land must be made through appropriate and thorough consultation with all interested parties. Through this public consultation process, all groups with an interest in the future use of Whenuapai will be able to have their submissions fully and fairly considered by the Government.

“This document will form the basis for any interested groups or individuals to prepare their submissions, providing crucial information about the site, regional activity, and plans for the area.

“It also describes the four broad options that were established earlier this month by a multi-agency working group, the processes in place for disposal of the land, and the criteria against which proposed future options might be addressed.”

The consultation process will include a series of public meetings, to be held from the week beginning 10 November 2003.

The discussion document is available online at:
