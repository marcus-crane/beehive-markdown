The new Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Amendment Act balances personal rights and law enforcement, Police Minister George Hawkins says.

The Act, which passed through Parliament yesterday, overhauls DNA profiling legislation to enhance police ability to catch criminals and resolve burglaries. It represented a comprehensive rework of the 1995 Criminal Investigations (Blood Samples) Act.

Mr Hawkins said the range of offences for which suspects or convicted persons may be liable to provide a DNA sample had been extended to cover crimes punishable by at least seven years' jail, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such crimes.

Mr Hawkins said burglary was a serious crime that often predated violence and sexual offending. "The Act is of particular value in this area because for the first time police can obtain samples from burglary suspects,” he said.

“Previously police could not compel anyone whose DNA profile matched a sample taken at a burglary to give a fresh sample.”

An increased police budget and more police meant burglary resolutions were at the lowest rate for many years, and the new legislation was likely to improve the situation further.

The Act also introduced:  
·compulsory testing for databank purposes of offenders currently in jail and convicted prior to the introduction of DNA testing

·recognition that less expensive, less invasive mouth (buccal) DNA samples were of the same quality as blood samples

·the ability of police to request, with parental consent, that a child suspected of a range of serious offences provide a buccal sample

·removal of the requirement that police obtain court permission to take a sample from a convicted person. People retained the right to request a judicial hearing if they believed they are not liable to provide the sample, Mr Hawkins said.
