A bill to repeal the Architects Act 1963 and to introduce a modern regulatory framework for architects was tabled in Parliament today, by Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel.

“The recently introduced Building Bill aims to ensure that buildings are designed and built right first time and reinforces the importance of each element of the building process from design to inspection.

“The Architects Bill is a companion measure and is an important component of the wider look we are taking at how the building industry is regulated,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“This Bill makes a number of changes to improve standards for architects and it meets the desire of architects to modernise their legislation.”

The key features of the Bill include:

- Continuation of statutory protection of the title of architect;
- The establishment of a public register that includes details of disciplinary action taken against an architect to provide better information to consumers;
- The introduction of ongoing competency testing for architects, and;
- Modernised governance and administration processes and procedures to bring the legislation in line with current practice in occupational regulation.

“We have worked closely with the Architects Education and Registration Board and the New Zealand Institute of Architects in the development of the proposals. I believe that this Bill represents a balanced path for the regulation of architects that both industry and consumers have been seeking,” Lianne Dalziel said.
