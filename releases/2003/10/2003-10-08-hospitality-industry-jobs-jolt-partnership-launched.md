A partnership agreement signed between the Hospitality Association of New Zealand and Work and Income aims to get 200 people into work in the hospitality industry within the next year.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey launched the first formal partnership agreement as part of the government’s Jobs Jolt ‘Job Partnerships with Industry’ initiative this evening.

“The Jobs Jolt package of initiatives will help people get off benefits and into employment, and address the shortage of skilled labour. Ensuring more New Zealanders gain the security of a well-paying job is the best way to opportunities are shared equally across our society. The partnership agreement now signed with the hospitality industry will target its particular workforce needs.

“The hospitality industry will play a lead role by helping Work and Income design and deliver programmes to ensure job seekers meet industry indentified skill needs. Hospitality is an excellent choice for our first formal industry partnership agreement as it provides a huge range of employment opportunities for New Zealanders. The industry is a key factor in our economic growth and provides real career opportunities for people, particularly young people.

“The aim of the Jobs Jolt ‘Job Partnerships with Industry’ initiative is to help thousands of people into work over the next three years. Work and Income are currently developing similar partnerships to the hospitality agreement with the retail, road transport, tourism, and trades industries,” Steve Maharey said.

Hospitality Association of New Zealand Chief Executive Bruce Robertson said he believes Job Partnerships with Industry will work because industry is driving the training and work placement component of the initiative.

“The underpinning factor is that this initiative will assist in addressing industry identified skill and labour shortages.

“By entering into a partnership with Work and Income and introducing programmes specific to industry needs we can achieve objectives for everybody,” Bruce Robertson said.
