The mayors and chair of all eight of Auckland's councils will meet with at least eight government ministers and the Prime Minister tomorrow to discuss key issues affecting New Zealand's most populated region.

Chaired and organised by Local Government Minister Chris Carter, the forum will explore Auckland's transport issues, the development of sustainable cities, crime, drugs, the Gambling Act, and the Local Government Act.

"This is the first official forum of ministers and Auckland local authorities in Wellington and it is evidence of the Labour-Progressive Government's on-going effort to take a strategic approach to the economic and social development of Auckland," Mr Carter said.

"The forum is a great opportunity for central and local government to assess what we have achieved so far, and what more needs to be done," Mr Carter said.

Judith Tizard said it was crucial to put the resources and knowledge of government alongside the resources and knowledge of Auckland to deliver a better economy, better infrastructure and services, more jobs, healthy and affordable housing and a better environment.

"I look forward to the discussions that are going to take place tomorrow. Helen Clark made a promise in 1999 that this government would take Auckland's issues seriously and the forum is further evidence that we are making good on that promise."
