The New Zealand Customs Service’s Annual Report for 2002/03 showed that the organisation was facing a time of significant change in a riskier international environment, Customs Minister Rick Barker said today.

“Customs does an exemplary job at the border of protecting and enhancing the interests of New Zealand and its people.

“However increased international attention of terrorist activity and transnational crime plus growing tourist and trade arrivals means Customs must find new ways to better protect our borders.”

Mr Barker said Customs was increasing staffing levels by up to 160 and was investing between $15 and $25 million (subject to commercial tender) in x-ray technology in direct response to the changing environment the service was operating in.

The annual report showed that in the 2002/03 financial year Customs cleared 6.994 million arriving and departing air travellers, close to the previous year when 7.013 million passengers were cleared.

The report noted that this stability in the face of international factors such as SARS and terrorism indicated that overseas tourists regarded New Zealand as a safe destination.

In the 2002/03 financial year, Customs reported that 93.6 percent of arriving passengers exited border control within 45 minutes. The service also cleared 51.7 million import transactions, including goods imported through the mail, and 486,992 export transactions.

Mr Barker said Customs’ success in intercepting increasingly large volumes of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals has been widely reported. Additional drug investigators have been appointed, but Customs will continue to closely monitor this area.

“New Zealand cannot be complacent about its security. We are part of the international community and face the same risks. Customs plays a key role in ensuring that New Zealand is clean, green and safe.”
