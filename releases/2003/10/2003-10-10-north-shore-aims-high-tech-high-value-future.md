Congratulations are in order for North Shore City and Enterprise North Shore today as it plans to become one on New Zealand's leading centres for the information, communication and technology (ICT) sector, said Jim Anderton, Minister of Economic, Regional and Industry Development who is visiting the North Shore today.

“North Shore City has the potential to be one of New Zealand’s major centres for information, communication and technology (ICT) businesses. New Zealand's future growth and prosperity will be boosted by investing in industries based on knowledge and ideas, like the ICT industry.

"High value, high skills businesses, such as those in the ICT sector, play a key role in our economic development so it is good news that North Shore City aims to boost their ICT industry. Spin offs from ICT benefit all industries in the long run.

"Enterprise North Shore has adopted the government's ICT framework with the ambition to grow between 20 to 25 North Shore businesses to achieve $100 million turnover, within ten years," said Jim Anderton.

Enterprise North Shore and Massey University’s e-centre is setting up a forum to encourage growth of North Shore-based ICT businesses. They will be working with North Shore City Council, local developer Smales Farm, and a broad cross section of North Shore ICT businesses. Their overall focus is on high skill, export industries.

North Shore have also started a niche manufacturing cluster, primarily working with tool making manufacturers, including RPM International Tool and Die Makers, whom Mr Anderton will visit today.

Jim Anderton will also meet with Enterprise North Shore and their Chief Executive, Terry Hoskins, to discuss the ICT and manufacturing initiatives during his visit to the North Shore today.

Background

About North Shore City

The number of North Shore residents employed in the ICT sector is steadily growing. With TelstraClear and EDS now both resident at the Smales Farm site in Takapuna, the contribution of the ICT industry to the North Shore economy is already significant.

North Shore’s communication sector grew 275% between 1994 and 2002, which was more than ten times the national rate of growth. At March 2002, the City held 11% of national communication jobs despite the City’s workforce accounting for only 5% of national jobs.
