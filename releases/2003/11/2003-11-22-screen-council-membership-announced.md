Screen Council Membership Announced

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton has today announced the membership of the new screen production industry body, the Screen Council.

The establishment of the screen council was one of the key recommendations of the Screen Production taskforce, one of four sector taskforces established by the government in May 2002. The taskforces were charged with developing growth targets for their sector and to report on what they needed to reach those targets and stimulate growth across the economy.

Speaking to the annual conference of the Screen Producers and Director Association (SPADA) Jim Anderton said the government expected the 11 member Screen Council to provide a leadership voice for the sector, to oversee the implementation of the Taskforce’s recommendations and to provide ongoing independent advice to ministers on the sector’s development.

"I know you’ve got the breadth and depth of experience to do that. And I know that you have the necessary vision and ambition for your sector to provide the leadership it requires," Jim Anderton said.

The government is to provide two year’s of start up funding for the Screen Council with the expectation that future funding will come from the industry. The Screen Council’s primary objective will be to mobilise industry support for, and take ownership of, the growth targets identified by the Screen Production Taskforce.

These targets are:  
·sustainable foreign exchange earnings of $400 million per annum within five years;  
·at least 10 companies to achieve an annual turnover of $50 million each and at least another 20 companies to achieve an annual turnover of $10 million each.

The Screen Council members are:

Brent Harman (Chair) - currently chair of Prime Television

Michael Stedman - Managing Director, Natural History New Zealand, previously a member of the Taskforce

Ian Fraser - CEO Television New Zealand, previously a member of the Taskforce

John Barnett - managing director, South Pacific Pictures, previously a member of the Taskforce

Nicole Hoey - of Cinco Cine Productions and currently president of Spada
