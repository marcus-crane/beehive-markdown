“Deborah Coddington’s and Gerry Brownlee’s refusal to let me table information in the House today regarding comments I made on the proposed Eastern highway is an indication of how desperate Act and National have become and how dismayed they are at the real progress being made on Auckland’s transport issues,” said Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“Ms Coddington is quoting from a year-old story from the East and Bays Courier in which I did not oppose the proposed Eastern highway, but instead posed several serious questions related to its cost and expected benefits.

“Today I sought to table a letter of reply I wrote to correct a small section of original article, which the East and Bays Courier published but which Ms Coddington refuses to look at. It’s a sign of their desperation that they are prepared to trample on constitutional conventions in this way.

“I wish to make my views on this matter clear both as MP for Auckland Central and Minister for Auckland Issues. A proposed project of this magnitude needs serious thought. My letter to the East and Bays Courier is attached.

“Auckland’s transport situation is not going to be solved by petty political point-scoring and twisting the truth. Any major projects and their expenditure must be decided by Auckland through the Regional Land Transport Strategy, in partnership with the work the government and Auckland officials are doing on strategic and funding solutions.

“I look forward to the continuation of this government’s considerable progress on Auckland’s issues in partnership with the whole region.“

**Re: Minister Opposes Eastern Expressway**

Dear Madam

Contrary to your headline, I am not opposed to the Eastern Expressway proposal. I told your reporter that but I also told her that there were many questions that the new report does not answer. As Minister for Auckland it is my job to make sure that the Government and its agencies work with Auckland to build an efficient, cost effective transport system that is affordable and allows Aucklanders to live and work to our full potential as New Zealand’s economic powerhouse. As a life-long Aucklander, I also want the region to be worth living in. Our environment and our communities matter now and for the future.

Auckland region, not me, will decide whether this project goes ahead. Some of the questions that we will need answered include: How does this project fit in with existing roads, busways, train and ferry services? When should it be built? What form will it take? What will it cost? Who will pay for it? What will we have to defer if we build it now? What are the flow-on effects? And as MP for Auckland Central I am asking, “What happens when those three lanes of cars hit Mechanic’s Bay?”

The Auckland isthmus is not just a transport corridor for the South, West and North. There's actually a city there with communities, businesses, waterways and open spaces that are used for recreation as well as protected environmental areas, all of which need to be considered or consulted before a decision is made.

I also want to know how the eastern highway fits in with the established Auckland Regional Growth Strategy, the Regional Land Transport Strategy and the Public Transport Action Plan, which have laid out the agreed best use of money and resources within this funding cycle to help solve Auckland’s congestion and transport needs.

My top priorities are fixing Spaghetti Junction, the Grafton Gully-to-Port link, progressing State Highway 20, and public transport, public transport and public transport. Having a car is one of the joys of being an Aucklander but if we all want to drive to work at the same time the financial and environmental costs will skyrocket as Auckland grows.

I hope that we can get answers to all of our questions, and get a decision, as soon as possible. Because in the meantime the people whose homes, businesses and lives could be involved will be worried sick. People have to be involved in the process and know that if they're forced to move for the public good, they are not going to be out of pocket as well.

There needs to be proper investigation, proper integrated planning, good costings and full public consultation, and then Auckland can make a sensible decision.
