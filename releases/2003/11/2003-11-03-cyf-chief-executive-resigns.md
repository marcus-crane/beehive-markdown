Child, Youth and Family Minister Ruth Dyson today thanked CYF chief executive Jackie Pivac for her work leading the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services since 1999.

“Jackie has decided that it is in the wider interests of Child, Youth and Family to have another chief executive lead the implementation of the recently-released baseline review. I have no doubt that the decision was a difficult one. However, it is understandable, given her enormous contribution over the last four years, and an indication that she continues to put the wider interests of the department first.

“Jackie was appointed as chief executive of Child, Youth and Family in 1999 after the previous government created a stand-alone organisation without sufficient resources or infrastructure.

“Among her many achievements are leading the New Directions programme which came out of a report by former Youth Court Judge Mick Brown, overseeing greater recruitment and professionalism of social workers, and strengthening relationships with community providers.

“Child, Youth and Family helps thousands of New Zealand children and families a year, often under very difficult circumstances. As chief executive, Jackie has shown dedication and commitment, both to her staff and to the people the department is designed to serve.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey also thanked Ms Pivac for her hard work during the four years the department reported to him and wished her well for whatever career options she might pursue in the future.

“During my time as Minister, Child, Youth and Family achieved a great number of things which Jackie and the department can be justifiably proud of. Child, Youth and Family deals with some of the most difficult issues faced by any government department and Jackie’s passion and commitment to rebuild shattered lives was an inspiration to all her staff. With the baseline review now completed, the department has the opportunity to further build on her work and further improve its essential role looking after vulnerable New Zealand children and families,” Steve Maharey said.
