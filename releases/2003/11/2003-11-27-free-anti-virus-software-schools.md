Free anti-virus software for state and state-integrated schools will be available from the beginning of next year, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“This software will be a tremendous benefit to schools, knowing they can be confident they are working in a safe and secure environment free from viruses,” Trevor Mallard said.

“A large number of schools currently do not have anti-virus software, and are exposed to virus attacks which cost them time and money.

“Through the provision of a common, high quality anti-virus software package at no cost to schools, the government is ensuring this risk is greatly reduced.

“ Learning ICT skills is essential for our students and this package will enhance the quality, performance and reliability of computers in schools.”

The software and software supplier were selected through a tender process, and the deal is negotiated for 36 months.

Under the in-principle agreement, the “eTrust” software will be distributed to all schools by IBM New Zealand. The software is produced by Computer Associates.

“eTrust will provide virus protection for all servers and desktops currently used in New Zealand schools. Teaching and administrative staff will also receive protection for use at home,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I would expect all schools to have the software installed by the end of January 2004.

“While private schools will not automatically receive the free software, they will be eligible to buy the anti-virus package from the vendor at the same price negotiated by the Ministry of Education.”
