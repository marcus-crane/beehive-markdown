The expertise of teachers in using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to help students learn will get an important boost with the first ever appointment of e-learning fellows, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“These ten teachers were selected from more than fifty applicants across New Zealand. They are representative of a growing group of educators committed to developing innovative e-learning practice that is focussed on lifting student achievement,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The fellowship year gives teachers the time and support networks to research how to best meet their students’ learning needs in new and exciting ways.

“Making sure young New Zealanders have the skills that equip them for life and work in the 21st century is a key education priority for our government that sits alongside our firm commitment to building an innovative and dynamic economy.

“That’s why the government is investing heavily in ICT in education. Some $4.02 million has been earmarked for the year-long fellowships over the next four years – part of an extra $77.6 million dollar ICT investment in education.

“These fellowships will greatly contribute to national and international research as new approaches to learning through ICT are developed and shared. The fellowships will add another important dimension to ICT use in schools.”

Under the fellowships, teachers are released fulltime from their teaching duties for a year to work on their research project. Ultralab South is co-ordinating the academic support for the project. The research includes:

·Andrew Carswell's exploration of how high-end 3D animation technologies can create virtual environments for senior science students.  
·Gaylene Mackereth from Edgewater College in Auckland will explore ways to develop life-long learning habits in language students by connecting them to new ‘real world’ learning opportunities online.  
·Claire Derham-Cole from St Albans Primary School in Christchurch will research how e-learning can raise the achievement of Maori students in a bilingual classroom.  
A full list of the fellows, their research topics and schools is attached.
