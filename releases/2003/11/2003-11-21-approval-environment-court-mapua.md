Minister for the Environment Marian Hobbs has announced that the Environment Court today approved a Consent Order for the clean-up of the Mapua contaminated site.

The order follows an appeal of the original consents.

“I am pleased an agreement has been reached about consents for the clean-up of the contaminated Mapua site,” said Marian Hobbs.

“Negotiations between the Ministry for the Environment, Tasman District Council, Theiss and the appellants have worked through the issues and come to an agreement that delivers good environmental outcomes.”

“This is good news for Mapua and the Tasman District. We can now move forward to the next stage of the clean up and I look forward to proceeding as quickly as possible.”

John Hurley, Mayor of Tasman District Council, said that he was pleased the Environment Court had been able to make a quick decision on the Consent Order.

“The Court’s quick decision means we can move on and progress the work of cleaning up the site,” said John Hurley.
