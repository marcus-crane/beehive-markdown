The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs will continue its work on youth employment issues for another year with the support of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton, said today.

“The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs and the government share a common goal to have all 15 to19 year olds engaged in appropriate education, training, work or other options that will lead to long term economic independence and well being by 2007.” said Mr Anderton.

Along with the Ministry of Social Development and the Department of Labour’s Community Employment Group, MED will provide funding for the administration of the Taskforce as it works to achieve the goal agreed with the government in the Memorandum of Understanding.

MED is to allocate $50,000 from the Regional Initiatives Fund to assist the running of the Taskforce for this year. The funding will pay for an executive officer who runs the day to day activities of the Taskforce and co-ordinates the mayor’s activities.

"The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs met the criteria of the Regional Initiatives Fund as the Taskforce is involved in a number of initiatives that, while aimed at addressing employment issues, does so in ways that are tailored towards regional opportunities. The Taskforce also provides a valuable forum through which ideas can flow between regions and local and central government,” the Progressive leader said.

Their application is supported with funding from two other central government agencies as well as some private sector funding and contributions from the participating mayors.

Editors Note:

The Regional Initiatives Fund (RIF) is a discretionary fund administered by the Ministry of Economic Development. Each application is sent to the Minister for Economic, Industry and Regional Development for approval.

On average 20 projects through RIF are funded in each year. RIF grants range in value between $28,000 to $200,000 with most between $50,000 and $70,000. The majority of RIF grants are paid to territorial local authorities. In some cases, the council holds the money on behalf of groups that are not a legal entity.

Each application is based on partial funding on a case by case basis. A ‘local contribution’ is an essential part of any RIF application.

The purpose of the RIF is to provide support for regional projects that are consistent with economic, social and environmental objectives but cannot be funded through other Government assistance programmes. A region is defined as a geographical concentration of communities with similar economic, social and environmental characteristics and objectives.

The Regional Initiatives Fund was created to provide catalyst funding for regional projects that fall outside the criteria of existing Government assistance programmes, but have the potential to leverage economic growth as well as meet Government objectives for economic, social and environmental development.

Funding is only paid out on the completion of agreed milestones, and is monitored by the Ministry of Economic Development.
