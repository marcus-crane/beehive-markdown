Education Minister Trevor Mallard today opened a new special needs unit at Fernlea School in Wainuiomata.

A feature of the school is its work with special needs students, and its commitment to inclusive teaching.

Trevor Mallard said the new developments enabled students have access to quality teaching and learning in a way that celebrates and acknowledges their diverse learning conditions.

"This government is committed to ensuring that all students have access to quality teaching and learning and the facilities and dedicated staff at Fernlea mean those opportunities exist," Trevor Mallard said.

The government-funded modification of Fernlea's existing facilities was prompted by an increase in the enrolments of special needs students.

Trevor Mallard said he was not surprised enrolments had increased, as the school has a strong family-oriented culture and he congratulated the school community for its work developing the new unit.

"I want to acknowledge the work of Fernlea's teachers and also the support that the special needs students receive from their families. Congratulations on your new facilities which I am very pleased to open today."
