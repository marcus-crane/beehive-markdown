An agreement signed between Dunedin health practitioners Activ8 and Work and Income aims to vocationally assess 25 people who have been in receipt of an unemployment benefit for more than 8 years.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey signed the agreement this afternoon, as part of the Governments Job Jolt initiative.

Steve Maharey said many job seekers who have been looking for work over several years find themselves demotivated and disconnected from the labour market and this specialised approach will reconnect them with suitable employment opportunities.

“A pilot programme undertaken by Ranworth Healthcare earlier this year showed that vocational assessments followed by intensive Work and Income case management brings excellent results – 62% of the clients moved into employment or training. Ranworth Health have also been contracted to assess a further 25 Dunedin and Balclutha clients.

“The Jobs Jolt package of initiatives will help people get off benefits and into employment and address the shortage of skilled labour. This initiative targets the very long term unemployed job seekers with a specialist assessment and will provide a better understanding of their issues and support further development of their long term solutions and participation in the labour market,” Steve Maharey said.

The aim of Jobs Jolt initiatives is to help thousands of people into work over the next three years. Work and Income are currently developing similar agreements around the country seeking practical solutions that address causes not symptoms. The number of registered as unemployed for eight years plus has reduced in Dunedin from 101 in November 1999 to 53 in October 2003. This compares with a nation wide reduction from 3060 to 1753 for the same period.
