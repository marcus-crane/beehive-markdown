Health Minister Annette King says more children and their families from high-needs groups will benefit from the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society's care.

Plunket will receive an increase of $2.8 million on its baseline funding in 2003/04 and a further $2.8m in 2004/05, under a new two-year contract reached with the Ministry. Plunket funding has increased from $21.2m in 2000 to $28.2m in 2003.

In the 2002/03 year, Plunket also received a $1.9m one-off payment. That payment has now been included in its baseline funding.

Ms King says the increased funding demonstrates a commitment to helping Plunket achieve its goals in line with the Well Child framework.

“It will provide more Plunket visits for children and their families in lower socio-economic groups who have high needs, while continuing to provide services to those with lower needs.

"All children and their families have a right to healthcare, no matter what their economic situation. Plunket will continue to provide care for children of all needs, while putting additional resources and services into high-needs groups to increase their number of visits," says Ms King.

Ms King says that more than 47,000 children are enrolled with Plunket, and the new agreement will allow all children who enrol with Plunket to receive the visits they are entitled to, as well as additional visits to high-needs families and first time parents across all socio-economic groups.

"There are various reasons why some high-needs groups face barriers to healthcare. While the new agreement will allow Plunket to direct more resources to these groups, in the long term it will mean greater pay-off through ensuring health care for those who need it most," says Ms King.

The Ministry will be monitoring the number of Plunket visits overall, as well as progress toward fully implementing the Well Child framework over the next four to five years.
