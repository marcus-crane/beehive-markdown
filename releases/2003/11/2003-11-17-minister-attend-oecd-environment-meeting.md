Environment Minister Marian Hobbs leaves for Paris this afternoon to attend an OECD Round Table meeting on Sustainable Development.

The meeting, chaired by former New Zealand Environment Minister Simon Upton, will attempt to produce measures of the impact policies in OECD countries have on the prospects for sustainable development in other countries.

Participants include a dozen ministers from OECD countries and representatives from the United Nations Environment and Development Programmes, business, trade unions, universities and environment organisations.

"Remarkably little is known about the global impact of national policies," Marian Hobbs said. "We will be considering the cross-boundary effects of such policies and attempting to test political reaction to suggested measures.

"The RoundTable operates under 'Chatham House rules' allowing a free-flowing exchange between participants with no prepared statements.

"Conference discussions should prove valuable for the government's sustainable development programme."

Marian Hobbs returns to New Zealand on Friday.
