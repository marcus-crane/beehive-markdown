The newly announced Screen Council will greatly assist Maori participation in the screen industry, Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.

Parekura Horomia will be involved in appointing members to the Council and is taking a special interest some of the training initiatives that are likely to emerge.

The Screen Council will play an important role in overseeing the formation of a qualification type standard for training in the industry.

"I am excited by this because it will give Maori the opportunity to unlock the same type of creative potential that we have seen in recent productions like Whale Rider," said Parekura Horomia.

The Screen Production Industry Taskforce’s recommendations were designed to ensure industry training and tertiary education courses better met the industry’s needs. They are to be the subject of further work by the Tertiary Education Commission, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and the Screen Council.

"Film and television play an important role in both our cultural and economic development, and in helping to build a more confident nation,” Parekura Horomia said.

"We have many exciting and experienced Maori producers working in the film and television industry, and I believe this package will provide them with opportunities to further develop their talents.

"Maori have been prominent in all aspects of screen production like acting, crew work, and directing, and I am thrilled by this new announcement.”
