Jim Anderton, Minister for Industry and Regional Development, congratulated BLOOMZ on winning first prize at the Amsterdam International Hortifair for its new calla lily 'Hot Chocolate'

"This is a great example of innovation, intellectual property, and export success in one of the most competitive markets in the world" said Mr Anderton.

"Andy Warren from BLOOMZ should be congratulated for having the vision and drive to achieve such a wonderful triumph".

BLOOMZ acknowledges the vital support given to its innovation programme by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise. As a member of the NZTE Fast Forward Programme for rapidly growing companies, BLOOMZ has been able to extend its patent protection for new varieties through-out the world and gain support for new innovative advances in the breeding arena. A NZTE Senior Business Adviser has also been working with the company on its strategic planning for the programme.

"This is a good example of government and business working together," said Mr Anderton.
