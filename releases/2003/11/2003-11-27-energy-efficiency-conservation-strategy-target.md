New Zealand is on track to meet the targets set by the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, with a 1.9% improvement in energy efficiency in the Strategy’s first year.

Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today released the first full year’s results since the launch of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy. The benefits include 536,000 tonnes less carbon dioxide emitted due to the energy efficiency improvement.

"While gains are greater in some areas than in others, it looks like we’re on track for delivering on the Strategy’s targets of a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency and a 30 petajoule increase in renewable energy by 2012," Mr Hodgson said. "The National Strategy seeks an average 1.8 percent per annum efficiency improvement – double what would be expected without any intervention."

The figures, for the year ended March 2002, show a 1.9% improvement in energy efficiency – saving about 9 petajoules, the annual power consumption of 207,000 homes. There was also a 2.2% (2.2 PJ) increase in the use of renewable energy which is 7.3% of the way towards the target.

Efficiency gains came from the transport, commercial and industrial sectors with efficiency improvements of 3.5%, 2.1% and 1% respectively. Energy efficiency in the residential and primary production sectors declined slightly.

"Achieving these two targets will mean two thirds of our additional energy needs will come from clean, renewable sources such as wind, hydro, solar and bio energy. It will also mean that we will have met around one third of our emissions reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

"Energy efficiency doesn’t mean going without. It means getting more value from the energy we consume," Mr Hodgson said.
