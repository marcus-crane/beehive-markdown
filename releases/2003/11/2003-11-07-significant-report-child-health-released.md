Health Minister Annette King says today’s release of a [significant report on our children’s health](http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/238fd5fb4fd051844c256669006aed57/064234a7283a0478cc256dd60000ab4c?OpenDocument#NZ_Food_NZ_Children) poses a challenge to all parts of New Zealand society to encourage children to make wise choices about their health.

“The New Zealand Food: New Zealand Children report is the most important and comprehensive piece of evidence we have yet of the state of our children’s health, and it will influence policy development for many years,” says Ms King.

Ms King says the report consists of the findings of the 2002 National Children’s Nutrition Survey. “These findings confirm what we've largely suspected about our children's health, and provide critical data that will help create better and more effective policies and public health programmes to improve our children’s health and the nation’s health.”

More than 3000 school children, aged between 5 and 14 years old, and from 172 schools, participated in the Ministry of Health-funded survey last year. The University of Auckland, Massey University (Palmerston North) and the University of Otago conducted the survey.

The questions asked of children included diet and exercise patterns, said Ms King. “The resulting data forms the basis for this comprehensive report on food and nutrient intakes, eating patterns, levels of physical activity, dental health, and nutrition-related clinical measures.”

Ms King says the survey findings provide valuable health information on European, Maori, Pacific and other children.

“Some main findings show that younger children have good levels of food and nutrient intake and physical activity, but as children grow and start making their own food choices, their choices tend to become less well-balanced and they become less active.

“Children's overall fat intakes are satisfactory, but saturated fat (bad fat) intake is higher than ideal, and more than one-third of total sugars intake comes from beverages, sugar, and sweets. The findings confirm that we must continue to encourage children to make wiser choices about their health. There are no quick, easy answers to changing lifestyles, but we must make the healthy choice the easy choice for children."

Ms King says shared solutions for improving nutrition and physical acitivity must come from a range of sectors. “These healthy messages should not only come from the home, but from within the community, schools, health professionals, and Government and non-Government organisations.

“One major Government initiative, Healthy Eating, Healthy Action, was launched earlier this year and is a strategic future framework for improving nutrition, obesity-related illness and lack of exercise. The Ministry of Health has also produced a series of informative Food and Nutrition Guidelines for all ages, to help people make smart choices.

"The Government is committed to improving children's health and while this survey’s findings will influence policy development for many years to come, change cannot happen unless we all take up the challenge.”

Questions and Answers

How was the survey conducted, and what was the aim?  
The Ministry of Health funded the University of Auckland, Massey University (Palmerston North) and the University of Otago to conduct the survey. Auckland UniServices Limited managed the contract on behalf of the three institutions.

The survey provides information on food and nutrient intakes, eating patterns, physical activity patterns, dental health and nutrition-related clinical measures of New Zealand children aged 5-14 years old from 172 schools.

The voluntary school-based survey was a cross-sectional, population survey on a representative sample of 3276 children. The primary purpose of the survey was to provide information that can be used to improve, promote and protect the health status of children in New Zealand.

The survey consisted of several components, the major one of which was a questionnaire in which children reported their food consumption patterns, food security, eating habits and use of dietary supplements. They also answered questions about their activity levels, dental health and, for older girls, menstruation. Typically, the main interview with the child was carried out in the home in the presence of a parent or caregiver. Collection of body size measures (height, weight, skinfolds) as well as blood and urine samples occurred at school.

What are some of the findings?

·As children grow older and have greater access to and ability to make their own food choices, the food choices they make tend to be less well-balanced, and their levels of physical activity tend to fall.  
·Some 86percent of females and 79 percent of males ate breakfast before they left home in the morning for school. These figures are lower for Maori and Pacific children. Those children who are living in more "deprived" areas were less likely to have breakfast before leaving home in the morning.  
·Some 78 percent of all children reported that their household could always afford to eat properly. This means 22 percent could not.  
· About 2 out of 5 children met the recommended number of serves of fruit (at least two per day).  
· About 3 out of 5 children met the recommended number of serves of vegetables (three or more times a day).  
· Overweight and obesity in New Zealand for children aged 5-14 years of age is at 31 percent. Pacific children stand at 62 percent; Maori at 41 percent; and other New Zealand children at 24 percent.

More findings are available in the Survey and brochures on www.moh.govt.nz/phi

How will the information from this report be used?  
This survey provides critical information on the current health and nutritional status of the children of New Zealand aged between 5 and 14 years. Knowing this information gives health workers and policy-makers direction in terms of how to target their programmes. It also provides a baseline against which the success or otherwise of these programmes and promotions can be measured and monitored. For example, the survey provides information about children who eat or do not eat breakfast before school. We are able to identify at-risk groups in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and NZ Dep score. This enables specific targeting of public health programmes and promotions to encourage higher levels of consumption of breakfast in these groups.

Will there be further work undertaken?  
Yes. The survey provides a comprehensive overview of the health and nutritional status of New Zealand children between 5 and 14 years of age in 2002. Whilst it is unlikely that the survey will be repeated in the same form, the PHI-managed New Zealand Health Monitor (a 10 year strategy for national population surveys in the Ministry of Health) sets out a programme under which the health of all New Zealanders is regularly monitored. This includes monitoring the health and nutritional status of this group of New Zealanders.
