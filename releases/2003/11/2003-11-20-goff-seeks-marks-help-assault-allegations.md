Justice Minister Phil Goff is urging NZ First MP Ron Mark to cooperate fully with attempts to bring to justice two men Mr Mark claims were responsible for vicious assaults on security guards in the past week.

On Tuesday Mr Mark claimed in Parliament that two security officers working for a private company had been hospitalised after being attacked by "crazed P-using crims" on home detention.

"Such serious allegations require urgent investigation by the police," Mr Goff said.

"Unfortunately Chubb, the private security firm used by Corrections to monitor home detainees, says it is unaware of any such incident.

"Chubb also says no incidents of that nature have ever occurred during the time their company has been monitoring offenders on home detention.

"The Police have also told me that they have had no complaints that could be related to the incidents described by Mr Mark. Corrections also have no record of any officers being assaulted in this manner."

Mr Goff tabled the letter from Chubb in Parliament today.

"Yesterday I invited Mr Mark to table in Parliament the email containing the information he had on the attack. He has done that, but has deleted the name of the person making the complaint.

"I urge Mr Mark to assist the police by providing them with all the information he has on this matter, including the name of the complainant, or to press that person to take their complaint directly to the police so they can thoroughly investigate this matter.

"The allegations Mr Mark has made, if true, are too serious to be left unresolved," Mr Goff said.
