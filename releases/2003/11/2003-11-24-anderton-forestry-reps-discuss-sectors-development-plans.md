Forestry industry representatives have been invited to Wellington to  
meet with Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton to discuss the  
industry's development strategy.

Jim Anderton said he wanted to touch base with a broad range of  
representatives from the sector to ensure they remained committed to  
accelerating the industry's development towards high value-added  
products and markets as outlined in the Wood Processing Strategy  
after comments earlier today by the Timber Industry Federation's  
executive director, Wayne Coffey.

The Timber Industry Federation appears to think that the government  
is hostile to business and views industry as 'some sort of necessary  
evil,' according to a Radio New Zealand report.

"In reality, there hasn't been a government in our recent  
history that has been so prepared to be engaged with the wood  
industry as this coalition government. When I chaired the Wood  
Processing Taskforce it was the first time that such a comprehensive  
and representative industry grouping had been brought together to  
address industry-wide concerns.

"We studied the issues that the industry itself identified as  
blockages to development. And we carefully considered areas where the  
government could actively participate in collective solutions to  
assist the sector to meet its potential of one day being this  
country's largest export earner.

"This is the government that has met the challenge of investing  
$30 million per year in strategic roading identified as necessary to  
the industry's development. This is the coalition government that has  
invested $2 million in setting up a Centre of Excellence for Wood  
Processing in Rotorua and is committed to investment in the training  
and education of young adults for the wood industry which is so  
valuable to its future," he said.

Jim Anderton said everyone in the industry agrees that New Zealand's  
future prosperity can't be secured by competing on low costs and low  
wages alone.

"Our challenge as a nation is to make the investments in skills,  
infrastructure and equipment that will permit us to raise the  
proportion of high quality goods and services that we manufacture and  
export. There are complementary roles for industry sectors,  
individual businesses and the government to achieve these objectives.  
I believe we are on the right track and most industry leaders I speak  
to regularly think so too," he said.
