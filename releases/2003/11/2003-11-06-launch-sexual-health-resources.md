Health Minister Annette King visited Wainuiomata High School today to launch a new series of sexual health resources for year 9 and 10 students (aged 13–15 years).

Ms King said the new resources, a video, a Compact Guide to Sexual Health booklet, and a Teachers' Guide to Sexual Health, had been developed by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education in consultation with students and community groups.

“Sexual health is a key learning area in the health and physical education component of the New Zealand curriculum. These new resources are designed to meet the needs of young people for up-to-date, relevant and accurate information about their sexual and reproductive health in a format they can relate to,” she said.

Students from Wainuiomata High School were involved in developing the video and members of the Hutt Valley Teen Parents Programme also share their experiences in the video.

Ms King said it was important to remember, when developing health education resources, that “what adults and health professionals think will work does not always coincide with how young people think. Therefore, having input from young people into the development process is a key factor in whether the resources will be successful or not."

Young New Zealanders had relatively high rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmissible infections, suggesting young people needed more information, she said.

“International evidence suggests that countries with comparatively good sexual health outcomes, particularly for young people, share similar approaches to promoting good health, such as open, honest discussion about sex and sexuality at all levels of society.”
