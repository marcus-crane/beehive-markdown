Returning to study at various times across a person’s working life is the foundation of a successful career in today’s workforce, says Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

The options open to mature students to re-enter education and training are discussed in the Department of Labour’s November issue of workINSIGHT.

Steve Maharey said it’s important that a culture of lifelong learning is instilled in young people while they’re still at school so they can understand their options well before they commit to decisions about the future.

“Workers are now repeatedly returning to education or training throughout their lifetime. ‘Mature students’ (people aged 25 years and above) currently make up more than 50 per cent of the student population.

“workINSIGHT explains the options available to mature students contemplating re-entering education and training. It’s designed to help people make informed decisions about their education, training and careers by giving them the facts and showing them their options,” Steve Maharey said.

workINSIGHT is aimed at labour market intermediaries, including careers advisers and counsellors, education and training providers, Work and Income and employment brokers as well as public sector organisations. Other topics covered in the latest issue include workplace literacy, workforce trends in the New Zealand Plastics industry and job vacancy growth areas.
