The Government has launched a new public service cadetship programme for school leavers in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Development, reinstating a career path disestablished after the state sector reforms of the 1980s.

Speaking today from Auckland at the launch of the nationwide employment programme, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Rick Barker said 100 cadets would be taken on by the Ministry of Social Development’s Work and Income service.

“Work and Income will employ and train the first 100 cadets as case managers.”

Mr Barker said the cadetship programme would help reinforce a strong public service and also formed part of the Government’s long-term commitment to help young people make a successful transition from school to work.

“The cadetship programme will provide young people with a career path in the public sector and quality training linked to the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.”

Cadets would be supported to work towards a Certificate in Client Management, a nationally recognised tertiary qualification.

Mr Barker said the cadetship programme would also reinforce the capacity of the public sector by recruiting, developing and retaining young people with the ability to become future leaders.

“Once upon a time, young people had a clear career path in the public sector and many of today’s public sector leaders, including Work and Income’s own National Commissioner Ray Smith, benefited from being cadets.”

The September 2003 quarterly Household Labour Force Survey figures showed that New Zealand’s official unemployment rate stood at 4.4%, a 16-year low and one of the lowest in the OECD. However, Mr Barker said the HLFS unemployment rate for people under the age of 24 stood at 6 percent.

“With an ageing population and work force it is crucial that we take steps now to invest in young people and help reduce the loss of skilled workers as baby boomers begin to retire.

“The up-side for young people is a buoyant New Zealand economy and an increasing demand for skills, which means the conditions are right for a younger generation to achieve excellent training and employment outcomes.”

Mr Barker said the Ministry of Social Development had a central role in helping young people into employment and would therefore take on cadets each year.

“The challenge now is for other government agencies and local authorities to demonstrate their commitment to investing in the future of young people and do likewise.”

The Ministry would begin advertising for cadets in national newspapers from this weekend.

Cadets will be employed throughout the country and young people interested in applying to become cadets with Work and Income are welcome to call (free phone) 0508 CADETS (0508 223 387) from Friday 28 November.

Background information about the Ministry of Social Development Cadetship scheme

Cadetships provided young people with a career path in the Public Service until they were disestablished following the state sector reforms of the 1980s.

An opportunity now exists to reintroduce a cadet programme to Work and Income in order to demonstrate leadership in the youth transition area and to help build future capability for the Ministry.

Such a programme would involve cadets working towards industry qualifications through the Public Service Training Organisation’s Modern Apprenticeship Scheme.

Background

·The Ministry of Social Development has a key role in helping young people successfully transition to adulthood.  
·Modern Apprenticeships were introduced by the government in 2000 (under the Modern Apprenticeship Training Act 2000) to encourage and assist young people into careers, while improving their skills and qualifications.  
·In September 2003, Minister Maharey (the Minister for Tertiary Education) announced funding for an additional 500 Modern Apprenticeships this financial year, thus reaffirming the government’s commitment to this youth transition initiative.  
·The trend in many organisations is to develop and re-introduce internal capacity measures such as cadetships. This is a necessary step following a decade of cost reductions, flat structures and efficiency, which, now that the economy is growing, is insufficient for the medium term requirements for growth.

Programme overview

·The cadet programme is aimed at youth who are eligible for the Modern Apprenticeship Programme (16 to 21 year olds).  
·Cadets will be permanent fulltime employees and will be employed into case manager roles  
·Cadets will undertake study over a two-year period to obtain a Certificate in Customer Service in the Public Sector (Level 4).  
·Cadets will receive additional support from their direct manager, team coaches, and regional training functions. It is likely that they will take on a lower caseload than existing staff to accommodate study requirements.  
·The Public Sector Training Organisation (PSTO) provides support (and limited funding) through the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme.  
Work and Income will be looking for youth for the cadet programme who:

·Are eligible for the modern Apprenticeships Scheme  
·Have the potential to achieve a level 4 qualification under the NZQA framework  
·Have shown leadership skills within their school or community groups  
·Are suitable for case manager roles (in particular we will be looking for people with strong communication skills, who are motivated by a career in customer service).

Work and Income will continue to value diversity in its new recruits.

Linkages with Other Programmes  
·The Modern Apprenticeship Scheme requires participants to obtain an industry related NZQA qualification. This links with the National Certificate in Customer Service being piloted internally with case managers at the beginning of 2004.  
·Regional Commissioners have also been developing cadetship and internship programmes with local government and industry to assist youth at risk. The focus for that is on a smooth transition to work from school.  
·The cadet programme will be complementary to the Maori and Pacific cadetship programme.
