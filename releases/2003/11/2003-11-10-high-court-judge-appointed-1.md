Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of John Gerard Fogarty as a Judge of the High Court.

Justice Fogarty graduated from the University of Canterbury with an LLB Hons and went on to study at the University of Toronto where he completed an LLM in 1974. He then joined Weston Ward & Lascelles, becoming a partner in that firm in 1978.

Justice Fogarty went to the bar in 1985 and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1990. As a barrister he developed a public law/commercial practice, and he is also a trained mediator and arbitrator.

Justice Fogarty has been an advisor to the Deaf Sports Federation of New Zealand (formerly NZ Deaf Sports Association) for many years and was part of the organising committee for the XVth World Games for the Deaf held in Christchurch in 1989.

The new judge will sit in Christchurch.
