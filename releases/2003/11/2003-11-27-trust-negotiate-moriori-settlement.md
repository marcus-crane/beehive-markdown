The Hokotehi Moriori Trust will represent Moriori in negotiations for the settlement of their historical Treaty of Waitangi claims, Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said.

“The Minister of Maori Affairs and I are satisfied that the Trust has the support of the Moriori people to negotiate on their behalf. Congratulations to the Trust on achieving this important milestone, it demonstrates their hard work and determination to progress Moriori claims toward settlement.”

The Waitangi Tribunal published its report Rekohu: A Report on Moriori and Ngati Mutunga Claims in the Chatham Islands in 2001. The Tribunal report found Moriori were entitled, as native people of New Zealand, to make claims under the Treaty.

“These negotiations will give the Crown the opportunity to redress its role in the harm suffered by Moriori since 1842, when the Chathams first became part of New Zealand,” Margaret Wilson said.

“Negotiations with the Trust will begin after they have held elections early next year, to give them time to appoint negotiators. The next step will then be the signing of Terms of Negotiation setting out the ground rules for how negotiations will be conducted.”

A number of claimant groups are currently developing their mandates in order to enter negotiations, including Central North Island iwi. The Government is committed progressing these claims so grievances are addressed and claimants have the opportunity to rebuild their economic base, strengthening their communities and New Zealand as a whole.
