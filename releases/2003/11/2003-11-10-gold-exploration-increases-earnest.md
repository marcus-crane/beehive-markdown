Associate Minister of Energy, Hon Harry Duynhoven today announced a dramatic increase in interest in exploration for gold in New Zealand.

“Most of the prospective ground is covered by permit or is currently under application. Not only have New Zealand-based companies been expanding their interests but applications have been received by English, Australian and North American companies” said Mr Duynhoven.

“I have just awarded a prospecting permit to Glass Earth Limited, a New Zealand company with Australian and Canadian partners, who intend to acquire high-quality geophysical datasets over the Taupo volcanic zone and southern Coromandel. This data will enable them, future exploration companies and land owners to identify potentially prospective areas of mineralisation below the surface,” said Mr Duynhoven.

This dramatic increase in interest comes on the back of an improving gold price and after a concerted marketing effort by Crown Minerals in the Ministry of Economic Development. Crown Minerals recently released a CD containing a GIS data package with prospectivity modelling for epithermal gold in the North Island. The epithermal CD completes a set of three Crown Minerals CDs. The second CD contained a GIS data package with prospectivity modelling on mesothermal gold in the South Island and was published in 2002. The first in the series of the CD's was Introduction to New Zealand’s Mineral Resources.

“The beauty of the CD data packages is that they enable quality data to be put in the hands of the decision makers in the exploration industry worldwide, breaking down New Zealand's geographic isolation. The CD also feature innovative, world-first prospectivity modelling at a regional scale which has captured the exploration industry's imagination. These two CDs have been a joint project between Crown Minerals and the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences and have cost less than $300k to produce. This is a good investment considering that exploration is expected to more than double in the next two years from the $10m spent last year” Mr Duynhoven concluded.

These CDs are available free from Crown Minerals. For further information contact Paul Stigley at Crown Minerals, paul.stigley@med.govt.nz
