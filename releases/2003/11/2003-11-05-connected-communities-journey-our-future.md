Comments at the Department of Labour's Community Employment Group's Connecting Communities conference. Wellington Town Hall.

\[SLIDE 1: Connecting Communities: A Journey to our Future]

Kia ora koutou, Fakaalofa lahi atu, Kia orana, Malo e lelei, Ni sa bula vinaka, Talofa lava, Taloha Ni, warm pacific greetings to you all.

I am very pleased to be with you here today, to be able to speak with such a large gathering of digital champions.

Over the past couple of days you have had an opportunity to hear about a wide range of community based projects which are successfully using information and communications technologies (ICT).

You will have a sense of the sheer diversity of approaches to providing digital opportunities to New Zealand’s communities, and some of the challenges we face in supporting and extending this activity.

This morning Gene Crick - our guest from Texas - talked about the lessons that have been learned from community ICT initiatives in the USA. I am pleased to hear that the most successful American projects have integrated ICTs into the activities of communities rather than setting technology up as an end in itself. The integration of technology for community purposes is the model emerging from New Zealand’s communities’ as we develop ourselves as a knowledge society.

You all appreciate that ICT is changing the way we live, work, communicate, and take up services and leisure activities. We are living in a time of rapid change where new technologies emerge and change our lives at ever increasing speeds.

Knowledge is crucial to our future development and these new technologies are essential in our toolkit for sustained economic and social development. They enable us to use our knowledge for the benefit of all.

You know from your own experiences that ensuring that everyone has access to these new technologies, the skills and confidence to use them and the motivation to take an active role in the knowledge society, is not an easy task. Neither is it something that can be done alone. It requires collaboration between partners from all sectors.

To respond to the challenges of becoming a successful knowledge society we need to be able to identify our strengths and build on them. We need to be prepared for the changes ahead to ensure that we improve the wellbeing of all members of our society.

This is what I want to spend some time talking about with you today.

I want to look at what the government is doing to help support the knowledge society and some of the challenges we face in ensuring that everyone is able to thrive in that society.

The government is committed to supporting community use of ICT through partnership working and I want to stress the importance of the final sessions of this conference which will concern themselves with setting an agenda for future action to support community technology initiatives.

\[SLIDE 2: The Knowledge Society]

THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY

There have been major changes in information and communications technology in the recent past. Cell phones mean we’re always available, the internet can provide us with incredible amounts of information and opportunity, and a two hour international phone call can be as little as $7. Most of us had not thought about these changes 25 years ago. Technology has made the world more accessible.

Globalization is another trend affecting our lives. It is exposing us to new international markets and competition, changing the needs of our own economy and changing our relationship with the rest of the world.

And knowledge, its creation, movement and use is perhaps the biggest driver of change. Increasingly all aspects of our life depend on our ability to access and use information.

The government has instigated a range of strategies to prepare for the use of ICT that is so central to the knowledge society. These include:  
·ensuring all schools have access to broadband.  
·focusing on the ICT sector generally as a source of economic development through the Growth and Innovation Framework.  
·making sure that we have a more collaborative and cooperative tertiary system that is closely connected to enterprise and local communities.  
·adult learning is also a key government priority for the next 5 years with $45million committed to improving numeracy and literacy skills.  
·within the Jobs Jolt package launched in August there’s provision to develop a community based learning programme to engage long-term unemployed people with ICT.  
·there has also been considerably energy spent making sure government information is accessible via the internet, that business is supported in e-commerce activities and that research is in place to access the impact of ICT economically and socially.

\[SLIDE 3: Connected Communities]

Connecting Communities

In June last year, I launched the Connecting Communities strategy, the first government strategy to tackle the ‘digital divide’.

This is an ambitious strategy which seeks to increase communities ability to access, participate in and efficiently use ICT.

‘Connecting communities’ is explicit in the need to link with other strategies aimed at improving communities’ wellbeing. It requires the government to work in partnership with colleagues from community, private and philanthropic sectors to support innovative and sustainable activities to tackle digital disadvantage.

Connected communities

What is a connected community?

We know from research here and abroad that a connected community is one that uses ICT to enable it to function more effectively.

Community Information Networks offer a way of communicating. They do not replace face-to-face networking, they can enhance it.

Networks are essential to us. Through them we gain our sense of ourselves, our identities, our environment. They help to develop trust and teach us the ways of co-operation and participation. This is the social fabric of our communities.

Through our complex interactions with each other we develop collective resources – community groups, voluntary services, governance structures, shared activities which generate the feeling of wellbeing.

These assets are your social capital. The collective structures, memory, imagination and energy that is brought into play when communities come together to solve new problems, make solutions and celebrate success.

Introducing ICT is a community capacity building exercise; it can strengthen existing social capital.

Once in place, ICT can be used to build community capacity, to increase and support enterprise.

What can we expect from a connected community?

·A number of accessible places where all people can feel safe and supported in using ICT’s.  
·The provision of a range of ICT learning opportunities, suited to people’s different learning styles and focused on different levels of competency. Telfords Technology Bus, REAPs various activities, CyberWaka are just some of the examples you’ve heard about at this conference.  
·Active networks of people learning to use technology, applying the information they find through using technology or sharing the knowledge they are generating through their interactions with others. Innovators on Line, Wellington Community Net and other networks have demonstrated the benefits of this to you.  
·New community products such as on-line directories, maps of local activities, web pages of local groups and businesses, information developed by and with communities and on their terms. The Big Idea, the local community websites, some of the written products here are examples.  
·A multi-lingual, multi-cultural and multi-ability presence on local websites, that offers information in appropriate styles, formats and languages. PacificFlair.com, WEKA.net (What Everyone Keeps Asking about disability) and the dot maori and dot iwi developments are showing what is possible.  
·Improved governance within the community, as decision makers are able to access up-to-date information about their communities and refer to archives of information stored in a community archive. Tipuake & Kaitiakitanga Enterprises, the processes being developed in the connecting communities pilots offer some insights into how powerful this can be.  
·New service channels enabling local people to access local, regional and nationally based health, education, employment, housing and all other services which promote social cohesion. The Language Line, CommunityNet Aotearoa and WorkSite illustrate early ventures into this area of work.  
·Improved local employment prospects as the community’s expertise in ICT increases and begins to add value to our traditional industries and creates new opportunities for trade and innovation.

A JOURNEY TO THE FUTURE

This afternoon you are being invited to help identify the activities that will support the development of connected communities. To consider whether support should be provided nationally or locally. And the kinds of networks and partnerships needed.

Reflecting on the three Connecting Communities pilots and recent research into New Zealand’s community ICT Projects a few critical success factors become clear.

\[SLIDE 4: Critical Success Factors]

Raising people’s awareness of the benefits of ICT is crucial in gaining their interest and support. Their early experiences of ICT have to be interesting and relevant to their lives.

The spark that sets the whole process in motion, needs to be re-kindled to re-focus people in the challenging journey to project implementation. Strong facilitation, inspirational digital champions and active communication in all forms are vital.

Good tools and collaborative planning processes are needed for communities to work together, to map what they have, what they need and where they are going.

Building strong partnerships within the community as well as local and central government will assist in securing resources for the initiative and finding links with other strategic developments.

Community leadership is required to bring all the different players together, to balance different interests and ensure the strategies encompass the aspirations of those without the access or ability to use ICT.

\[SLIDE 5: The Future]

THE GLOBAL ISSUES

These factors are not confined to local communities. The first World Summit on the Information Society takes place in Geneva in December this year.

The summit brings together public, private and community sector interests from across the world to begin to create a framework for the global knowledge society. I know that a number of you have contributed to the content of submissions from New Zealand.

In comparison with many of the countries taking part in that summit, New Zealand is well placed in terms of ICT infrastructure and applications, and social, educational and economic development.

What is important about this gathering is that the same issues and debates taking place in Geneva, are also taking place in the communities of New Zealand. There are significant international disagreements about ownership of cultural and intellectual property, the particular needs of indigenous peoples, women, immigrants, refugees, disabled people, older people, the health and safety implications of new technologies, the security measures needed for security and the protection of children and vulnerable people.

Globally and locally, these are fundamental issues which will not be resolved easily.

What is important is that we develop the networks to raise and discuss those issues and develop policy frameworks that enable knowledge to be created and shared appropriately.

We are actively creating new public places in cyber space. A knowledge society will only succeed if we understand and respect our differences, and value the diversity that results from our mix of unique assets. At the end of the day, this is about people.

THE CHALLENGE FOR THE FUTURE

The world we live in is being shaped by rapid technological change and knowledge is driving those changes.

Our ability to become a successful knowledge society depends on our ability to identify, create and share knowledge.

We need to work together – in our communities, our regions, and across our sectors to appreciate and value our diversity of cultures, perspectives and experiences, and share what we know.

ICTs will not replace the community level interactions that give us our sense of self and wellbeing, they can enhance and extend that sense of community and provide new spaces for knowledge to be developed and stored.

We need to be accountable to each other for the ways we give and gain knowledge – ensuring that we serve the interests of our communities at local and national levels.

We don’t know what is ahead of us but we do know some of the benefits we can expect from connected communities. And we are making good progress in these areas.

\[SLIDE 6: Connecting our Communities]

Finally, the government is committed to working with the broadest range of partners to support community use of ICT.

The immediate challenge for you is to identify the best ways of providing that support in the next few years.

I look forward to the results.
