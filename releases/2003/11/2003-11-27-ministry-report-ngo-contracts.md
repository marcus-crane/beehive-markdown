Health Minister Annette King has welcomed the Ministry of Health report on its contracts with Non-Government Organisations and the way they comply with public service standards.

Ms King said the Ministry carried out its investigation in relation to lobbying activities of NGOs.

“The report makes clear recommendations which the Ministry of Health has already begun implementing,” Ms King said. “It should be noted that some of the clauses in dispute can be found in some contracts that go back to the 1990s, and that these were rolled over each time they were renewed, including the time when they were handed over from the Health Funding Authority to the Ministry in 2000.“

Damien O’Connor said he was pleased the report “clarified the approach to be taken by the Ministry in contracting with NGOs in the future”.
