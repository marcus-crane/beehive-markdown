Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says the start of two new roading projects shows that Auckland continues to get much-needed attention on its infrastructure under the Labour Progressive Government.

The Associate Transport and Auckland Issues Minister will help turn the first sod for Stage 2 of the Central Motorway Junction, and attend the iwi blessing of the Greenhithe section of the Upper Harbour Corridor today.

“Stage 2 of the Central Motorway Junction project is the biggest roading construction contract in Auckland and marks the beginning of one of the busiest phases of construction in Auckland’s history. Spaghetti Junction, as Aucklanders know it, is at the heart of the region’s motorway system.

“The Greenhithe project is a significant step in the development of the total Upper Harbour Corridor and is a critical part of the Western Ring Route. Completing these links is part of this government’s commitment to providing a reliable motorway system for Auckland, connecting communities and providing access to goods and services.”

Judith Tizard warned that while these projects will help to ease congestion in the long-term, commuters need to continue to be patient and think about their transport options.

Spaghetti Junction is the busiest section of road in New Zealand with 200,000 vehicles travelling through each day. Where possible, work will be carried out in the evenings, and traffic and construction noise will be minimised.

“As more work comes on-stream our roads are going to get busier, with road-works and construction traffic on top of the usual congestion. This project is an opportunity for Aucklanders to consider the importance of transport alternatives.

“Being able to get around all of Auckland’s wonderful attractions, to work and to school by car is one of the pleasures of living here. However the present roading system is badly congested and our population is rapidly expanding. The government continues to put huge new funding into passenger transport and transport alternatives alongside roading improvements. Our aim is not only to make Auckland more efficient, but also to keep it a great place to live and work.”
