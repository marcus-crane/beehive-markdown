SPEECH NOTES

Around the middle of this year I met up with some Danish Furniture manufacturers who were visiting New Zealand.

They had seen this exhibition in Auckland and they told me about it.

They were impressed by the quality of the designs and potential of the product used by the designers.

How important is that?

If this country wants to lift our living standard back up to the levels of other developed countries, we will do so through design.

Consider this: The United States exported in the Year 2000 the same weight of goods that it exported in the year 1900.

Yet the value of its exports increased several hundred fold.

Selling more of the same did not make the difference.

The difference was the value of creativity and design.

This is a true of our wood processing industry as any.

Wood processing could become our most valuable industry in fifteen years.

That is why the Danish manufacturers who saw this exhibition were here in New Zealand.

But if we want to grow the industry, we are dependent on more innovative products being developed.

Innovative products like designer furniture.

Encouraging our designers to use our wood resource in innovative ways is a good start.

The next step is to find manufacturers with the foresight and commitment to progress these products into markets.

We need distribution channels that target consumers who are prepared to pay for good designer products.

The focus of the government’s work to develop the wood processing industry is to develop an industry that captures customers through our design and high quality manufacturing.

There are many examples of successful businesses that have utilised design and innovation.

One of them – based here in the Hutt – is Formway Furniture.

It is an example of a successful New Zealand furniture manufacturer, whose work has already been exhibited here at the Dowse.

Fisher and Paykel is another example.

Design and innovation take time to convert into viable commercial entities.

It is not easy.

Green Seal is the result of a lot work that was done in Forest Research in the early nineties.

The development of wood hardening techniques has taken time.

I am pleased to see this viable business develop from an idea that began at Forest Research.

I would like to congratulate Carter Holt for developing the product.

And I particularly welcome the success of the students whose work is on display.

I pay tribute also to the Dowse.

The gallery champions the creativity of industry in a unique way.

I believe it reflects the immense creativity of manufacturing in Hutt City.

This is the third time this year I have been fortunate enough to come here for an event celebrating innovation.

It’s not only because I live in a State House round the corner.

In February I came to Seaview for Innovate on the Road.

We gathered some of Wellington’s most innovative businesses to talk about the importance of innovation.

Some were able to talk to us about the innovative ideas they are commercialising.

Then I opened an exhibition of Finnish design here at the Dowse.

Once again we are here to recognise and celebrate the importance of creativity.

I hope it will inspire the region’s manufacturers.

Their success is crucial for our economy.

We have a great deal to celebrate in New Zealand.

Our economy was one of the fastest growing in the developed world over the last four years.

This week, unemployment dropped to 4.4 per cent of the workforce.

Unemployment is lower than it has been since 1987.

We have 61-thousand more jobs than a year ago.

New Zealand has experienced sixteen consecutive quarters of employment growth.

The Pakeha unemployment rate is 3.3 per cent.

The Pacific rate is 6.6 per cent and the Maori rate is under double figures at 9.7 per cent.

The government accounts are in surplus.

Interest rates are relatively low.

We have much to celebrate.

But there is much more to do to secure our future performance as well

Our future will be developed from more design-led innovation.

This exhibition will help to realise that future, and I congratulate everyone involved.
