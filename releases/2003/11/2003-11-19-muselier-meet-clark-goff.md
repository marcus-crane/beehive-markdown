French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Renaud Muselier, will call on Prime Minister Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Phil Goff tomorrow as part of a three-day visit to New Zealand.

Mr Goff said discussions with Mr Muselier would cover a range of issues, with the main focus on the South Pacific. A joint ministerial statement announcing a new project aimed at strengthening public health in the region would also be signed.

“New Zealand and France have a warm relationship and have cooperated successfully in recent years in overseas development assistance to the Pacific. Mr Muselier’s visit provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen our relationship further," Mr Goff said.

During his visit Mr Muselier will visit Auckland's America’s Cup village and attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the War Memorial Museum.

In Wellington he will visit the Randell Writers’ Cottage, established in 2002 as a complement to the Katherine Mansfield Fellowship to Menton in southern France. He will also attend a celebration of the arrival of the new Beaujolais vintage, an important and widely celebrated event on the French wine calendar.

Mr Muselier is one of three French Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs (equivalent to an Associate Minister). His responsibilities include the Asia-Pacific region and the French overseas community. He will be accompanied by MP Philippe Vitel, head of the France-NZ Friendship Group in the National Assembly.
