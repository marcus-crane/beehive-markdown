Mr Speaker, I move that the Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill be now read a second time.

The content of the Bill

This Bill represents the final step in the first five-yearly review of Radio New Zealand’s Charter. As part of a government that has a strong commitment to the principles of public broadcasting, it is a pleasure to bring this Bill back to the House.

Public broadcasting has seen some uncertain times in this country, but right now it is in safe hands. As I said when I addressed the New Zealand Broadcasting Conference back in 1994: “Public broadcasting is above all else driven by an ambition or belief that broadcasting makes a contribution to the health of society and culture.” This government holds strong to that belief and we are working hard to ensure that it is reflected in the reality of public broadcasting.

The Commerce Select Committee was asked to undertake the review of Radio New Zealand’s Charter in December 2000, and the Committee’s report was tabled on 21 December 2001. That report was supportive of the Charter and suggested only a few minor legislative changes to assist Radio New Zealand to engage fully with the spirit of its Charter. The government considered this report and agreed with its recommendations. The proposed amendments were originally drafted for inclusion in the Statutes Amendment Bill (No. 3), but all parties did not support this course of action so the Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill was created instead. That Bill has been referred to the Commerce Select Committee.

It proposes three areas of change to the Charter:

·Firstly, the Bill proposes some changes of wording to incorporate certain concerns raised by submitters during the review of the Charter, which were supported by the Committee. The current Charter requires our public radio broadcaster to provide programmes that contribute to intellectual, scientific and cultural development. This Bill adds spiritual and ethical development to that list. This change recognises that in order to contribute to the health of our society and culture, public broadcasting needs to address these additional dimensions. There is also a new requirement to include programmes for a full range of age groups, designed to ensure that the needs of children are included.

·Radio New Zealand is also required to provide an international radio service to the South Pacific (Radio New Zealand International). Providing this service has been part of Radio New Zealand’s operation for thirteen years and this change to the Charter gives recognition of the importance of this function.

·Finally, Radio New Zealand is required for the first time to survey the views of non-listeners of Radio New Zealand, and to inform the shareholding Ministers of the result of these surveys as part of its annual report.

The purpose of this new requirement is to assist in assessing Radio New Zealand’s performance against its Charter obligations, and to inform future programming decisions that may increase the size of its audience.

Select Committee consideration of the Bill

The Commerce Select Committee called for submissions on the Bill and all submissions received were supportive of the proposed changes.

The Select Committee has not recommended a change to any provisions of the Bill, except to amend the commencement date of the Bill to January 2004.

The Radio New Zealand Act, which incorporates the Radio New Zealand Charter, is a major part of the public broadcasting landscape. The ongoing “maintenance” of the Charter is essential as we keep our sights on what it is designed to achieve.

I want to make special mention of those groups and individuals who took the time to make submissions at the review and on the Bill itself. Your efforts are appreciated.

I am also grateful to the members of the original Commerce Select Committee for their thorough and considered review, and to the members of the current Select Committee for the expeditious way in which they have heard submissions and reported back on this Bill.

Concluding comments

I am aware that this first review of the Charter has been a protracted one. From the first instructions to the Commerce Select Committee in December 2000, it has taken a good two and a half years to get to this stage. Cognisant of the fact these reviews are required every five years, I will be looking at whether the review process can be streamlined.

As a member of a government that believes government does have a role in broadcasting, I look forward to the small but significant changes this legislation will make and the incorporation of these amendments to the Charter.
