Minister of Tourism Mark Burton says that the value film has added to New Zealand’s tourism sector is “difficult to overstate.”

Speaking at a New Zealand Trade and Enterprise function honouring the three New Zealand filmmakers being featured in the BFI London Film Festival, Mark Burton praised New Zealand filmmakers for their role in raising New Zealand’s international profile as a desirable, diverse, and sophisticated destination.

“New Zealand’s filmmakers have been the creative force behind raising New Zealand's profile internationally, in a way that has been unprecedented in the arts. While Whale Rider and The Lord of the Rings trilogy are two outstanding recent examples, there are many others.

“Jane Campion’s The Piano took a uniquely New Zealand story to the world, and won not only the Palme D’or, the top prize at Cannes, but three Oscars—a New Zealand first. Lee Tamahori’s Once Were Warriors, too, commanded the attention of Hollywood, as has the work of Roger Donaldson and Vincent Ward, among others.

“I am delighted that three of our top filmmakers are being featured at such a prestigious film festival: Jane Campion, Gaylene Preston, and Christine Jeffs. The profiling of these talented industry leaders is great news for New Zealand’s international profile.

“Film is one of the world’s most powerful storytelling tools, and perhaps the most powerful medium we have to communicate our stories to the world.

“Just as it has in tourism, this government continues to take an active role in supporting and promoting New Zealand's creative industries—a vital measure to ensure those stories can go on being told to audiences all over the world.”
