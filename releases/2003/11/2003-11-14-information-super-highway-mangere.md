The information super highway will soon be a reality for the 25 students at Ambury Park Centre for Riding Therapy in Mangere, part of the government’s Project Probe (Provincial Broadband Extension).

"The government is spending tens of millions on this project because we believe a major investment in broadband is critical to improving our education system and fostering growth and innovation," said Mangere MP Taito Phillip Field.

ICT is a crucial tool in New Zealand schools. A report last month found ICT is making a difference to quality teaching and learning for students, with two thirds of school principals reporting major improvements to the quality of curriculum delivery in schools.

Taito Phillip Field said schools in more remote areas will now have new learning opportunities with broadband internet. Students will gain access to greater subject choices, and – along with teachers – can take part in video conferencing and quickly access education resources on the internet.

The extension of broadband coverage brings enhanced benefits to rural communities in the form of improved health and social services, access to information and other communication services.

“Just as importantly, local businesses will now have easy access to high-speed internet capability, allowing them to better tackle domestic, national and world markets," said Mr Field.

Project Probe is a crucial infrastructure investment by government to build a strong and confident New Zealand where all communities have the same opportunities in education and business, regardless of location, said Taito Phillip Field.
