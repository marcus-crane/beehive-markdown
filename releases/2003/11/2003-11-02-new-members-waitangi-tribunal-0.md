Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia is pleased to announce three new appointments to the Waitangi Tribunal.

Professor Hirini Moko Mead, Professor Ranginui Walker and Judith Binney have all accepted initial three-year terms to the Tribunal.

"These new members bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise across a variety of areas," said Parekura Horomia.

"Being a member of the Waitangi Tribunal is not an easy task but I believe all of the new members have skills that will be welcomed."

Profiles  
Professor Mead is an eminent social scientist, educationalist and an expert in tikanga Maori. He has held various academic posts and is a council member for Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi, for which he was chairman of the foundation committee. His specialist subjects include Maori development, education, intellectual property, treaty claims and cultural property rights.

Professor Walker is a well-known social commentator, author and educationalist. His books include a biography of Sir Apirana Ngata and a history of New Zealand from a Maori perspective. A former primary school teacher, he has spent 33 years in tertiary education, and since 1997 has been Pro Vice Chancellor (Maori) at Auckland University.

Ms Binney, author of authoritative books on Te Kooti and Rua Kenana, has been a history professor at Auckland University since 1996. She specialises in colonial history and the evolution of the relationship between the Crown and Maori.

The new members join John Baird and Keita Walker who have both been reappointed for a further three years. They replace Judge Richard Kearney, Brian Corban, Dame Augusta Wallace and Areta Koopu, whose terms will continue until the completion of inquiries that they are currently involved in.
