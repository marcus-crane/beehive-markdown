Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Ruth Dyson today welcomed the [report by Child, Youth and Family’s chief social worker](http://www.cyf.govt.nz/news.cfm?news_id=45) into the deaths of Saliel Aplin and Olympia Jetson, and the department’s response.

“It is clear from the report that Child, Youth and Family has policies and procedures in place to safeguard children. However, these were not followed, with tragic consequences. This is not acceptable.”

Ms Dyson stressed the importance of accountability by the department, and welcomed additional measures to ensure that its policies and procedures are followed in all cases.

“When it comes to protecting our children and young people, we cannot accept anything less than the highest standards of social work practice and supervision. The department’s policies and procedures, such as the Risk Estimation Tool and Serious Abuse Team protocol, provide essential checks and balances that must be followed at all times.”

Ruth Dyson said Child, Youth and Family’s response to the baseline review would improve service quality, and provide more support and resources for social workers.

“The department’s immediate priorities are to employ additional front-line social work staff, develop a strategy for managing demand, and give greater support for regional delivery of services.

“Social Workers Registration legislation passed in April will also help to ensure that social workers are competent to practise and accountable for the way they practise.”

Ms Dyson said greater inter-agency cooperation and community responsibility for family violence were also needed to avoid future tragedies.

“Protecting our children and young people is a broad community responsibility. Child, Youth and Family can only work effectively with the support of the wider social services sector, care and protection system, youth justice system and individuals living in our communities. ”
