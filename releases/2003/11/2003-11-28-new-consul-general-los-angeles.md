Career diplomat Rob Taylor is to be New Zealand’s new Consul-General in Los Angeles, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The Los Angeles Consulate General is one of New Zealand's busiest Consulates as it covers the 13 western states of the United States, from Alaska to New Mexico," Mr Goff said.

"The region is one of significant wealth, and is of great importance to New Zealand. It is a world leader in information technology and the creative industries, as well a major market for us. New Zealand's exports to the US are worth $4.3 billion a year, and go predominantly to the western states. California alone accounts for nearly one third of the total.

"One of Mr Taylor’s main jobs will be to protect and promote our economic interests in these states through trade, investment and other exchanges.

"His challenge is to work closely with other government agencies to help generate growth and innovation in New Zealand through international connections to US world leaders in ICT, biotechnology, film, forestry and other knowledge-based industries,” Mr Goff said.

The Consulate, which reports to the New Zealand Embassy in Washington, also incorporates the main North American representatives of Tourism New Zealand, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise.

Mr Taylor is currently Mr Goff's senior private secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade. He was formerly New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Vanuatu and has also served in Samoa, Riyadh and Baghdad.

Mr Taylor takes up his appointment in April 2004, replacing Darryl Dunn who is returning to Wellington.
