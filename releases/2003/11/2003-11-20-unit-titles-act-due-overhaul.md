Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced that the government will review the Unit Titles Act 1972.

“Although this was a recommendation arising out of a 1999 report of the Law Commission, it has been the recent report of the Auckland Regional Council *‘Bodies Corporate and Intensive Housing in Auckland’* that has highlighted the urgency for this work,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The ARC report identified a range of problems concerned with the way body corporates are required to operate under the current legislation. In particular, the report found that this was leading to practical difficulties in getting agreement to the on-going maintenance and effective management of these developments.

“A review of this legislation would normally fall within the Ministry of Justice’s work programme. However pressure on that programme has led me to invite the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) to adopt a lead role in this review.

“This sits very well with the work MED has undertaken on the regulation of the building industry and with the changes set out in the Building Bill, currently before Parliament.

“As we know, many of the problems that have been experienced in the building industry relate to large-scale apartment developments. The problem that the ARC has identified is that the legislation, colloquially referred to in Parliament in 1972 as the ‘Flats Bill’, is no longer adequate for the sophisticated and complex requirements of the modern-day body corporate in one of these developments.

“I am sure that the ARC will be pleased to know that the issue is on the government’s radar screen, and I hope to be in a position to introduce amendments to legislation by the end of next year,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Minister said that this was an important issue for Auckland due to the number and scale of developments in that region however, modernisation of the legislation would be welcomed throughout New Zealand as more and more people choose inner-city living.
