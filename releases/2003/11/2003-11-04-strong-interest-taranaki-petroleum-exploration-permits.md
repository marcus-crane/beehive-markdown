Hon Harry Duynhoven, Associate Minister of Energy, announced today that 23 bids had been received for the 17 blocks on offer in the 2003 onshore Taranaki and offshore North Taranaki bidding round which closed on 31 October.

Mr Duynhoven said that a total of 17 companies had bid for the blocks on offer including four companies new to New Zealand.

"I am pleased with the level of competition for a number of the blocks. This is a reflection on the quality of the acreage on offer and the realisation that the time is right to be exploring for hydrocarbons in New Zealand" said Mr Duynhoven.

The earlier than anticipated wind down of the Maui field and the projected rise in demand for gas for electricity generation is pushing up gas prices. The gas market is fast becoming a sellers market and in the words of one commentator last week "the current environment for explorers in New Zealand is better than at any time in 30 years".

The bidding round included nine offshore blocks and eight onshore blocks covering a total area of 12,772 square kilometres. The offshore blocks are in water depths between 50 and 200 metres extending north from Cape Egmont to an area west of Kawhia Harbour. The onshore blocks are located in an area bound by Cape Egmont to the west, Mt Taranaki to the south and Urenui to the east and are immediately adjacent several producing fields and recent discoveries.

Mr Duynhoven said that the total value of the work programmes bid was close to $200 million. A condition of the blocks offer was that an exploration well must be drilled within four years of the commencement date of the permit although many of the bids received involved well drilling earlier than the four years.

It is expected that an announcement on the successful bids will be made in January.
