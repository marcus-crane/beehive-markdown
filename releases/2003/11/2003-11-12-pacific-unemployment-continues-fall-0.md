Unemployment levels amongst Pacific people are continuing to fall, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment Taito Phillip Field said today.

According to Statistics New Zealand’s Household Labour Force Survey for the September 2003 quarter the official unemployment rate amongst Pacific people stands at 6.6 percent (down 0.5 percentage points).

“Pacific unemployment is at it’s lowest levels in 16 years. Pacific unemployment has not been at this level since March 1987, when the official Pacific unemployment rate was at 5.3 percent.

“Whilst unemployment rates for Pacific peoples have fallen, there is still a need to focus on further reducing Pacific peoples unemployment with a goal to bring the rate among Pacific people down to the national average.

One initiative by the Ministry of Social Development – Work and Income service line that will assist in achieving this goal is the Pacific Wave Strategy. The Pacific Wave Strategy aims to promote an increase in the employment, job retention, earnings and occupational skills of Pacific clients primarily in the Auckland area, as the bulk of Pacific unemployed is situated there.

This in turn will improve the economic position of Pacific families and their communities Taito Phillip Field said today.
