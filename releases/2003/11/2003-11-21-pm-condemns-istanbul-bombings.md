The New Zealand government is shocked and appalled by the cold-blooded and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Istanbul.

Helen Clark condemned the attacks, saying that there can be no tolerance for acts of terrorism. An especially distressing aspect of this outrage in Istanbul is that Turkey is a nation where people of different creeds live in relative harmony, Helen Clark said.

“It is important that the international community continues to work together to counter terrorism. New Zealand will continue to do whatever it can to help.

“Our thoughts first and foremost are with those caught up in this tragedy, and their families, friends, and communities. The government is sending messages of sympathy to the Turkish and British governments, whose people have borne the brunt of this outrage,” Helen Clark said.
