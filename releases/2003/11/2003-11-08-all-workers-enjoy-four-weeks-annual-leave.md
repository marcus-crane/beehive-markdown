Prime Minister Helen Clark today announced that all workers will enjoy at least four weeks leave, taking effect in 2007, enabling families to spend more time together, and workers to have more rest and recreation.

The Prime Minister [told the Labour Party conference](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/?q=node%2F18311) in Christchurch this afternoon that the Labour-Progressive government is to promote amendments to the [Holidays Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=46270953&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B83BD495B%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC) to increase the minimum annual leave entitlement from three to four weeks, effective from 1 April 2007.

Amendments to the Holidays Act are currently before the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee, which is due to be reported back to Parliament by 1 December.

“We believe that four weeks annual leave will be good for New Zealand. By giving 3½ years advance notice of the change, employers, including the government, will have time to plan for the change,” Helen Clark said.

“The extra week is a particular boost for working parents, who will be able to spend more time with their families. This is especially important these days as many people are working longer hours than in the past.

“There is the issue of equity between employees with many, particularly those in white collar managerial positions, already enjoying four weeks leave through their employment agreements, while most manual workers currently miss out.

“Four weeks annual leave is also important if New Zealand is to compete internationally in attracting and retaining skilled people.

“The move will put us on par with many of our major trading partners, like Australia and the United Kingdom, although we will still lag behind many European countries. Australia has had four weeks annual holidays for 30 years, and the United Kingdom introduced a further week in April 1999.

“In the United Kingdom, data covering the period when an increase from three to four weeks leave was introduced showed continued growth in output and a continued increase in productivity. Employment also continued to increase throughout the transition period.”

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said compliance costs will be kept to a minimum by having the extra entitlement take effect on the 1 April date. The date dovetails with the tax year, which is when businesses normally update their pay roll systems.

“The option of phasing in the fourth week of annual leave was rejected because of the compliance costs associated with businesses having to change their pay roll systems several times.

“This is the latest in a series of initiatives supporting employees and their families since Labour came into government. We have increased the minimum wage, introduced paid parental leave, improved health and safety and accident compensation legislation, and brought in fairer labour laws with the Employment Relations Act.

“A key reason for raising the minimum annual leave entitlement is that life has become more hectic and people need adequate rest and time to spend with their families and in their communities,” Margaret Wilson said.
