The Ministry of Justice is holding $6 million in unclaimed reparation but has not yet been able to disburse the money to the victims of crime because many have moved or changed their names, Courts Minister Rick Barker said today.

“The Ministry has $6m in unclaimed reparation sitting in an account, money that we really want to pass on to the victims of crime. The problem is we can’t because we’ve lost contact with a number of victims.

“We’re asking those people owed reparation if they have changed their name or address to let the Ministry know. They may have easily overlooked this but by getting in contact with us now, we’ll be able to tell if we are holding payments for them.”

When a sentence of reparation is imposed, the Ministry of Justice writes to the victim advising them of the Judge’s order of reparation and the process by which it will be paid. The letter asks the victim to advise the Ministry’s Collections Unit if their name or address changes so that reparation can continue to be paid out.

The Ministry went to considerable effort to locate victims and pay reparation to them. A Centralised Processing Unit was recently established to assist collections staff with this task.

However, Mr Barker said the Ministry also relied on victims advising it of any change in personal details.

“The Ministry does its best to locate victims owed reparation but we are very reliant on people keeping in contact with us.

Mr Barker said the Ministry worked hard for the victims of crime and in the last financial year the collection of overdue reparation increased by 25 percent, with $12.28m collected in the year ended 30 June. The amount overdue decreased by $8.6 million, with $21.9 million of overdue reparation unpaid as at 30 June 2003.

“If victims believe that they may have reparation owing or know that their contact details need updating, I urge them to call the Victims’ free phone number 0800 909 909. Alternatively, they can write to or visit the Collections Unit at their local Court.”
