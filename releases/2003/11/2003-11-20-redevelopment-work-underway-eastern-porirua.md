Housing Minister Steve Maharey today helped remove a window, launching the start of a $3.6m project to improve state housing in Eastern Porirua.

The project is part of the Eastern Porirua Community Renewal and involves 25 Housing New Zealand Corporation homes on corner sites on McKillop Street and Champion/Mungavin Streets.

Overall, 14 three-bedroom units will be demolished to make way for new housing and a further 10 three-bedroom units will be redesigned and refurbished. Another unit in a block of four will also be demolished to provide the remaining three with better access to the back yard. Construction is expected to begin in January 2004.

Steve Maharey said this is a significant redevelopment/modernisation project that will improve housing in Eastern Porirua and provide a greater variety of housing.

“We know there is a growing need for large homes for extended families living in Eastern Porirua and also a need for smaller two-bedroom homes for single people and single parent families.

“This project is the first to towards providing a variety of housing to help meet these needs. In some cases, the changes may mean the home is no longer suitable for particular families. In these situations, the tenants will be relocated.”

The refurbishment will include new kitchens, bathrooms and laundries, improved indoor/outdoor living spaces, carparking and landscaping. Similar projects are planned for other areas during the four-year project.

Mana MP Luamanuvao Winnie Laban welcomed the project which will also have a local employment spin-off.

“This community renewal project has, and will continue to create employment opportunities.

“Construction contractors will employ local apprentices through the Porirua Apprenticeship Trust.

“It is also hoped to encourage interest in the building industry as a career by providing on-site work experience for local students,” Winnie Laban said.

Employment Link, a local employment and training information service will also work closely with contractors to provide labour resources.

Homes refurbished in the Eastern Porirua project would be retrofitted with energy efficient products, which would make them warmer and healthier. This is in line with the Corporation’s current programme to insulate all of it’s older properties. Where possible materials will also be recycled in keeping with the Corporation’s environmental policy.
