The Ngati Tama Claims Settlement Bill has been passed by Parliament today.

Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said this event of great significance for the tribe marks the settlement of long-held historical grievances in Taranaki and the beginning of a new era of progress.

Representatives of Ngati Tama were in the House to witness the passage of the Bill and Margaret Wilson encouraged all New Zealanders to read about the iwi's history.

"It tells a sad history, about which some of us have a general awareness, but know little of the detail. It is a history all New Zealanders should be familiar with.

"It makes it clear why there must be restitution and why this nation must persevere with settlements. Everyone benefits if we can build a positive and co-operative future. This settlement will help Ngati Tama move on from the grievance they have carried over the past 150 years and contribute to the growth of the iwi and their community."

This is the second of eight Taranaki settlements, which are in various stages of completion. These include Ngati Ruanui, whose legislation was passed in April, Ngaa Rauru who are scheduled to sign a Deed of Settlement shortly, and Ngati Mutunga and Te Atiawa who have signed Heads of Agreement with the Crown.

Ngati Tama have been in direct negotiations with the Crown since November 1996, when a Deed of Mandate was recognised. A Heads of Agreement was signed in September 1999. A Deed of Settlement, involving financial redress of $14.5 million, and a variety of cultural redress aiming to recognise and protect the interests of Ngati Tama in sites particularly significant to them, was signed in December 2001.

Margaret Wilson said the government was committed to progressing the settlement of valid historical Treaty claims. "There are people who like to criticise the current Treaty settlement process. They forget settlement is a two-way process seeking to restore, and in some instances activate, relationships."
