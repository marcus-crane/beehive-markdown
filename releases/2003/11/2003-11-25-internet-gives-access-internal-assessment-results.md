Online access to this year’s internally assessed NCEA results has been made available for the first time, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“Results from this year’s school assessments for internally assessed standards are now available to students on the New Zealand Qualifications Authority website (www.nzqa.govt.nz). This is the first time internally assessed results have been available before the issue of full results,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This is another benefit from the new NCEA which is designed to be make student achievement more open and transparent for students themselves, their parents and teachers. The website lets students see exactly how they have done in internal assessment.

“The service went live on Friday and over the weekend more than 10,000 level 1 and 2 NCEA candidates checked results. This shows how computer-literate our kids have become, and also how keenly interested they are in how they have performed.

“Letting students see their internally assessed results before the end of the year is a very useful refinement. Internal results have been supplied to NZQA by schools, and if students and schools check and verify results right now, this will further guarantee a smooth process for the January results,” Trevor Mallard said.

Students should get in touch with their school if they believe any internally assessed results are incorrect or missing. Students can also check their results at their school. The results available are for all unit standards and level 1 and 2 internally assessed achievement standards.

Results are expected to be verified by schools by 5 December 2003.

Further information for reporters is available on the “media information” page on the NZQA homepage (www.nzqa.govt.nz) or directly using this link – www.nzqa.govt.nz/news/media-info/index.html. This page will carry information on the examinations, results and statistics until April/May 2004.
