Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard today launched a new health and physical activity resource, which aims to improve the wellbeing of New Zealand children.

The Millennium Institute developed the Health and Physical Activity Resource, which is targeted at children in years seven and eight (ten and eleven year-olds).

It was developed in collaboration with Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC), which reviewed the resource to ensure it met with physical activity best practice.

Trevor Mallard said during the launch at the Millennium Institute that the resource's development and release is timely, as recent statistics from the Ministry of Health and SPARC show childhood obesity increasing and physical activity decreasing.

“With rising levels of childhood obesity and declining rates of physical activity among some young people, the Institute is to be congratulated for developing and distributing the Health and Physical Activity Resource," Trevor Mallard said.

“The challenge of reaching young Kiwis and encouraging them to do more physical activity is a whole-of-community challenge and I applaud the Institute for working collaboratively with SPARC and others in this regard.

"If we really want to make New Zealand one of the most active nations in the world, then we need to start encouraging and educating our young people in healthy lifestyle choices."
