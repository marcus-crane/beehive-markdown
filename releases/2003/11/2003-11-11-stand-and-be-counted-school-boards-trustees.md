Education Minister Trevor Mallard today called for 20,000 volunteers to stand for election as school trustees next year.

Launching this year’s Trustee Elections campaign at Parliament today, Trevor Mallard encouraged people from all communities to consider putting their name forward as a candidate for their school’s board of trustees.

“There are 13,000 trustees to be elected to 2,580 schools around New Zealand. This is a job for any New Zealander with the skills, abilities and commitment to make a difference to our children’s education.

“We want boards of trustees who reflect the diversity of our school communities, so it is important as many people as possible take up the election campaign challenge of standing and being counted for their children,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Hearing past trustees speak about their experiences illustrates that boards have the ability to bring about great change in their schools – and that being a trustee is a challenging and rewarding role.”

In the 14 years since Tomorrow’s Schools was introduced, bringing with it the community governance approach to education, more than 100,000 people have served as school trustees.

“A strong partnership between schools and their community through the board of trustees is crucial to providing children with the best quality education and lifting student achievement,” Trevor Mallard said.

With the end of the school year just around the corner, Trevor Mallard called on school communities to start thinking about the people around them who could stand for election.

“When school starts up again 2004 we need people to be ready to step up to the challenge and stand for our children’s education,” Trevor Mallard said.

Nominations can be made between March 5 – 19, 2004 and polls close on April 2, 2004, with new boards in place by the end of that month.
