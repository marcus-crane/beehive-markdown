Roading projects in Auckland continue to move ahead under the leadership of the Labour-Progressive Government, Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard said today.

“Transit New Zealand has brought forward a number of Auckland roading projects which will benefit the Auckland environment, improve traffic flow and speed up the clearance of traffic snarl-ups,” said Judith Tizard.

“As Aucklanders see every day, there’s a lot of work underway on the region’s roads and public transport corridors. We’ve got years of neglect to catch up on and it has to be carefully managed so that we’re not actually adding to congestion while we’re trying to solve Auckland’s traffic problems.

“The completion of projects such as the Wellesley Street Bridge gives Aucklanders welcome evidence that progress is at last being made.

“But the work is not just about completing roads. The work that Transit is bringing forward involves significant traffic management and environmental projects that have to go alongside major construction.”

Almost $24 million of work to be brought forward includes:  
·extending Transit’s advanced traffic management systems so that congestion can be better monitored through the network of closed circuit television cameras  
·upgrading stormwater run-off from the Auckland Harbour Bridge which will bring an end to untreated discharge running into the Waitemata Harbour  
·beginning investigation work on adding bus lanes to the shoulders of Auckland motorways.

Judith Tizard said the imminent passing of the Land Transport Management Bill would provide important tools for improving Auckland’s – and New Zealand’s – transport system.

“We also have a team of hard-working officials from central and local government who are working on strategic and funding solutions to transport issues in the Auckland region. This Joint Officials Group will be reporting to Ministers and Mayors next month.

“I’m delighted that National has finally recognised the need for Auckland to be a strong, confident and sustainable contributor to New Zealand, by appointing an honest Auckland-based leader. Hopefully his cooperation will see the Land Transport Management Bill pass smoothly so that we can all get on with improving the nation’s transport system for the benefit of all New Zealanders.”
