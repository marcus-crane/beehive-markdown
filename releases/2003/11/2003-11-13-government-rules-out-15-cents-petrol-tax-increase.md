Transport Minister Paul Swain has ruled out a 15 cents per litre petrol tax increase.

Mr Swain was responding to reports this morning that the option is among measures being considered by the government to solve Auckland's transport problems.

"While the government is looking at a range of options as part of its Auckland work, a 15 cents per litre petrol tax increase is out of the question, it is simply not acceptable," says Mr Swain.

Mr Swain says on December 12 there will be a joint announcement by central and local government on funding solutions for Auckland transport problems.
