Unemployment levels among Pacific people are continuing to fall faster than national figures, Pacific Island Affairs Minister Phil Goff said today.

Figures released today show unemployment for Pacific people at 6.6 percent for the year ended September 30, a drop of 0.5 percent for the quarter. National unemployment fell 0.3 percent over the same period to 4.4 percent, the lowest level since 1987.

"Unemployment among Pacific people in New Zealand is now well under half the 15 percent level it was when the Labour-led Government took office in 1999," Mr Goff said.

"This continuing decline is a reflection of the on-going strength of the New Zealand economy and the Government's commitment to assisting all Pacific people to reach their full potential.

"The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs is working closely with employment agencies such as Work and Income on initiatives such the nationwide Value Jobs programme and local projects such as Pacific Aim High to Employment (Pate) in Porirua, and the Hoppe (Help Our Pacific People Excel) in Mangere.

"Over 25 percent of job-seekers on the Value Jobs programme now have jobs with employers targeted by the initiative and another 32 percent are working with other employers.

"The latest figures are very encouraging. However the challenge ahead must be to bring the unemployment rate among Pacific people down to the national average," Mr Goff said.
