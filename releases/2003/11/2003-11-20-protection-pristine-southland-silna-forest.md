Conservation Minister Chris Carter and Parliamentary Undersecretary for Conservation Mita Ririnui announced today that the Nature Heritage Fund has negotiated protection of 230 hectares of Southland native forest under the Government’s SILNA conservation policy.

“This is a very exciting settlement, preserving pristine areas of indigenous forest in the remote scenic West Rowallan area, west of Te Waewae Bay in Southland,” said Mr Carter.

The land forms part of about 57,000 hectares given to 4,000 named Maori identified as having insufficient land to support themselves in the South Island Landless Natives Act 1906. Descendants of those Maori still own the land, much of which is native forest. About 5,000 hectares of it has particular conservation value, including the 230 hectares protected today.

“We are very grateful to the Orbell family who have ensured that the natural qualities of their land are preserved not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of the public of New Zealand,” said Mr Carter.

“The Orbell owners have resisted logging the land from the 1930s up to the present day.”

Representing the family, Mr Peter Orbell said: “I am particularly pleased to have been able to fulfil the wishes of my tipuna who quite clearly wanted these beautiful forests preserved for all of us while at the same time maintaining our tino rangatiratanga intact.”

Covered in dense podocarp and silver beech forest these coastal sections provide high quality habitat for indigenous forest birds. They lie upon a series of uplifted marine terraces, one of the most well-preserved of its type in New Zealand. They are traversed by the South Coast Track that links up with the new Hump Ridge Track.

“Both the owners and the Crown acknowledge that the land has significant cultural and historical value and is taonga to the owners,” said Mr Ririnui.

“Through the protection of a conservation covenant the family have ensured that the forest will be preserved in perpetuity and its Maori identity retained.”

Mr Orbell said: “Between us we have achieved our joint objective – the preservation of these two ancient forests, rich in history, cultural significance and natural beauty. Kuaha ki Waitutu - the Gateway to Waitutu. They constitute a taonga - a treasure to all New Zealanders and are now in safekeeping for future generations.”

Last year the Government set aside $16.1m over seven years for the Nature Heritage Fund to use to negotiate conservation settlements over some of the SILNA land. Two significant blocks of pristine forest have now been protected in perpetuity without the owners losing title to their land.
