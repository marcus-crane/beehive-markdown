A new state primary school will be established at Kyle Road, Albany to meet population growth in the Albany and Greenhithe areas, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“The decision to establish a new contributing school, for students from new entrants to year 6, follows consultation with existing schools and the local community,” Trevor Mallard said.

“There has been much interest in the new school and I’d like to thank the Albany and Greenhithe parents, boards of trustees, local groups and members of the community who participated in the consultation process.”

This new school, scheduled to open at the beginning of 2005, is being established to take pressure off neighbouring schools, especially Albany and Greenhithe Schools.

Trevor Mallard said nominations for the establishment board of trustees were sought from schools, early childhood centres, residents, community groups and North Shore City Council. Five local residents have been appointed to the establishment board.

They are Adrienne Bell, Micheal Clague, June Kent, Natalie Smith and Maggie Twaddle.

“These board members have a range of skills and experience and will be instrumental in developing this new school to meet the needs of the local community,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The establishment board will appoint the principal and staff, determine school policy, establish governance practices and influence school design. It will be in place until an elected board takes over. School elections are likely to be held within about six months of the new school opening.
