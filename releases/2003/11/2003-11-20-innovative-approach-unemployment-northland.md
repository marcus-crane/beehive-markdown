At least twenty more Northland people have the prospect of permanent employment in the tourism industry thanks to a joint initiative between the Minister for Economic Development Hon Jim Anderton and the Minister for Social Development Hon Steve Maharey.

"The Northland region has consistently returned the highest unemployment figures in New Zealand. We could not let that continue. Innovative approaches to achieve solutions need to be tried," said Jim Anderton.

The Ministers decided to pilot a new approach.

Employers in the tourism industry were asked to identify the skills people needed to fill current vacancies.

Possible candidates for the jobs were identified from unemployment data and the employers interviewed them. Where the candidates did not have all the skills required for the job, the Ministry of Social Development undertook to provide the training necessary to bring them up to the required standards.

"The potential employees therefore had a guarantee of a job as soon as they reached the required standards. That guarantee was a real impetus for them to make the grade in the industry", said Mr Anderton.

To date 20 people are in the programme, many have already started work. In addition to skills training they also receive workplace mentoring and professional support.

The employers are delighted that they can fill vacancies with staff who are motivated because they see a future for themselves in tourism. Major tourism operators, including Copthorne, Beachcombers, and Scenic Circle as well as a number of smaller operators are involved.

"We chose the tourism sector because it is a major contributor to Northland’s economy," said Hon Steve Maharey.

Tourism contributed $558 million to Northland’s economy in 2001 and directly employed one in nine Northlanders. Tourism is also at the heart of the region’s Major Regional Initiative that recently received $2.0 million from the government.

The Ministers are now looking to extend the pilot scheme to other Northland industry sectors - such as construction, forestry and marine, and may consider using the Northland model in other regions.

The Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Economic Development, Te Puni Kokiri, the Tertiary Education Commission, and Enterprise Northland are responsible for managing this pilot programme.
