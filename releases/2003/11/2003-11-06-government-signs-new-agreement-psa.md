Prime Minister Helen Clark and the PSA President Ian Bamber today signed a new Partnership for Quality Agreement, reflecting a commitment by the government and the union to work together on public service issues.

The government and the Public Service Association (PSA) first signed a Partnership for Quality Agreement in May 2000. State Services Minister Trevor Mallard and the PSA recently reviewed the agreement.

“The renewed partnership agreement reflects a continuing commitment by the PSA and the government to work together to develop a strong, modern and innovative public service that is highly successful for both citizens and public servants,” Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard said.

“The Partnership for Quality is a ground breaking initiative that has generated benefits for both the government and PSA members.

“The positive working relationship we have means workers are collectively participating in the management of their workplaces, making concrete contributions to the improved delivery of government services to the public,” they said.

The agreement encourages employers, managers and the PSA to establish co-operative and open relationships, and to work together to improve the effectiveness of departments and agencies and their ability to provide quality services for New Zealanders.  
Under the agreement, the government and the PSA have agreed to a work programme which includes completing and implementing Review of the Centre projects, and scoping options for promoting partnership.
