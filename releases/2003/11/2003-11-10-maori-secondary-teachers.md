Maori secondary teachers are set to improve the quality of their teaching by reducing workload stress according to Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia.

These findings are contained in an independent survey carried out by the New Zealand Council of Educational Research. Their 2003 report indicates *Te Hiringa I te Mahara* continues to be an effective intervention for Maori secondary teachers.

*Te Hiringa I te Mahara* aims to address the stresses associated with the excessive workload of Maori secondary school teachers, in particular te reo Maori teachers.

"Over the past five years, the development and refinement of this programme has enabled Maori secondary teachers to approach their work efficiently and effectively, to build their confidence and capability, and develop their professionalism and career pathways, said Parekura Horomia.

"It is also important to note that participants believe Te Hiringa I te Mahara has made a positive contribution to reducing work associated stress.

"This latest survey also shows an important shift in priorities for Maori secondary teachers from pastoral care to curriculum matters," said Parekura Horomia.

Other findings include:

- *Te Hiringa i te Mahara* maintains teacher participation in professional development activities.
- Over a third of teachers believed that *Te Hiringa i te Mahara* had a major positive impact on the quality of their teaching.
- The Information Communication Technologies (ICT) professional development programme filled a significant gap in the professional development of Mäori secondary teachers.

"This evaluation demonstrates *Te Hiringa i te Mahara* - The Power of the Mind - is an effective intervention for Maori secondary teachers," said Parekura Horomia.
