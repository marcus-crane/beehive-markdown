Proposals to reduce the tax barriers to international recruitment are set out in a government [discussion document](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/files/html/reducingtaxbarriers/index.html) released today by Revenue Minister Michael Cullen and Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe.

“The idea is to benefit New Zealand businesses recruiting overseas workers,” the Ministers said. “Reducing some tax costs for those workers will make it more likely that New Zealand businesses can hire the best people for the job, at the right price.

“The government is proposing a temporary exemption from New Zealand income tax on the overseas income of people who come here to work as employees, whether they are foreigners or expatriates who have been non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes for ten years.

“It would be targeted at people coming to work as employees, and would not be available to those coming to retire or start up their own businesses.

“Whether it would apply to all income from overseas investments and property or limited to a few types of income is yet to be decided.”

The discussion document, “Reducing tax barriers to international recruitment to New Zealand”, is published at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz and www.treasury.govt.nz. The closing date for submissions is 19 December.
