The five members of the establishment board of trustees for a new state primary school at Baverstock Road, Flat Bush, Manukau were announced today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

"I am pleased to appoint Chris Day, Sonya Eastlake, Jason Ghezzi, Michael Leach and Shelley Smithies to the board," Trevor Mallard said.

“These high calibre board members have been chosen for their skills and experience and I’m sure they will support the school in meeting the needs and aspirations of the local community.

"Board nominations came from 15 local schools, early childhood centres, residents, community groups, the Manukau City Council and local iwi."

Trevor Mallard said the establishment board appoints the principal and other staff, as well as determining school policy, sound governance practices and contributing to the school design.

"This board will be in place until the elected board takes over. School elections are likely to be held within six months of the school opening at the beginning of 2005.

"Baverstock Road School will meet increasing population growth in the Flat Bush area."
