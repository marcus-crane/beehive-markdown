Tony Ryall has a poor grasp of the new child sex offender legislation if he thinks offenders have to agree to have 24-hour, seven-day supervision, Justice Minister Phil Goff said today.

"The Bill does allow for 24-hour supervision of high-risk child sex offenders," Mr Goff said.

"It inserts into the Parole Act 2002 a new section (s.107I) that provides for the Parole Board to impose special conditions, including requiring a person to reside at a specific address at which another person (ie, a supervisor) could also reside or be present for 24 hours a day, and be subject to standard detention conditions.

"This provision quite clearly allows 24-hour, seven-day supervision where it is deemed necessary.

"Contrary to Mr Ryall's assertions, there is also nothing to stop an offender from being under a supervision order for the full 10 years. If an offender continues to be assessed as posing a risk of re-offending, the supervision will remain in place," Mr Goff said.
