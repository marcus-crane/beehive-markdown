Health Minister Annette King has announced a new deputy chair for Southland District Health Board, and three other new DHB board appointments.

Ms King said she welcomed the appointment of Lesley Soper as deputy chair in Southland, and the appointments of Karen Guilliland (Canterbury DHB), Dr Gail Tipa (Otago DHB) and Keith Hindle (Hutt DHB).

“Ms Soper has played an important role at Southland DHB since her election as a board member in 2001,” Ms King said. She is taking over the deputy role following the death of Keith Kennedy last year.

Ms Guilliland is chief executive of the New Zealand College of Midwives. She has had varied roles and responsibilities within the health sector over the last 30 years. She will be able to use this experience combined with that from her previous board membership of Canterbury Area Health Board and current membership of the Pharmac board.

Dr Tipa has an extensive environmental planning and consultancy background. Her governance experience includes current roles as a representative of Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu and as a director of both the Ngai Tahu Development Corporation and Timberlands West Coast.

Mr Hindle retired recently from his position as chief executive of KPMG Legal in Wellington. In this role and in his previous position with Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co, he gained considerable experience in both business development and financial management.

“I am very pleased to be able to make these appointments. They all bring substantial governance experience to their boards and have contributed extensively in their local communities in other areas. I look forward to working with them and their boards to improve the health of people in their districts.”
