Education Minister Trevor Mallard has appointed four new members to the board of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

The new members are: Tracey Bridges, a partner in public relations firm Senate Communications; Peter Chrisp, chief executive of Norske-Skog Tasman Ltd; Angela Foulkes, former secretary of the Council of Trade Unions and now an independent consultant; and Graeme McNally, former Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at the University of Canterbury and a partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

All new members have been appointed for a four-year term.

"I am delighted with the make up of the new board and have every confidence that it will successfully guide the Qualifications Authority through a process of strengthening its operating systems and its capacity," Trevor Mallard said.

“This is a dynamic group of people who bring a passion for education as well as enormous experience at a governance and strategic level.

“We now have a great deal of financial management experience at board level, which will ensure the Qualifications Authority remains as cost effective as possible.

“Many of the members have been intensively involved in workplace literacy and industry training programmes and they are committed to making New Zealand a place of life-long learning,” Trevor Mallard said.

Dr Graeme Fraser was announced as board chair earlier this year.

Tina Olsen-Ratana, manager of Kokiri Marae Keriana Olsen Trust, a private training establishment based in the Hutt Valley, has been re-appointed to the board for a further four-year term.
