A significant step in the government’s strategy of boosting student achievement through quality teaching was announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard today.

“I am announcing today a raft of ground-breaking research projects that will be undertaken through partnerships between education research experts and teachers around the country.

“Our aim is to find out what works in terms of lifting student achievement, and then to apply those lessons in the real world so students do actually enjoy the benefits.

"These new projects have been selected through the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative and will be an important part of our work in the early childhood, school and tertiary sectors.

“They’ll be a welcome addition to New Zealand’s existing educational research, and will be a rich resource for teachers," Trevor Mallard said.

“The initiative is part of the government’s investment in education and educational research, and reflects our commitment to significantly improve educational achievement through quality teaching.

“Through these projects we can build on teaching and learning knowledge by enhancing the links between educational research and teaching practices.

"Evidence from this research will be used to inform and make a difference to educational practice. All 13 projects selected in this first round are based on partnerships between researchers and teachers to ensure the outcomes are relevant, practical and usable.”

Trevor Mallard said the 13 projects to receive the new funding were selected from 180 expressions of interest.

“The strongly contested and rigorous process to select the final 13 reflects the depth of interest in educational research."

The New Zealand Council of Educational Research has been contracted to manage the programme on behalf of the Ministry of Education. A team of specialists in key areas of educational research will manage the initiative and assist the researchers.

A $1 million annual fund is available for this research, and funding for the 13 projects is expected to begin before the end of the year. There will be a call for expressions of interest for the second year of funding in May 2004.

Short descriptions of the 13 successful research projects are attached.

BACKGROUND TO TEACHING & LEARNING RESEARCH INITIATIVE

In May 2002 the government established the Teaching and Learning Research Initiative (TLRI) programme to build knowledge about teaching and learning which in turn will lead to significantly improved outcomes for learners. Research undertaken in all areas of the education sector, from early childhood centres to industry training organisations, kura and wänanga, is eligible for funding under the Initiative.

To enhance the potential of the research findings to inform practice, the Initiative emphasises partnerships between researchers and practitioners, with this approach expected at all stages of the process from the research design to communicating the results to teachers and other educators.

The project priorities determine there must be demonstrable strategic, research and practice value based on six principles:  
\-the research will address themes of strategic importance to education in New Zealand;  
\-it will draw on related overseas work and build upon New Zealand-based research evidence;  
\-the research will address strategic themes and be forward looking;  
\-the project design will to enable substantive and robust findings;  
\-the research will recognise the central role of the teacher in learning; and  
\-the projects will be undertaken as a partnership between researchers and practitioners.

Three levels of funding were available under the scheme:  
\-A - large-scale projects (maximum $400,000) of up to three years with a $150,000 maximum for any project in the first year.  
\-B - medium-scale projects (maximum $180,000) of up to two years with a cap of $90,000 for any project in any one year.  
\-C - small-scale projects ($15,000–$30,000) often with an emphasis on practitioner-driven, researcher-supported projects.

The programme has annual funding for three years of $1 million, although funding for projects of more than one year is conditional upon continued government funding of the TLRI and on satisfactory performance during the first funding cycle.
