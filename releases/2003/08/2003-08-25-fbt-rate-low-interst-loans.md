FBT rate for low-interest loans down

The prescribed rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest, employment-related loans has dropped from 7.74 per cent to 7.33 per cent, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The new rate applies from 1 July 2003.

The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the results of the Reserve Bank’s regular survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from 1 April 2003.
