Wellingtonian David Oughton has been appointed to the Remuneration Authority for a three-year term, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson announced today.

He replaces Ross Mulholland who has served on the authority since 1998. The two other authority members are Hutton Peacock (Chair) and Beverley Wakem.

David Oughton retired as Secretary for Justice in July 1994 after more than 40 years in the public service. Since then he has undertaken a broad range of consultancy, advisory and investigatory work for a number of government agencies both here and in the Pacific.

David Oughton has also been active in his local Porirua community where he is currently Chairman of the Porirua House Trust, and a Trustee of both He Huarahi Tamariki Trust and Whitieria Community Law Centre.

Margaret Wilson said David Oughton has the right mix of skills and experience for his new role on the authority.

“His broad public sector career included experience with state sector wage fixing practices over a 30-year period,” she said.
