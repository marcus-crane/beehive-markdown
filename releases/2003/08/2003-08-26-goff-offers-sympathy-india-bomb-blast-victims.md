Foreign Minister Phil Goff today extended his sympathy to the families of victims caught in two bomb blasts that killed at least 46 people and injured over 100 in Mumbai, India.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts. One was close to the Gateway of India monument, a popular tourist site, and the other was at the crowded Zaveri Bazaar bullion market near a popular Hindu temple.

"I condemn the perpetrators of these acts, which seemed designed to cause maximum civilian casualties," Mr Goff said.

"The blasts, apparently from bombs planted in taxis, appear to have been coordinated and were detonated in crowded areas in the middle of the day. The result has been devastating.

"At this stage we are not aware of any New Zealanders injured or killed by the blasts.

"High Commission staff in New Delhi have made contact with all but two of the 19 New Zealanders registered as living in Mumbai, and our Honorary Consul there has been keeping in close contact with local authorities. No New Zealanders are believed to be staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel, opposite the Gateway monument.

"New Zealand extends its support to Indian authorities in their on-going efforts to combat terrorism, and to bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice," Mr Goff said.
