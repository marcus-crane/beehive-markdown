Education Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the final decisions on the review of schools in Mosgiel and the wider Taieri area which is aimed at ensuring local students continue to receive quality education well into the future.

“This review has been notable for its rigorous level of debate. I have been impressed and heartened by the contribution of schools and their communities to this debate and thank all those involved in the process,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I believe I have received complete and accurate information on which to base my final decisions and am confident that these decisions will form the basis for a strong and sustainable schooling system in the Taieri and Mosgiel area.

“I now hope that schools and their communities will put their energy into working towards the best use of the resources that the review will release. This re-organisation of schools is about ensuring local students continue to receive quality education well into the future.

“Using current estimates, $3 million in educational development funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements. There will be a fund of around $865,000 for schools to use jointly, and $4.5 million of extra property funding will be available,” Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
·The merger of The Taieri High School and Mosgiel Intermediate School to create a Year 7 to 15 school on The Taieri High School site, with Mosgiel Intermediate being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Arthur Burns, Reid Park and North Taieri Schools on the present Mosgiel Intermediate site to create a contributing primary school with Arthur Burns School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Melville Park, Mosgiel West and Wyllies Crossing Schools on the Mosgiel West site to create a contributing primary school with Mosgiel West School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of East Taieri and Allanton Schools on the East Taieri site to create a contributing primary school with East Taieri School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Henley, Momona and Outram Schools to create a full primary school on the Outram site with Outram School being the continuing school;  
·The retention of Lee Stream and Waihola Districts Schools on their present sites as full primary schools.

The board of each continuing school will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held. There will however be secondments from each of the merging schools to the boards.

In addition Trevor Mallard has asked the Ministry of Education to work with the Dunedin City Council to address concerns raised over the traffic safety issue relating to Factory Road. This will involve a financial contribution from the ministry to the changes that will be necessary.

“Some schools including Reid Park School also have innovative social service programmes and good relationships with their communities.

“The ministry will place an emphasis on the maintenance and development of these programmes and relationships during the transition.

“The changes are expected to be effective from the start of the 2004 school year. If the property changes take longer, then the current sites will continue to be used for a short time if necessary,” Trevor Mallard said.
