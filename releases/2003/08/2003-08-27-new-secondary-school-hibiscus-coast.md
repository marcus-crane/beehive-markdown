A new secondary school for years 7 to 13 will be established at Stanmore Bay, Whangaparaoa to meet increasing population growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The school is scheduled to open at the beginning of 2005.

The decision to establish a secondary school, for students from year 7 to year 13, follows consultation with existing schools and the local community.

“I’d like to thank all parents, the boards of trustees and Hibiscus Coast residents who participated in the consultation process. I have carefully considered all your views and believe the establishment of this school will be welcomed by parents in the area,” Trevor Mallard said.

The school is being established to cater for the continued population growth throughout the region and will ultimately be able to accommodate 2,200 students. The existing Hibiscus Coast Intermediate will be amalgamated with the new school to enable the years 7 to 13 school to function as a single entity from day one.

Five people have been appointed to the establishment board of trustees: Barbara Anderson, John Cooper, Annie Lloyd, Kevin Raynes, and Bruce Shadbolt.

“Nominations for the establishment board were sought from a range of parties including local schools, early childhood centres, residents, community groups and the Rodney District Council. Board members were chosen because of their high-level skills and background. I am pleased that I have been able to appoint Hibiscus Coast residents, to ensure the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community,” Trevor Mallard said.

The establishment board will appoint the principal and other staff, as well as determining school policy and sound governance practices, and contributing to the school design. It will be in place until an elected board can take over. School elections are likely to be held within six months of the school opening.
