Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that his proposal for a re-organisation of Turangi schools had been supported by affected boards of trustees and was now likely to go ahead.

“I have been impressed by the positive and professional attitude of the schools involved and especially their principals. With the level of support shown by Tuwharetoa, the local community and schools and with the extra $1.65 million that the review will release, I am confident that Turangi schools can begin a new era and look forward to a strong and sustainable future,” Trevor Mallard said.

Under the proposal and using current estimates, an extra $926,000 in operational funding will be available to schools. There will be a fund of $264,000 for schools to use jointly, and $459,000 of extra property funding.

“This review will improve local education by bringing it into line with the needs of the Turangi community, and making it more responsive to Maori. It will also ensure that local students continue to receive quality education well into the future,” Trevor Mallard said.

Proposals under the review are:  
·To close Hirangi, Turangi, Tongariro High and Tauranga Taupo Schools and establish a single Year 1 – 15 composite school on the Tongariro High School site;  
·To establish a new Wharekura for Year 1 – 13 students who wish to receive their education in te reo Maori, on the Hirangi School site; and  
·To retain Kuratau School as an autonomous full primary school.

The boards of trustees from the schools involved in closures now have 28 days to comment on this announcement.

Trevor Mallard expects to make his final decisions in September. The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to ensure a smooth transition and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
