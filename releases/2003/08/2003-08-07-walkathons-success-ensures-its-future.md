This year's Project K Weet-Bix Kiwi Kids Walkathon raised more than $140,000 for the 376 schools involved and youth charity Project K.

Sports and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard and Project K founder Graeme Dingle congratulated the schools, teachers, kids and communities for their contribution and enthusiasm for the scheme.

"Not only have these kids achieved something material for their schools, they have also learnt about responsibility, the benefits of being physically active and took positive steps to make their communities healthier. They should be really proud of their efforts," Trevor Mallard said.

Graeme Dingle says the Walkathon will be held again next year following the  
success of the inaugural event.

"Getting about 62,000 kids involved in the first year was a real stunner.  
The Walkathon fits with all of Project K's goals: helping kids be fitter and  
healthier and more motivated. Its great strength is that it's more than a Walkathon; it's a five-week health and fitness programme."

The Project K Weet-Bix Kiwi Kids Walkathon is a community-based fundraising event for youth charity Project K, aimed at encouraging New Zealand primary and intermediate school children to lead more active lifestyles.

For five weeks between April and June, 376 primary and intermediate schools throughout New Zealand implemented curriculum-based, health and physical education units, concluding with a walkathon on June 4 to raise money for their school and Project K.

Half of the money raised will be rebated back to the schools and the other half will go to Project K in those regions.

“Active and healthy kids make better learners in the classroom, and if children become more active in their younger years, they are likely to be more active and lead healthier lifestyles later in life as well," Trevor Mallard said.

Graeme Dingle says the support and effort from sponsors, particularly  
Sanitarium and Weet-Bix, and the many individuals involved was vital to the Walkathon's success, as it will be again next year.
