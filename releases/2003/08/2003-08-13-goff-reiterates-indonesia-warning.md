The risk of further terrorist attacks in Indonesia remains high and New Zealanders should avoid hotels and other places frequented by Westerners, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

“We continue to receive reports that terrorist groups in Indonesia are planning attacks. Those attacks could occur anywhere, at any time, and may well target places that are popular with Westerners, such as international hotels and shopping centres,” Mr Goff said.

“In light of those reports, our ambassador in Jakarta has written to all New Zealanders registered with the Embassy, warning them of the continuing high risk of attack.

“The letter notes that Indonesian police have reportedly seized a list of terrorist targets and that they believe a group of suicide bombers exists in the country. Police have also been reported as saying that there are sizable quantities of unaccounted-for explosive material in Jakarta.

“New Zealanders in Indonesia, and anyone thinking of travelling there, should take the implications of those reports seriously.

“The Ambassador’s letter also reiterates New Zealand’s current travel advice, which was updated in the wake of last week’s hotel bomb blast in Jakarta.

“That advice continues to warns against tourist and other non-essential travel to Indonesia, and notes that Jakarta is likely to be a particular focus for potential terrorist activity.

“It also warns New Zealanders to avoid places where Westerners are known to gather, such as hotels, clubs, shopping centres, and tourist attractions,” Mr Goff said.
