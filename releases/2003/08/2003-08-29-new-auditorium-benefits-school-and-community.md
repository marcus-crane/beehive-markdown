New buildings at Pakuranga's Elm Park School will make a big difference to the daily lives of students, staff and community, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

Trevor Mallard was at the school to officially open the auditorium and administration building, worth more than $1.1 million, and funded jointly by the Ministry of Education and the school.

“Elm Park is a school on the move – it is clear that a lot is happening here. I understand the building will be used by the community, and it is great to share an asset like this,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard acknowledged the work of the many people involved in turning a dream into a reality in a short space of time.

“The auditorium allows aspects of the arts curriculum to be taught in a purpose built space,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Last year Elm Park held a school-wide art exhibition and art continues to be centre stage at the school, with an Art Expo opening a few weeks ago.

"The arts have a vital place in education and are central to the development of innovative, creative, literate and critical-thinking New Zealanders."

Trevor Mallard applauded the school for its mission of empowering all learners to achieve their personal best.

"One of this government's top education priorities is to create an all-inclusive education system that helps students achieve to their full potential. Elm Park School aim of meeting all students’ needs on an individual basis is admirable. The school is a mini United Nations, with 36 cultural groups represented within the mainstream.

“The school has established networks of support, and teachers who are skilled and experienced in meeting the needs of multi-cultural students and their families," Trevor Mallard said.
