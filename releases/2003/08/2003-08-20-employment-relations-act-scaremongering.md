Labour Minister Margaret Wilson says opponents to minimum employment standards are doing their usual scaremongering.

The Government has consistently said there will be no return to compulsory unionism or to the national awards system, nor will employees right to choose between individual or collective employment be undermined.

The Government has been conducting a review of the Employment Relations Act to see how well the law is achieving its aim, which is to promote rather than simply permit collective bargaining.

The review process is coming to a close, and when it is finished amendments to the Employment Relations Act will be introduced to parliament.

This is unlikely to happen before October, as the Government will first be consulting with social partners, Business New Zealand and the Council of Trade Unions, on the proposals.

The Employment Relations Act builds and maintains productive employment relationships, as part of a broader strategy for a more productive and equitable society and economy.  
Margaret Wilson’s speech today to the Employment Law Institute said fair and productive employment relationships are an essential ingredient in developing a more innovative economy and protecting the more vulnerable members of society.

“Good employment relationships between employers, employees and unions make good business sense. They can be a source of competitive advantage, support innovation, improve productivity, attract talented workers, and encourage skill development in the workforce,” Margaret Wilson said.
