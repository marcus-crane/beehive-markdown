Government recognition of the key importance to educational success of information & communication technology (ICT) has seen $697,880 provided for ICT programmes in Mangere electorate schools.

Mangere MP, Taito Phillip Field said ICT is an incredible tool for learning and ICT skills are essential for work and for life in the modern world.

“This government is developing IT and infrastructure – so students and teachers can take advantage of the vast opportunities that exist online,” Mr Field said.

ICT initiatives, costing an estimated total of $697,880 over three years, are now in place in Mangere – including a project to supply laptops to all of New Zealand's 2700-plus principals, already completed ahead of schedule.

"Students and teachers need well-informed, and effective leadership, and that’s why we’ve equipped all 28 principals in Mangere with the benefits of mobile computing," Mr Field said.

Also, the laptops for secondary teachers programme, has already supplied six Mangere teachers. Budget 2003 extended it to include teachers in years 7-8, who can now also lease a laptop through their school, with the government meeting two-thirds of the cost.

The expansion of the ICT professional development cluster programme was another feature of Budget 2003. There will be 40 new clusters and up to 400 new schools involved in the programme in 2004, adding to the 94 clusters and 800 schools involved nationwide since 1999. In Mangere this programme is lead by Viscount School.
