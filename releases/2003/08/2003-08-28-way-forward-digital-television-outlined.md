The government is to invite industry to establish a group to plan for the roll-out of digital television in New Zealand, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Minister of Communications David Cunliffe said today.

It is inevitable that New Zealand broadcasters will migrate from the current analogue television to digital television in the future because of technological change and the age of existing equipment – although there is a need for a viable business plan to enable the rollout of free-to-air digital television.

Steve Maharey said decisions taken by the government ensure New Zealand broadcasters will be able to learn from digital television developments in other countries and will ensure that they are able to migrate to the new technology in the most cost-effective way to the benefit of consumers.

“Digital television is able to provide viewers with more programmes, interactivity and better picture quality than traditional analogue broadcasting – but no broadcaster has yet developed a business plan to roll-out free-to-air digital television in this country.

“Without a broad industry consensus, digital terrestrial television is unlikely to go anywhere very quickly. The government is enlisting the industry to work together to develop such a business case. A viable business model is an essential part of any investment in a platform to roll-out digital television.

“Planning for digital television was put on hold at the end of the 1990s, a decision now widely acknowledged within the industry to have been the right one. It’s now a good time to be working on this issue because we are able to take account of overseas experience, such as the development of the United Kingdom's free-to-air digital terrestrial platform,” Steve Maharey said.

David Cunliffe said the government has decided on how digital television spectrum should be allocated and wants to work with broadcasters on the most effective way of developing a digital television platform.

“Digital television can be provided in a number of ways, including satellite and terrestrial or land-based transmission.

“To help industry plan for digital terrestrial television, we have agreed in principle to an allocation plan for the necessary broadcasting spectrum.

"Actual allocation of spectrum will occur following further consideration of demand and industry developments. We will also make some changes to management of the spectrum used for satellite television to increase the available capacity.

"We will continue to make spectrum available for testing of digital terrestrial services, and we will also allow holders of existing licences the ability to swap those licences for digital ones at no extra cost. This puts conversion to digital within reach of some existing broadcasters,” David Cunliffe said.

Steve Maharey said public broadcasters such as TVNZ will be invited to plan for the provision of digital content. In addition, interested parties will be contacted over the next few months and invited to establish a digital television group.

Terrestrial analogue coverage will continue for the foreseeable future. TVNZ terrestrial transmission to remote areas, previously a NZ On Air responsibility, will now be maintained through a direct subsidy to TVNZ.
