A rail safety programme for children has been praised by Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard.

*Tracks are for Trains*, a nationwide safety education programme aimed at children aged eight to 11 years, was launched today at Ngaruawahia Primary School.

“Tranz Rail's *Tracks are for Trains* programme is an excellent resource for children to promote safety around trains and tracks,” said Judith Tizard at the launch.

“Trains are an important and exciting part of New Zealand's landscape, but trains and tracks are dangerous, too. They are heavy, quiet, and take a long time to stop.

“*Tracks are for Trains* helps children understand why rail tracks and trains, tunnels and bridges are so dangerous. They learn the importance of keeping off the tracks, and learn safe behaviour at railway stations and level crossings.”

Judith Tizard said the government was committed to improving safety and had started a number of new initiatives to assist with rail safety, including introducing to Parliament a new law to deal specifically with rail safety.

“I want to congratulate Tranz Rail for the *Tracks are for Trains* initiative. It is well written, informative and has plenty of fun activities for children, whilst reinforcing the central message of rail safety, and that tracks are for trains.”

Judith Tizard said she was pleased that Tranz Rail had been working closely with the Ngaruawahia community in the year since one of the pupils at Ngaruawahia Primary School was killed when a train struck him on the Ngaruawahia Rail Bridge.

“I hope that as many children as possible learn from this rail safety programme, and that future tragedies may be prevented as a result.”
