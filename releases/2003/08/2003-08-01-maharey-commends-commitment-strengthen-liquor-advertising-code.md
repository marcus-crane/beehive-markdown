Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey is commending the advertising industry for agreeing to tighten alcohol television and radio advertising rules.

The report of the Review Panel on Liquor Advertising on Radio and Television was released this afternoon. It recommends tightening and clarifying the Code for Advertising of Liquor and the introduction of a new principal of social responsibility which the Advertising Standards Complaints Appeal Board can use when dealing with advertisements which appeal to young people.

The advertising industry was granted self-regulation and the right to advertise alcohol on television and radio in 1992 and agreed to institute impartial regular reviews to gauge the social impact of liquor advertising and report findings to the Minister of Broadcasting.

Steve Maharey said he welcomed advertisers unanimous commitment to behave responsibly with liquor advertising.

“Parliament has indicated that it wants advertisers to act very carefully around liquor advertising. The industry has acted very responsibly in reaching these decisions despite the position of many members who felt there were significant grounds for liberalisation in a number of areas.

“In particular I welcome the new principal of social responsibility which is being introduced to guide advertising directed at young people. This is an issue that has concerned a large number of New Zealanders.

“The aim of alcohol advertising should be to encourage moderate use, not to encourage abuse. It’s clear the advertising industry has taken this message firmly on board,” Steve Maharey said.
