Foreign Minister Phil Goff hopes the United Nations will play a role in the rebuilding process in the Solomon Islands following today's Security Council statement welcoming the regional intervention.

"Today's statement, following earlier supportive statements from Kofi Annan and UN Development Programme Administrator Mark Malloch Brown, highlights the strong endorsement of the UN for legitimate multilateral action," Mr Goff said.

"The Security Council's statement warmly welcomed both the collective action taken by Pacific Islands Forum countries, and the leadership shown by Australia and New Zealand.

"It hopes the initiative will quickly lead to the restoration of normalcy and national harmony in the Solomon Islands in order to facilitate the peace-building process and economic recovery.

"The statement also encourages all parties to cooperate and to renounce the use of armed force and violence to settle their differences.

"I welcome such a strong statement of support from the Security Council and hope the United Nations will look at increasing its involvement in the rebuilding process in the Solomons now that the rule of law is being restored by the Regional Assistance Mission."

Mr Goff said the arms amnesty in the Solomons had been highly successful.

"By yesterday, 3355 weapons had been handed in. Of these, 468 were high-powered, modern, military style weapons and a further 264 were other sorts of military rifles, shotguns, pistols and grenade launchers. More than 300,000 rounds of ammunition have also been surrendered.

"However around 300 high-powered and military weapons are still outstanding and the next phase of the police action, supported by military personnel, will be to secure these weapons," Mr Goff said.
