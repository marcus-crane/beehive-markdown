Skydivers in America could soon be jumping from New Zealand designed and manufactured aeroplanes Jim Anderton said today at the celebration of Civil Aviation Authority certification for Pacific Aerospace Corporation’s (PAC) new aircraft.

New Zealand certification for the PAC 750 XL brings the North American world sports jumping market closer as there is a substantial degree of cross-recognition between the Federal Aviation Authority certification and New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority certification, Jim Anderton said.

“This is a fantastic achievement for a New Zealand company. In designing and manufacturing a new aircraft, Pacific Aerospace Corporation has demonstrated that New Zealand has world class talent in aerospace technology. The development of this aircraft shows how innovation can lead to the creation of high quality jobs and I congratulate Pacific Aerospace are to be congratulated on their work,” said Jim Anderton.

The company is seeking dual certification of the PAC 750 XL in the United States of America, Canada and Europe.

The aircraft, which was developed initially to target the fast growing tourism skydiving market, has already attracted keen interest from adventure tourism operators in Europe and the United States.

It has also attracted interest from companies wanting aircraft able to lift heavy loads, operate efficiently at altitude, and take-off and land on short landing strips.

The PAC 750XL was four years in the making.

The base aircraft will be sold for just under US one million, and the company has already received orders for eight aircraft with a large number of options.

By the end of 2004 the company projects the PAC 750 XL will have boosted exchange earnings by $25 million. This is expected to grow by another $30 million the following year with two aircraft a month being made.

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has worked alongside PAC since 1999 introducing them to potential buyers in a variety of markets including South America, Europe, South East Asia and the Middle East. Potential new contacts include parachuting clubs and government agencies involved in various services.

More recently New Zealand Trade and Enterprise has helped the company develop a growth strategy, complete the flight testing programme and associated documentation required for CAA certification and provided assistance with Canadian and European Union certification procedures.
