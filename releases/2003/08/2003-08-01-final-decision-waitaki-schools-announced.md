Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of schools in the Upper Waitaki Valley which is aimed at ensuring local students continue to receive quality education well into the future.

“I believe these decisions provide the best solution for a strong and sustainable schooling system in the Upper Waitaki Valley,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Having carefully considered all the advice received from the Ministry of Education and the community I don’t believe the support for a merger between Otematata and Omarama Schools was strong enough to alter my original proposal.

“Savings made as a result of the review will go back into schools. An estimated $357,500 in educational development initiative funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements and I have agreed that some of this funding will be made available for Omarama School if current Otematata students enrol there.

“There will also be a fund of an estimated $102,010 for joint education initiatives, and an estimated $60,000 of additional property funding made available.

“I have listened to community concerns over the provision of school transport and uniforms and will ensure that the ministry successfully addresses these issues.

"In light of recent developments at Cattle Creek School, I am seeking further advice on the school’s future. I have therefore deferred any final decision on its future until I have received that advice.

“I’d like to thank all those involved in the review as I know the process can be stressful and tiring. I look forward to local students having access to quality education now and in the future. I’m also sure schools and the community will benefit from the money that this review will unlock,” Trevor Mallard said.

The review decisions are:  
·Decision on the retention of Cattle Creek School deferred pending further advice;  
·The merger of Kurow Area, Hakataramea Valley and Otematata Schools, with Kurow as the continuing school. It will become a full primary school on the present site. Surplus property at the Kurow site will be retained in the meantime, to allow for any impact of Project Aqua to become evident.

The board of Kurow School will manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held. Representatives of Hakataramea Valley and Otematata Schools will be seconded to the board until those elections.

The ministry will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
