ACC and Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson today expressed regret that the trustees of the ChildFlight Trust had resolved to wind up the trust immediately. However, she said, services currently provided by the trust would continue.

“My priority is to make sure that sick and injured children continue to get specialist transportation to Starship Hospital in Auckland when necessary. The Ministry of Health and other interested parties are holding meetings urgently to ensure that there are no gaps in the delivery of this essential service.”

On 5 August, the trust decided to continue operating its emergency air ambulance service for children until 2 November 2003. This followed the Department of Internal Affairs granting a three-month extension before withdrawing site approval for six pubs that run gaming machines from which the trust receives funding, to give it time to make alternative arrangements.

“I am sorry that the trustees are now winding up the trust immediately, and I express sincere regret to the staff who have lost their jobs,” Ruth Dyson said.
