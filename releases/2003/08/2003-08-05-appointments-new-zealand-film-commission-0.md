Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today announced the reappointment of Helene Wong and Bill Birnie as members of the New Zealand Film Commission.

The term of Ms Wong has been renewed for three years and for Mr Birnie for a further 12 months.

Helene Wong, of Auckland, is a film and television director, script consultant and former development consultant with the Film Commission, and brings considerable industry expertise to the Commission, particularly in script development and assessment.

Bill Birnie, of Auckland, is Chairman and Managing Director of the investment banking company FR Partners Limited and has had 20 years experience with FR Partners and its predecessor, the Fay Richwhite Group. The company was a major sponsor of the Auckland and Wellington Film Festivals for 10 years.

Judith Tizard acknowledged the contribution already made by the members. “Ms Wong and Mr Birnie bring invaluable skills and experience to the Board and their continued presence will be of great value to the Commission,” she said.

The New Zealand Film Commission is responsible for encouraging the making and distribution of New Zealand films and the development of the New Zealand film industry. It is not a producer of films but supports New Zealand films through investment, marketing, industry support and other activities.
