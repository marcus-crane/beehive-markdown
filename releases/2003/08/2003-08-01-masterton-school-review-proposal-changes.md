Education Minister Trevor Mallard has acted on community feedback on a review of Masterton schools and today announced some changes to his earlier proposal.

“The thorough consultation process involved with this review has resulted in a large amount of interest in the shape of schooling in Masterton. I am encouraged by the active role the community has played in this process,” Trevor Mallard said.

“After considering feedback from the community, I have changed my original proposal to better match the desires of individual schools and their communities with the need to ensure a strong and sustainable schooling system for Masterton.

“I know this process is difficult but we must face the issues raised by the area’s population decline and falling rolls and make sure this will not impact on students’ education.

“The proposed re-organisation I am announcing today will unlock an estimated $6.9 million for local schools. I believe this re-organisation will consolidate and strengthen education in the area, and provide parental choice.

“Under this proposal and using current estimates, $2.8 million in educational development funding will be available to schools over and above their normal entitlements.

“There will be a fund of around $810,000 for schools to use jointly, and $3.3 million of extra property funding will also be available for the continuing schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard’s firm preferences for the schools are:  
·The retention of Fernridge, Mauriceville, Solway, Tinui, Wainuioru, and Whareama schools;  
·The retention of Masterton Intermediate, Makoura College and Wairarapa College;  
·The retention of Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Wairarapa;  
·The merger of Miki Miki and Opaki Schools on the Opaki site, with Opaki School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Harley Street and Masterton Central Schools on the Masterton Central site, with Harley Street School being the continuing school;  
·The merger of Lansdowne and Totara Drive Schools with Hiona Intermediate School on the Hiona Intermediate School site with Totara Drive School being the continuing school; and  
·The merger of Cornwall Street and Masterton West Schools on the Masterton West site with Cornwall Street School being the continuing school.

The board of each continuing school would manage the transition period and govern the new school until elections can be held.

The boards of schools involved in mergers now have 28 days to comment on this announcement.

Trevor Mallard expects to make his final decisions in September. The Ministry of Education will work closely with schools to ensure a smooth transition and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
