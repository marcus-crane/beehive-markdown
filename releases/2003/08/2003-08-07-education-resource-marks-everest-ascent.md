The Hillary Challenge, an exciting new on-line learning programme for school students, was launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent of Mount Everest.

“Fittingly, this resource is packed full of adventure and challenge and shows students what they can achieve through hard work and commitment,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Students learn about the different ways people record and remember the life and achievements of Sir Edmund and how these achievements have impacted on the lives of others and especially their own. Overall, students learn why this special and larger-than-life New Zealander is world famous.”

Trevor Mallard launched the Hillary Challenge at Tuakau Primary School, the primary school which Sir Edmund went to as a child. Sir Edmund was also present at today’s ceremony.

Jointly developed by the Ministry of Education, Microsoft New Zealand and the Institute of Technology (UNITEC) the Hillary Challenge is aimed at years 5 -10 (10 - to 14 year-olds) as part of the social studies curriculum. It has been designed for use with the ‘Hillary - Nothing Venture, Nothing Win’ CD sent out to all New Zealand schools in May.

“It’s great that Tuakau Primary School students have been participating in the Hillary Challenge. They will have learnt how Sir Edmund, together with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and the rest of the expedition team, went about "knocking off” Mt Everest - the preparation, commitment, teamwork, skills and values and other qualities needed to achieve a common goal.

“It’s a fantastic insight and life lesson for our young people,” Trevor Mallard said.
