A pre-introduction briefing paper on the Public Finance (State Sector Management) Bill has been released for parliamentary parties, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and State Services Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The Parliamentary Briefing document outlines the legislative changes contained in the Public Finance (State Sector Management) Bill.

The bill has been developed in response to the recommendations of the 2001 *Review of the Centre*.

The review found that the foundations of New Zealand's public management system were sound but proposed a number of improvements to better meet the needs of the future.

"Due to the fundamental and enduring nature of the legislation we are seeking to build broad support for this bill. The Parliamentary Briefing seeks to aid the parliamentary and select committee processes and provides parties with an opportunity to raise issues before cabinet approves the bill.

"The bill is scheduled to be introduced in November 2003," the ministers said.

The Parliamentary Briefing is available on [www.beehive.govt.nz/mallard/public-finance](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/mallard/public-finance).
