New Zealand music played on commercial radio has increased again to a new high – mirroring Kiwi success in the sales charts this week.

Figures for the second quarter of this year show an all-time high for New Zealand music on commercial radio. Local music accounted for just over 17 percent of playlists. This is a strong indication that the 2003 target of 14.5 percent will be surpassed.

The news comes as local musicians take out four of the top five albums in the latest RIANZ Top 50 album sales chart, the first time in history that New Zealand music has held such a position.

Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard are congratulating the New Zealand music industry on this latest achievement.

“Put simply, our New Zealand music is now firmly embedded. New Zealanders are hearing more New Zealand music and buying more New Zealand music than ever before.

“Commercial radio stations have exceeded their New Zealand music broadcast targets in every genre and are ahead of the overall kiwi music target for the year,” Steve Maharey said.

Overall, there are 13 New Zealand albums in the latest Top 50 dated Sunday 3 August (RIANZ Chart 1369). The top four are: Hayley Westenra’s Pure (1), Bic Runga’s Beautiful Collision (2), Mareko’s White Sunday (4) and Love & Disrespect by Elemeno P (5).

Judith Tizard said the New Zealand albums featuring in the Top 50 reflected a passion for all types of local music.

“There is a fantastic range of options for music lovers amongst our homegrown releases. This week alone, New Zealand hip hop, rock, reggae, jazz, electronica, pop, singer-songwriters and operatic soloists are represented in national album sales,” Judith Tizard said.

The Ministers congratulated the music, radio and retail sectors and government agencies including New Zealand On Air on this latest achievement.

“We also commend the record-buying public on their great taste in music,” they said.
