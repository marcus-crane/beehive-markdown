The Biosecurity Strategy is a useful document, and the Government was working to put its recommendations in place, Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton said today.

The Biosecurity Strategy, written by the Biosecurity Council, was published today. It sets out a framework for a co-ordinated biosecurity operation for New Zealand.

Mr Sutton said New Zealand already had probably the best biosecurity system in the world.

“As an isolated island nation reliant on primary production, we need to have the best systems in place. I’m proud of what we have now, and of the extra resources this Government has put into biosecurity.

“But it’s not an area we can be complacent about.”

Mr Sutton said Cabinet had approved a programme that would see the Biosecurity Strategy’s recommendations implemented. These are mostly around clarifying roles and accountabilities, improving co-ordination between agencies, and improved prioritization and decision-making.

He said the Biosecurity Strategy had been written by the Biosecurity Council after a wide consultation process.

“I congratulate John Hellstrom and his team on bringing this project to fruition.”
