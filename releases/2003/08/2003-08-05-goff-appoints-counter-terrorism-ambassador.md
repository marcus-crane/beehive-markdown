Foreign Minister Phil Goff today named diplomat Dell Higgie as New Zealand’s first Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism.

Mr Goff said Ms Higgie, who is director of the security policy division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, would build on measures taken by the government since the September 11 attacks in the United States.

"The Ambassador's role ensures New Zealand will have a stronger capacity to develop and implement policies on global terrorism and related security issues.

"Ms Higgie will provide an overview and coordination of New Zealand's responses; monitor international developments, and promote our interests internationally through advocacy and attending relevant meetings.

"The appointment follows the significant additional funding made available in the Budget for security, counter-terrorism and emergency response initiatives.

"It also underlines the high priority the government places on making a contribution to international counter-terrorism efforts," Mr Goff said.

A number of countries, including Australia, Japan, Thailand and the US, have appointed counter-terrorism ambassadors.
