The Transport Minister Paul Swain has accepted all the recommendations made in the independent review of the Oamaru search and rescue incident, and has welcomed the decision of the New Zealand Search and Rescue Council to move immediately to implement them.

Mr Swain has released the report by independent reviewer John Bowdler, who was asked to review the response to the fishing boat accident off the coast of Oamaru on 11 May 2003.

"My sympathies go out to the families of the victims and the survivors of this tragedy" says Mr Swain.

"One of the reasons I called for this review was to ensure that problems that occurred around this search and rescue incident won't happen again."

"While there is always risk in going to sea, we want to ensure the best possible search and rescue response now and into the future."

"The review has found some procedures and arrangements were not followed, others were unclear, there were problems with communication, and there were errors and delays at various points in the system."

"The system will be improved as a result of this review," says Mr Swain.

"The Reviewer notes that while in many ways the current system can be said to have served New Zealand well, it has a high risk attached to it."

"While it is clear that there were procedural failings in this incident on the day, I also note the need for major reform of the way we activate and manage our SAR obligations."

The Reviewer has broken down his recommendations into two groups, the first requiring remedial action within three months, the second requiring long-term institutional review and reform, taking up to 6 months.

Mr Swain says the New Zealand Search and Rescue Council decided last week to implement the recommendations.

"However some of these changes will take time. Consequently, I have directed that interim steps be taken now while other work is being done."

"From now, if a search and rescue mission coordinator (SARMC) is alerted to a confirmed distress signal, they will immediately activate the NRCC, thus ensuring all appropriate resources are available to assist."

"This procedure will be in place till formal work is completed on the recommendations."

"One issue the reviewer commented on but stopped short of recommending was whether the NRCC should be a 24/7 operation, and I have asked the SAR Council to promptly report back to me on whether this should be the case."

The SAR Council was formed earlier this year and first met in April.

It brings together agencies including the Police, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Maritime Safety Authority, the Defence Force, and the Ministry of Transport, and provides strategic coordination of all search and rescue activities in New Zealand

The full report will shortly be available on the [Ministry of Transport's website](http://www.transport.govt.nz/business/multimodal/search-and-rescue/)  
Below: List of recommendations from the review.

**IMMEDIATE REMEDIAL ACTIONS**

01. The Search and Rescue Operations Plan (SAROPs) of the National Rescue Coordination Centre (NRCC) be revised to include a specific sub-section on responses to distress beacon incidents, which not only provides guidance to Search and Rescue Mission Coordinators (SARMCs), but also provides clear linkages to related procedures in NRCC member organisations.
02. The SAROPs be revised to provide clear advice on responding to incidents where survivors may be in the water, and where priorities need to be struck around likely survival times and the type of response that is most feasible in the circumstances.
03. While some discretion must necessarily remain with SARMCs, the SAROPs be further strengthened to ensure that other key NRCC members are alerted without fail
    
    1. Where there is any chance that a distress beacon incident may be at sea, the Marine Duty Officer (MDO) to be informed as soon as a reasonable judgement can be made by the SARMC that the signal represents a potential distress situation, but otherwise immediately when a resolved alert is available
    2. For any land-based, or near to shore distress beacon incident, the relevant Police Communications Centre or the Police Liaison Officer (PLO) to be informed on a similar basis to the MDO
    3. As soon as a decision is made to task a search resource, relevant members of the NRCC to be notified (to trigger contact arrangements at the local level and alert/mobilise resources as necessary, if not done already)
    4. If a significant search by air is in prospect, the ADO to be alerted or brought in to the NRCC
04. The question of what is a "near to shore" incident, and what procedures and contact arrangements are to apply, be clarified unambiguously in the SAROPs and related documents as part of the responses to recommendations 1-3.
05. The SAROPs be augmented to provide guidance to SARMCs in cases where two or more incidents, or two or more dimensions of the one incident, require prioritisation.
06. The SAROPs be augmented to provide additional guidance on tasking SAR resources, and clear advice on communication with operators of SAR resources.
07. Where there are any problems apparent in mobilising NRCC support, SARMCs be required in such cases to contact the Manager, NRCC or use the Manager to activate the NRCC.
08. As part of the process of revision to the SAROPs, consistent changes be made to key operational documents in other NRCC member organisations. To ensure consistency is maintained, a regular review program also be instituted between agencies, to ensure consultation on possible changes and advice of actual changes.
09. All NRCC member organisations review their paging and "at call" arrangements, to ensure that urgently needed officers and volunteers are located without delay, and are given clear advice on the nature and immediacy of the incident or possible incident, and what is required of them.
10. Communications protocols be established within and between NRCC member organisations, and supported in documentation and training, to ensure that discussions are clear, that all relevant information is provided or sought, and that initiative is taken to call back in instances of failure to receive an expected communication within a reasonable time.
11. Consistent with the changes implemented through recommendations 9 and 10, encouragement and assistance be given to other communications networks related to the SAR system, and volunteer SAR organisations, to enhance their contact and communications procedures.
12. The changes to current arrangements and procedures in recommendations 1 to 11 be endorsed and promoted by the NZ SAR Council, and appropriate documentation sent to all operatives, with a supporting program of seminars and training exercises.

**INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW AND REFORM**

1. The SAR Council commission a full risk analysis of current NRCC arrangements, around a range of possible Class III SAR incidents and the different sets of decisions and institutional arrangements that might be taken to respond to them. These sets of decisions and arrangements to include the possible operation of the NRCC for longer periods, including at weekends. The analysis should take into account not only the costs of, but also the range of benefits potentially coming from, different courses of action and outcomes.
2. The risk analysis in recommendation 13 assess also the risks related to particular communications systems, with a view to avoiding over-reliance on a particular system either generally or in responding to a particular incident.
3. In the context of this analysis, decisions be taken on related recommendations outstanding from the 2001 Maritime SAR Review, including longer hours of operation for the NRCC and options for a closer relationship between the NRCC and the Maritime Operations Centre (MOC).
4. A program of consultation with commercial operators of SAR resources be undertaken by the NRCC, to discuss SAR procedures and tasking arrangements, and to develop a communications protocol. This program then to be maintained as necessary on an annual basis.
5. A program of consultation with local Police and volunteer SAR organisations be undertaken by the NRCC, to increase NRCC awareness of local issues and response factors, and inform local SAR resources of NRCC procedures and issues in responding to alerts, emergencies and distress beacon situations. This program then to be maintained as necessary on an annual basis.
6. Consistent with new or revised SAR structures, procedures and arrangements to be introduced to provide a clear record of communications and decisions in a SAR response, to enhance performance review, quality assessment and learning from experience.
7. The SAR Council prepare a national SAR statement, to outline SAR policy and agency responsibilities, and to provide a common reference manual for all participants in SAR activity in New Zealand.
8. The SAR Council develop an implementation plan for decisions based on this review, and on other related inquiries, to ensure their implementation is achieved over the shortest feasible timeframe and that appropriate resources are provided.
