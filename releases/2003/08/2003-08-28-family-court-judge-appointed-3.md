Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Jacquelyn (Jackie) Moran as a Family Court Judge.

Jackie Moran has practised in family law since her admission to the bar in 1980, and exclusively since 1990. For the past 10 years she has been in sole practice in Invercargill. Before that she had held the position of Team Leader of the Disputes Resolution Team at Arthur Watson Savage.

Margaret Wilson said Jackie Moran has made a considerable contribution to professional organisations in Wanganui, where she practised from 1981 until 1991, and in Southland.

“She has been Chair of the Southland Care and Protection Resource panel, a member of the Southland District Law Society Family Law Committee and past president of the Southland Family Courts Association. She has also served as a member of the New Zealand Law Society Family Law Section and Matrimonial and de Facto Property Committee.”

Jackie Moran also helped establish the Southland Abuse Intervention Programme, Margaret Wilson said.

The new Judge will be sworn in on 5 September and will sit in Christchurch.
