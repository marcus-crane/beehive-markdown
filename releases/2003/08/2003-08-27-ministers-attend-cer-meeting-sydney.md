New Zealand and Australian trade and economic Ministers get together for a special CER 20th Anniversary Forum in Sydney tomorrow, Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton will attend the meeting, as well as Mr Sutton.

Mr Sutton said the annual trade ministers meeting has been expanded to include domestic economic ministers because this year marks the Closer Economic Relations trade agreement’s 20th anniversary.

He said that as well as Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile, Australian Agriculture Minister Warren Truss and Australian Revenue Minister Senator Helen Coonan would also take part.

The meeting also includes a trans-Tasman Business Forum on innovation in biotechnology.

Mr Sutton said that, among other issues, Mr Anderton would exchange views on our respective growth and innovation policies and Ms Dalziel was likely to focus on business law coordination. Increasingly, policies of both Governments are being harmonised.

“For my part, an obvious focus with both Mark Vaile and Warren Truss will be the upcoming Cancun Meeting on the Doha WTO Round. Both New Zealand and Australia are determined to keep pressing for substantive results from this meeting.”

Mr Sutton said New Zealand had initiated a process of having the Business Dialogue focus on specific sectors as part of CER meetings last year.  
This year’s topic is “Partnering for Innovation in Biotechnology”.  
“This theme sits well with the New Zealand Government’s Growth and Innovation framework. Having the meeting in the financial centre of Sydney is a plus.  
“The need to attract more interest and capital is a concern shared by both New Zealand and Australian biotech firms.”  
The New Zealand business delegation is being led by investment banker and BIOTENZ board member Dr Claire McGowan, and includes New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Chair John Grant, HortResearch Business Development Leader Dr Gavin Ross, Agriculture NZ’s Colin Ansell, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’sBiotechnology Sector Director Dr Chris Boalch.

AusBiotech Chair Dr Peter Riddles will lead the Australian side of the business dialogue.
