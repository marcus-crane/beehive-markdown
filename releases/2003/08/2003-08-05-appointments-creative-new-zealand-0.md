Elizabeth Ellis continues for a further one-year term as chair of the Maori Arts Board Te Waka Toi. Her term continues from the expiry of her previous term and ends 31 October 2004. Ms Ellis is a visual artist who has been involved with Mâori arts, education and community activities. She has been chair of Te Waka Toi since 1997.

Current members of the Arts Board of Creative New Zealand, Marilyn Kohlhase, a management consultant, and Helen Schamroth, an arts and design consultant, both of Auckland, and Lydia Wevers, a university lecturer and researcher of Wellington, have been re-appointed each for a further term of three years.

Judith Tizard expressed her confidence in the appointed members. “I am delighted that these people have all agreed to continue serving on Creative New Zealand boards. They bring an extremely impressive range of skills and experience to their positions and I am confident that Creative New Zealand will be well served by them.”

Creative New Zealand encourages, promotes and supports the arts in New Zealand. It has Arts Council and two boards, the Arts Board and Te Waka Toi each with seven members.

The Council sets policy and strategic direction and has a major role in promoting and advocating for the arts. The Arts Board and Te Waka Toi develop art-form policy, allocate grants and carry out initiatives that support the Council’s strategic direction. Te Waka Toi specifically supports and promotes Mâori arts, while the Arts Board supports the arts of all New Zealanders.
