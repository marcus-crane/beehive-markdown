Wide consultation planned for foreshore and seabed

26 August 2003Media Statement

The government will consult widely over the next five to six weeks on how to ensure public access for all New Zealanders to the seabed and foreshore while also acknowledging Maori customary rights, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today.

“We are confident that with good will on all sides, we can produce a win-win solution which takes New Zealand forward as a nation built on tolerance and  
diversity,” they said.

Feedback must be received by Friday 3 October. Written submissions can be sent to Foreshore and Seabed Submissions, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, PO Box 55, Wellington or made on line at http:///www.beehive.govt.nz/foreshore.

Dr Cullen said interest in the issue was high with many calls to the 0508 FORESHORE number in the first week, including 1999 requests for booklets and 3790 for pamphlets. This was in addition to a large mail-out of the documents when the government announced its proposed solution last week.

Mr Horomia said the government was keen to hear from Maori and was putting on eleven hui across the country \[schedule attached]. These would be facilitated by Wira Gardiner and attended by senior Ministers and the local MPs.

The government is also contacting key stakeholder groups in local government, recreation, the fishing industry, tourism and the environment offering them a briefing from a Minister should they want one.

People interested in organising a public meeting should contact their local government MP.

Dr Cullen said that as the proposed changes would require legislation, people would have a second opportunity to make submissions through the normal select committee processes.

“It is important that we get this right. Our best chance of doing that is through a constructive debate focussed on the issues and on building broad-based agreement around a way forward,” he said.
