Associate Health Minister and Progressive leader Jim Anderton announced today that WellTrust will receive $188,000 this financial year to continue their assessment and counselling support services for young people with alcohol and drug problems.

“I am pleased to announce that WellTrust will receive funding for the rest of the 2003/2004 financial year to support teenagers and their families who are faced with alcohol and drug abuse problems.

“WellTrust works closely with the Department of Courts, Child, Youth and Family, as well as schools in the Wellington region.

“There is a lack of treatment services in Wellington for young adults who are having trouble with drugs and alcohol. WellTrust provides both an assessment and treatment service, the aim of which is to turn these kids’ lives around.

“This funding will also include an evaluation process which will determine whether future government funding will be extended past the end of the 2003-2004 financial year.”
