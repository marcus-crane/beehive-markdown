Education Minister Trevor Mallard today launched six books in the “Figure It Out” series, aimed at better maths teaching and learning for students in years 7 and 8 (ages 11 and 12).

“Thirty-seven booklets have been published in the series already and we’ll have another 16 books published by 2005, at an estimated cost of $7 million,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard launched the new books with the pupils of Bishop Viard College in Porirua today. The launch also coincides with the start of Maths Week, designed to celebrate the importance and fun of mathematics in schools throughout New Zealand.

“Last year’s NCEA results, and several international surveys of maths learning showed that New Zealand had to improve its algebra teaching. This series will help teachers to lift our game and improve understanding of algebra and algebraic thinking.

“The two theme books give maths an innovating and exciting slant. Canoeing the Whanganui river, riding roller coasters, measuring earth quakes and tsunamis should capture the interests of children, teachers and parents.

“This is a key element of our government’s Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. Our maths standards will be rising with this comprehensive new approach.”

Trevor Mallard said the feedback he was receiving showed that teachers, pupils, and parents were all impressed with the “Figure It Out” series.

This latest set of books provide material for children working at level 3 of the maths curriculum, two booklets focus at level four and one booklet is for children beyond that level.

The books, published by crown-owned Learning Media, supplement existing maths programmes in schools and provide activities and investigations that students can work on independently or co-operatively in pairs or teams.
