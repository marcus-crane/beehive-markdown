Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his final decisions on the review of Dannevirke schools, aimed at ensuring that local students continue to receive quality education well into the future.

“I am pleased that my proposals met with general approval and believe that Dannevirke schools can now look forward to a strong and sustainable schooling system,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Having carefully considered all the advice received from the community and Ministry of Education, I have decided that Dannevirke North School site is the most suitable site for the new merged school.

“I also agree with feedback that the establishment of a combined board of trustees to govern Dannevirke’s two primary schools would help maintain consistency in the quality of schooling provision, and I will consult further with the community on this.

“I’d like to thank all those involved in the review as I know the process can be a strain. I now look forward to Dannevirke students enjoying the benefits of the extra funding that will be released – totalling about $1.6 million.”

On top of this, about $470,000 will be released for joint education initiatives between the schools and nearly $3.3 million in extra funding will be available for capital works.

The review decisions are:  
·To retain Dannevirke South School, Weber School, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori O Tamaki Nui a Rua and Dannevirke High School as a Year 9-15 secondary school;  
·To merge Dannevirke North and Hillcrest Schools on the Dannevirke North School site with Hillcrest School being the continuing full primary school;  
·To merge Awariki, Norsewood, Ormondville and Matamau Schools on the Norsewood School site, with Norsewood School being the continuing full primary school;  
·To merge Ruahine and Rua Roa Schools on the Ruahine School site, with Ruahine School being the continuing full primary school; and  
·That year 7 and 8 technology provision is relocated to Dannevirke High School.  
The ministry will work closely with schools to make sure their requirements for a smooth changeover are met and that the review is implemented in time for the 2004 school year.
