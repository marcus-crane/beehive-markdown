The Ministry of Women’s Affairs will be retained as a separate ministry and strengthened, following a review of the agency, State Services Minister Trevor Mallard and Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.

Trevor Mallard and Ruth Dyson said the review had examined how the Ministry of Women’s Affairs could most effectively deliver on its role and purpose, and contribute to improved outcomes for women.

“The government has agreed to the review’s recommended option for improving the performance of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs by internally strengthening the ministry, under the leadership of a new, change-management focused chief executive,” the ministers said.

“The ministry will also examine ways of working more closely with other government departments on collaborative work programmes.

“The way forward now is for the State Services Commission to begin the appointment process for a new chief executive with a clear mandate for change.

“The chief executive will be responsible for initiating and reinforcing the capability development under way, building the ministry’s reputation and credibility and working closely with other departments to support and encourage their active participation in policy programmes impacting women,” the ministers said.

The capability needs identified in the review which was undertaken by the State Services Commission included improving policy development processes, management systems and processes, organisational culture, and cross-governmental relationships.

The review found that these had had major impacts on the credibility and reputation of the ministry and reduced its ability to influence other government departments.

“Collaborative working relationships between the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and other government departments are crucial if New Zealand is to achieve equality of outcomes for women,” the ministers said.

The review looked at a range of options to improve the government’s performance in this sector.

Absorption of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs' functions across a range of departments was not considered feasible given the role and purpose of the ministry. The review found that without a specific women’s ministry there would not be a sufficient focus for work identifying implications and opportunities for women in the policy process.

The appointment of a new chief executive is expected to take three to four months.

The government today also announced that a new Ministry of Youth Development will be created out of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and youth policy functions of the Ministry of Social Development. The new ministry will be within the Ministry of Social Development. (eds:see separate press statement)

Questions and answers – Ministry of Women’s Affairs

How many staff are in the Ministry of Women’s Affairs?  
24\.

Ministry staff positions are not affected by this review outcome.

What is the background to the sector reviews?  
Sector reviews were suggested in the government’s 2001 appraisal of New Zealand’s public management system, the Review of the Centre. The Review of the Centre identified four areas for improvement:  
·focus more on results/outcomes;  
·becoming more citizen and community centred;  
·building the culture, people and leadership; and  
·better integration of structures and processes.

This Review recommended a series of initiatives to address fragmentation and improve alignment of state sector agencies with government objectives. The full Review report can be found at: www.ssc.govt.nz

How did the review come about?  
In March, the government asked the State Services Commission to review the Ministry for Youth Affairs and the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. The government was committed to continuing the work of Women’s Affairs and Youth Affairs but believed that there could be areas for improved sector performance.

Based on the role and purpose of each ministry the review:  
·examined the capability needs each ministry has to deliver its outputs, now and in the future to achieve outcomes (the description of the capability needs was informed by extensive consultation with governmental stakeholders, including management and staff);  
·developed criteria to evaluate options to enhance the capability in each ministry;  
·identified structural and non-structural (virtual administration and enhancing the status quo) options to build and maintain capability, and their associated risks; and  
·evaluated these options against the criteria.

Who undertook the review?  
The review work programme was led by the State Services Commission (SSC) and involved a project group of representatives from the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC), the Public Service Association (PSA) and the acting chief executive of the ministry. Staff from the ministry have had the opportunity to take part in the review process through being directly consulted by the SSC.

Why was the review outcome different for the two ministries?  
Although these two departments are both “population ministries” their specific roles, relationships with other departments, and current situations differ significantly. While both Youth Affairs and Women’s Affairs have an over-arching cross-government focus, Youth Affairs sits closely with the social development interests of the Ministry of Social Development. In addition, the capability issues are significantly different - with Youth Affairs facing challenges in its external environment while Women’s Affairs has a number of internal and external issues.

What other sectors have been reviewed?  
The government recently announced the results of a justice sector review, which resulted in a merger of the Department of Courts into the Ministry of Justice.

What is the purpose of the reviews?  
The government is always seeking ways to improve the performance of the state sector. This work programme follows on from the government decision in its last term to improve the performance of the social sector by merging the Department of Work and Income with the Ministry for Social Policy.

The purpose of the sector reviews is to consider ways to improve whole-of-government effectiveness to achieve results for New Zealanders. The reviews are intended to increase alignment between government agencies and reduce fragmentation where this is a barrier to improving performance.
