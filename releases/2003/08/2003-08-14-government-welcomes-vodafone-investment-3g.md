The Ministers of Finance and Information and Communications Technology say they are thrilled at the announcement by Vodafone that it will invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build a 3G network in New Zealand.

Michael Cullen and Paul Swain say it is a significant development for New Zealand, and demonstrates a high level of investment confidence by Vodafone.

Dr Cullen and Mr Swain say the investment is a prime example of what the government is seeking to promote under its Growth and Innovation Framework.

Mr Swain says 3G, or third generation mobile technology, will provide "fast internet access on the go wherever you go, and puts the world truly at your fingertips with the potential for world-wide roaming."

Dr Cullen and Mr Swain say New Zealand companies will now have world-leading opportunities to use the technology to develop other IT applications, making use of the 3G features that allow for voice, video, graphics, and text on your mobile phone.

The Government's 3G spectrum auction was completed in February 2001.
