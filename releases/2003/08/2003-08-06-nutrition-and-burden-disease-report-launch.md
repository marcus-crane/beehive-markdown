Health Minister Annette King said today that unhealthy diets and physical inactivity play a role in about 40 percent of deaths in New Zealand.

Ms King was launching a joint Ministry of Health-Auckland University report, Nutrition and the Burden of Disease: New Zealand 1997-2011, which assesses how many premature deaths are attributable to selected nutrition-related factors.

"The full impact of poor nutrition on our health has not been accurately measured before," said Ms King. "The report confirms that nutrition-related factors such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, overweight, obesity, and not eating enough vegetables and fruit, can seriously affect the country's death rates."

The report estimates that poor nutrition plays a role in up to 11,000 deaths each year in New Zealand (two in every five deaths), with more than 4500 premature deaths in 1997 attributed to high cholesterol.

Ms King said the report also showed that high blood pressure resulted in about 3700 deaths, overweight and obesity contributed to 3200 deaths, and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake contributed to 1600 deaths.

Only tobacco consumption (approximately 5000 deaths in 1997) ranked higher than such nutrition-related factors as a contributor to premature death in New Zealand.

Ms King said the report also showed that even modest improvements in nutrition could prevent hundreds of deaths annually within just a few years.

"Asking people to eat less and exercise more will not work. We have to address the social and physical environment – the factors that shape people’s choices and opportunities. For example, the food industry could gradually reduce the salt content of manufactured foods, which would result in widespread reduction of blood pressure and potentially save hundreds of lives each year."

One of the report’s authors, Dr Anthony Rodgers, of Auckland University’s Clinical Trials Research Unit, says the most striking finding was the huge impact of high cholesterol levels in New Zealand. “Our high saturated fat diets are causing thousands of deaths from heart attacks and strokes every year.”

Nutrition-related factors accounted for more than 85 percent of ischaemic heart disease and 70 percent of stroke; overweight and obesity alone accounted for more than 80 percent of diabetes; and overweight, obesity and poor fruit and vegetable intake were responsible for more than six percent of cancer deaths.

Ms King said the report provided evidence backing the inclusion of improving nutrition and reducing obesity as priority objectives in the New Zealand Health Strategy. “It will give added impetus to Healthy Eating – Healthy Action programmes. The eventual aim is to make the healthy choice, the easy choice.”

Questions and Answers

Why was the aim of the Nutrition and the Burden of Disease report?

Nutrition is a key determinant of health. However, while it is known that nutrition-related risk factors cause heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and other major health problems, their full impact on the health of New Zealanders has never been accurately quantified.

What methods did the report use?  
A methodology developed by the World Health Organization called 'comparative risk assessment'. The methodology was used in the World Health Report 2002, which looked at the contribution of different risk factors to disease in different regions of the world. We applied this methodology to New Zealand and estimated, for selected nutrition-related risk factors, the attributable burden of disease in 1997 as well as the burden of disease that could be avoided in 2011 if exposure to these risk factors were reduced.

Why does the study use 1997 statistics?  
These are the most recent data on the risk factors included in the study, ie cholesterol, blood pressure, overweight and obesity, and vegetable and  
fruit intake. Data were sourced from the 1997 National Nutrition Survey.

Why does the study make projections to 2011?  
To estimate the avoidable burden we had to know what disease levels were expected to be in the future (so we could estimate by how much we could  
reduce these levels). Work on projecting disease levels has already been done in the Ministry of Health up to 2011, which is as far as we can project with reasonable certainty.

What is meant by "the burden" of disease?  
The burden of disease refers to the number of deaths and ill-health in the population due to disease and injury. In Nutrition and the Burden of Disease, we only focused on fatal numbers - ie deaths - as a measure of the burden of disease.

What do the terms "attributable burden" and "avoidable burden" mean?  
Attributable burden means the number of deaths that can be attributed to a particular risk factor such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity or inadequate vegetable and fruit intake.  
Avoidable burden looks to the future, and estimates the number of deaths that can be avoided or prevented by reducing exposure to a particular risk factor.

How did we add the attributable burdens across risk factors to get the overall burden due to nutrition?  
We are unable to add the disease burden of the nutrition-related risk factors directly because risk factors overlap (for example, a person can be overweight, have high blood pressure and high cholesterol at the same time) and therefore more than one risk factor can contribute to the same death.  
A formula that took into account the overlap of risk factors was used to estimate the overall effect of nutrition-related risk factors on deaths in New Zealand. Using this formula we estimated that the mortality burden of 'nutrition' was approximately 11,000 deaths (compared to 13,000 deaths if you simply add up the disease burden from the risk factors we had chosen).

Where does physical activity fit in?  
Not all of the 11,000 deaths resulting from high blood pressure, cholesterol, and excess body fat can be totally attributed to diet alone. Physical inactivity also causes disease through these same risk factors. The estimate of 11,000 deaths therefore reflects the combined effect of diet and physical inactivity. We have estimated that approximately 2000-3000 of the 11,000 deaths are likely to be due to physical inactivity with the remainder (8000-9000) likely to be due to diet alone.

Can you add the avoidable burdens across risk factors?  
Unfortunately we cannot add the avoidable deaths from the risk factors to get an overall view of the number of deaths that could be prevented from a reduction in all four nutrition-related risk factors. This is because, unlike for the attributable burdens, a formula has not been developed to calculate the joint effect of avoidable burdens from different risk factors. It is possible that a formula will be developed in the future. Also, it is important to note that the avoidable burdens were estimated using one of many possible intervention scenarios for each risk factor - if other scenarios were used, we would have obtained different avoidable burdens.

Where to from here?  
The Nutrition and the Burden of Disease report took a whole of population approach, and recognises there are many scenarios, or ways of trying to  
reduce the number of deaths attributed to nutrition-related risks. Asking people to eat less and exercise more will not work. The social and physical environment needs to be influenced – the factors that shape people’s food and activity choices and opportunities. Some examples include getting industry to lower the salt content of manufactured foods, making changes to urban planning that make it easier for people to walk or cycle to work, and improving access to vegetables and fruit. Overall, it’s all about making the healthy choice, the easy choice.

How does Nutrition and the Burden of Disease relate to the Healthy Eating - Healthy Action strategy?  
It is intended that that Nutrition and the Burden of Disease will provide an evidence-base for the implementation of the Ministry of Health's Healthy Eating - Healthy Action strategy. It is intended that the results from this study will be used to help prioritise appropriate actions to improve the health of New Zealanders through improved diet and physical activity.
