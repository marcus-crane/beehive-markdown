New Zealand’s profile as a desirable Japanese holiday destination has just gotten a real boost.

Speaking in Tokyo at a function to mark 30 years of marketing to Japan, Minister of Tourism Mark Burton yesterday announced that Tourism New Zealand’s funding for the internationally recognised 100% Pure New Zealand would be doubled in Japan.

Mark Burton hosted three senior Japanese government ministers at the Tokyo New Zealand function, which was attended by more than 200 senior representatives of the travel and tourism industry, airlines, media organisations, and government agencies.

“Tourism New Zealand has developed a profile of our ideal visitor. Dubbed ‘interactive travellers,’ these high-yield guests are environmentally aware, interested in activities that are off the beaten track, and want to engage with our culture and heritage,” said Mark Burton.

“Tourism New Zealand are now focusing their marketing activity on this target visitor. Accordingly, by doubling the investment in Japan, the already successful 100% Pure campaign will make New Zealand even more visible to prospective interactive travellers.”

“Japan offers a wealth of such visitors. However, in the wake of the SARS virus, there has been a significant impact on this vital market. It is essential that we re-emphasise our commitment to a strong New Zealand/Japan relationship and promote New Zealand as a safe, peaceful, and unique destination—one that values and welcomes guests from Japan.

Funding will be increased from NZ$1.25 million to NZ $2.6 million, and will be used to advertise in newspapers in Osaka, Tokyo, and Nagoya, as well as in major Japanese magazines. Tourism New Zealand are also planning outdoor billboards in the Tokyo and Osaka railway stations, and an advertising truck carrying the 100% Pure message throughout Tokyo.

Mark Burton said that work was also being done to increase the Japanese travel trade's knowledge of New Zealand, with a major Japan Mission planned for October and a strong New Zealand presence at Japanese trade shows.

“Japan is a vital part of our thriving tourism market, and the 100% Pure message is attractive to our ideal Japanese visitors. We are committed to re-building and strengthening this valuable market over the long-term.”
