Experienced television producer and media studies academic Diane Musgrave has been appointed to the board of the Broadcasting Standards Authority, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Ms Musgrave replaces Judy McGregor who has resigned from the Authority’s Board to take up a new role as New Zealand’s first Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

Steve Maharey said Diane Musgrave will contribute a wide community perspective, as well as knowledge and practical experience of broadcasting, to the Authority.

“Diane Musgrave is an experienced television producer and director and is currently a senior lecturer in television at the Auckland University of Technology’s School of Communication Studies. She also been involved in a wide range of Auckland and nationwide community and voluntary sector organisations.

“Her appointment will ensure the Authority has an appropriate mix of broadcasting experience and perspectives,” Steve Maharey said.

Ms Musgrave's appointment has been welcomed by the Television Broadcasters' Council because of her knowledge of the sector and contribution in training graduates to work in the industry. The Screen Production and Development Association has also endorsed her appointment.

Steve Maharey said the government also intends appointing a new chair for the Authority to replace Peter Cartwright who has decided not to seek a second term. An appointment to this position is expected to be made within the next two months.
