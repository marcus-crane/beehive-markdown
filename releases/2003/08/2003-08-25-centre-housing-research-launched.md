Housing Minister Steve Maharey launched Kainga Tipu – the Centre for Housing Research, Aotearoa New Zealand at Parliament this evening.

The independent research centre has been established through Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) with a mandate to carry out broad-ranging research in the housing sector. The need for a sound knowledge base to provide understanding of current and future housing patterns had been acknowledged by those working in the social housing area and by Housing New Zealand Corporation which had since April last year been assisting the independent Centre to become fully established.

Steve Maharey said good objective housing research is an investment in the future.

“More informed decisions, particularly in such important areas as housing and urban development, will be of crucial importance as we jointly shape our responses to the social challenges facing New Zealand.

“Good objective research helps us make better decisions.

“There are strong relationships between housing and other components of well-being – with health, education and training, labour market participation, and family stability, among others.

“The Centre’s interest covers a broad range of housing-related issues. Its objectives include:  
·encouraging the development of the housing research sector  
·widening the use of research findings, and  
·stimulating the exchange of ideas and debate about housing matters.

“Work has already been initiated into home ownership, accommodation for older people, housing and structural adjustment and the changing structure of the housing sector.

“The Centre has its own Board that will set the research agenda. Board members are:  
·Nigel Haworth (Chair), Head of Department and Professor of International Business at the University of Auckland Business School;  
·Brian Donnelly, Chief Executive, NZ Housing Foundation;  
·Rau Hoskins, Director, Design Tribe (Architects);  
·Robin Kearns, Associate Professor of Geography, University of Auckland;  
·Sam Knowles ,Chief Executive, Kiwibank;  
·Major Campbell Roberts, Salvation Army;  
·Raewyn Stone, Community and Economic Development Planner, Manukau City Council;  
·Maryan Street, HNZC Board and Waitemata District Health Board; and  
·David Thorns, Professor of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Canterbury.

“HNZC is providing $481,000 in funding for the Centre this financial year. The longer-term objective is for the centre to attract its own funding,” Steve Maharey said.
