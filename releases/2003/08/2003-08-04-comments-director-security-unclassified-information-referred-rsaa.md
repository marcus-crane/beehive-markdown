The Prime Minister has received the following advice from the Director of Security with respect to the Refugee Status Appeals Authority report on Ahmed Zaoui which was released today.

The Director of Security advises as follows:

§“The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service received a letter from the RSAA asking for all information held about Ahmed Zaoui. The Service declined to provide classified information.  
§The Service did, however, in accordance with the Official Information Act, provide unclassified information it held. Among the documents provided was a ‘chronological background on Ahmed Zaoui based entirely on open-sourced materials’.  
§The document was simply that: a compilation of publicly available materials. It made no attempt to judge whether or not the information was reliable.  
§That document was not used by the Director of Security in making the Security Risk Certificate. It had and has no status in that respect.  
§The Service did not make submissions to the RSAA. It merely responded to a request for information.”

The Director of Security believes it is important that the factual record around the request for information from the RSAA and the response of the Service is made clear.
