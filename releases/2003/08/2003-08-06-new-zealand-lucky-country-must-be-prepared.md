New Zealanders have been lucky when it comes to natural disasters, but kiwis shouldn’t count on their luck lasting forever, Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins says.

Mr Hawkins was speaking at the launch of a Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management project aimed at getting the public to make submissions on improving New Zealand’s ability to deal with natural and non-natural disasters.

While officials had advanced disaster strategies worked out with local and regional councils, police, fire, ambulance services and volunteer groups, Mr Hawkins said he was concerned at the rest of the population’s lack of involvement.

“New Zealand’s last major natural disaster, Cyclone Bola, occurred in March 1988 and perhaps that is why people have not been as keen to become involved in thinking about preparing for such events as they might,” Mr Hawkins said.

While New Zealand was in many ways a blessed country, it was also an unstable, unpredictable land.

“When we choose to live here we do so knowing we stand on shaky isles, that earthquakes in New Zealand are not unknown, that we live among volcanoes, and that many of our areas are subject to floods, storms, tsunami and other natural disasters.

“We accommodate these and know we may also have to face the possibility of non-natural disasters, such as terrorism, biological and chemical hazards, and disruptions caused by the loss of water, power or telecommunications.

“Our best protection is our preparedness.”

Mr Hawkins said Civil Defence was currently calling for public submissions on the proposed National Civil Defence Emergency Management Strategy, which sets out the Crown’s priorities for emergency management for the next decade.

“I’d like as many people as possible to put their two cents in because the reality is natural and unnatural disasters can destroy New Zealanders’ lives, property, infrastructure and livelihoods,” he said.

Copies of the Strategy and submission guidelines were available by phoning the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management 04 473 7363, by writing to the Ministry at PO Box 5010, Wellington or from www.civildefence.govt.nz.

Submissions close on 12 September 2003.

Note: The National Civil Defence Emergency Management Strategy’s framework was established under the new Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002.

This Act seeks to improve New Zealand’s management of disasters through a comprehensive risk-based approach, and focuses on reducing risk and managing disasters when they occur.
