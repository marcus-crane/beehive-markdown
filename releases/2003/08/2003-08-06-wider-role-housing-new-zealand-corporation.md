Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) will continue to expand beyond state rental properties, to help provide more social housing that reflects community aspirations, Housing Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The Corporation’s Statement of Intent for 2003-2006 was published today. It outlines the objectives of HNZC and the nature and scope of activities to be undertaken over the next three years.

Steve Maharey said that while demand for housing assistance continues to grow, the nature of the demand for public housing is changing.

“The supply of social housing is declining, the availability of private housing for low to moderate income households is limited and much of the Corporation’s stock is old and needs upgrading.

“Working proactively with customers, iwi, communities the private sector and other government agencies will form a key part of identifying and addressing local housing issues.

“The Corporation will continue to work with other housing providers to expand the amount of social housing available, build the capacity of these providers and a greater pool of community resources to help those in need. The third sector Housing Innovation Fund and assistance for local government are initiatives to support those areas,” Steve Maharey said.

During the 2003/04 year the Corporation is expected to deliver an overall increase of 944 homes worth $165 million, including another 90 houses in rural areas of high housing need in the East Coast, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Far North and 103 additional community group homes.

In addition, it will carry out 2,500 environmental energy efficiency retrofits, $124 million worth of maintenance and modernise 600 state rental homes.

Steve Maharey said another important link in the process is development of the New Zealand Housing Strategy. A discussion document will be released later this financial year.

“Primarily the Corporation’s approach over the next three years will be to become a more customer-focused organisation, as well as encouraging communities, government, non-government, iwi and Maori to work together to address housing need, rather than expecting the state to provide all the answers,” Steve Maharey said.
