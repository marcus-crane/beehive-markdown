Minister of Tourism Mark Burton is today welcoming Air New Zealand’s new Tasman Express service, which will offer travellers significantly reduced trans-Tasman fares.

Tasman Express, which will come into effect on October 29, will feature ongoing average price reductions of 20 percent, with some fares reduced by up to 45 percent.

Mark Burton said that the new service was excellent news for the entire tourism sector.

“Australia has long been our number-one tourism market. Air New Zealand already carries over 650,000 Australian visitors across the Tasman every year.

“Air New Zealand has already experienced impressive results with their domestic Express Class service. They are on track for a 22 percent increase in the twelve months since its introduction last year—an increase of one million travellers.

“The introduction of a similar trans-Tasman service will make New Zealand more competitive with domestic Australian destinations. The new lower fares are expected to stimulate the trans-Tasman market even further.

“I congratulate Air New Zealand for its lateral thinking and success in an extremely competitive market.”
