The Transport Minister Paul Swain says the next step in the Government's efforts to bring down the road toll will be the release of the Road Safety to 2010 Strategy, which is now in its final drafting stages.

Mr Swain has provided a progress report on road safety initiatives to the annual conference in Auckland of TRAFINZ, the New Zealand Local Authority Traffic Institute, made up of local government councillors and staff.

The Government has already set a road safety goal of no more than 300 fatalities and 4,500 hospitalisations a year by 2010.

Mr Swain says the Road Safety to 2010 Strategy, spelling out how that goal could be achieved, is now very close to being released.

"It is built around the 'three Es' - Engineering, Education and Enforcement."

Mr Swain told the TRAFINZ conference that central and local government are working closely together on engineering issues, with major and minor road works playing a part in improving road safety.

"Major works include state highway construction, while minor works can be as simple as clearing vegetation, improving road markings and signs, and removing deep ditches or other obstacles.

There is also a joint venture between Transit and the five local authorities in Auckland to monitor the traffic signals and cameras across the region."

Education strategies will continue to see advertising campaigns undergo subtle changes to reinforce messages such as the need to wear seatbelts and observe give way signs.

Enforcement is a crucial component of road safety policy, and changes to the Land Transport Act are being considered, that will target drivers who are recidivist offenders, as well as making changes to the safety regime for commercial vehicle operators.

Mr Swain also says central and local government need to work together to develop innovative solutions to funding questions.
