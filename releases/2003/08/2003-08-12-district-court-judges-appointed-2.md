Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of two new District Court Judges to Auckland. They are Aucklander Philip Recordon and David Wilson QC of Hamilton. The new judges will be sworn in on 29 August.

Philip Recordon, a barrister sole since 2001, has practised in Auckland over a 30-year period, the past 20 of those years in the South Auckland area. While much of his recent work has been in the Family Court jurisdiction, he has also practised in the areas of criminal law, civil litigation, immigration, tenancy and tribunal work. He has been District Inspector for Mental Health since 1987.

He has also been active in a wide variety of community-based organisations, including the Auckland Council for Civil Liberties, New Zealand Lawyers for Nuclear Disarmament and many others providing assistance to disadvantaged or minority groups. He has served as trustee on a number of mental health and Mâori health trusts.

Philip Recordon will sit in the Waitakere Court.

Appointed a QC in 1997, David Wilson began practice as a barrister sole in 1984 after 12 years as a partner of McCaw Smith & Arcus. His career has been in litigation, much of it criminal litigation, for both defence and prosecution.

He has been a member of the Hamilton Crown Prosecution Panel for 20 years. He also has considerable experience in civil and family litigation, and has been involved in many successful commercial mediations.

A foundation member of the New Zealand Bar Association, David Wilson is a former President of the Waikato Bay of Plenty District Law Society.

He will sit in the North Shore Court.
