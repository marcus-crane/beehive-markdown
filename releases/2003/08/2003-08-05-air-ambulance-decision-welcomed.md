ACC and Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson today welcomed the Child Flight Trust’s decision to continuing operating its emergency air ambulance service for children until 2 November 2003.

The Department of Internal Affairs has granted a three-month extension before withdrawing site approval for six pubs that run gaming machines from which the trust receives funding, to give it time to make alternative arrangements.

Ruth Dyson said that, during that time, the Ministry of Health and ACC would work together to develop long-term arrangements for the service.

“My priority is to make sure that sick and injured children continue to get specialist transportation to Starship Hospital in Auckland when necessary. Following a meeting yesterday afternoon, there is a lot of goodwill between the parties involved. I am confident that a long-term solution will be found that will ensure there are no gaps in the delivery of this essential service.”
