Ports of Auckland Ltd has a guardianship role over Auckland's waterfront, and financial return must not be its only concern, says Auckland Central MP and Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard.

“The principles the goverment has declared towards New Zealand's foreshore and seabed – that they should be in the public domain, with open access and use for all New Zealanders – must apply to Westhaven and Hobson West as well.

“Ports of Auckland and Infrastructure Auckland – as the majority owner of Ports of Auckland – must consult with the public before any steps are taken to put Westhaven Marina and Hobson West Marina up for sale.

“As with the Viaduct Harbour, I am prepared to predict that Aucklanders will want these marinas to remain publicly owned and accessible.

“I hope that Ports of Auckland and Infrastructure Auckland take their role as guardian of Auckland's waterfront seriously, and work with the Waterfront Action Group to develop long-term plans for these areas.”
