Minister of Defence, Mark Burton, welcomed the crew of HMNZS Te Mana home today, at the conclusion of their deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom’s Maritime Interdiction Operation (OEF MIO).

Te Mana spent six months as part of the Canadian-led Coalition Task Group patrolling the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.

Mark Burton stressed the importance of Te Mana’s work in OEF.

“Terrorism is still a very real threat to international security, and New Zealand continues to work closely with others globally to counter that threat.

“Although Te Mana’s role in OEF is now complete, an RNZAF P3 Orion aircraft is currently working with the multinational MIO in the Gulf of Oman, tasked with the detection, identification and surveillance of surface vessels. One of New Zealand’s C130 Hercules is also flying support missions for OEF—a vital contribution to the ongoing work in Afghanistan.”

Mark Burton praised the crew for their outstanding service.

“Te Mana’s work has been exemplary, and you have performed exceptionally well under demanding circumstances.

“I know that your role as part of Operation Enduring Freedom has added further to the international reputation of the NZDF’s service men and women.

“You have acquitted yourselves with honour and distinction. On behalf of the government and all New Zealanders, I am proud to welcome you home.”
