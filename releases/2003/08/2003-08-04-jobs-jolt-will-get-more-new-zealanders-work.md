The government today unveiled a $104.5 million jobs package to tackle skill shortages and get more New Zealanders into work.

The ‘Jobs Jolt’ initiatives will help people get off benefits and into employment, and also address the shortage of skilled labour.

Ten specific initiatives will help employers facing skill shortages, the long term unemployed, people with disabilities, long term sickness and invalid beneficiaries, mature job seekers, youth, and people who have been made redundant. Changes will also be made to the operation of some benefits to ensure beneficiaries capable of work are active in their search for employment.

The Jobs Jolt initiatives will assist 22,000 people into paid employment over the next three years. Employment growth has averaged 44,000 jobs a year since the Labour-led government has been in office. Changes to the operation of the benefit system will see a further group of beneficiaries given more active assistance and may see an even greater number finding paid work.

Social Development and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said Jobs Jolt recognises that with low unemployment and labour shortages, the New Zealand economy needs as many working age people as possible to be active in the labour market.

“Given economic and employment growth, we have an opportunity now to implement new initiatives which will help to meet industry needs for labour and support into work more of those presently unemployed.

“Assuming robust economic growth, the Jobs Jolt initiatives should make a significant contribution to employment growth and skill shortages over the next three years.

“At the same time we can consolidate changes in how we work with people on benefit in order to improve their chances of moving into employment in the future.

“Jobs Jolt acknowledges that peoples’ lives are best improved through work and community participation.

“Most ($91 million) of the expenditure on the Jobs Jolt package is expected to be recovered from what we would otherwise have had to pay out in benefits. This is an important principle and a good example of social development investment in action,” Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey said further initiatives to assist job seekers into paid employment are also under development. This includes a package targeting South Auckland Pacific job seekers to be announced on Friday by Associate Social Development and Employment Minister Taito Phillip Field.
