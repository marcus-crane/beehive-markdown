The new maximum tuition fee and course costs system, announced as part of the Budget, has been largely confirmed following consideration of public submissions.

Tertiary providers will set their fees within these new rates; with the government anticipating fee rises to be around the level of inflation each year.

From 2004 the government is setting maximum limits on the tuition fees and course costs that students can be charged. The new system, that covers the years 2004-2006 after which time it will reviewed, replaces the annual fee freeze agreements the government has struck with tertiary providers over the last three years. Indicative rates were announced in the May Budget and have now been confirmed, with some changes, following consideration of the 59 submissions that were received.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said the new system gives students certainty about the fees they will pay over the next three years and provides greater flexibility to tertiary providers when they are setting their fees.

The new fee and course costs maxima system establishes a sound middle ground between the uncontrolled fee-setting environment students experienced during the 1990s and a centralised fee-setting system which would give tertiary providers no flexibility to control a significant portion of their annual revenue.

As required by changes made to tertiary education legislation last year, the indicative fee and course costs limits announced at Budget time were gazetted for public comment. A number of improvements have been made following consideration of the 59 submissions received.

The changes made are:

- the fee and course costs maxima for subjects such as engineering, agriculture architecture, audiology and specialist large animal science has been reduced by $300;
- providers whose tuition and course costs fees are below the maxima will not be able to increase fees by more than 5 percent in any given year. This will provide students, who enrol in a multi-year programme, with a reasonable level of certainty about future fees. Exemption circumstances provisions will apply;
- courses above the fee and course costs maxima have been frozen in 2004 to enable a long term funding solution for these courses to be worked out. This provision mirrors the exemption for 2004 granted to Private Training Establishments that was announced as part of Budget 2003;
- postgraduate tuition and course costs fees will continue to be exempt from the maxima, however the amount providers are able to lift these fees in any given year has been decreased from $1000 to $500. Professional masters degrees, such as MBAs, will be exempt from the maxima, as will community education courses.

The government anticipates that tertiary providers will keep any fee increases to around the rate of inflation next year. We have provided a 3% increase in tuition subsidies for 2004 ? this is 1.2% above inflation estimates and builds on the annual funding increases tertiary providers have enjoyed since the change of government in 1999.

Over the next four years additional targeted funding, over and above resources provided for usual teaching and research activities, will also be available to the tertiary education sector, including:

- more than $86 million to invest in areas such as e-learning, capability development and regional development projects by polytechnics;
- access to around $90 million of new funding going in research, science and technology over the next four years; and
- matching capital funding for partnerships projects through the Partnerships for Excellence scheme.

The New Zealand government now spends more of our national income on tertiary education than most OECD nations.

The final design of the fee and course costs maxima system draws heavily on the report of the Fee Maxima Reference Group, which included students, tertiary providers and staff union representatives. I want to thank the tertiary education sector for working cooperatively on the design of the new system," Steve Maharey said.

Detailed information about fee and course costs has been sent to tertiary education organisations today and is also available [on-line](http://www.minedu.govt.nz/step).
