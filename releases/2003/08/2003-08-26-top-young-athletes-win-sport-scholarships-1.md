Four talented athletes from the Tasman region have received the Prime Minister’s sporting scholarships to help them reach their sporting and educational goals, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The four athletes are amongst a group of 463 nationwide who were offered this year’s scholarships, worth up to $16,000 each per annum.

Trevor Mallard presented the scholarships at the official opening of the Tasman Regional Coaching Resource Centre in Richmond, which will provide resources for coaches of all levels in the top of the South Island.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships are a government initiative, administered on its behalf by the New Zealand Academy of Sport. They were established in 2000 to help athletes pursue academic or trade studies as well as sporting careers.

“Our government has committed $5 million each year for the programme because we want to support young sportspeople achieving excellence in their field. These scholarships help young athletes who have the potential to become the next generation of New Zealand's outstanding sportspeople,” Helen Clark said.

One of New Zealand's most promising up and coming sprinters, Clint Grooby, is among today's recipients. Clint is presently in his second year of a 4-year apprenticeship at Christchurch Polytechnic and competed as a member of the NZ Relay Team at the 2002 World Junior Athletic Champs.

“It is important for sportspeople to have balance in their lives. Studying for a tertiary qualification while also training in their sport ensures that other opportunities will exist for them once they retire from their sport," Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said athletes receiving scholarships will have their full tertiary fees paid, up to $10,000 per annum.

“Athletes may also be entitled to an allowance which is dependent on their study loading. This is a huge help for those who are struggling to make ends meet while juggling their busy lives.”

Scholarships are available to athletes who are either currently carded by their national sport organisation and accessing services linked to the New Zealand Academy of Sport, or to athletes from non-carded sports who are prioritised by their national sport organisation.
