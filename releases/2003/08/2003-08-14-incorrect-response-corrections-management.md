Te Tai Hauauru M.P. Tariana Turia says the Corrections Department's defence of the so-called 'goon squad' sends mixed messages about the role of the department.

"The general public expect that people who receive custodial sentences, especially for violence, are being rehabilitated," said Mrs Turia.

"We are encouraged to believe that imprisonment will change the behaviour of offenders, through punishment of negative behaviours as well as reinforcement of positive changes. That is implicit in the name of the department.

"What message is Corrections management sending when they appear to condone illegal, violent and potentially abusive behaviour by their own staff, by allowing perpetrators to keep their jobs?

"I can't think of any other job in the country where an employee would be kept on after being found to have used excessive force and intimidation against people who are in their care against their will.

"With a big staff recruitment campaign under way, I would have thought now is the time for the Department to demonstrate the high standards of behaviour it expects from its staff," said Mrs Turia.
