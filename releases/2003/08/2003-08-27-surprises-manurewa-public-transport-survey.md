Few Manurewa people use public transport, most reject a regional petrol levy and most want the Government to spend more on reducing road congestion.

They’re the key findings from an informal survey of constituents undertaken in July by Manurewa MP George Hawkins.

“Perhaps the biggest surprise was the 55 per cent of those who responded who said they never used public transport,” Mr Hawkins said.

Of those who responded, most took the train or bus and only five per cent car pooled. Eighteen per cent used public transport monthly, 17 per cent most week days and only 9 per weekly.

Price wise, 39 per cent thought public transport fares were about right, 24 per cent thought they were expensive and 6 per cent thought they were inexpensive.

Mr Hawkins said he regularly surveyed his constituents to find out what their concerns were.

“It’s a useful way of keeping in touch with the electorate and hearing back from people about things that impact on them on a day-to-day basis.”

Mr Hawkins said 72 per cent of people rejected a regional levy on petrol to pay for public transport, but 77 per cent wanted the Government to spend more money on reducing road congestion.

A final question on the Government’s performance also received a clear reply, with the vast majority of respondents saying they thought the Government was either doing well or very well, Mr Hawkins said.
