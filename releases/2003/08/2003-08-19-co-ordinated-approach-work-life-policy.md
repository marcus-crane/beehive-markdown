The government will establish an integrated work programme to develop family-friendly and other policies promoting work-life balance, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

"Currently a number of different government agencies are carrying out research and policy development in this area and there is a need to ensure their work is co-ordinated," she said.

An inter-agency steering group chaired by the Department of Labour will be set up to develop and co-ordinate the integrated work programme.

Margaret Wilson said work-life balance policies and practices could help individuals to improve well-being and more fully use their potential both in work and outside of work. Work-life balance practices could also help employers to increase retention, reduce absenteeism and improve productivity and profitability.

"The right balance between work and 'life' is different for each person. Obviously work-life issues for a sole-parent worker will be quite different than for say a worker nearing retirement. Similarly, work-life issues will be quite different for students, older people, people with significant caring responsibilities and those without such responsibilities.

"What is important is the extent to which people have real choices and control over their circumstances. What is also clear is that achieving work-life balance is complicated, and will therefore require different government, employer, individual and community responses," Margaret Wilson said.

The Terms of Reference for the integrated work-life policy development programme are attached.

#### TERMS OF REFERENCE - WORK-LIFE BALANCE

**Steering Group for work-life balance policy development**

**Introduction**

1. Work-life balance is about the interaction between paid work and other activities, including unpaid work in families and the community, leisure, and personal development. There is no one answer to what "balance" is for each individual. It is about recognising however that one sphere impacts positively and negatively on the other. Employers and individuals can gain from improved integration for the individual.
2. Work-life balance is an important contributor to both social outcomes (improving opportunities to adequately parent or provide care for others and fulfil cultural/community responsibilities and reducing indirect discrimination as well as enhancing personal well-being) and economic outcomes (efficient use of skills and talent, enhanced productivity and firm profitability). Work-life balance also relies on the provision of adequate and accessible services and community supports.
3. The government's position on work-life balance was set out in the Governor General's Speech from the Throne (27 August 2002) where the Governor General stated that her government believes that work is but one dimension of living and should not crowd out and distort family life, recreation and personal development. Work-life balance should seek to raise the profile of activities other than work and should contribute to the government goals of a growing economy and an innovative and an inclusive society.

**Purpose**

1. To develop, co-ordinate, and direct an inter-agency work programme on work-life balance, that includes substantive public consultation. All policies and practices that have a direct and indirect affect the ability of employees to balance paid work and other activities will be considered.
2. To develop policy options that provide increased opportunities for New Zealanders to enjoy access to work-life balance and for all of New Zealand to enjoy the social and economic benefits that might arise from increased work-life balance.
3. Any unintended outcomes of specific policies, such as potentially reduced female participation in the labour market from extended parental leave, should also be considered and advised.
4. To have particular regard to low income families, those in casual, non-standard, precarious work, sole parents, carers, and those who given wider choices may change their productive activities, for example parents/carers, or those with disabilities or who might be nearing retirement when advising the government on:
   
   1. which aspects of the identified problems relate most appropriately to government, firms, families and communities, and individuals so that the government might consider and prioritise policy development
   2. which aspects of the identified problems relate most appropriately to government, firms, families and communities, and individuals so that the government might consider and prioritise policy development
   3. whether there are family-friendly work-life balance policies (including government policies and practices) that will contribute to social and economic outcomes, such as firm productivity, community cohesion, and maximising the capacity of individuals, and if so, advise on the development of those policies
   4. determine whether particular priorities for policy development can be developed and, if so, determine priorities for policy development
   5. consider the possibility of ascertaining optimal levels of work-life balance, with particular regard to improving the constrained choices of some particular groups
   6. the likely impacts, including effectiveness and cost effectiveness, of any work-life balance policies.
5. To recognise, utilise, and integrate where necessary any current labour market arrangements, social development or other government policies (including legislative interventions), management practices, and family and community activities, as well as the role of individuals that are directly related to work-life balance.
6. To give consideration to the development, funding, and accountability of an ongoing work programme once government has agreed to the priorities for work-life balance policy development.
7. To give consideration to the establishment of monitoring and evaluation of work-life balance policies.
8. To report on options for Government to promote policies and practices in the community that balance work and life.

**Work Programme**

***Phase 1: Analysis of work-life balance policies and practices***

1. Integrate the current work programmes of the various government agencies, with particular regard to the work in the following agencies: the Department of Labour, the Treasury, Ministries of Social Development, Women's Affairs, the State Services Commission, EEO Trust, and NACEW.
2. The work-programme will need to take account of other initiatives such as the Pay and Employment Equity Taskforce, Paid Parental Leave, the establishment of the Families Commission, and other initiatives, policies, and practices to ensure that the work programme is complementary and duplication is avoided.
3. Identify existing policies, including international experiences, that contribute to work-life balance, assess their effectiveness, identify any gaps in the existing policies for different groups, having regard to low income families, those in casual non-standard precarious work, sole parents, carers, and those who given wider choices may expand their productive activities.
4. Prepare the basis and process for informing and consulting the public on work-life balance. The preparation might include identifying a vision statement, developing multiple communication mediums, such as a draft action plan, supporting background information available on a website, digital storytelling.

***Phase 2: Consultation***

1. Subject to Cabinet agreement, undertake consultation from October to December.
2. In parallel, there are likely to be some further research or policy issues generated from Phase 1 that can be continued in this period.

***Phase 3: Policy development***

1. Analyse the results of Phases 1 and 2, to advise the government on how future policy development should proceed. At this time, particular options that have a high priority might be recommended to government. Other options might form part of a longer-term action plan that government can address over time.
2. Once the government has agreed to the priorities for work-life balance policy development, recommend a process to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the development, funding, and accountability of an ongoing work programme, which would include monitoring and evaluation.

***Reporting***

1. The Minister of Labour will be the responsible Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Economic Development, the Minister for Social Development and Employment and the Minister of Women's Affairs.
2. The Chair of the Steering Group will be responsible for ensuring that the Minister of Labour is kept informed of the progress of the Steering Group.
3. The Steering Group will report to the Minister of Labour on the detailed work programme in August.
4. The Minister of Labour will report to Cabinet in:
   
   1. September 2003 - on the results of the work in progress, and seek agreement to the consultation process, including any products produced for the purposes of consultation.
   2. February 2004 - on the results of consultation and an update of any other relevant findings from work completed during Phase 2.
