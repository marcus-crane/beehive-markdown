Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard advises fans to get to Eden Park in good time for the All Blacks’ Bledisloe Cup game tomorrow night.

“As always, it’s a challenge to get a capacity crowd of 45,000 to the ground in time for kick-off and then safely home again,” said Judith Tizard.

“The gates will be open from 5.30pm which means people can plan to arrive in plenty of time for kick-off at 7.30pm.

“Parking is always an issue in Mt Eden as it is a residential area, so I recommend people investigate options such as public transport, coach hire and car-pooling.

“Sky City Auckland is putting on ten free buses to Eden Park departing from Federal Street from 5.30pm and returning after the game. People using this service should check with the bus drivers regarding return times.

“Stagecoach will have extra buses running on the Dominion Road and Sandringham Road corridors to complement their regular bus services. They advise me that they will continue running buses from Sandringham Road after the game until the crowd is clear.

“From Britomart to the Kingsland station, TranzMetro will also be providing its regular service, doubling its usual two carriage units to four carriages. And there will be a service with four carriages returning to Britomart straight after the game, departing at 9.45pm.

“People taking public transport to and from the game should use Auckland Regional Council’s Rideline to find out their best options.“
