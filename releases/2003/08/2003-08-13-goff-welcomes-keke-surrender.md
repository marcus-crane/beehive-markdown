Today’s surrender of Solomon Islands militant Harold Keke is a major success for the Regional Assistance Mission, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said tonight.

“I very much welcome the surrender of Harold Keke. It is a major step forward in the restoration of peace and security to the Solomons. Keke and his lieutenants are allegedly responsible for 50 or more murders, as well as the burning of many villages on the Weather Coast, and the taking of hostages.

“It is also hugely symbolic. This is a recognition by Keke that the time of the gunman is over, and that the rule of law is returning to the Solomon Islands.

“Today’s development will also bound have an important flow-on effect. It will send a clear message to other gunmen to turn in their weapons.

“Keke’s surrender means that Malaitan militiamen can no longer justify holding on to their weapons by using the excuse that they would be defenceless against Keke, who is a Guale, without them.

“I am particularly happy that the surrender occurred without the use of force. It was one of the key early goals of the Regional Assistance Mission, and will greatly assist in ensuring that other objectives of the deployment can be met without resort to using military backup.

“Keke and his followers have also handed over a large number of weapons. Over 1000 weapons, including between 200 and 300 high-powered guns, have been handed in, in total since the mission began.

“That is a considerable achievement. There is, however, still a long way to go before the Solomon Islands can step back from the precipice of being a failed state and resume its place as a functioning member of the wider Pacific community.”
