Government plans to develop a Marine Protected Areas Strategy will continue independently of the foreshore and seabed ownership debate, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said today.

Mr Carter was due to visit New Zealand's newest marine reserve at Te Matuku Bay on Waiheke Island on Saturday with Mexico's Vice-Foreign Minister Enrique Berruga, and launch a Department of Conservation marine environment information kit entitled The Sea: Our Future.

A draft Marine Protected Areas Strategy being developed by DOC would be released for public consultation later this year, Mr Carter said.

"What we are talking about is a system of national parks in the sea. Protecting 10 per cent of the marine environment is the bare minimum we need to do to ensure that representative samples of our marine ecosystems are conserved for future generations."

Even with the inclusion of Te Matuku Bay, approved in March and due to be gazetted later this year, New Zealand's total coastal marine protected areas were still smaller in area than Abel Tasman, New Zealand's smallest national park, he said.

"That's pitiful, given that our waters are 15 times greater in area than our landmass, and that we know so little about the marine environment. For example, seven new marine species on average are discovered in our waters every fortnight, with the possibility that species may be going extinct without anybody realising it."

In the draft strategy, a number of mechanisms for marine protection were contemplated, but marine reserves would remain the most important, Mr Carter said.

Experience at Leigh and other marine reserves, in New Zealand and worldwide, had proven the environmental benefits of marine reserves, he said.

The number, size, and biomass of fish in these areas rebounded when fishing pressure was removed, a literature review compiled by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, released in June found. At Leigh, snapper were six times more abundant within the reserve than in adjoining waters.

"Talk to any old timer and they will tell you the fish at their favourite spot were much bigger and more plentiful 30 years ago," Mr Carter said. "We must turn back the tide on declining quality in marine biodiversity."

When gazetted, Te Matuku Marine Reserve would become New Zealand's 18th marine reserve and the fourth in the Auckland region.

At 700 ha, the reserve is designed to protect Waiheke Island's largest and least-modified estuary, covering native coastal forest, salt-water wetlands, mangrove forests, inter-tidal flats and deep water environments in Tamaki Strait.
