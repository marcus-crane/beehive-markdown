Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment the Hon Taito Phillip Field today launched the Ministry of Social Development - Work and Income Pacific Wave strategy at the Counties Manukau Regional Skills and Employment Forum in Mangere.

The strategy is a specific programme of work that aims to reduce the levels of unemployment for Pacific peoples particularly in the Auckland Manukau region

“The Pacific wave strategy has as its central goal the significant reduction of Pacific Unemployment Benefit clients in the Auckland Manukau region by the end of June 2005”, said Taito Phillip Field.

The purpose of the Pacific Wave strategy is to bring about an increase in the employment, job retention, earnings and occupational skills of Pacific clients. This is a social development approach that improves the social and economic position of Pacific families and their communities.

This will involve adopting a multi-tiered approach, as no one strategy will suffice in achieving the goal of reducing Pacific unemployment.

The strategy contains a mix of different approaches including prevention, diversion, early-intervention and employment retention.

The Pacific Wave strategy is an additional programme of activity for Work and Income. The strategy outlines activity that will complement the existing income support and employment services activity.

“But neither Work and Income nor the Government can do this on their own. Work and Income will seek to strengthen its partnerships with service providers in the areas of training, communication, employment services and social support”, Taito Phillip Field said.
