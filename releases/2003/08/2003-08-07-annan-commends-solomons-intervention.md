Foreign Minister Phil Goff today welcomed a statement from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan praising the regional response to the Solomon Islands crisis.

"Mr Annan has commended all members of the Pacific Islands Forum for taking collective action to support the government and people of the Solomons," Mr Goff said.

"While the Secretary-General noted the leadership exerted by Australia and New Zealand, more significantly he recognised the particular importance of the unanimous regional support for the initiative, and the fact that it was undertaken within the framework of the Forum's Biketawa Declaration.

"Mr Annan expressed hope that a prompt restoration of normalcy in the Solomons would lead to a return to national harmony, and he emphasized that the United Nations system was fully prepared to contribute actively to the process.

"The response to the Solomons crisis demonstrates that Forum members can collaborate quickly and effectively in times of need. However plenty of hard work lies ahead for both the regional response team and the people of the Solomons, and to have the support and commendation of the UN Secretary-General is very welcome," Mr Goff said.
