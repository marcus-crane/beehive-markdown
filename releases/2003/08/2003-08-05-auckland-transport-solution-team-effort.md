Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard said today that the government and Auckland must continue to work together to meet the cost of providing a good transport mix in the region.

“I know that the Auckland Regional Council’s rates introduction is a huge concern to many, and I share that concern, but I continue to receive more complaints about the state of Auckland’s transport infrastructure than I do about rates.

“Traffic densities are increasing 5 per cent annually, vehicle emissions are a major health and environmental concern, and the whole country is paying the economic and social costs of Auckland’s congestion.

“Census 2001 figures show almost 55 per cent of Auckland residents drive a motor vehicle to work – the highest proportion in the country. On top of that, a further 11 per cent are driving freight and company vehicles.

“We can’t fit any more vehicles on Auckland’s roads, so we have to concentrate on traffic and roading management and transport alternatives. The impressive increase in public transport patronage over the last four years shows that Aucklanders are willing to use transport alternatives if they are available.”

Judith Tizard says the solution is a good mix of roading, passenger transport and transport alternatives which the government and Auckland must meet the cost of for all Aucklanders and for New Zealand’s economic benefit.

“Under the Labour-Progressive Government, for the first time, Auckland’s share of Transfund funding in both public transport and in roading matches its share of New Zealand’s population.

“The government has increased the subsidy to public transport in Auckland from $20.1 million three years ago to over $60 million this year. We have put more into the state highway network in Auckland, and we have also increased the total amount going into land transport so that rest of New Zealand does not suffer while we continue to work on Auckland’s issues.”
