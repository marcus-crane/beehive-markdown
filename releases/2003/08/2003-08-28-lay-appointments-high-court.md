Attorney-General Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of three new lay members of the High Court under the Commerce Act. They are Professor Stephen King of Blackburn Australia, Professor John Small of Auckland and Mrs Rhonda Smith of Templestowe Australia.

Wellingtonian Michael Copeland has also been appointed for a further term.

Lay members help the Court in cases involving appeals from decisions of the Commerce Commission and in other matters under the Commerce Act.

Margaret Wilson said the new appointees bring the pool of lay members from which the Court can draw to eight.

"There needs to be a reasonable pool of experts available because there are relatively few economists with the requisite qualifications and experience in New Zealand," she said. "For this reason they tend to be vulnerable to a conflict of interest if called upon to sit as a lay member."

The new Australian appointees are from Melbourne University which is considered the pre-eminent university on competition matters in Australasia, Margaret Wilson said.
