Senior Citizens Minister Ruth Dyson today congratulated Stagecoach Wellington for its bus fare promotion for senior citizens. The bus company is offering discounted fares to senior citizens every Tuesday throughout August.

The promotion enables older people to use any Stagecoach of Cityline Bus after 9am to travel to, and around, Wellington, the Hutt Valley, Eastbourne and Wainuiomata all day and pay no more than $4.

“Many older people rely on public transport to get out and about in our communities. However, the cost of bus fares can be a limiting factor. Stagecoach’s discount fare will encourage older people to use buses for their travel needs, without the hassle of driving their own car or relying on someone else to take them.”

Ruth Dyson said the initiative was a good example of the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy in action.

“Affordable and accessible transport is one of the key goals of the government’s Positive Ageing Strategy. I commend Stagecoach for addressing older people’s transport needs.”

Ms Dyson said it was up to older people in the region to ensure the trial was a success.

“I encourage older Wellingtonians to get behind Stagecoach’s offer. Make the most of the cheap bus fares, and get out and enjoy the region!”
