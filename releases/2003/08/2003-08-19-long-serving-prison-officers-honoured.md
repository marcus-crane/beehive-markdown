The Corrections Minister Paul Swain is honouring nine long-serving prison officers at a medal presentation ceremony today.

Mr Swain is presenting the Long Service Medals to Corrections Officers at Hawkes Bay Prison, during a visit to the site in Hastings.

Eight staff members are receiving medals for 14 years service, while one receives a bar to mark 21 years service.

Mr Swain is congratulating the officers for their contribution.

"They play a key role in changing the lives of inmates not only during the time they are in prison, but also preparing them for when they will be released."

Mr Swain is also thanking the officer's families.

"Corrections Officers can't do the difficult work they do, with long hours, shift work and challenging circumstances, without a supportive home environment."

"This ceremony is well timed, given that the Public Prisons Service is in the middle of a recruitment campaign."

"The officers we are honouring today underline the campaign's message, that some of the best role models are behind bars," says Mr Swain.

"The officers have already well exceed the average length of service for Public Prisons Service staff, which is on average 10 years for male staff, and around 7 years for female staff."

"They have seen a lot of change in the way offenders are managed during their time as prison officers - 17 years ago the first women started working as officers in men's prisons, 8 years ago the Corrections Department was established as a standalone agency, and in 2000, the new Integrated System for Managing Offenders was introduced."
