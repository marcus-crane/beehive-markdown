Racing Minister Damien O’Connor today announced the appointment of Julie Crengle, Alan Jackson and Anne Urlwin to the inaugural New Zealand Racing Board at a birthday celebration to mark a new beginning for racing.  
The Minister presented a birthday cake to retired equine star Sunline at Trevor and Stephen McKee’s Takanini stables. Like every other racehorse, 1st August marks Sunline’s birthday.  
Mr O’Connor said he was delighted to be celebrating the champion mare’s birthday on the same day as the beginning of a new era for racing in New Zealand.  
The Racing Act 2003 comes into force today, and with it, the New Zealand Racing Board replaces the Racing Industry Board and the TAB.  
“The new Act is about increased efficiency, better policy co-ordination and clear accountability”, the Minister said.  
“It simplifies racing administration by establishing a single statutory body and sets up New Zealand racing for a bright future.”  
The three new NZ Racing Board appointments will join the independent chairperson, Warren Larsen, and the three code-nominated members, Murray Acklin (thoroughbred racing), Jim Wakefield (harness racing) and Thayne Green (greyhound racing) on the inaugural board.  
“The three new appointees, together with the chairperson, bring with them a wealth of business skills that will complement the industry knowledge of the three code nominees,” said Mr O’Connor.  
“These new faces can approach industry issues with a clean slate; Julie, Alan and Anne bring independence to the Board and I am confident they’ll serve the industry well.”
