Housing Minister Steve Maharey today announced a two-year Government initiative with Kiwibank to make access to home ownership easier for low to modest income earners.

From September 2003, people earning up to and including $50,000 a year, or up to and including $100,000 if there are more than two main sources of household income, may be able to get a home loan. They’ll also need a good credit history, be able to afford repayments and meet other conditions.

Steve Maharey said those who qualify won’t need a deposit if buying a house up to $100,000, and only a 5% deposit if buying a house over $100,000, and that money could have been gifted.

“This is possible because, through Housing New Zealand Corporation, we’ve developed and are subsidising a mortgage insurance programme to the value of $5.3 million. This will enable Kiwibank to reduce the risk of lending to people with little or no deposit.

“For many people, such as Housing New Zealand Corporation tenants paying market rent, home ownership is only just out of reach.

“Either their income is just slightly too low, or they aren’t able to save a deposit. Yet once in a house they would be able to manage the repayments and keep a reasonable standard of living.

“The partnership with Kiwibank aims to make access to home ownership easier for these people.

"We will therefore be having an initial focus on HNZC market rent tenants and current applicants on the waiting list for rental housing for whom home ownership may be a viable option.

“As part of the initiative, people will have access to information about the costs and responsibilities of owning a home, and once they have their own home, Kiwibank will keep in contact to provide ongoing advice and support.

“We chose Kiwibank for this trial because it’s readily accessible throughout New Zealand. It was a commercial decision by Kiwibank to enter into the trial.

“Trialling for two years will allow us to test the initiative on a small scale to find out how successful it is before we expand it to other lenders,” Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey said state house tenants would not be able to buy their homes, and the initiative won’t help everyone who wants to buy a house.

Kiwibank is expected to approve about 1,800 loans as part of this trial.

The trial starts in September 2003 and will run for two years.

**Mortgage Insurance Programme: Frequently Asked Questions**

1\. What’s the new Government initiative to help people buy a home?

It’s a trial to make access to home ownership easier for modest income earners, while at the same time providing information about the costs and responsibilities of owning a home and providing on-going support and advice once the borrower moves into their new home.

From September 2003, people who would not usually get a home loan because they have not saved a deposit or are outside current lending criteria may be able to get a Kiwibank In Reach loan.

This is possible because the Government, through HNZC has developed is subsidising a mortgage insurance programme. This will enable Kiwibank to reduce the risk of lending to people with little or no deposit.

This will help modest income households earning up to and including $50,000; or up to and including $100,000 if there are more than two main sources of household income, and they are all co-borrowers on the loan. Applicants will also need a good credit history and be able to meet repayments.

Those who qualify won’t need a deposit if buying a home up to $100,000, and only a 5% deposit if buying a home over $100,000.

Loans may only be approved in situations where the applicant meets the credit criteria and conditions, can afford the repayments, the applicant does not currently own another home and they will be the owner/occupier.

2\. What are the main criteria to qualify?

A couple or individual earning up to and including $50,000; or up to and including $100,000 if there are more than two main sources of household income, providing they are all co-borrowers; and they must have a good credit history, be able to meet repayments and other conditions.

3\. How is this loan different from other home loans?

No deposit is needed if buying a house up to $100,000. A 5% deposit is needed if buying a house more than $100,000, and the deposit could have been gifted.

Once people are in their new home, there is regular contact from Kiwibank to provide ongoing advice and support.

If there are more than two sources of household income, Kiwibank will take this into account, whereas other lenders may not. This will help households living in an extended family situation and who want to buy a home.

4\. Who will this trial appeal to?

Modest income earners. It may be of particular interest to Housing New Zealand Corporation tenants paying market rents, or applicants who are interested in buying a home rather than renting. It will also help households living in an extended family situation where there are more than two main sources of household income and they want to buy a home.

It is designed for first home buyers or people re-entering the housing market and they do not currently own a home and they will be the owner-occupier.

5\. Why Kiwibank?

Kiwibank is readily accessible throughout New Zealand and like the Government, wants to help people into home ownership. The partnership with Kiwibank allows the initiative to be trialled on a small scale to see how successful it is before it is expanded. It was a commercial decision by Kiwibank to take part in the trial.

For the duration of the trial, Kiwibank will provide the home loans and follow-up contact. Kiwibank will be the main point of contact for customers and will determine whether someone qualifies.

6\. Why should the Government subsidise HNZC’s mortgage insurance programme?

Home ownership rates have fallen from 74% to 68% over the past 10 years. If the present trend continues, the home ownership rate could fall below 65% within 10 years. The possibility that more New Zealanders may remain in private rental accommodation throughout their lifetime has implications for social and health outcomes - security in old age; retirement income; aggregate household savings; and growth in Accommodation Supplement payments.

By providing Kiwibank’s Lender’s Mortgage Insurance, the Government, through HNZC is making it possible for Kiwibank to lend to individuals who previously would not qualify for home loans, making access to home ownership easier.

7\. What is the value of the Government’s mortgage insurance programme with HNZC?

The Government has budgeted $5.3 million to cover HNZC’s Lender’s Mortgage Insurance for the duration of the two-year trial. It is expected that this will cover about 1,800 home loans.

The Lender’s Mortgage Insurance premium under this trial is 3% of the total home loan. The Government, through HNZC will contribute 2%, so the borrower pays only a premium equivalent to 1% of their total home loan.

8\. Can HNZC tenants buy the house they’re in if they get a home loan as part of this trial?

No. HNZC tenants can’t buy the home they’re in.

9\. Why can’t tenants buy their own home?

This Government wants to retain state houses and make them available to those in greatest need, rather than deplete stocks through state house sales.

10\. Who can apply for a Kiwibank In Reach home loan as part of this trial?

Anyone who meets the criteria above can apply to Kiwibank from September 2003 by calling 0800 272 278.

11\. If an applicant qualifies, how much can they borrow?

The loan provided by Kiwibank will vary depending on individual circumstances and how much money the applicant already owes on things like hire purchase, credit cards, personal loans etc.

The maximum loan available under the Kiwibank In Reach initiative is $280,000.

12\. Do they need a deposit?

No, not if they qualify and are buying a home up to $100,000. However, if they’ve saved a deposit it will mean they maybe able to borrow more money for a home.

If buying a home over $100,000 a 5% deposit is required. This money could have been gifted.

While Kiwibank may be able to offer finance up to 100% of the purchase price for a home under $100,000, the borrower must arrange for a deposit to be paid to the seller when finance is approved. Kiwibank may be able to arrange finance for this, up to a maximum of $5,000.

13\. Can applications be made with any bank to benefit from this trial?

No. The trial is only be available through Kiwibank from September 2003 for two years. Once the trial is completed, the Government will decide whether to expand it.

14\. Can applications be made now?

No. It’s not available until September 2003.

15\. Where can we get more information about the costs and responsibilities of owning a home?

From September 2003 a booklet to help people make informed decisions about home ownership, including the costs and responsibilities of owning a home, will be available by contacting the Kiwibank Call Centre on 0800 272 278. The booklet will also be available on the HNZC website and copies will be available in HNZC’s Neighbourhood Units.
