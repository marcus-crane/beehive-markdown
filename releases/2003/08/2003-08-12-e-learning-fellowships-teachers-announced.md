Teachers can now apply for 10 new e-learning fellowships aimed at helping them expand their teaching and learning through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“Some $4.02 million has been earmarked for these year-long fellowships over the next four years. I believe these fellowships will greatly contribute to national and international research as new approaches to learning through ICT are developed and shared,” Trevor Mallard said.

“One of our government’s two top education priorities is building an education system that equips people with 21st century skills.

“ICT has virtually become an essential life skill so it’s important we give teachers greater opportunities to enhance their expertise and pass it on to others. The research produced as a result of these fellowships will add another important dimension to ICT use in schools.

“The fellowships are an important part of this year’s Budget Education where over $6 million was targeted to develop and expand effective e-learning practice in schools.

“Five fellowships will be awarded to primary teachers and five to secondary teachers. One fellowship will be targeted at a teacher working in a Te Reo Maori learning environment.”

Trevor Mallard said the fellowships provide successful applicants with:  
·release from their school for a calendar year;  
·targeted research opportunities as agreed with the Ministry of Education;  
·professional learning workshops and academic guidance from Ultralab South – in collaboration with other tertiary institutions;  
·ongoing support from an online learning community; and  
·workstation and ICT resources as required for their project.
