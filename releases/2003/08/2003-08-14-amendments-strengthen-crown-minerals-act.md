“The Crown Minerals Amendment Bill was passed by the House today, giving effect to the original policy intention of the Crown Minerals Act as it was passed in 1991” said the Associate Minister of Energy, Harry Duynhoven.

By removing the right of mining licence holders to extend or renew their licences, the bill addresses issues that have arisen through recent court decisions on the transition from the repealed Mining Act 1971 and Coal Mines Act 1979, to the Crown Minerals Act regime.

“When the Crown Minerals Act was enacted in 1991, the intention was always that existing mining licences under the old regime would not be able to be renewed or extended. To continue mining after any current mining licence expired, the holder would transfer to the new permitting system under the Crown Minerals Act. This was widely understood within the industry and was the basis upon which both officials and industry proceeded from 1991 onwards,” said Mr Duynhoven.

“I must stress that the Bill does not extinguish current mining licences. All current mining licences will continue in force until they expire. Nor does the Bill deny mining licence holders continuing opportunities to mine Crown owned minerals. When their licences are approaching expiry, licence holders will be able to apply for a mining permit under the Crown Minerals Act and I encourage them to do so,” concluded Mr Duynhoven.

Mr Duynhoven also noted that the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill strengthens the original Act by:  
·clarifying the requirements for an extension of duration of exploration permits;  
·providing that a permit remains current while an extension of duration is being processed;  
·clarifying the definition of ‘occupier’  
·removing the requirement for permit details to be registered with the District Land Registrar;  
·allowing for the decrease of minerals in a permit with the permit holder’s consent;  
·extending the unit development provisions to existing privileges;  
·providing that sections 90(4) and 90(7) concerning the release of information do not apply to royalty returns.

Additional information on the Glenharrow proceedings

In 2000, the High Court held in Glenharrow Holdings Limited v The Attorney General that the right of mining licence holders to apply for a new mining licence had not been extinguished by the Crown Minerals Act. The Court also held that it is still possible to extend the term of a mining licence as a variation of the conditions of the licence.

However, in April 2003, three Court of Appeal judges confirmed unanimously what the Crown has consistently maintained, which is that since the old legislation was repealed in 1991, the Minister of Energy has neither had the power to grant a new licence nor to consider an application to vary the term of a licence.

Glenharrow Holdings Limited has been granted conditional leave to appeal this decision to the Privy Council. The Bill includes special provisions to ensure that the Court’s final judgment in the ongoing Glenharrow proceedings is protected and that the decisions in this litigation are applied to any applications that were received prior to 5:00pm on 19 September 2002, including applications by Glenharrow Holdings Limited.
