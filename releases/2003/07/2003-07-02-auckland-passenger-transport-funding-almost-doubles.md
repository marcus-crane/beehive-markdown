Funding for passenger transport in the Auckland region has almost doubled with just over $60 million being allocated for the 2003/04 financial year, says the Minister for Auckland Issues and Associate Minister for Transport, Judith Tizard.

Judith Tizard says this week’s funding announcements by Transfund include a 94 percent increase on the 2002/03 figure for passenger transport in Auckland.

“This government promised to work with Auckland to improve public transport as part of an efficient, integrated transport system to allow people and goods to move freely around the region. The New Zealand Transport Strategy sets out a real commitment to a network of roads, walking and cycling ways, ferries, trains and buses and bus ways to reduce congestion and to give people in Auckland real choices about how they get to work, to education and leisure activities and how they move freight.” Judith Tizard said.

The funding increase reflects the growth anticipated in use of public transport, some credits for unused funding, support for continued design of the North Shore busway and the refurbishment of rail carriages.

“Patronage numbers have increased from 38 million for the year ended June 2000 to an expected 52 million in the year just ended June 2003. This is an increase of 37 percent over the last three years and we expect this trend to continue.

“Another $15.1 million also goes to passenger transport services for baseline funding, which is made up of the base rail, bus and ferry services already in place at the start of the patronage funding scheme,” said Judith Tizard.

Funding has been allocated to continue to support a number of new bus services initiated under Transfund’s kickstart funding. These include an increased number of early morning, late night and Sunday bus services on routes such as New North and Sandringham roads; Dominion Road; Botany to Midtown; Howick, Pakuranga and Botany; South Auckland; North Shore; and East Coast bays.

Other services which continue to be supported are commercial trial services for New North and Sandringham roads; Remuera Road; the Hibiscus Flyer; Papakura Express services; Onehunga peak services; and the East Coast bays services.

Funding also goes to ferry services in the region, including the Devonport and Half Moon Bay mid week and weekend ferry services.

Also earmarked is funding for more bus shelters and bus priority lanes in the region and the marketing of passenger transport services to the wider community. Ongoing funding is committed to the design of the North Shore busway, with construction of the busway expected to begin later in the financial year.

Over $5 million has been allocated for concessionary fares and paratransit services for people with disabilities and transport disadvantage and $1.2 million is for the continued refurbishment of Auckland’s rail carriages.

“This huge increase in expenditure on public transport is another green light signal of the government’s comprehensive efforts to solve Auckland’s transport problems,” said Judith Tizard.
