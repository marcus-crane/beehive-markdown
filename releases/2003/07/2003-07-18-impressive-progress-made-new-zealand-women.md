New Zealand had adopted a very sensitive approach to women’s human rights and had a good chance of becoming a good practice example to many countries of the world, Ayse Feride Acar, chairperson of the United Nations Committee, Convention for Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), said.

Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson presented New Zealand’s 5th report to the CEDAW committee in New York this week. The report covers the period March 1998 to 1 September 2002.

With impressive legislation for the advancement of women and women filling New Zealand’s four most powerful positions, including that of the Prime Minister, expert members of the CEDAW Committee cautioned against complacency in a seemingly ideal situation. The Committee said it was important to make sure that the current thrust was sustained and that there was no slip-back in the future.

Ruth Dyson said, “Since the government’s last report to CEDAW in 1998, we have introduced a number of significant measures to improve women’s lives. These include the introduction of 12 weeks paid parental leave, following serious concerns from CEDAW about the National government’s lack of action on this issue throughout the 1990s.

Ruth Dyson said other key measures for women introduced since the last CEDAW report included:  
·setting up a pay equity taskforce to look at ways to reduce the gender pay gap;  
·establishing an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Commissioner in the Human Rights Commission;  
·amending the Matrimonial Property Act to address economic disparities between partners when a marriage or relationship breaks down;  
·implementing Te Rito: New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy;  
·requiring gender analysis of papers submitted to Cabinet;  
·publishing a Time Use Survey providing robust information on the paid and unpaid work of women and men.

Ms Dyson said CEDAW provided a useful international yardstick against which to measure progress for New Zealand’s women.

“The Status of Women in New Zealand 2002 is a valuable record of the position of New Zealand women today. This report provides the CEDAW committee and the New Zealand people with an understanding of the issues affecting women in this country so that we can work together to improve the status of all women.  
“While the CEDAW report shows many positive gains, it also acts as a reminder that structural and systemic inequalities still exist for women in New Zealand. To address these inequalities, the government is developing a Women’s Action Plan which will be completed by the end of the year.”

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was drawn up and adopted by the United Nations in December 1979 as a result of the First World Conference on Women held in Mexico City in 1975.

CEDAW is an international bill of rights for women that recognises women’s rights in political, cultural, economic, social and family life. It was adopted by New Zealand in 1985.

The CEDAW Committee’s “concluding observations” on New Zealand’s fifth CEDAW report wil be available at the end of July.

Optional Protocol to CEDAW  
In September 2000, Prime Minister Helen Clark signed and ratified the Optional Protocol to CEDAW. This allows women alleging a violation of the provisions of CEDAW to make individual complaints to the international commission if they have exhausted all avenues of redress in their home country.

Reservations to CEDAW  
Governments that decide to adopt CEDAW must bring in laws and other measures to conform to its 16 articles. They may have “reservations” where their laws do not conform fully to the Convention, but these reservations must not go against its main purpose.

New Zealand has had a reservation to CEDAW about maternity leave with pay. The introduction of a paid parental leave scheme has recently enabled the government to lift this reservation.

New Zealand also has a reservation regarding women in armed combat. It will consider lifting this reservation in 2005 when new equipment to remove strength barriers to women’s participation in the New Zealand Army will be in place.

NGO CEDAW Reports  
Representatives from the National Council of Women, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Mäori Women’s Welfare League presented NGO reports to the CEDAW Committee in New York on 7 July 2003.
