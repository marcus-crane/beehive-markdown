There was just one work stoppage recorded for the March 2003 quarter, the lowest result since the recording of quarterly figures began in 1945.

Labour Minister Margaret Wilson says the latest figures released by Statistics New Zealand today are an endorsement of the Employment Relations Act to the extent that it reflects the non-adverserial approach promoted by the Act.

The one work stoppage recorded last quarter was resolved through the help of the Department of Labour’s Mediation Services.

“Mediation is one of the great successes of the ERA and I am sure it will continue to prove its worth in resolving disputes,” Margaret Wilson said.
