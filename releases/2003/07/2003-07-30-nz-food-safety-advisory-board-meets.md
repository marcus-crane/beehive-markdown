Food Safety Minister Annette King said the New Zealand Food Safety Advisory Board met for the first time in Wellington today.

The Board, which is an independent body and will report to the Food Safety Minister, will be chaired by former Wellington Mayor and MP Fran Wilde.

“I am very pleased Fran Wilde has agreed to chair the board. She has a wealth of experience in business, trade and community issues,” said Ms King.

“The New Zealand Food Safety Authority is embarking on a major review of the New Zealand domestic food regulatory programme. The Board’s role is to assure me that New Zealand’s domestic food policy incorporates consumer, industry and health expectations. It will advise me on all aspects of the regulatory programme for food sold within New Zealand. That includes imported food.

“The members of this Board have been chosen for their experience, knowledge and expertise and I believe the appointments reflect the Government’s desire to incorporate the interests of everyone involved in food safety, from the consumer through to the producer.”

The appointments are for a two-year period. Other Board members are: David Russell, Chief Executive, Consumers’ Institute, representing consumers; Patsy Gordon, Consumers’ Forum on Food Safety representative and Rural Women NZ member representing consumers; Melino Maka, Pacific Island representative on Consumers’ Forum on Food Safety, representing consumers; Percy Tipene, Te Waka Kai Ora, Maori producer; Dr Donald Campbell, Medical Officer of Health, Palmerston North, representing health professionals; Professor Ian Shaw, Food Safety Programme Leader, Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR), representing science providers; Brenda Cutress, Executive Director, New Zealand Grocery Marketers Association, representing food processors; Tom Lambie, President, Federated Farmers, representing food producers; Colin Harvey, President, Animal Remedy and Plant Protection Association and Managing Director of Ancare, representing food “interface” groups; John Albertson, Chief Executive, New Zealand Retailers Association, representing retailers; Brian Lynch, Executive Director Meat Industry Association and Direct Food and Beverage Exporters Council, representing exporters.
