Maori are tuning into Iwi radio in large numbers according to a survey carried out by Massey University.

Commissioned by Te Mangai Paho, the survey of almost 28-thousand Maori found that half of those living in areas covered by Maori radio are tuning in to listen on a regular basis.

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said the findings are important because it shows that it is necessary to provide a broadcast service tailored to meet our needs and aspirations of Maori.

"It is appropriate that these results have been released during Maori language week because some of the findings show that many people regard Iwi radio as a lifeline to keeping them in touch with the Maori world," Parekura Horomia said.

Of those who listened just over half (51.38%) rated the amount of Maori language broadcast as excellent or very good, while another 32% rated the amount as okay. As well 43% thought Iwi radio was an excellent tool in helping them learn the language.

"This year's budget has allocated a further $1-million toward improving Iwi radio services over the next three years and I intend to ensure that our capacity is maintained."
