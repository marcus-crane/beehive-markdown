The Appeal Court ruling on a claim by eight iwi that the Marlborough foreshore and seabed was Maori customary land generated a lot of heat last week. Shedding a little light, rather than heat, on the subject would be helpful.

First the facts of the case: eight iwi applied to the Maori Land Court to have land between high and low tide declared to be Maori customary land. They asked that, if the land was found to be Maori customary land, the court investigate customary title to that land.

The Appeal Court ruled that Maori customary rights were not extinguished by the Crown assuming sovereignty, and allowed the iwi to have their claim heard by the Maori Land Court.

Prime Minister Helen Clark indicated that the Government would legislate to assert Crown ownership of the seabed and foreshore.

Helen Clark knew, as I knew, that if you say to a Kiwi "your rights to take your kids down to the beach for a barbie are going to be impaired because of the rights of Maori," you immediately alienate 85 per cent of New Zealanders, and in a democracy you obviously have to take into account that sort of figure.

In 25 years of Treaty jurisprudence, no private rights that Kiwis have enjoyed have ever been over-ridden by any Treaty settlement process.

But that doesn't mean that when protecting the rights of the majority, you don't also have a responsibility to balance their rights against the rights of the minority, and as Maori we do have rights that no other group has.

Maori were understandably concerned that the Government was moving to extinguish their customary rights, and those concerns must be addressed.

The Appeal Court decision noted that there is a long history of Maori customary property and rights in areas covered by water. And in more than a century and a half of European settlement of this country, a right for all New Zealanders to enjoy unfettered access to our beaches has firmly established itself.

My father called the sea "kapata kai" - food cupboard. He saw the sea and our take from the sea as merely an extension of our rights on the land; there was no difference.

The fishing grounds are all named – those names were passed down to me, and I will pass them on to my kids. The seasons when the crayfish are running, and the mussels, kina and paua are the fattest are all told to you. There were specific fishing areas that had been used for generations by the group of families that owned our land block.

My personal understanding is that customary title would mean the continuation of the rights my father taught me to pursue and use - it doesn't mean ownership of the water or seabed. These things are given to us by the god of the sea – we are really there to protect our use rights for future generations.

Maori are going to explore as a people what customary right means. Some Maori will argue that it is an absolute and exclusive right. The Government may argue that that is too tough. And if you are going to take away a right, you have to compensate for the loss of that right.

Some Maori are talking about exclusive ownership of the seabed and foreshore; I want a customary use right. My Dad didn't bring me up to believe I owned the seabed. He taught me to respect the sea, because it could kill you – but it will also feed you.

This debate was put in the too hard basket by Doug Graham in 1992 when he settled the commercial aspects of Maori fishing rights with the Sealord deal, but did not determine what the customary rights were.

The Appeal Court ruled that the Maori Land Court should conduct an investigation of the extent of that customary right because there is no doubt that such a right exists.

What we must do now is embark on the debate on how we define and protect those customary rights. As a start, a committee of senior ministers, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen, will engage with the Maori caucus and Maori communities to negotiate a way through this debate. It might not be an easy debate, but it is a debate that must take place, and it a debate in which we must reach a result that is fair - for everyone.

So what I would advise everyone do is this: go down to the beach, fire up your barbie, because everything is going to be the same tomorrow as it was yesterday
