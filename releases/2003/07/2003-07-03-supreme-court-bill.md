The Supreme Court Bill now before Parliament provides for New Zealand’s final court of appeal to be located in New Zealand, rather than with the Privy Council 20,000 km away in London. This marks the coming of age of New Zealand’s judicial system.

The bill provides for an independent Supreme Court sitting above the Court of Appeal, headed by the Chief Justice (the head of New Zealand’s judiciary) and with four other permanent judges, including one well-versed in tikanga Maori.

This will improve access to justice for all New Zealanders by reducing costs – nobody will have to pay the cost of a lawyer traveling to the other side of the world to represent them – and by providing an opportunity for appeals from specialist courts such as the Family Court, the Environment Court and the Employment Court.

This proposal has been a long time in the making. Severing ties with the Privy Council was first raised about 20 years ago, and successive Labour and National-led governments have addressed the issue. When the Supreme Court Bill came to Parliament in December it followed two years of consultation and development, during which 70 submissions were received from the public.

The proposal was also made public before last year’s general election, so that voters could take it into account. Since then, almost 300 individuals and organisations have made submissions to the parliamentary select committee considering the bill.

It is an important change, but not major constitutional change, as Opposition parties would have us believe. It certainly does not require taxpayers to spend $10 million on a referendum. A referendum asks a very simplistic question, whereas a select committee hearing enables different views to be contested and misunderstandings to be cleared up.

Parliament is perfectly capable of making decisions on this matter. Lord Cooke of Thorndon, who served with distinction on the Privy Council, has said Parliament has to take responsibility for change, as it always has with matters of court structure.

The 1986 Royal Commission on the Electoral System concluded that referenda were blunt and crude devices “to be used with care and circumspection”. It would be extremely unusual for a country to use a referendum to determine the structure, jurisdiction or membership of its courts.

Australia and Canada have both abolished appeals to the Privy Council and neither country referred the matter to a referendum, even though Australia’s Constitution Act has a requirement for referenda to be conducted on important constitutional change. Clearly the issue of appeals by Australians to the Privy Council was not placed in that category.

Opinion polls have shown the New Zealand public is largely supportive of change. There has been much positive feedback from the legal fraternity, and some expressions of concern. Some in business believe a New Zealand Supreme Court may deter foreign investment by being seen as out of touch with the rest of the world, but that has not been borne out by the experiences of Australia, Canada or Singapore. On balance I believe people are confident this country can manage its own final appeals.

Canada abolished all appeals to the Privy Council in 1949, South Africa in 1950 and Australia in 1986. Caribbean countries plan to withdraw by the end of the year, leaving only New Zealand, the Bahamas, Brunei, Kiribati, Mauritius and Tuvalu.

Even in Britain the government is proposing to create a new Supreme Court as the highest court in the land.

It is now time for New Zealand’s judicial system to finally come of age and take responsibility for its own courts.
