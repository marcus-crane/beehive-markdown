Police Minister George Hawkins today opened the new Howick police station.

Mr Hawkins paid tribute to Manukau Mayor Sir Barry Curtis, who worked with police to find a new building to replace the former Howick station. The new station is situated on the corner of Fencible Drive and Moore St, in a building leased from Manukau City Council.

Howick station looks after an area of around 198 square kilometers, including around 94,000 people within the Howick and Pakuranga Wards, and the Beachlands and Maraetei areas of Clevedon Ward.

Police undertook the refurbishment to meet operational requirements for the station’s 31 sworn and five non-sworn staff. The cost of the project including furniture and fittings, IT requirements and security systems was in the order of $750,000. the project was completed below the anticipated budget allocation.

“Howick now boasts police facilities that are second to none,” Mr Hawkins said.

A committed police capital works programme ensured staff enjoyed comfortable, satisfying conditions in which to do their important work, he said

“Compared with an average of only around $725,000 a year spent between 1996 and 1999 on New Zealand police property, the Labour-led government currently invests around $12 million annually on refurbishing and rebuilding stations nationwide.

Shortly the communities of Manurewa, Invercargill, and Oamaru, will celebrate opening new stations in their areas, he said.

The station project was overseen by RDT Pacific, with Opus International as architects and Canam contractors.
