A major report providing an updated picture of the well being and quality of life in New Zealand was released today by the Minister for Social Development, Steve Maharey.

The Social Report 2003, provides a detailed look at New Zealand society - how well we are doing, where we have come from and how different groups are faring.

Steve Maharey said the report shows a largely positive picture. "New Zealanders are living longer, healthier lives. We are better educated, safer and earn more than in the past. More children are receiving early childhood education and more people are involved in tertiary education. Unemployment is down and economic growth is up."

The Social Report 2003 presents information under the broad headings of health, knowledge and skills, paid work, economic standard of living, civil and political rights, cultural identity, the physical environment, safety and social connectedness.

The Minister said: "While the progress revealed in the Social Report is the result of a wide range of influences, this Government believes that its approach to social, economic and environmental development has been an important factor.

"An essential part of the Government's approach to improve social outcomes is to understand that we have a key role but that we must also work in partnership with others. Families, communities and businesses are all key to improving the well being of New Zealanders."

Steve Maharey said that while the gains seen in the 2003 report are generally shared by all New Zealanders there are points of concern. "Average outcomes for Maori and Pacific peoples are poorer than the national average, although they are improving. Young people are also clearly identified as a priority for social investment.

"We need to ensure that our young people have the best opportunities in life. The Government is working towards this with initiatives such as those set out in the Sustainable Development Programme of Action aimed at improving young peoples' living standards, health, success in education and transition into employment and ability to live free from violence and crime.  
"That is why we are working closely with partners on initiatives such as the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs."

Steve Maharey said this year's Budget included funding for a number of the Government priorities in social policy. These include:

- Improving skills and education
- Widening access to high quality healthcare
- Reducing crime
- Reforming social assistance to families and improving opportunities to move into paid work
- Improving availability for safe and affordable housing
- Supporting families and communities.

Steve Maharey said the Social Report is an important document because of the information it provides and because social reporting plays a part in promoting open and transparent government and better public debate. "It helps to build understanding of how well we are doing as a nation. In this sense, The Social Report is of value to all New Zealanders as well as to policy makers and Government," he said.
