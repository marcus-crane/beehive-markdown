Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard today congratulated the new world netball champions, the Silver Ferns, who fought hard to beat Australia in a heart-stopping final in Jamaica today.

“The Silver Ferns have campaigned long and hard to win this title after narrowly missing out in the one-goal loss of 1999. This is a phenomenal result – the last time New Zealand won the world champs was sixteen years ago – in 1987,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This win is testament to the courage, character, skill and fortitude of the team, backed by coach Ruth Aitken.

“The final today, with a score of 49-47, was incredibly thrilling and close. Australia, who have been world champions since 1991, deserves recognition for putting up an impressive fight.

“This win must be especially satisfying for Belinda Colling, Anna Rowberry and Lesley Nichol who experienced the anguish of the loss in the 1999 final against Australia.

“I’ve followed this team closely and I’m delighted at their success. I know the rest of New Zealand will join me in celebrating this victory particularly in light of the many close trans-Tasman results in sport over the years,” Trevor Mallard said.
