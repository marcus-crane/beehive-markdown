Prime Minister Helen Clark joins 14 other heads of government at the Progressive Governance Summit in London this week, following an official visit to Wales.

Helen Clark will also attend important events showcasing New Zealand in the United Kingdom, including the premiere in London of “Whale Rider” and the Toast Life New Zealand wine and food festival.

“The Progressive Governance Summit brings together broadly likeminded heads of government. This year it is being hosted by Tony Blair. The agenda ranges widely over economic and social policy, including migration, and international affairs.

“The meeting also provides an opportunity for me to brief other leaders on issues of concern to New Zealand, such as the WTO negotiations. The recent European Union decisions on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy are encouraging for the WTO Round. It will also be useful to be able to meet with leaders of three countries due to enter the EU next year.”

The Prime Minister will also call on Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and the Leader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Wales, Peter Hain.

In Wales, she will address the Welsh Assembly, meet with business leaders, and visit the Royal Mint where New Zealand coins are made.

“Devolution has enabled Wales to take greater responsibility for its own affairs. It shares with New Zealand an emphasis on growth and innovation policies and on knowledge-based industries. New Zealand also has longstanding links with Wales, including through rugby contests.”

The Prime Minister will be in the United Kingdom from 8 to 14 July.
