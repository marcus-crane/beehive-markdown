State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today officially launched a new government initiative aimed at improving public services through the development of high-calibre public service leaders.

“The Executive Leadership Programme will be run by the State Services Commission through a new Leadership Development Centre with funding set in the May budget at $9.83 million over four years,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Today’s launch represents a major step forward for the state sector.  
It’s part of this Government’s commitment to improving the delivery of services to New Zealanders by strengthening the public service.

“Boosting people development is one of the highest priorities for the state sector in general, and the public service in particular,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This programme is recognition by the Government that a strong future for the country requires solid foundations – effective senior management within the public service is key to this.

“The public service's role is to advise the Government, to implement its policies, and to deliver high quality services for New Zealanders. To do this well requires leadership, good management and a strong values-based culture that supports high standards of quality and integrity.”

In the first year of the executive leadership programme, the intake will be between 25 and 40 people, rising to 200 people in the overall pool after five years. Individual professional development plans will be designed for each manager and may include training such as secondments to other departments, specific skills and management development courses or academic study.  
“This initiative will bring about significant change in the way senior management talent is developed and supported in the future and will make state sector management a much more attractive career option for talented people,” Trevor Mallard said.
