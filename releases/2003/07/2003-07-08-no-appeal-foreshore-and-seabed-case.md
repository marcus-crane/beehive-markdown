The Government will not appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the foreshore and seabed case.

The Court of Appeal decision highlighted the need for the government to give careful consideration to the process for exploring questions about the nature of any ongoing Maori customary rights.

The questions are timely, given the range of current policy initiatives affecting the use of coastal space. It is unlikely that a single court decision could provide adequate answers, especially as the Court of Appeal decision itself was concerned only with the narrow and technical question of jurisdiction.

The government considers these questions can be best addressed by working and talking through the issues, so that policy can be developed to give effect to previously stated objectives: to acknowledge and protect Maori customary rights and to protect the public interest (including the ability of all New Zealanders to enjoy traditional access to, and use of, the seabed and foreshore).
