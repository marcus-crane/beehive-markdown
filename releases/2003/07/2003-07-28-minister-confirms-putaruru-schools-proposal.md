Education Minister Trevor Mallard today confirmed his original proposal for the review of schools in the Putaruru area, in a reorganisation that will unlock an estimated $4.9 million for the education of local students.

“I have made a final decision about Okoroire and Tapapa schools and they can proceed towards merger immediately on the Okoroire site. These schools have indicated their willingness to merge and have indicated that they do not require any further consultation period.

“I have also indicated that it is appropriate to advertise the principals’ positions for the new town primary and secondary schools, if the establishment committees set up by the continuing boards think that is appropriate. The appointments to these positions may not be made until after I make my final decision on the entire review proposal.

“I believe we have received the best advice possible from schools and their communities and I’d like to thank everyone for their comments. After weighing up all the evidence and feedback, I still firmly believe that the initial proposal is the best way forward to consolidate and strengthen education in the area,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This review is about making sure our children continue to get a high standard of education wherever they live and despite population decline. We also need to make sure we are spending money on teaching children well, and not on maintaining unnecessary buildings. I believe it’s better to tackle issues now and plan for a positive future, rather than wait until we are on the back foot.

“Savings made as a result of the review will go back into schools.  
According to current estimates, $2.4 million in educational development initiative funding will be available to schools, along with a fund of nearly $700,000 for schools to use jointly plus $1.8 million of additional property funding,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard’s firm preferences for the other schools in the review are:  
·The retention of Te Waotu, Tirau and Lichfield Primary Schools;  
·The merger of Putaruru Intermediate and Putaruru High School on the High School site with the Putaruru Intermediate School board of trustees governing the new school until new elections are held; and  
·The merger of Cambridge St, Oraka Heights, Putaruru West and Puketurua-Arapuni schools on the Intermediate school site, with the Putaruru West board of trustees governing the new school until new elections are held.

Trevor Mallard expects to make his final decisions in early September after further consultation with the schools involved. The Ministry of Education will work closely with the schools to ensure a smooth transition so the changes will be in place in time for the 2004 school year.
