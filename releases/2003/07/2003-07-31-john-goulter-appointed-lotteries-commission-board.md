John Goulter has been appointed to the New Zealand Lotteries Commission Board.

Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins said Mr Goulter would take over as the Board’s Presiding Member following the retirement this October of Kerry Marshall.

Mr Goulter recently retired as the Chief Executive of Auckland International Airport, a position he had held since 1988. Previously he worked for a number of years with Ceramco New Zealand. He is currently a member of the Reserve Bank Board, and a director of the New Zealand Business and Parliament Trust.

Mr Goulter was named Business Leader of the Year by the Business Herald in 1999, and was a finalist in the 2002 Executive of the Year awards.

In announcing Mr Goulter’s appointment, Mr Hawkins acknowledged the strong contribution of Kerry Marshall in his time leading the Commission.

In addition to Mr Marshall for the remainder of his term, Mr Goulter joins current Commission members Charles Chauvel, Kaye McKelvie and Sue Driver.

Mr Goulter began working with the Board on 1 July.
