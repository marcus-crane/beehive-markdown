Pharmac's decision to allow doctors and their patients to determine the frequency of prescription dispensing is a good outcome, says the Associate Minister for Rural Affairs and Health, Damien O'Connor.

Pharmac announced yesterday that from 1 October 2003, people will only have to visit their pharmacy once to pick up the majority of their prescriptions. However, doctors will be able to choose more frequent dispensings, such as monthly, if they decide their patient needs it.

"I'm very pleased that Pharmac has listened to the vast number of submissions received and decided to include this flexibility into the dispensing changes. Doctors and patients can decide the appropriate timeframes, and pharmacists will continue to be paid a fee for those monthly prescriptions," Mr O'Connor said.

DHB's will be able to reinvest savings of $132 million over the next five years into essential health care services, a greater range of expensive drug treatments and pharmacy services.

"Local pharmacies play a vital role in their communities. I am pleased to see the new dispensing regime will be reviewed within a year of it coming into operation.

“People in rural areas have enjoyed the convenience of three-monthly dispensing since 1996, so this will present little or no change for many people in rural NZ,” said Damien O’Connor.
