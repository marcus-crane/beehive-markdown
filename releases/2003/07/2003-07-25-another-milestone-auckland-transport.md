Judith Tizard, Minister for Auckland Issues and Associate Minister of Transport, today applauded the opening of the Britomart Transport Centre.

"This is another major milestone in the development of Auckland's passenger transport system,” she said. “It has been a long and sometimes bumpy ride to get to this stage but passenger transport is finally moving in Auckland.”

“The official opening of Britomart joins the arrival of Auckland’s first renovated train last December and the start of construction of the North Shore Busway in March this year as milestones in achieving this government’s vision for transport in New Zealand.

“The continuing partnership between the government, Auckland City Council, Auckland Regional Council, Infrastructure Auckland, and the Auckland Territorial Local Authorities through Auckland Regional Transport Network Limited that has finally delivered the world-class facility we see today. It is the start of an integrated transport system of roads, rail and ferry services for all of Auckland’s transport needs.

"But there is much more to be done. To make the most of Britomart, we need more trains running more services, we need to improve the railway lines and we need to upgrade and secure stations along those lines. The ARC and ARTNL, with funding from Infrastructure Auckland, the Regional Council, and Transfund, are well advanced in doing just that.

"The government's purchase of the Auckland rail network for $81 million has provided a stable foundation for rail development in Auckland. Last month Transfund announced a 41 per cent increase in funding for passenger transport and Alternatives to Roading. This financial contribution will ensure pace of progress continues.”
