"Vehicle emissions are a major concern to the government and we are actively working on a number of steps to reduce emissions and their related effects," Associate Transport Minister Judith Tizard said today.

Judith Tizard was responding to an environmental group's concerns that new figures show carbon dioxide emissions from domestic transport grew by ten-percent between 2001 and 2002, more than twice the average annual increase since 1990.

“Vehicle emissions are a major source of health problems, including asthma, heart disease and bronchitis,” said Ms Tizard. “A report released last year estimates that this “invisible” road toll is almost equal to the number of people who are killed on our roads each year.

"This is clearly cause for concern and we are not being complacent about those figures.

"This government is addressing the causes and effects of vehicle emissions in a number of ways across the transport sector:

·We are developing a Vehicle Emissions Policy, which I expect to go to Cabinet in August. This will present a full range of proposals intended to further reduce vehicle emission levels;  
·We are about to sign off a new Vehicle Emissions Rule which comes into effect in January 2004. This rule will ensure that all vehicles entering this country are at least built to a standard that can run efficiently and cleanly on New Zealand fuel;  
·We are putting major resources into easing the Auckland region's severe congestion problem, which contributes to pollution from vehicle emissions;  
·We have seen a reduction in sulphur levels in diesel

"The government takes seriously the health and environmental impacts of pollution from vehicle emissions and I can assure ECO and other concerned parties that we are working closely and constantly with the transport sector and local government on reducing emissions across New Zealand," said Judith Tizard.
