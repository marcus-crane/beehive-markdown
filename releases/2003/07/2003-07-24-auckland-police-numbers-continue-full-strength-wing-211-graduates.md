Auckland police numbers continue at full strength following today’s graduation of 56 new Constables from Wing 211 at the Porirua Police College.

Police Minister George Hawkins says 29 of the new Constables are bound for Auckland, meaning Auckland police numbers would  
continue at full strength.

“Today’s graduates, along with former police recruited recently from the United Kingdom and a policy of directing to Auckland the majority of graduates from recent Wings, means Auckland police numbers continue at full strength,” Mr Hawkins said.

Currently, in excess of 2000 sworn officers operate across Auckland’s three police districts. Staff targets are set by the Police Commissioner.

Wing 211 graduates spent some of their time at the College training alongside 74 former police recruited earlier this year from the United Kingdom. These police began serving in Auckland City and Counties Manukau Districts at the beginning of July.

Wing 211 was made up of 38 males and 18 females aged between 20 and 48 years. They included four former nurses, as well as representatives from all the armed forces, a former croupier, restaurant owner, and househusband. The Wing encompassed a mix of cultures.

While 29 of the Wing will go to the Auckland districts, 19 will be posted throughout the North Island and eight to South Island stations.

Sir Murray Halberg was the Patron of Wing 211.
