From today, 1 July, businesses and regions can work with a one-stop shop economic development agency which will advise on exporting, expansion, marketing, investment and the full range of government business support.

Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton and Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton today launched New Zealand Trade and Enterprise which has been created from the merger of Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand. The new agency builds on the strengths of both organisations.

“We want to see more innovation, stronger businesses and stronger regions all leading to long term sustainable, high quality jobs, and this new agency is a key part of achieving this goal,” said Jim Anderton.

“This Labour Progressive Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that New Zealand businesses, industries and regions can strive to be internationally competitive and this requires more Government partnership support tailored to meet the needs of businesses,” said Jim Anderton.

Jim Sutton said the decision to merge Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand would assist our exporters and support our major export industries.

“Overseas customers are likely to notice that our exporters have upped their game but there will be no interruption of support or assistance from those who are advising our export businesses.

“This new organisation will help our businesses to do better, so that New Zealand will perform better on the world stage,” Jim Sutton said.

The board of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise was announced last year and the new CEO Tim Gibson was appointed in March 2003.

The legislation to create NZ Trade and Enterprise was passed last week.
