New Zealand’s tourism sector is about to get its own TV show. Business Class, a weekly 30-minute magazine programme that will provide small and medium sized tourism businesses with strategic information and operational advice, has just gone into production.

The programme, which has just been allocated $200,000 of Tourism Strategy Implementation funding, will act as a vehicle for capability building within the industry, as well as complementing the wide range of educational material already available through the Ministry of Tourism’s core tourism data set and Industry New Zealand’s BizInfo service.

Mark Burton stressed the importance of communicating with New Zealand’s small and medium sized tourism businesses, as well as to a broader audience.

“Our tourism sector comprises between 13,500 – 18,000 small and medium sized businesses. Currently, operators are able to access information and advice from a number of agencies and organisations. Many, however, are unaware of these sources; particularly those who are may be new to the industry or who have entered tourism for lifestyle reasons. They may therefore have a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry’s current operating environment or of quality business practice.

”Television is an ideal medium for reaching this target audience and delivering the kind of up-to-date information they need in an interesting, accessible way. In addition, it will give the wider viewing audience an insight on what’s happening in New Zealand’s tourism sector.

“Business Class will also have its own website, offering detailed information about the contents of each segment. It will also provide links to relevant websites, other information sources, and further assistance. Fresh Media, the production company behind Business Class, will work closely with the Ministry of Tourism, the Tourism Research Council, Qualmark, Tourism New Zealand, the Tourism Industry Association, Regional Tourism Organisations, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to ensure that the information and advice provided on the programme and the website is accurate, up to date and consistent with current sector thinking.  
“Quality is the key to building a truly sustainable, world-class tourism sector for New Zealand. This programme is an ideal way for industry stakeholders to effectively share ideas, information, and best practice models.”  
Business Class will screen at midday on TV3, and is scheduled to go to air on August 17.
