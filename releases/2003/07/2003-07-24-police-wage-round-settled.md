This year’s police wage round includes a general wage adjustment and increases to most allowances of three per cent from 1 July 2003, two per cent next year and 2.5 per cent the following year.

“The settlement was ratified this month with over 90 per cent of Police Association and Public Service Association members voting in favour of the proposal after 77 meetings around the country,“ Police Minister George Hawkins said.

For the first time, the agreement changed police remuneration structure from performance pay to competency and service based pay.

Mr Hawkins said at just under $1 billion annually Vote Police was at its highest rate ever. “Not only are there more police than ever, but they are better funded than ever,” he said.

The police capital works programme of $60 million over five years had seen the opening in Manurewa last Friday of the sixth new station in New Zealand this millennium. Numerous other stations, most recently Westport, had been refurbished and upgraded within the Labour-led Government’s term.

“This compares with an average of only around $725,000 a year spent on police property between 1996 and 1999 under the National-led Government,” Mr Hawkins said.

Auckland staffing levels continued at full strength after several initiatives to increase staff numbers. These included a $1m recruitment campaign, bringing in experienced police from the United Kingdom, a pilot ‘cadet’ scheme targeting young people and taking on more non-sworn staff.

More money had also been spent on upgrading the police vehicle fleet and equipment. “Compare that with the 1998 Review of Police Administration, or Martin review, commissioned by the National Party which initially planned to cut 540 police jobs,” Mr Hawkins said.
