A ‘who’s who’ of New Zealand music has signed up to the Government’s Music Industry Export Development Group to help identify what needs to be done to take New Zealand music to the world, by boosting sales and increasing awareness of New Zealand talent.

The 17-member group, picked for its commercial experience and strategic thinking, was announced today by the Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister, Jim Anderton and the Arts, Culture and Heritage Associate Minister, Judith Tizard.

Jim Anderton said the New Zealand music industry was currently strong domestically. “What we have got to do internally is build on that domestic strength to become a real force internationally.

“I want this group to be focused on economic development, through exports, of the domestic, and particularly New Zealand-owned, music industry.”  
The export group includes New Zealanders who have played leading roles in international music, top industry promoters, musicians and representatives from independent recording companies, major international recording companies, Maori and Pacific music and the New Zealand Music Industry Commission.

Judith Tizard said, “there is no better promotion for New Zealand than our forms of cultural expression, like music. The formation of this Export Group, building on our local industry strength and supported by the who’s who of New Zealand music, is a vital step in giving New Zealand music the international prominence it deserves”.

This review will provide material for the export group when it meets for the first time for a three-day session in September.

Jim Anderton said the Government wanted the group to provide it with an agreed industry plan that sets out what the industry and government, in partnership, need to do to realise and sustain the export potential of the New Zealand music industry.
