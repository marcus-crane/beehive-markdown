Senior officials from New Zealand and the United States met in Wellington today to consolidate cooperation under the bilateral climate change partnership. Through this initiative, the U.S. and New Zealand have committed to enhanced bilateral dialogue and practical cooperation on climate change.

The U.S. delegation to New Zealand was led by Dr Harlan Watson, Senior Climate Negotiator and Special Representative of the Department of State. Dr Watson headed a delegation including representatives from the Departments of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), Energy and State, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation, and the Consortium for Agricultural Soils Mitigation of Greenhouse Gases (CASMGS), a consortium of nine U.S. universities and a national laboratory assembled to investigate agricultural soils to mitigate greenhouse gases.

During his visit to New Zealand, Dr Watson met with the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Hon Pete Hodgson. He also met with a range of senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Climate Change Office, the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Treasury, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), as well as climate change scientists from a number of agencies, including the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), Landcare Research, CRL Energy Ltd, Massey University, Victoria University of Wellington and Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences.

The exchanges underscored the significant amount of cooperation which already exists between the U.S. and New Zealand in the area of climate change research.

A number of new projects were initiated under the partnership in the following nine areas: climate change science; technology development; greenhouse gas accounting in forestry and agriculture; engagement with business; cooperation with developing countries; climate change research in Antarctica; and public education initiatives. The two sides also discussed a number of policy issues including process and product standards to achieve common best practice benchmarks for appliances, vehicles and industry processes, as well as the development of emissions registries. Specific projects included under the partnership are identified in an attachment to this statement.
