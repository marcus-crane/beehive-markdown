Draft commencement rules for integrated governance of the electricity industry have been released for consultation.

The draft rules are based on those developed by the electricity industry's Electricity Governance Establishment Project. The industry-developed rules have been amended to reflect the shift from a self-governance to a statutory framework.

The rules, which will be administered by the Electricity Commission when it is established later this year, will be at the heart of the operation of the New Zealand electricity market.

Comment is sought from interested parties by 31 July 2003.

The Consultation Electricity Governance Regulations and Rules, with explanatory notes, are available at:
