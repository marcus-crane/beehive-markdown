“Taranaki has a strong advantage in Engineering and it is excellent to see the region committing to develop this further,” says Jim Anderton.

Taranaki is to receive $2 million under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s Regional Partnership Programme to develop and promote the region as a specialist centre of applied engineering, Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister and Progressive leader Jim Anderton announced today.

Venture Taranaki Trust, as the region’s economic development agency, will receive the funding over two years to establish the Taranaki Centre of Applied Engineering, which will offer a range of business services to the region’s engineering sector.

Jim Anderton said engineering already represents an estimated 30% of total manufacturing employment in the region, and 5% of total regional sales.

“This major regional initiative builds on Taranaki’s strengths in engineering and helps cement it as a leading centre of excellence. By developing the exporting capacity of local engineering firms and supporting them to develop new products, the Centre will help broaden and deepen the nature of Taranaki’s regional economy.”

In addition to establishing the Taranaki Centre of Applied Engineering, the funding will contribute towards a skills strategy, establishing a procurement and export office within the Centre, resources to commercialise new products, and a regional branding campaign that will position Taranaki both nationally and internationally as a specialist centre for applied engineering.

The Centre will work in partnership with the Western Institute of Technology Taranaki (WITT) and Engineering Taranaki to pursue new business opportunities, cooperate over research and development and promote the region’s engineering specialisations.

The funding will allow WITT to purchase sophisticated engineering equipment and offer specialist courses better suited to the needs of local engineering firms.

The procurement and export office will coordinate the collective purchasing power of the engineering companies and work with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to link groups of firms into appropriate offshore trade missions and trade shows. It will also allow firms to tender for large engineering projects that are beyond the capacity and capability of any one company.

“The project will allow the region to use its engineering infrastructure more efficiently at the same time as it promotes faster industrial growth.

“It also aligns with New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s efforts in the regions to support economic development strategies based around centres of excellence and already established industry clusters,” Mr Anderton said.

This is the seventh major regional initiative to receive funding under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s Regional Partnership Programme. All initiatives are a mix of private and public sector funding.
