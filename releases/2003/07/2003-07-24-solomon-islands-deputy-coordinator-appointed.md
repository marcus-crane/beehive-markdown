New Zealander Peter Noble will be the Deputy Coordinator of the strengthened assistance programme to the Solomon Islands, Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Defence Minister Mark Burton announced today.

The Ministers said Mr Noble would play a crucial role as deputy to Australian-appointed Special Coordinator Nick Warner.

“The position of Deputy Coordinator is focused on developing policy issues relating to all aspects of the strengthened assistance programme, and also on operational decisions over deploying police and military assets.

“The Deputy will need to liase with a variety of individuals and groups such as the advisory council, which will include Solomon Island ministers, the Police Commissioner, key senior officials, and possibly representatives of civil society.

"Equally, he will work with the operational command level of the police and military contingents, and the senior police and military officers of all the participating nations,” Mr Goff and Mr Burton said.

The Deputy will also act in place of the Special Coordinator when Mr Warner is out of the Solomon Islands.

Mr Noble, a civilian staff member of the New Zealand Defence Force, has 19 years' experience in Defence policy, including peacekeeping operations, and was involved in the establishment of the Truce Monitoring Group in Bougainville.

More recently, he was Deputy Head of the International Peace Monitoring Team in the Solomon Islands, and also acted as Deputy High Commissioner in Honiara for three months.

Mr Goff and Mr Burton stressed that Mr Noble's familiarity with the Solomon Islands and its security issues made him an ideal candidate and excellent complement to the Special Coordinator.
