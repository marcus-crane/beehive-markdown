Minister for Sport and Recreation Trevor Mallard was saddened to learn of the death of New Zealand Olympic Committee President and former Olympic and Commonwealth medallist John Davies.

“I remember listening on a crackly transistor to the outstanding exploits of John Davies at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics when he won a bronze and Peter Snell won gold,” Trevor Mallard said.

“John was an outstanding athlete. He continued to make a significant contribution to athletics following his retirement through coaching a number of world champions and Olympic athletes.

“While his time as President of NZOC was tragically short, he still managed to make a life time contribution to sport.

“My thoughts are with John Davies’ family and friends at this sad time,” Trevor Mallard said.

John Davies had been president of the New Zealand Olympic Committee since October 2000. He was the bronze medal winner in the 1500 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games and a silver medal winner in the one mile event at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth.
