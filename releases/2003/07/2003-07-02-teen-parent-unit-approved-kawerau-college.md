Kawerau College is to receive funding for a Teen Parent Unit that will cater for up to 25 young people who have had their education interrupted by pregnancy and child-rearing responsibilities, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

Teen parents are a group of students at high risk of under-participation and under-achievement in education. The pressure of raising young children and studying makes it difficult for many young parents to continue their schooling.

“The Government, by supporting initiatives such as the Kawerau College Unit and the associated early childhood centre, is ensuring that teenage parents can continue with their secondary education while their babies and children have access to quality early childhood education,” Trevor Mallard said.

“We believe it’s essential that every young person has the chance to reach their full potential, in education and later in life, at work and hopefully this unit will give them a good second start.”

The Kawerau Teen Parent Unit will receive a maximum of about $214,000 a year. It will be based in a school house adjacent to an early childhood centre managed by the Central North Island Kindergarten Association. The initiative will operate under the governance of Kawerau College Board of Trustees.

Kawerau schools are currently engaged in a Project to Enhance Education in Kawerau (PEEK). The schools and community are seeking ways to provide additional educational opportunities in Kawerau. The establishment of a Teen Parent unit for Kawerau is one of the initiatives that has arisen as part of this project.

·Porirua College (He Huaraki Tamariki), Porirua;  
·Colenso High School, Napier;  
·Upper Hutt College, Upper Hutt;  
·Rotorua Lakes High School, Rotorua;
