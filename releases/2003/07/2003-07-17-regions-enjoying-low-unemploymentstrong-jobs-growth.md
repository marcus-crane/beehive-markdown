A report showing unemployment running at historically low levels and strong job growth in the regions has been welcomed by Minister for Employment, Steve Maharey.

Commenting on Regional Labour Market Reports released by the Department of Labour, Mr Maharey said "New Zealand has enjoyed economic growth of 4.3 per cent in the year to March and recorded a 15 year low in the unemployment rate."

There were 44,600 more people in jobs in the year to March and 156,500 more jobs in New Zealand than four years ago. Auckland had 1,300 more people in jobs in the year to March and 39,500 more than in March 99.

"Most of our regions have benefited from these healthy conditions with areas like. Taranaki, for example, experiencing 10.4 per cent growth in employment in the year to March," said Mr Maharey.

More stand-out figures for the March 2003 year were Northland's 5.6 percent employment growth and Manawatu-Wanganui's 4.7 percent.

The regions with the most improved labour markets were Taranaki, Waikato, Manawatu-Wanganui, Nelson-Marlborough-West Coast, Bay of Plenty and Gisborne-Hawke's Bay. These regions all experienced a fall in unemployment, a rise in the number of people in the labour force, and some had impressive job growth.

Steve Maharey noted that right across the regions, the numbers of unemployment beneficiaries dropped over the past year to May 2003. Nelson-Marlborough-West Coast saw the number of people in the region on the unemployment benefit drop by nearly a third, and those in Canterbury by a quarter.

"The outlook for the New Zealand economy over the next year is for a lower, but still positive rate of growth. The government will continue to work on supporting our regions with sound policies and with programmes to help build a skilled workforce".

The Department of Labour expects that Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury will have the top performing labour markets over the next year, with moderate job growth and fairly steady unemployment.
