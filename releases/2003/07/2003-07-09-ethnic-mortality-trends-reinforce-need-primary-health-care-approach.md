Health Minister Annette King says new information on ethnic mortality trends reinforces the Government’s approach to improving the health of all New Zealanders through implementing the Primary Health Care Strategy.

A joint Ministry of Health and Otago University report released today shows that Maori and Pacific peoples have missed out on the life expectancy gains made by other New Zealanders in the past 20 years.

Decades of Disparity: Ethnic Mortality Trends in New Zealand 1980-1999 shows European New Zealanders live 10 years longer on average than Maori, compared with the early 1980s when there was a seven-year difference. Pacific people live an average of six or seven years less than European New Zealanders, compared with three to four years less in the early 1980s.

“This report shows that this Government is taking the right approach,” Ms King said. “I am constantly astounded by attacks National and ACT make upon the way we are spending the new primary health care money, particularly our decision to target high health need, low income parts of New Zealand first.

“These areas often have a high proportion of Maori and Pacific people, and I am flabbergasted that some political parties persist in attacking our policies as race-based for that reason. I make no apology for wanting to improve the health of Maori and Pacific people,” she said. “This new report shows how important it is that we do so, and we will not resile from that approach.

“I strongly believe that no New Zealander would want to see other New Zealanders dying earlier than they should do.”

Ms King said the Government had done a lot already to reverse some of the social inequities caused by policies of the 1990s, such as market-rents, harsh industrial laws, and user-charges in health, and would continue to build the sort of just society that removes the inequalities covered in this report.

“I believe our best chance to make a difference to the health of New Zealanders is through a strong primary health care system. We are now bringing back the sort of subsidised primary health care that was demolished in the 1990s,” said Ms King.

“We are spending more than $400 million over three years to implement the strategy, and after one year 1.7 million New Zealanders are already enrolled in 47 Primary Health Organisations (PHOs), which will focus on keeping people as well as possible for as long as possible.”

Ms King said Decades of Disparity showed that the main contributor to increasing ethnic differences in life expectancy is chronic disease mortality in middle and old age. “PHOs will also provide a range of primary health care services such as programmes to manage chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

“The report reinforces our belief that an intersectoral approach is needed to reduce health inequalities. The health sector will continue to work with housing, social services and education to make sure we get it right for everyone.”
