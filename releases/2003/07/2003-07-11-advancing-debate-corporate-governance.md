Businesses are urged to contribute to discussions around corporate governance standards in New Zealand, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

Speaking at a forum organised by Minter Ellison Rudd Watts in Auckland to discuss their white paper on corporate governance, Lianne Dalziel welcomed their contribution to the debate and encouraged wider industry discussion.

“I have asked the Securities Commission to lead the development of a set of corporate governance principles to establish a benchmark for shaping the behaviour of New Zealand businesses.

“It is important that all stakeholders take part in the debate so we might advance the issue of corporate governance,” Lianne Dalziel said.

“I am well aware that there are those who say that because we haven’t seen an Enron or WorldCom scandal here, that we do not have to revisit our own regulatory framework. However, in my view that is naïve. If we look too different to the outside world, the international investors won’t be stopping to ask why,” said Lianne Dalziel.

Lianne Dalziel said that international regulatory and institutional reforms, which followed these scandals, were designed to:

- Promote accountability (particularly of company management);
- Enhance transparency;
- Meet the information needs of the modern business community by promoting the timely disclosure of accurate financial information; and
- Protect shareholder rights.

“Ensuring that similar work is undertaken in New Zealand will help to retain investor confidence in, and safeguard the efficiency and integrity of, New Zealand’s capital markets and, more importantly, will ensure that New Zealand’s corporate governance regime is consistent with international best practice.

The Commission will work with the business community and other stakeholders, to develop the set of principles for best practice corporate governance. It is a shared responsibility as ICANZ pointed out with the release in May of its report ‘Improving Corporate Reporting: A Shared Responsibility’.

“This is an important opportunity for the business community to be proactive in developing best practice for corporate governance in New Zealand and to take ownership of it.

“We must not, however, lose sight of the fact that the adequacy of our own regulatory regime will be viewed through the prism of international experience. While the risk of corporate failure in New Zealand might be perceived to be comparatively low, there is still a need for our corporate governance framework to continue to evolve in accordance with international best practice, in order to demonstrate that our regulatory regime is robust and credible and to safeguard New Zealand’s reputation as a safe and transparent investment destination,” Lianne Dalziel said.

The Securities Commission will report back to the Minister before the end of 2003.
