News that Northland is to receive $2 million for a major tourism strategy is welcome indeed, says Minister of Tourism Mark Burton.

The funding, which was allocated under New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s Regional Partnership Programme, was announced today by Jim Anderton, the Minister of Economic, Industry and Regional Development.

Mark Burton stressed that developing a high-quality, sustainable tourism market in Northland would benefit both the local economy and New Zealand’s thriving tourism sector as a whole.

“This is clearly an ideal opportunity for Northland to further develop their tourism potential. Tourism is New Zealand’s premiere industry, and this initiative will provide a great boost to Northland’s economy.”

Enterprise Northland is to receive the funding over three years, which will be used to implement the Activate Northland project. This project aims to increase the capability of Northland’s tourism businesses, enhance their web presence, increase visitor numbers, the length of stay and visitor spend within the region. In addition, it is focused on increasing the consistency and quality of the visitor experience, developing unique new Maori attractions, building the education and conference market, and attracting further investment into Northland’s tourism sector.

Mark Burton said that these goals were consistent with the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

“In the long-term, New Zealand’s tourism sector faces the challenge of sustainability. If we are going to realise the full potential of our thriving tourism market, we must balance strong industry growth with care, protection, and, wherever possible, enhancement of our unique environments.

“This initiative will help Northland to achieve these goals. I congratulate all those from the Northland Regional Council and the Kaipara, Whangarei and Far North District Councils, who have worked with Enterprise Northland on this project, as well as the local iwi, business, and community representatives who have also been involved.”
