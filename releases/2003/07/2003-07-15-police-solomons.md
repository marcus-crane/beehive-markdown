1.Why are New Zealand Police going to the Solomons?  
The situation in the Solomons is grim. The collapse of law and order has led to significant loss of life, destruction of homes, and displacement of hundreds of families. The machinery of government is failing and the provision of even basic services is at risk.  
There are compelling humanitarian reasons why New Zealand should assist, It is also in our national security interest to contribute to restoring the rule of law and strengthening government in the Solomons. A failed state may provide a haven for trans-national criminals including terrorists.

2 When are they going?  
Superintendent Tony Annandale departs tomorrow to join the planning team in Townsville, Australia. The main body will go via Australia for final training before arriving in the Solomons some time in August.

3 Will they go to the Solomons with the soldiers and how?  
Logistical arrangements for the main deployment are still being worked out.

4\. Where will they be based?  
On the outskirts of Honiara.

5\. Where will they be deployed?  
Initially they will first work in Honiara, then move to the provinces.

6\. What role will the New Zealand police have in the Solomons?  
They will work with the Royal Solomon Islands Police to restore law and order. New Zealand also expects to be able to contribute to restructuring the Solomon Islands Police.

7\. What districts in New Zealand will the police come from?  
Selection will try to ensure an even spread from all Districts, as well as the Office of the Commissioner (OoC).

8\. What will be the impact on police of taking 25 officers out of New Zealand?  
Ten New Zealand police staff have been serving in the Solomons since October 2002 as part of the NZ Aid funded Solomon Islands Policing Project. They will become part of the 35-strong deployment.  
Their role will change from mentoring local police to operational duties. Government has agreed to fund the back-filling of the 35 positions.

9\. What percentage of the New Zealand Police does 35 officers represent?  
Thirty-five police represents 0.47% of New Zealand’s total sworn police staff.

10\. Will the 35 police serve 2 years each or will 70 police serve a year each, or what?  
The 35 police will serve mostly six-month rotations.

11\. Will they be armed?  
Early in the planning process Australia accepted the New Zealand Police view that an international police force would normally be unarmed. However, within the deployment there will be a tactical response group available to deal with armed emergencies.

12\. To whom will the New Zealanders report ?  
The New Zealand contingent will come under the control of the international police force commander, an Assistant Commissioner from the Australian Federal Police.  
However, the senior New Zealand police officer will be in a command position and one of three deputies of the international police force.

13 What skills will the Police selected have?  
The first rotation will include a tactical team of 10 to 12 members.  
There will be 15 general duties staff and a command team of two or three as well as four to five investigative detectives and one to two intelligence officers.

14\. What number will come from Police HQ?  
We don’t know yet as the selections have not been made.  
However, the contingent commander Superintendent Annandale is from the OoC and other contingent members may also be drawn from there.
