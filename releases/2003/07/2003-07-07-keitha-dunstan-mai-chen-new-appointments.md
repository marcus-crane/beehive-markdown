Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today announced two new appointments and two re-appointments to the Securities Commission.

Research professor Keitha Dunstan and constitutional lawyer Mai Chen have both been appointed as new members of the Securities Commission, both for a period of five years. Current Commission members Falcon Clouston and Lloyd Kavanagh have been re-appointed for two and four years respectively.

The Commission’s roles include keeping securities law under review; a supervisory role in relation to securities exchanges; granting exemptions from securities law; and promoting public understanding of securities law. Since changes to the Securities Markets Act 1998 came into effect on 1 December 2002, the Commission also has an enforcement role for insider trading and continuous disclosure breaches.

**Ms Mai Chen**  
Ms Chen is a nationally renowned academic and practising constitutional lawyer. She is a foundation partner of Australasia's first public law specialist practice, Chen Palmer & Partners, which she co-founded in 1994. Her extensive public law expertise and her decade of experience in advising a wide range of corporate clients on the interface between commercial law and public law will enable her to bring to the Commission valuable perspectives on governance and on the impact of regulation on business. She brings particular strengths in policy and law reform.

He has been a member of the Securities Commission for four years.
