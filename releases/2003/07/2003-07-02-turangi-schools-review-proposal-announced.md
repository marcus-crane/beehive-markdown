Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today his proposal for a re-organisation of Turangi schools aimed at strengthening education for local students.

“The proposal will improve local education by bringing it into line with the needs of the Turangi community, and making it more responsive to Maori. It will also unlock an extra $1.65 million for the education of local children.

“The area is facing population decline and falling rolls and we must ensure this won’t impact on students’ education. The aim is to make sure education money is spent on teaching students, and not on maintaining under-used or empty buildings.

“This proposal can bring about a new era for education in the Turangi area. Having two composite schools will ensure that all local students will receive a quality education that is sustainable well into the future.

“I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution made by Tuwharetoa, the local community and schools in this process.

“I know this process can be stressful but I hope the community will understand that it is better to consider the future from a position of relative strength rather than leave it until there is a situation of weakness.

“This is not about saving money for the Government to spend elsewhere. Under the proposal and using current estimates, an extra $926,000 in operational funding will be available to schools. There will be a fund of $264,000 for schools to use jointly, and $459,000 of extra property funding,” Trevor Mallard said.

Proposals under the review are:  
·To close Hirangi, Turangi, Tongariro High and Tauranga Taupo Schools and establish a single Year 1 – 13 composite school on the Tongariro High School site;  
·To establish a new Wharekura for Year 1 – 13 students who wish to receive their education in te reo Maori, on the Hirangi School site;  
·To retain Kuratau School as an autonomous full primary school.

There will be about one month of consultation on this proposal after which Trevor Mallard will announce his firm preference, based on feedback from the local community. Following that announcement there will be about another month of consultation before a final decision is made.
