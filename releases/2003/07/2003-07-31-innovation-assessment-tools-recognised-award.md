Education Minister Trevor Mallard congratulated everyone involved in developing asTTle, an education assessment tool, which last week won a ComputerWorld Excellence Award for IT in Education.

"AsTTle beat off 22 other nominees to win this award, which recognises the innovative approach of what is a world-leading resource," Trevor Mallard said.

AsTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning) enables teachers to assess literacy and numeracy among students in years 5-7 and provides them with the information they need to identify strengths and gaps in children’s learning and develop quality classroom programmes to meet student needs.

"AsTTle assessment tools are an exciting development in one of the Government’s top priorities for education – lifting educational achievement in literacy and numeracy.

"The tools are aimed at changing teaching practice and helping kids' learning to ensure they have the basics right for success later in life – in education and in the workplace," Trevor Mallard said.

The tools received overwhelming support from teachers and around 90 per cent of schools have requested copies of the CD-Rom resource since it was made available earlier this year.
