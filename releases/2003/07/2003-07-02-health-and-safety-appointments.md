Labour Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the make-up of the new National Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Committee who will provide expert independent advice on major occupational safety and health issues direct to government.

The Committee will be chaired by Professor Neil Pearce, Director of the Centre for Public Health Research at Massey University, Wellington. He has been appointed for a three-year term.

Committee members, who will serve two to three year terms, are Dr Evan Dryson, Professor Anne-Marie Feyer, Professor Philippa Gander, and Mr Selwyn McCracken.

Margaret Wilson said the committee membership represented an excellent balance of research and professional expertise covering as it did most areas of occupational health and safety.

The committee's first task would be to develop a research agenda to inform the government's research initiatives and provide direction to the wider research community, she said.

"At present the research infrastructure for occupational health and safety in this country is fragmented, with expertise spread across a diverse range of universities and departments. Although the Department of Labour seeks expert advice on health and safety issues, until now there has been no advisory body of experts to provide an independent assessment direct to government."

Research, particularly in regard to emerging health issues, would be an invaluable guide for future government policy in the health and safety area, Margaret Wilson said.

The Committee will hold its first meeting in August and is expected to meet up to five times a year.
