The Information Technology Minister Paul Swain says a new website gives young people greater access to Cabinet Ministers and encourages them to take part in the political process.

Mr Swain has become the first Cabinet Minister to take part in online chat on the new Labour youth website [www.headsup.co.nz](http://www.headsup.co.nz), spending an hour fielding questions across a wide range of subjects.

Mr Swain answered 40 questions at an average rate of about one question every ninety seconds, with subjects including boy racers, Treaty claims, foreign affairs policy, information and communications technology, public transport, small business, and even the National party's current internal problems.

Mr Swain says "it was full on with questions streaming in as fast as I was answering them. I was pleasantly surprised at how busy the site was and how keen young people are to take part in the democratic process. The internet is a great medium for getting young people engaged in the political process, as many are turned off by traditional sources of information like newspapers and TV bulletins."

Mr Swain says the private sector agency that helped set up the chat session advised him that the most recent chat session featuring Greg Somerville and Ma'a Nonu on the official All Black website answered 137 questions in just over an hour, or roughly one question every 30 seconds.

Other Ministers will take part in online chat on [www.headsup.co.nz](http://www.headsup.co.nz) over the next few months, including the Education Minister Trevor Mallard, as well as Youth Affairs and Small Business Minister John Tamihere, Research Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson, and Tertiary Education and Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey.
