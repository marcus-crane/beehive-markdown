The Government is making $77.8 million extra funding available to tertiary education organisations for special initiatives to help fulfil aspects of the Tertiary Education Strategy, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey announced today.

·$20 million is available through the IDF  
·$14 million is available through the eCDF  
·$9.8 million supports the development of an e-learning portal and a tertiary education portal, phase 1 of which are live now  
·the remaining $34 million will be available for projects in future years

Next week the Tertiary Education Commission will call for applications from the e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund (eCDF) and the Innovation and Development Fund (IDF) that have been set up as part of the push to develop better capability within tertiary education organisations.

A total of $34 million of capital and operational funding is available for the first round of applications for projects to be undertaken during the period 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005.

Steve Maharey said the additional funding is a real example of the Government’s commitment to ensuring the Tertiary Education Strategy is realised.

“Innovation, e-learning and building capability are fundamental to the success of the Tertiary Education Strategy. Tertiary education organisations will shortly be able to gain new funding to make the changes that align with the Strategy.

“The e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund is designed to improve the tertiary education system’s capability to deliver e-learning that improves access to education or education quality for learners.

“The eCDF aims to help achieve co-operative and strategic implementation of e-learning in tertiary education organisations. It builds on the $9.8million from the 2002 Budget for investment in e-learning in tertiary education.

“The Innovation and Development Fund aims to foster new and innovative ideas to improve the operation of the tertiary education system, and initiatives to help organisations align with and deliver on the Tertiary Education Strategy and national goals,” Steve Maharey said.

The e-Learning Collaborative Development Fund and Innovation and Development Fund are contestable, and have clear parameters and very specific eligibility criteria, including alignment to the Tertiary Education Strategy.

The funds will be open for application on August 4 and close on September 26 2003. Decisions will be made by the end of this year.

The invitation to apply and application form will be available on the Tertiary Education Commission’s website www.tec.govt.nz from Monday, however background information on the new funds, is available now on the website.
