Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton reinforced the New Zealand forestry industry’s initiative in Geneva this week to promote trade liberalisation in forestry and paper products.

Mr Sutton said removing barriers to global trade in forest and paper products as part of the current WTO Doha Round was very important for New Zealand.

New Zealand already exports $3.7 billion of forest and paper products annually. This is expected to rise substantially over the next fifteen years.

New Zealand has promoted an ambitious goal of tariff elimination for all non-agricultural products in the World Trade Organisation. Forest and paper products would be one of the main areas that benefited.

“It is especially important for regions such as Northland and the East Coast that New Zealand make every effort to push for genuine market access liberalisation in the forestry sector,” Mr Sutton said.

The WTO negotiating group on non-agricultural market access is meeting in Geneva this week to continue negotiations on reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers that are inhibiting trade including in forest products.

The forestry initiative, coordinated by the New Zealand Forest Industries Council, supported by the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry and including the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa, is seeking to focus attention on the strong industry support in a range of countries for accelerated trade liberalisation in wood and paper products, and build support among WTO Members.

Mr Sutton said forestry was important for New Zealand, as well as for a range of other countries, including developing countries, which had significant forestry resources and shares of world trade in wood and related products.

He said the WTO negotiations remained in a difficult phase. Global industries, such as forestry that could see the benefits that would flow to businesses and employees from further trade liberalization, could play an important role in pushing for ambitious outcomes in the Doha Round.
