The Associate Minister of Energy Hon Harry Duynhoven announced today that mining industry export receipts have, for the first time, broken the half billion dollar mark.

Mr Duynhoven said the Minerals and Coal Annual Report 2002 produced by the Crown Minerals group of the Ministry of Economic Development showed New Zealand’s major mineral and coal exports reached $519 million in 2002, a 70% increase over the four years since 1998 when mineral exports were $306 million.

Gold and coal were the leading export commodities, with coal exports more than doubling in the past four years. Ironsand, silver, clay, cement, and salt also made important contributions to export earnings.

The report shows that total production of the mining industry in 2002, was $953m. This was an increase of $245m or 35% over the past five years.

Production included 9.77 tonnes of gold, 28.72 tonnes of silver, 4.5 million tonnes of coal, 1.7 million tonnes of ironsand and over 30 million tonnes of sand and aggregate.

Mr Duynhoven said the mining industry is now a substantial contributor to the New Zealand economy, through more jobs, more energy, and essential supplies to the roading and construction industry.

He said coal exports are forecast to continue to grow strongly in the near future with high quality coking coal from the West Coast establishing a niche market with world steel manufacturers. Domestically, coal will have a more important role in supplying New Zealand’s energy needs with the Huntly power station to become predominantly coal-fired over the next few years.
