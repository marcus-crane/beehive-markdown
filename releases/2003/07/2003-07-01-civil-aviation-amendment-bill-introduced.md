The Associate Transport Minister Harry Duynhoven has introduced legislation to improve the aviation safety framework in New Zealand.

The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill tabled in Parliament today will enable New Zealand to implement mutual recognition obligations with Australia, in line with earlier commitments to develop a Single Aviation Market between the two countries.

Mr Duynhoven says "the new arrangement will enable aviation safety certificates issued to eligible airlines in one country to be recognised in the other. Removing the existing requirement for airlines to hold certificates from both New Zealand and Australian authorities will make it easier for airlines to operate services in both countries, achieve operating efficiencies and better utilise fleets."

Mr Duynhoven says "mutual recognition is expected to provide significant up-front and ongoing cost savings to airline operators."

He says "the safety of our skies remains the paramount consideration of both governments. Mutual recognition is possible because the regulation of aviation safety in both countries is of a very high standard and comparable with international best practice."

Air Operator's Certificates for aircraft of more than 30 seats or 15,000kgs will be the first to be recognised. Mutual recognition of other safety certification relating to airline operations under the 'open skies' agreement will be considered in the future.

Mr Duynhoven says "mutual recognition is not about harmonisation. Although there are differences between the New Zealand and Australian systems, including particular standards, they can be accepted because it is the overall safety outcome achieved by each system that is being recognised."

The Bill also introduces measures to improve aircraft security and the safety of passengers and crews, by extending the ability of airlines and enforcement agencies to deal with unruly passengers.

The current law makes it difficult to deal with unruly passengers outside New Zealand territory unless it involves a serious criminal offence, and also has a narrow range of offences.

Under the legislation introduced today, anyone committing an offence on board a New Zealand aircraft, or a foreign aircraft where New Zealand is the next port of call, can be prosecuted as if the offence happened in New Zealand.

A more comprehensive set of offences is also included in the bill, including acts endangering aircraft or passenger safety, interference with the aircraft such as tampering with a smoke detector, offensive behaviour, not obeying commands given by the pilot, being intoxicated, smoking, or operating portable electronic devices.

The enforcement regime will be similar to that in the Biosecurity Act, and includes the ability for an offender to pay an instant fine and avoid going to court.

In addition the Civil Aviation Act is being updated to improve its workability and to align it with other international obligations. This includes some changes to the domestic liability regime.

Corresponding mutual recognition legislation was introduced to the Australian Parliament last week.
