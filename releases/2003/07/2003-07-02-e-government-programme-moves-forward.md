State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today released an updated strategy for the e﷓government programme which sets a direction for the delivery of government services online until 2010.

“This is the most significant revision of the e-government strategy since it was launched in May 2000,” Trevor Mallard said.

“We are now well on our way to enabling ready access to government using the internet. The popularity of the government web portal is an indication that more and more New Zealanders are taking advantage of the convenience the internet provides. The portal is now getting some 80,000 visits a week,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Under the revised strategy the Government has set new targets for the programme that look beyond 2004 to the point where networks and internet technology are integral to the delivery of government information, services and processes.

“Right now when I visit the government portal to find out about my entitlements or obligations, I still have to visit several agency websites to get the whole picture.

“This Government is intent on strengthening the delivery of government services for all New Zealanders, and that means fostering a whole-of-government approach rather than agencies operating in isolation. The e-government strategy will help us deliver on that goal.

“In the future, e-government has the potential to link information and services together in ways that make this whole process much more seamless and adaptable to people’s personal circumstances.

“All New Zealanders also need to be confident that their personal information is being protected and that dealing with government agencies online is just as secure and private as sending a letter or fax. The Government is developing a system for this – known as online authentication.”

“Our vision is that New Zealand will be a world leader in e-government, and this strategy lays the path forward for us to make that a reality,” Trevor Mallard said.
