Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard congratulated the Special Olympics New Zealand team which returned home today after successfully competing in the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Dublin, Ireland.

“We are very proud of the team of 40 athletes who competed in these games, bringing 60 medals home. It was a great opportunity for these athletes to showcase their skills and ability and they certainly rose to the challenge.

“Congratulations to everyone who took part. It was a fantastic effort, particularly so for the 40 personal bests that were achieved,” Trevor Mallard said.

The New Zealand team competed in seven different sports at The Games – Athletics, Aquatics, Bocce, Equestrian, Golf, Powerlifting and Ten Pin Bowling. They were awarded a total of sixty medals, including 20 golds, 19 silvers, 21 bronzes and forty personal bests.

Trevor Mallard said the twenty coaches who accompanied the athletes also deserved congratulations for their contribution to the success of New Zealand.
