New Zealand’s new Consul-General in Melbourne is Mark Ingram, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Mr Ingram, who will also be Trade Commissioner in Melbourne, previously worked on Trade New Zealand’s Export Hotline assisting new exporters to take their first steps into offshore markets.

“The decision to reopen the Consulate-General in Melbourne, which closed in 1997 after 92 years, is recognition of the increasing economic and social relationship between New Zealand and Victoria, and the rate at which that relationship is expanding," Mr Goff said.

“Australia is New Zealand's largest economic partner, and Victoria is our leading trading partner of Australia's eight states and territories.

"Last year Victoria took 36.4 percent of New Zealand’s merchandise exports, while the state produced the largest share (34.16 percent) of merchandise imports from Australia.

“Increasingly we also cooperate closely at government level on a range of issues such as policing, land transport safety, and the development of biotechnology, and I look forward to a further strengthening of ties during Mr Ingram’s term," Mr Goff said.

There are approximately 60,000 New Zealanders living in Victoria, and a core element of the Consulate-General’s functions will be to provide consular assistance to them, as well to the approximately 180,000 New Zealanders who visit Victoria every year.
