Wood companies in Northland are being asked to provide job guarantees for young unemployed Northlanders.

Economic development minister and progressive leader Jim Anderton made the call at the launch today of ‘logs to jobs’ strategy for Northland.

He said wood processing offers the fastest potential gains for New Zealand of any industry.

Training and skills development is a top priority for unlocking the potential of wood processing.

“The Department of Labour has been working closely in partnership with industry. We need to match skills development with training programmes.

“I want to ask the forestry companies here to put up their hands for the long-term young unemployed in Northland.

“The Government will take responsibility for getting them ready for work.

“But we need the companies to agree to guarantee a job those young people who reach the required standard,” Jim Anderton said.
