Transit New Zealand’s revised 10-year plan, with eighteen Auckland projects among the 54 top-ranked major state highway initiatives, recognizes the city’s importance to the nation, says the Minister for Auckland Issues & Associate Minister for Transport, Judith Tizard.

Auckland projects include the SH20 Mt Roskill Extension, the SH1 Esmonde Rd Interchange and the SH1 North Shore Busway (Stages 1 and 2), ranked 2, 3 and 4 on Transit’s list. Each of these projects remains scheduled to start this financial year.

Judith Tizard says these three projects are also among a handful of major projects subject to a review by Transit and Transfund, to ensure they are consistent with the government’s transport objectives.

“I see this review as an important part of public analysis and consultation. Auckland projects are very costly and they have to be carefully managed to stay within budget and to ensure they don’t actually add to congestion while they are being built.

“I understand the review will be completed by the end of this year,” Judith Tizard said.

Other Auckland projects to remain on the ten year Transit plan include the Hobsonville Deviation on SH18 (scheduled 2005/6), the Manukau Extension on SH20 (2006/7), the SH1 Waiouru Interchange (2006/7), SH1 ALPURT Sector B2 (2006/7) and the Advanced Traffic Management System Stage 3 (2006/07).

“Auckland has been a big winner in transport over the last three years. The government has recognized that if Auckland’s transport system overheats, it cools the New Zealand economy,” said Judith Tizard.

“Transit’s 10-year projections for state highway expenditure are for $7.28 billion in spending. Auckland’s forecast share is $2.57b or 35.3 percent of the total.

“At the same time, we acknowledge there needs to be a balance between expenditure on roading and public/alternative transport, between Auckland and the rest of New Zealand.

“I’d like to thank Transit and Transport Minister Paul Swain, who has backed getting these improvements to Auckland region’s transport infrastructure.

“We need to acknowledge that Transit has done its best within its budget. Auckland’s eighteen projects are concrete evidence of the extra money this government is directing into transport to catch up on earlier neglect,” said Judith Tizard.

Transport Minister Paul Swain said Transit and the transport funding agency Transfund had listened to the concerns of all New Zealanders in delivering today’s announcements. This year’s spending under the National Land Transport Programme is $1.19 billion, a $90m (7.5 percent) increase on 2002/3. He said he was particularly pleased to more funding going into roading initiatives, public passenger transport and cycle routes. Paul Swain said the government’s bid to buy Tranz Rail was, in part, a further reflection of the determination to have a comprehensive transport strategy for New Zealand.
