One year on, nearly one in two New Zealanders benefit from the establishment of Primary Health Organisations (PHOs).

Manurewa MP George Hawkins says 1.7 million New Zealanders now receive primary health care from 47 PHOs, with more than 800,000 people paying no more than $20 per doctor’s visit.

“In my electorate, members of the Community Medical Centre Trust at the Halver Rd Peoples’ Centre, pay only $10 a month for the whole family to see a doctor,” Mr Hawkins said. Visits for children under six are already free. From October, under 18s enrolled at a PHO will also receive free, or low cost, primary health care. After January next year many similarly enrolled older people, as well as others requiring high levels of care, can also expect cheaper doctor visits.

“Initially the government hoped 300,000 New Zealanders would be on the PHO books by the end of the first year. Instead, nearly the figure is nearly six times that original forecast, ” Mr Hawkins said.

Many people previously put off seeking medical care because of the cost, often resulting in serious problems later and further pressure on public hospitals.

“With many PHOs providing comprehensive primary health care services including immunisation, diabetes management , family planning, sexual health services and programmes to reduce heart disease, hopefully that will be a thing of the past,” Mr Hawkins said.

In March last year, the Government announced a $410m commitment over three years to begin implementing its Primary Health Care strategy.
