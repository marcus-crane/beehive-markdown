Minister for Sport and Recreation Trevor Mallard is pleased to announce the appointment of Christopher Doig and Sarah Sandley to the Sport and Recreation New Zealand (SPARC) Board.

Christopher Doig and Sarah Sandley will fill the two vacant positions on the nine-person board created by the departure of Margot Foster, whose term ends on 30 June 2003, and Wayne Boyd, who resigned earlier this year.

Christopher Doig is a former opera singer and sports administrator who spent six years as chief executive of NZ Cricket.

“During this time Christopher instituted a number of reforms and introduced professional planning and administrative processes. This experience will be of value to SPARC as it looks to revitalise the sport and recreation sector through the provision of business consultancy services to key organisations,” Trevor Mallard said.

Sarah Sandley is a former New Zealand table tennis representative, and has had substantial involvement in sports marketing and administration.

“Sarah was the Executive Director of Sport Waitakere between 1992-1995, and consequently has a wide range of networks with local authorities and in the sport and recreation sector which will be beneficial for SPARC’s work,” Trevor Mallard said.

Both Sarah Sandley and Christopher Doig have been appointed for three-year terms which expire on 30 June 2006.

In addition to these appointments, Bill Osborne’s term has been extended until 30 June 2004. David Collins QC and Graham Condon have been reappointed for a second term until 30 June 2006.

“I’d like to thank Margot and Wayne for their work. It is important that the board, chaired by John Wells, maintains a continuity of expertise while bringing on new appointments that will provide a different perspective.

“SPARC is now into its second year of operation and needs to be constantly challenging the status quo if it is to achieve its goal of revitalising the sport and recreation sector,” Trevor Mallard said.
