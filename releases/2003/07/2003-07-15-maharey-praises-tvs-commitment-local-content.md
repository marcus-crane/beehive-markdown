Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming a voluntary industry agreement that establishes minimum levels of New Zealand programming on the major free-to-air networks.

The agreement reached by the Television Local Content Group was announced today. The voluntary transmission targets for 2003 vary from broadcaster to broadcaster.TV One had agreed to 53% local content, TV2 to 17% and TV3 to 20%.

“Local content on television plays an important role in developing national identity and showcasing the work of talented New Zealanders. I am impressed with the commitment of networks, producers and funders and their willingness to work cooperatively to boost New Zealand programming,” Mr Maharey said.

“This Government is firmly committed to funding local content on public radio and on television. We remain committed to a voluntary approach to setting targets. Today’s announcement is based on industry negotiations identifying targets that are desirable, sustainable and achievable, utilising the public and private funding available.  
.  
Mr Maharey said that while New Zealanders want to see more locally produced programmes they must stack up against programmes produced overseas to attract and hold an audience.

The Television Local Content Groups is made up of representatives of the Screen Production and Development Association, TVNZ, TV 3 and NZ on Air. It is chaired by former TVNZ Chief Executive, Rick Ellis.
