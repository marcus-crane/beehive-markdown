A strategy to improve the quality and availability of justice sector data and information was launched this week by Associate Justice Minister Rick Barker.

“The Justice Information Strategy 2003-2006 builds on the work achieved by an earlier strategy launched in 1996.

“Since then, substantial progress has been made towards improving the quality of justice information, including developing protocols for sharing information between agencies and improving access to criminal justice information.

“It is essential that we now continue to improve the availability, accuracy, timeliness and delivery of integrated justice information to inform policy development, research and public debate," Mr Barker said.

The four goals of the Justice Information Strategy 2003-2006 are to:

·Establish an authoritative base of justice information  
·Increase information and knowledge sharing across the sector  
·Make justice information available through a choice of channels  
·Provide efficient processes for managing information and information-related initiatives.

The strategy was developed by the Ministry of Justice in collaboration with Department for Courts, Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police and included extensive consultation both sector-wide and beyond.

Mr Barker said the strategy highlighted several key initiatives that would be needed to implement the programme over the next three years.

“These include identifying key audiences and user needs, investigating the feasibility of 'shared workspace' options for justice sector staff and implementing a data management framework.”
