15 July 2003Media Statement  
One standard of citizenship for all – except Maurice

National's policy of "one standard of citizenship for all" clearly doesn't apply to Maurice Williamson, John Tamihere says.

"I am deeply concerned that another National Party policy has been broken even before it has been formed, in the mistreatment of the only National MP who is prepared to tell the truth," Mr Tamihere said.

"How can you promote one standard of citizenship, and silence the only person  
who is standing up and voicing the truth about what is wrong with the National Party and its leadership?"

"I'm sending Maurice a message of my absolute support. All power to Maurice's arm – it's time for National MPs to be truthful, rather than be whipped into submission."

Mr Tamihere said the threat to expel Mr Williamson was disgraceful conduct from a party that had once been a beacon-holder for freedom of expression.
