“The nationwide infrastructure stocktake announced in Budget 2003 has taken another step forward with the Ministry of Economic Development inviting proposals from businesses to undertake the study,” said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“The ‘Infrastructure stocktake’ will look at New Zealand’s transport, energy, telecommunications and water sectors.

“We need to have an accurate snapshot of New Zealand’s transport and energy networks and other infrastructure so we can confidently support sustainable economic development, and jobs.

“One goal is to establish a better understanding of the links between infrastructure and sustainable development and to establish principles to guide decision making.

“Early indications are that transport is the largest constraint to business growth, followed by energy. However more accurate information on the current issues and impending infrastructure needs is required before long term infrastructural planning can begin.

“The Coalition Government has already invested heavily in transport and communication networks and we have ensured we have a national air carrier. Already roading in forestry regions and in Auckland has been supported along with regional broadband.

“Population changes outlined in a report released last week, Population and Sustainable Development 2003, show that our population base will face significant changes and we need to ensure our infrastructure supports these.

“The Coalition is under no illusions that the neglect in the 1980s and 90s means that New Zealand faces billions of dollars of investment and we are committed to addressing this need to safeguard our economic future,” said Jim Anderton.

Budget 2003 allocated up to $550,000 for the ‘Infrastructure stocktake’ on needs and priorities.
