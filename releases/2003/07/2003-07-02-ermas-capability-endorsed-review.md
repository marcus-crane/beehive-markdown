A review of the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) has found the Authority does have the core competencies and capability to carry out its role, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today. ERMA is the independent decision-making body that controls the introduction into New Zealand of new plants and animals, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and new and existing hazardous substances.

The review was conducted earlier this year by a three-person team led by a former chief executive of Environment Waikato and Hutt Valley Health Ltd, Graeme Nahkies. It focused on ERMA’s decision-making capacity, particularly for new organisms, under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, following the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification and the government’s response.

The government commissioned the review under its co-operation agreement with the Green party.

While finding that ERMA does have the capability to do the job, the review team makes 49 recommendations to strengthen the authority's performance in various areas, including its functions under the law, its internal policies for development of staff and management, and its relationships with other agencies, stakeholders, Maori and the public.

Marian Hobbs welcomed ERMA's commitment to implement the recommendations.

"ERMA plays a vital role in promoting and protecting the health and safety of New Zealanders," Marian Hobbs said. "Thanks to the Review team's thorough work we now have recommendations we can build on to ensure ERMA continues to meet the demands placed on it by the HSNO Act."

The review team talked to a wide range of ERMA’s external stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organisations, local authorities, Crown Research Institutes and individuals as well as to Authority members and ERMA New Zealand staff. The Review team also considered more than 40 written submissions.

A copy of the report and the cabinet paper outlining the government’s response are available on the Ministry for the Environment’s website at www.mfe.govt.nz. People without access the internet can contact the Ministry for the Environment, 04 917 7400, for hard-copies.
