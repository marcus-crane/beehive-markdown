The Communications and Information Technology Minister Paul Swain is delighted at the Government announcement that three regions are to receive high speed internet access through the rollout of Project PROBE to Wellington, Taranaki and Waikato.

The announcement follows an earlier decision by Southland, Wairarapa and Northland to have an independent tendering process for those regions, on the understanding that Government PROBE funding would be available for some of their costs, provided Government objectives are met.

Liaison groups in the eight remaining regions - Auckland, Gisborne/Hawkes Bay, Bay of Plenty, Manawatu, Nelson/Tasman/Marlborough, West Coast, Canterbury and Otago, are engaged in ongoing consultation and further announcements will be made in the coming months.

Mr Swain says the announcement by the Minister of Education and Minister for Economic Development shows the Government is well on track to meet the 2004 target for every region to have high speed internet access.

"High speed internet is crucial for New Zealand's future. It will enable businesses to work more effectively across town, across the country, and around the world. It will boost distance learning, improve telemedicine opportunities for rural doctors, allow farmers to take participate in e-farming, and give greater access to government information and services online, especially for those outside major centres," says Mr Swain.
