Education Minister Trevor Mallard was at Wellington's Te Aro School today to launch Better Letters, a literacy resource aimed at helping teachers develop their students' letter writing skills.

The New Zealand Post Better Letters kit includes practical activities for teachers of years four – six to use in the classroom, so students can learn about and evaluate different forms of written communication.

"It's great that young people are embracing new technologies in communication, such as text messaging and emailing but authentic letter writing develops key literacy skills," Trevor Mallard.

"Writing letters gets students thinking more deeply about language and audience, and involves their own personal interests, preferences and experiences. This kit is a fun way of encouraging kids to write.

"This government is committed to improving the literacy of our young people. More than ever before, getting the foundations right is the essential key if we want all New Zealanders to participate and contribute to New Zealand’s growth, socially and economically," Trevor Mallard said.

The Better Letters kit, developed by New Zealand Post and Learning Media, ties in with different aspects of the New Zealand curriculum, such as English, technology, social studies and the arts.

The kits have been distributed to schools around New Zealand.
