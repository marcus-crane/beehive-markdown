Paul Swain will be the first Minister to take part in an online chat session on the new Labour Party youth website, www.headsup.co.nz.

He is hoping to generate interest from young people in his portfolio areas of ICT, Transport and Corrections, as part of the Government's approach to encouraging the use of technology and encouraging participation.

There is no need to download anything to take part.

Other Ministers will take part over the next few months, including Trevor Mallard, John Tamihere, Pete Hodgson, and Steve Maharey.

The site has been live for only a couple of weeks, and further features will be added over time, including a discussion board for topics of current interest, an A-Z of policy with a special focus on youth, and a regular "Ask the PM a Question" slot.

The site is complementary to the main Labour site www.labour.org.nz

Feel free to go along to the Heads Up website and take part in the chat.
