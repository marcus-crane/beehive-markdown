Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia, today called for nominations to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission as required by the Maori Fisheries Act 1989.

“The role of the Commissioners is an important one, and it is essential that we get the right people for the job.

"One way of ensuring this is to consult with those that will be affected by these decisions and to invite nominations," Parekura Horomia said.

Another way of ensuring quality appointments is to regularly review the adequacy of the selection criteria used in the appointments process.

"I am therefore seeking views on the criteria currently used to select Commissioners” the Minister said.

"The fisheries asset does and will continue to make a significant contribution to Maori economic development. It is critical to have the fullest participation in this process and the best possible leadership to drive this next development step – the allocation of the asset. I encourage you all to consider this and make your views known," Parekura Horomia said.
