Ethnic people throughout the country will be able to talk to key government agencies in thirty different languages over the phone due to a major new initiative launched by Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter today.

A year long $1m pilot of a telephone interpreting service supporting six government agencies delivering services to people from non-English speaking backgrounds is to begin this week.

The service, named Language Line, will enable the Police, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, Housing New Zealand, Work and Income, and the Immigration Service to access interpreters speaking 30 different languages when talking to ethnic people.

"About 50,000 people in New Zealand speak no English and at least another 250,000 have only limited English. These people represent a significant block of the population who until now have struggled to access basic government services the rest of us take for granted," Mr Carter said.

"If we want new ethnic New Zealanders to settle swiftly and effectively into our society it makes good sense to provide a cost-effective and practical service that can overcome language barriers.

"Ethnic people have a great deal to offer New Zealand socially, creatively and economically and we do not want those benefits to be lost because of an inability to understand each other.

"I expect Language Line will help both ethnic people and government departments working with them. Telephone interpreting is considerably less costly than face to face interviews, and should prevent misunderstandings and time consuming repeat visits," Mr Carter said.

"During the next year we will get an accurate idea of the level of demand for Language Line and its impact. I fully expect that it could be expanded to a wider range of other government services if the pilot is successful."

Access to an interpreter through Language Line during the pilot phase will be initiated by the government agencies when they decide a caller needs it. It will be free to the caller and available for use by the agencies between 10am and 6pm.

Languages provided through Language Line are expected to include Mäori, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Somali, Amharic, Assyrian, Farsi, Dari, Pashto, Kurdish, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil. Sinhalese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Myanmar, Niuean, Tokelauan, Tuvaluan, Cook Island Maori, Samoan and Tongan.
