State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the chosen 20 public servants who will attend the inaugural Executive Master of Public Administration (EMPA) degree programme at the Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG).

“This Government is committed to rebuilding a strong core public service to improve the delivery of government services to New Zealanders. To that end we want to support the professional development of talented public servants, and this new school of government reflects that aim,” Trevor Mallard said.  
ANZSOG is a top level professional school established last December by a consortium of Australian and New Zealand governments, universities and business schools. The school offers a masters-level programme in public administration and specialised programmes for emerging leaders in the public sector.  
Wellington’s Victoria University is a participant in the school which brings together talented senior public servants, leading academics and experienced practitioners from New Zealand, Australia and overseas.  
“The establishment of the school answered a long-standing need for a top tertiary institution that focused on the development of policy and management skills relevant to the state sector,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I am pleased with the depth and diversity of the candidates from New Zealand and look forward to seeing their progress over the coming years,” Trevor Mallard said.

New Zealand will put forward around 20 students per year for the two-year, part-time, EMPA course. Candidates are nominated by their departments and undergo a thorough selection process.  
State Services Commissioner Michael Wintringham and Victoria University’s Professor Matthew Palmer are the two New Zealand directors of the school.  
The foundation dean will be Professor Allan Fels who is currently head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. He will formally take up his position at the school in June.
