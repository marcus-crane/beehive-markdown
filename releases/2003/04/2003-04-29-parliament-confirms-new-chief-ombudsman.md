Parliament today unanimously confirmed Commerce Commission Chairman John Belgrave in his appointment as the new Chief Ombudsman from 1 July 2003.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel congratulated Mr Belgrave on Parliament’s unanimous support for his new role, which he inherits from retiring Chief Ombudsman Sir Brian Elwood.

“I want to congratulate John on his appointment as Chief Ombudsman and thank him for his excellent service as Chair of the Commerce Commission and the Standards Council.

“John has overseen the Commerce Commission during a period of considerable expansion. He was responsible for implementing significant changes as a result of Commerce Act amendments and the Commission’s new regulatory responsibilities in the telecommunications, electricity and dairy industries. His considerable experience of public sector management has been a great asset during this time,“ Lianne Dalziel said.

“When John leaves the Commission, deputy Chair Paula Rebstock, will become acting Chair of the Commission. Paula is well placed to take over the acting position due to her years of experience on the Commission as an associate member, member and now as deputy chair. Paula is an economist and a company director with experience in both the public and private sectors.”
