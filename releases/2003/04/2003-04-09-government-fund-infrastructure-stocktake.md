New Zealand’s road, rail, electricity and other infrastructure including substandard housing is to undergo a thorough stocktake to ensure the Government has an accurate base of information on which it can confidently support economic development and jobs.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today announced that Budget 2003 will contain $550,000 for the Ministry of Economic Development and Treasury to prepare a report on what infrastructural needs and priorities.

“To maintain economic development momentum New Zealand faces billions of dollars of investment on transport, water, energy sewerage, communications and other networks and we need to determine our highest priorities.

“Infrastructure was neglected throughout the 1980s and 90s, but we can no longer pretend the issue will go away or solve itself so we need to get this work underway.

“The ‘whole of government’ must work in partnership with local government, our regions and businesses to ensure our industries and regions can achieve their sustainable development potential,” said Jim Anderton.
