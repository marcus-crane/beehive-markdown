Veterans who do paid or unpaid work will no longer lose part of their veteran’s pensions entitlement following today’s passing of the War Pensions Amendment Act (No 2).

Veterans’ Affairs Minister George Hawkins said the Act reflected war veteran’s special status and needs.

“With the passing of the Act, veterans will be able to undertake paid employment to a certain level before their pensions begin to abate.

“The aim is to support veterans under 65 make the transition back into the workforce, with the focus on better assisting their overall rehabilitation,” Mr Hawkins said.

Rates of abatement of 30 cents for every $1 of employment income apply to veteran’s whose pensions exceed $80 per week. This increases to 70 cents for every employment dollar for veteran’s whose pensions are in excess of $180 per week.

The Act raises the floor for veterans’ pension rates for married couples to not less than 65 per cent of average weekly earnings, compared with 60 per cent previously.

It also incorporates the overall increase in veterans’ rates following the 2.72 per cent rise in the Consumers Price Index announced on 1 April.
