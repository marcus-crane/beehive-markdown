Maori Affairs and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia today welcomed the introduction of a 1:20 teacher: student ratio for students learning in te reo Maori, bringing an extra 155 full time teacher equivalents nationwide.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced that Budget 2003 will include almost $167 million to be spent nationally over four years to provide an extra 774 primary and secondary teaching positions over and above those required for roll growth.

"The improved ratio applies to Maori students who are taught in Maori for more than 12.5 hours a week at year 11 and under and will directly provide greater support for learning in te reo Maori," Parekura Horomia said.

"The estimated additional 155 teachers in Maori immersion education signals the importance the Government places on lifting the quality and supporting the growth of kaupapa Matauranga Maori.

"The extra teachers across all schools will be provided from the start of next year to help ease workload and staffing pressures. This initiative forms part of the Governmentâ€™s commitment to improving staffing, and so ensuring better teaching and better learning for students."

The increase in teacher numbers will bring the total extra staffing to about 2,090 teachers by 2004. This includes the more than 1,300 FTTEs already provided over the last three years.

The extra teachers will cost $20.4 million in 2003/04, $48.8 million in 2004/05, $48.8 million in 2005/06 and $48.7 million in 2006/07.

Trevor Mallard also announced that Budget 2003 will deliver more than $22 million in new funding for teacher supply initiatives over the next four years, bringing total funding in this area to more than $66 million.

Teacher supply initiatives for Maori include TeachNZ scholarships for Maori and Maori-medium student teachers, and te reo Maori continuing as one of the seven subjects in the Secondary Subject Trainee Allowance scheme.
