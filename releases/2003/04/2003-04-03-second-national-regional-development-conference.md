Regions are to be given another chance to work together to create jobs and stronger healthier communities through a second major regional development conference in Timaru on 24, 25 and 26 September 2003.

Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton announced the conference today at an Economic Development Association meeting. The conference will be organized by the Ministry of Economic Development in co-operation with the Economic Development Association of New Zealand.

“In 2001 we held the first Government sponsored national regional development conference since 1969.

“We expected 300 registrations, and we were amazed that over 700 attendees arrived in Rotorua.

“The conference provided a huge boost to regions and communities up and down New Zealand.

“The networking and knowledge sharing from that conference is still generating benefits to EDANZ members, councils, businesses and central Government who attended the event.

“At that conference, following calls from delegates who attended, I committed to supporting another conference.

“Those who attended the last event wanted more opportunities to share with smaller groups on specific regional develop initiatives. We will accommodate this with workshops and with sessions focussed on delegates priorities,” said Jim Anderton.
