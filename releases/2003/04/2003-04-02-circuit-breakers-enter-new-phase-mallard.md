State Services Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that the circuit-breaker team pilots will enter a new phase after a progress report showed positive results from their work in combating intractable problems.

Trevor Mallard today released the joint State Services Commission-Ministry of Social Development report on the Integrated Service Delivery programme.

“This report provides an update of the pilot projects and trials that are now underway in the Integrated Service Delivery programme. The programme involves agencies working more effectively together and exploring new ways of solving old problems,” Trevor Mallard said.

“These projects are part of a whole-of-government approach, and reflects this Government’s desire to improve the delivery of public services to all New Zealanders.

“Positive results are already emerging in the pilots of three ‘circuit breaker’ teams dealing with complex and intractable issues.

“The core idea is to take some long standing and difficult problems out of the traditional Wellington-based policy process and hand them over to cross-agency teams on the ground in the regions for some original thinking.

“The teams are tasked with developing innovative and different solutions to problems and acting as ‘catalysts’ for strategies already approved by the Government.

“While the pilots are in their early days, the Government is sufficiently encouraged by the progress to consider the first phase of the pilots a success, and to give the green light for the next phase,” Trevor Mallard said.

The three issues chosen to trial the circuit breaker approach were:  
·Truancy in Rotorua  
·Skilled migrant settlement services in Auckland  
·Funding for the reduction of family violence in Hamilton

Each of the three teams has now presented its solutions and had its implementation plans agreed to. In summary these are:

Truancy  
A cross-agency group has been formed, led by Police and also involving Child, Youth and Family, and the Ministry of Education. The solution involves:  
·Responding to rather than driving past young people on the street  
·Finding out why they are not at school, assessing the causes for each individual, referring to appropriate agencies as necessary  
·Putting in place an action plan for each truant to turn around their behaviour  
·Recording the truant on a truancy database  
·Agencies pooling resources and efforts  
·Solution is focussed on understanding the cause for each young person

Skilled Migrant Settlement  
·It is proposed to establish an integrated agency model that enables migrants to access the necessary services to get quickly into employment.  
·The chief executives of the Ministry of Social Development and the Department of Labour have agreed to jointly lead the implementation. The team leader will come from the Department of Labour, and will be appointed shortly.

Family Violence Funding  
·It is proposed to develop a single funding stream and shared accountability for funding for reducing family violence in Hamilton.  
·Briefings for Chief Executives are being held and so far they have been supportive. Regional managers are also engaged around revising models. The Circuit Breaker team leader will lead implementation.

“The real test of these new approaches will be seen over the longer-term – for example by the extent to which truancy rates in Rotorua fall, or by how skilled migrants are more easily settled into New Zealand or by how family violence reduces in Waikato,” Trevor Mallard said.

The next phase of the work will also involve:  
·Continuing the monitoring and evaluation of the first three Circuit Breakers during their implementation stage.  
·Initiating another set of Circuit Breaker teams with a focus on economic and environmental problems to test the approach in non-social sectors.  
·Exploring national roll-outs of the pilots

The progress report also updates progress on other integrated service delivery projects that have emerged from the State Services Commission Review of the Centre work. A good practice guide for regional coordination of agencies has been developed that will be released shortly to departments, community groups and iwi.
