Minister of Communications and Information Technology Paul Swain congratulated business incubator ICEHOUSE on its project to develop a training programme for the CEOs of kiwi companies expanding overseas.

Auckland-based ICEHOUSE (International Centre for Entrepreneurship) has received $100,000 from Industry New Zealand to develop a leading-edge programme for CEOs of high-growth New Zealand-based businesses.

“The programme is being developed in response to recommendations in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Taskforce report, ‘ Breaking the Barriers’ and advice from other sectors,” said Mr Swain.

“The taskforce identified having the necessary commercialisation experience and skills to go global as the critical success factor for kiwi ICT companies,” said Mr Swain. “The taskforce’s report recommended an educational programme for growing global businesses, targeted at business leaders in the ICT sector.

“The programme will focus on developing high growth entrepreneurs to take their businesses into a phase of significant international expansion.

“Industry New Zealand has widened the scope to include all New Zealand-based businesses that are growing global markets and have successfully passed through start-up phase, rather than just ICT companies,” said Mr Swain.

“If New Zealand is to turn its goal of getting back into the top half of the OECD into reality we need to support our talented entrepreneurs so they can grow their businesses internationally, thereby creating more jobs and foreign exchange earnings for New Zealand. We already have many innovative dynamic companies and business people. However we need to equip our business leaders with the skills and knowledge to succeed in a very competitive global market,” said Mr Swain.
