“Attention to quality, good management, strategic thinking, and strong public/private partnerships are positioning the industry to confront the issues it is facing, both in the short and long-term,” Tourism Minister Mark Burton said during a visit to Tauranga today.

Speaking at the opening of Tauranga’s new Ridge Country Retreat, Mark Burton stressed that the New Zealand tourism sector must continue to provide all visitors with the “highest possible level of quality for every single guest.

“I believe that the entire tourism sector is committed to building an ever more professional, high-quality tourism industry. A strong commitment to quality and sustainability is becoming the norm throughout the tourism industry—essential in managing the very real challenges the sector is facing.

“In the short-term, we must manage the impacts of such headline-making events as the war in Iraq and the SARS virus. Such events certainly have the capability to influence the market, but is simply too early to judge what, if any, long-term impacts they will have on tourism in New Zealand. I remain confident about the long-term growth path for New Zealand tourism.

“Overall, however, the impacts appear to be relatively small at this stage. Indeed, statistics released today indicate that following record arrivals in March 2002—a period which coincided with the Easter holidays—visitor arrivals for March 2003 have only decreased by four percent. In comparison with March 2001, arrivals have increased by 9.1 percent.

“In the long-term, the sector is also facing the challenge of sustainability. If we are going to realise the full potential of our thriving tourism market, we must balance strong industry growth with care, protection, and, wherever possible, enhancement of our unique environments, as well as for the communities and cultures of New Zealand who host and supply services to our guests.

“New Zealand’s focus must remain on building a fundamentally strong industry—an industry with a focus on quality, a vision of where it is going and who its customers are. Our businesses must adhere to best practice in all aspects of their own operations, and they must be staffed by appropriately skilled, qualified and motivated people.

As Minister of Tourism, I am committed to continuing my working partnership with the sector to making appropriate choices for both the industry and New Zealand—to keep this industry vital and to realise the potential of, and the inherent responsibilities in, building a truly sustainable, high-quality tourism industry for New Zealand.
