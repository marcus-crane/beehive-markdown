Police Minister George Hawkins and Transport Minister Paul Swain urged drivers to be vigilant on the roads over the Easter break.  
A recent spate of crashes has pushed the number of road deaths for this year to 143, up from 123 at the same time last year.  
“Although we are making good progress with the road toll and the long-term trend is down I’m disappointed at the number of accidents in recent weeks,” said Mr Swain.  
Thirty-four people were killed in a ten day span from 28 March to 6 April this year - nine more than died in the entire month of April 2002.  
"Eighteen of those 34 deaths involved speed or alcohol, six involved driver fatigue and four people died because they weren't wearing safety belts,” said Mr Swain. “It's a terrible waste, and it shows that we can't afford to forget the basics of safe driving - buckle up, stay sober, keep speed down and take breaks. When people ignore these fundamentals, the results can be deadly.  
“The police Highway Patrol will be out in full force over the Easter weekend, said Mr Hawkins. “Drink-driving and speed will be top of the list for enforcement, but police are also asking drivers to help themselves stay safe and ensure that traffic flows properly.  
“Keeping the road toll down is the responsibility of all of us,” said Mr Hawkins. “I hope that we all have a happy – and safe - Easter.”
