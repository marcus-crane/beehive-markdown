A revamped fall prevention manual developed by ACC and the Otago University Medical School will help prevent injuries among older people, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson says.

Launching the manual, Ms Dyson said it was a concise, well-written and illustrated guide which would help health and exercise professionals to create customised programmes that improved older people’s balance and strengthened their lower limbs.

"Too often, elderly people lose their independence because of a fall, but with proper balance and strength training, their risk of falling is greatly reduced. The programme is an excellent practical example of how to support older people to lead more healthy and active lives and to ‘age in place’.”

Ms Dyson said the research behind the programme had won international approval from researchers and health services.

“There are few fall prevention programmes that combine good quality research evidence and detailed 'how to do it' advice that we know will significantly reduce falls among older people.”

The Otago Exercise Programme to Prevent Falls in Older Adults is designed for exercise instructors such as nurses and physiotherapists who work with older people. It is based on research made possible in part by ACC funding, and draws on internationally-respected work by members of the Otago University Fall Prevention Research Group.

The researchers, Professor John Campbell, Dr Clare Robertson and Dr Melinda Gardner, authored an earlier manual which forms the basis for the one launched.
