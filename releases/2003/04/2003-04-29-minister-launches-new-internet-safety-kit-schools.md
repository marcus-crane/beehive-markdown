A new internet safety kit for schools was launched at Wellington’s Hataitai School today by the Minister of Education Trevor Mallard and the New Zealand Police Commissioner Rob Robinson.

“Today’s schools have their work cut out for them in providing a ‘cybersafe’ learning environment for students and staff and the time is right for the revised NetSafe Kit for Schools,” said Trevor Mallard.

The kit is produced by the Internet Safety Group (ISG) and is an updated version of the ISG’s Internet Safety Kit (2000).

The ISG is the Ministry of Education’s designated agent of choice for internet safety resources, advice and professional development. The Ministry has described the kit as a “model of best practice” and surveys have shown that the majority of schools are using it.

“The effectiveness of a number of important government strategies requires cyber environments that are safe for all users if the full potential of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is to be realised,” Trevor Mallard said.

One example is Project PROBE, the delivery of broadband access to all schools by 2004, which will provide them with access to an increased range of resources and activities on the Internet.

At today’s launch Trevor Mallard announced that he has asked the Ministry of Education to work with key government departments on how best to provide support for internet safety across government.
