Health and Food Safety Minister Annette King today called on the dietary supplements and complementary medicines industry to cooperate responsibly in a voluntary withdrawal from the market of dietary supplements, manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals, and available in New Zealand.

“Unfortunately because of the lack of regulation over complementary medicines in New Zealand, we have no register and no power to conduct a compulsory recall of these products in these circumstances, as they have done in Australia,” said Ms King.

“However, that does not mean we are not concerned. We are relying on the industry to work alongside the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) and the Ministry of Health in withdrawing these products voluntarily.”

Ms King said the NZFSA expects to have received from Australia by tomorrow morning a full list of all the Pan Pharmaceutical products that have been identified by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for recall.

The NZFSA and the Ministry of Health will immediately make that list available on their websites (www.nzfsa.govt.nz and www.moh.govt.nz), and will issue a privileged statement containing the list by Friday.
