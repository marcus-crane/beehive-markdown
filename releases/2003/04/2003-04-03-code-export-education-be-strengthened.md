Education Minister Trevor Mallard today launched a public discussion document aimed at strengthening the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students, and further protecting the billion-dollar export education industry.

“Growth in export education has been rapid over the last three years. This is a billion-dollar industry and we must make sure that the rapid growth is not at the expense of quality, that international students continue to be well cared for, and that this escalation in student numbers does not jeopardise our international reputation,” Trevor Mallard said.

Student numbers expanded from 28,000 in 1999 to over 82,000 in 2002, and close to 1,000 providers now participate in export education.

“The code has been in force since March 2002. Practical experience over the last year and the rapid growth in student numbers has revealed a number of areas for possible improvement and strengthening of the code of practice,” Trevor Mallard said.

The Ministry of Education is seeking sector comment by 2 May on a raft of proposed changes including:

·Changes to accommodate new requirements that short courses of less than three months be covered by the code. This is to align the code with the Education (Tertiary Reform) Amendment Act 2002 which requires providers of these short courses to be accredited and registered as private training establishments.

·Amendments to the code to address the rapid increase in the number of very young international students who are aged under 13 years.

“I have concerns about the emotional well-being of very young international students studying in New Zealand without adequate parental guidance or supervision,” Trevor Mallard said.

“While no final decisions have been made, I have asked the ministry to look at amending the code to restrict the enrolment of very young international students, to those living with a parent or legal guardian. This might also entail the introduction by the New Zealand Immigration Service of ‘guardian visas’ to enable those parents to stay in the country to take care of their kids.”

·The consultation document also proposes a strengthening of welfare and accommodation provisions to protect international students aged 18 and over.

“There have been allegations recently of serious mistreatment in international accommodation facilities. It is essential that all providers have a duty of care to ensure that all international students, not just those aged under 18, are in a safe physical and emotional environment during their stay in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.

·It is also proposed that the eligibility of international students to access publicly funded health and disability services be tightened.

“This could include removing the eligibility of holders of temporary permits, except where New Zealand has international obligations. The ministry is considering amending the code to also require that health insurance for international students be obtained, and maintained for the duration of their stay in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.

Other proposed amendments range from wording clarifications to amending the ability of the code administrator to refer matters to the International Education Appeal Authority.

“The code as it stands is focussed on international students coming to New Zealand. With growing involvement in the provision of programmes offshore, the ministry will also be considering the possibility of separate provisions under the code, or new guidelines, for offshore provision later this year,” Trevor Mallard said.

“These proposals represent important developments in the industry and I urge all education providers enrolling international students who, by law, must be signatories to the code, to take part in this consultation process.”

Submissions on the discussion document close on 2 May 2003.

The Ministry will consider feedback received on the discussion document before a revised code is published by the deadline of 1 July 2003.

The discussion document has today been mailed to all education providers enrolling international students. Copies of the code and of the discussion document are available on-line at www.minedu.govt.nz/goto/international or by e-mailing international.unit@minedu.govt.nz.
