Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel and acting Pacific Island Affairs Minister Chris Carter announced today that the Pacific Access Category (PAC) will be expanded to include Fiji nationals.

The category, a limited access programme, currently allows for 250 people from Tonga, 75 from Tuvalu and 50 from Kiribati to apply for New Zealand residence every year.

The changes announced today will include 250 places a year for Fiji nationals and the number of places for Kiribati nationals will increase to 75. The changes take effect from 1 July 2003.

Lianne Dalziel said including Fiji in the PAC signalled a step towards strengthening  
New Zealand’s relationship with Fiji.

“This move recognises our historic, economic and cultural ties with Fiji and the contribution that Fijians have made, and continue to make, to New Zealand,” she said.

“It also allows us to rebuild the strong ties that New Zealand had with Fiji prior to the 2000 coup in that country. Now that political stability has been returned to Fiji, it is timely to make this decision.”

Chris Carter welcomed the changes as a positive step.

“We have special relationships and close cultural ties with our Pacific neighbours, and although limited this scheme will continue to assist these small nations by providing some certainty for them,” he said.

The PAC was established on 1 July 2002 as a residence category after the abolition of the humanitarian category in 2001.

PAC applicants must first lodge a registration form with the New Zealand Immigration Service (NZIS) between 1 July 2003 and 12 August 2003. All registrations will be entered into the relevant PAC pool and a random, electronic ballot run the month after registration, until the limit for each country is reached.
