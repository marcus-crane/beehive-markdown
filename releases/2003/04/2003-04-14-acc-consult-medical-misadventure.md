ACC will consult publicly on a number of options to improve cover for medical misadventure, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said today.

Medical misadventure refers to:  
·medical error: where a registered health professional or an organisation fails to observe the standard of care and skills reasonably expected in the circumstances; and  
·medical mishap: where treatment properly given by, or at the direction of, a registered health professional, causes injury. For a claim to be accepted as medical mishap, the injury must be rare (ie it would not occur in more than one per cent of cases where treatment was given) and severe.

“Victims of medical error are the only ACC claimants who have to prove someone is to blame for their injury. ACC is meant to be a ‘no fault’ scheme, and it is not fair that people harmed by medical care are treated differently from those injured at work or playing sport,” Ms Dyson said.

“The rare and severe criteria for medical mishap are also seen as being too restrictive. In particular, there is concern that people who suffer severe consequences from medical treatment have to prove that those consequences would not occur in more than one per cent of cases where treatment was given.”

Ruth Dyson said the options for public consultation were:  
·the status quo, with operational improvements and a later change to the one per cent rarity criteria through regulations;  
·changes to ACC legislation to amend the definitions of medical error and medical mishap;  
·cover for medical misadventure if the injury could have been prevented; and  
·cover for medical misadventure unless the events during treatment were normal, expected and intended eg an incision to undertake a surgical procedure would not be covered.

Ms Dyson said ACC would also consult publicly on related issues, including cover for minor injuries, time limits for lodging claims, information provided to the public, statutory reporting of medical misadventure by ACC, additional compensation for those who have suffered a medical error, and the definition of treatment.  
She said the government had decided not to levy registered health professionals and/or organisations to pay for medical misadventure claims. Instead, ACC would continue to fund the claims from its Earners and Non-Earners Accounts.

Consultation is expected to begin in June 2003.
