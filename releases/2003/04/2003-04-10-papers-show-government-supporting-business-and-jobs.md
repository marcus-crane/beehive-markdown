Papers showing that EDS will receive $1.5 million to create 360 high skilled jobs in New Zealand or return the money were released by Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton today.

“The papers show the case for supporting EDS to ensure the new major client contact centre and software applications development centre is built for EDS New Zealand and not at an EDS centre somewhere else in the world. It is a major vote of confidence in New Zealand’s skills and infrastructure.

“Benefits include generating more than $200 million of foreign exchange earnings over the next eight years and introducing New Zealand companies to the global EDS network of contacts,” said Jim Anderton.

“The papers show there was thorough debate on the issues and there was advice from departments and agencies both for and against the investment. While Investment New Zealand supported the partnership with EDS, Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development had some concerns.

“Government Ministers considered the advice and decided on balance, that we were on the side of supporting businesses and jobs.

“Our active economic development policies have been described by the OECD as best practice and we are following international examples of how to work with businesses to create a stronger economy,” said Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton is on his way to Europe to view first hand other countries’ economic development programmes.

The move has been described in one UK publication, in very positive terms, as EDS ‘outsourcing’ work to New Zealand.
