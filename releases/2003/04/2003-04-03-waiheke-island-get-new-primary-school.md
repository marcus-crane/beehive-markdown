A second state primary school will be established on Waiheke Island to meet projected population growth, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The school is scheduled to open at the beginning of 2005.

The decision to establish a new full primary school, for students from new entrants to year 8 (form two), follows consultation with existing schools and the local community.

"I'd like to thank all parents, the boards of trustees and members of the Waiheke community who participated in the consultation process. I have carefully considered all your views and hope the establishment of this school will be welcomed by parents on the Island," Trevor Mallard said.

The school is being established to take pressure off Te Huruhi School and Waiheke High School, as the site of the existing schools in Donald Bruce Road has reached capacity.

“There are currently 830 primary school age students on Waiheke, with this number projected to grow to more than one thousand by 2016.”

The new school on the Seaview Road site, which was purchased for a primary school in 1996, will be able to accommodate up to 286 students.

Five Waiheke Island residents have been appointed to the establishment board of trustees - Ray Ericson, Dr Chris Greaves, Bill MacLeod, Glen Rees and Carol Webb. Nominations for the board were sought from a range of parties including local schools, residents, community groups, Auckland City Council and local MPs.

“The members of the board were chosen because of their skills and background. I am pleased that the board is comprised entirely of Waiheke Island residents to ensure the school reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community.”

The establishment board appoints the principal and other staff, as well as determining school policy, sound governance practices and contributing to the school design. It will be in place until an elected board can take over. School elections are likely to be held within six months of the school opening.
