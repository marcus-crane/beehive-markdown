Health Minister Annette King says she is being advised daily by the Ministry of Health on latest developments concerning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and is confident the Ministry, working with an expert independent technical advisory council, is keeping New Zealanders well informed.

Ms King said the latest information on SARS could be obtained from the Ministry website (www.moh.govt.nz/sars) and New Zealanders concerned about aspects of SARS could also phone 0800 0800 80.
