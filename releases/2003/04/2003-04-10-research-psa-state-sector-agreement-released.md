State Services Minister Trevor Mallard and the Public Services Association today released a research report into the implementation of the Partnership for Quality agreement in a number of government organisations.

In May 2000 the Government and the PSA (Public Services Association) agreed to try a new approach to industrial relations. This approach was formalised as the “Partnership for Quality” agreement.

In March 2002 the Government commissioned a review of the implementation of the Partnership for Quality approach. The PSA and the State Services Commission jointly commissioned a research report to evaluate the implementation of the agreement in a number of government organisations.

“The report finds that the majority of surveyed staff are aware of the new approach and have a positive view of Partnership for Quality and its effect on working relationships,” Trevor Mallard said.

“It identifies examples of best practice in the implementation of the agreement, barriers to it working and ways to overcome those barriers, and suggests ways to improve implementation.”

PSA national secretary Richard Wagstaff said the findings of the review report demonstrate that Partnership for Quality is a constructive and positive strategy which is working and which is proving mutually beneficial to employees and employers – and ultimately to New Zealanders.

“Partnership for Quality is an approach which involves a much wider understanding of the role of the union than simply a bargaining agent or workplace representative.

“It involves the direct collective participation of employees in decision-making through their union; common ownership of plans, issues and problems; and an acceptance by the government that the union is a stakeholder with rights and interests,” Richard Wagstaff said.

A number of common themes emerged from the research:

·A closer Union-Employer relationship - most staff in the surveyed organisations believe that Partnership for Quality has resulted in closer working relationships with their employer. The closer relationship appears to have some positive benefits with most staff thinking that collective contract negotiations have become less stressful and most feel comfortable to involve the union in workplace issues.  
·Communication – the approach has resulted in some improvements in communication with staff feeling that the PSA and management are communicating with them and each other better.  
·Awareness – most staff are aware of the Partnership for Quality.  
·Structure and support – most staff reported that their employer is supportive of the Partnership for Quality Agreement.  
·Behaviour – for the Partnership for Quality to be a success, everyone must behave according the partnership principles (share commitment, openness, engaging, union independence, quality, involvement and influence). The degree that this is happening varies across departments.  
·Improved quality of services – a number of staff feel they have been given the opportunity to improve the quality of their work and have received more training and improved the quality of services they deliver to New Zealanders.  
“The lessons learnt from this review are valuable and will now be used to help other government agencies improve their implementation of the partnership approach,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I am particularly pleased that the new approach seems to be having positive benefits for staff and the public through improving communication flows and the delivery of services.”
