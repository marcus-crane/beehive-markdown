The Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia today announced that businessman Wayne Walden will chair the Maori Television Service Board.

Mr Walden’s appointment to the MTS board, and that of former television executive Rod Cornelius, fill positions left vacant by the resignation of Derek Fox earlier this year and Wayne Brown last year.

They will join Wena Tait who is the Crown’s third director.

Parekura Horomia said the pair bring to MTS a vast amount of skill and experience in business and broadcasting.

“Mr Walden, who has been acting as an executive advisor to the board, will cease that role to become a director. His signficant experience in business and his history with MTS make him ideal for the job.”

“Mr Walden will oversee the establishment phase of the channel, and has agreed to remain as Chair through its first full year of operation to 31 December 2004,” Mr Horomia said.

Parekura Horomoia said: “Mr Walden’s appointment as chair has been discussed with the chair of Te Putahi Paoho (Maori electorial college), Mr Hone Harawira, and we are in agreement that Mr Walden has the appropriate experience and skills required to do the job.”

Rod Cornelius has an extensive background in the broadcasting industry, including holding senior positions with Television New Zealand and the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation.

Current Acting Chair Ani Waaka, one of the four Te Putahi Paho directcors, has been confirmed as Deputy Chair for a three year term.

All MTS directorships are interim positions until the Maori Television Services Bill is passed into legislation.
