Ngati Tama (north Taranaki) became the second Taranaki iwi to reach the parliamentary stage of the Treaty Settlement process when its Treaty Claims Settlement Bill was introduced to the House today.

Ngati Tama and the Crown signed a Deed of Settlement in December 2001 providing for financial and cultural redress totalling $14.5 million in reparation for loss of life and destruction of property during the Taranaki wars, and for the confiscation of land.

The Ngati Tama Claims Settlement Bill enacts those parts of the final and comprehensive settlement that require legislation.

The Ngati Ruanui Treaty Claims Settlement Bill is also making its way through the parliamentary process, with the third and final reading of the Bill expected to take place on 1 May. A delegation of Ngati Ruanui will be present in Parliament on the day in recognition of the mana and prestige of this historic event.
