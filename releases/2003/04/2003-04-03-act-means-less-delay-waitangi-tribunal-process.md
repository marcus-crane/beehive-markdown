Mäori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said the passage of legislation effected through the Mâori Purposes Bill (No 2) 2002 will do three things.

First, an amendment to the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 will allow the Waitangi Tribunal to replace members for reasons of illness or other circumstances that prevent them from carrying out their duties.

Second, the Broadcasting Act 1989 is amended to allow for the transfer of responsibility for Mäori broadcasting policy and Te Reo Whakapuaki (Te Mängai Päho) from the Minister of Broadcasting to the Minister of Mäori Affairs.

Third, amendments to the Mäori Land Amendment and Mäori Land Claims Adjustment Act 1926 will increase the number of fishing licenses available to members of Ngäti Tüwharetoa for Lake Taupô, from 50 licences to 200.

“I believe the changes in particular to the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 would be welcomed by Tribunal claimants,” said Parekura Horomia

“Inquiries into Treaty claims are already long and often arduous for claimant groups. It is in everyone’s interest that the process for resolving claims happens as quickly as possible,” the Minister said.
