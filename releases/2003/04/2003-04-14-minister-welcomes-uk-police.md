Police Minister George Hawkins today welcomed 76 experienced United Kingdom police officers recruited specifically to serve in Auckland to the Royal New Zealand Police College.

The members of British High Commission Wing 212, including 70 male and six female officers, were welcomed with a powhiri at the College this morning.

The officers would be required to serve at least two years in Auckland City and Counties Manukau policing districts, and continued the focus of providing police for the Auckland area, Mr Hawkins says.

“In fact, between 1 July 2002 and today, 190 graduates have gone to the three Auckland districts,” Mr Hawkins said.

“With the United Kingdom police included, a further 116 will go to Auckland by 30 June this year, making a total of 306 graduates sent there over the last 12 months,” he said.

The officers will graduate on 26 June 2003 after an 11-week accelerated course at the College.

While based on the current 19-week recruit training programme, the course takes into account the officers’ previous experience. Tailored around skills deemed essential for Counties Manukau and Auckland City, it includes police, driver, computer and firearms training, as well as defensive tactics.

Of the 76 officers, 50 had previously held the rank of constable, 10 detective constable, one detective sergeant, 14 sergeant and one trainee detective constable.

Fifteen of the officers are aged between 26-30 years, 28 between 31-35 years, and 33 between 36-41 years. Nine had previous police experience of between two and 10 years, 34 between five and 10 years, 22 between 11 and 15 years, and 11 between 16 and 20 years.
