Attorney-General Margaret Wilson leaves tomorrow for Melbourne where she will  
attend the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG).

This is a regular forum for the Attorneys-General of all the Australian states and of New Zealand to meet and discuss new legal developments and matters of mutual interest.

Following SCAG Margaret Wilson will attend the 13th Commonwealth Law Conference which is also on in Melbourne.  
This is the first time the Conference has been held in Australasia since 1990 when it was hosted by the New Zealand Law Society in Auckland, and speakers include a range of eminent Commonwealth jurists.  
Significant topics to be discussed at the Conference, which are directly relevant to current developments in New Zealand, include the future role of the legal profession, litigation in the new millennium and human rights (including indigenous rights) issues.
