Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton visited Hokitika today and announced $30,000 for Recruitment West Coast to recruit and train workers.

The funding from the Ministry of Economic Development’s Regional Investment Fund will meet half the costs of enabling the employment of a recruitment co-ordinator to:  
·provide information and promote the region to people outside the West Coast;  
·assist businesses to write job descriptions, advertisements and select staff  
·liaise with industry and business training opportunities to keep abreast of skill needs and training opportunities.

Others, including Department of Work and Income staff, the Community Employment Group of the Department of Labour, the West Coast Development Trust, the West Coast District Health Board, are also contributing funds and other support.

“This approach is an excellent way to address the skills shortages the West Coast faces,” said Jim Anderton.

“The approach is already supported by local business, councils and trusts and as support grows then funding for the approach can be found locally.”

“Addressing these labour shortages will allow progress to be made on the West Coast Region Economic Development Plan.

“Skills shortages are affecting much of New Zealand and this West Coast proposal is a sensible way to address the issue that may well be picked up in other regions facing similar problems,” said Jim Anderton.

Recruit West Coast’s members include Work and Income, Venture West Coast, the Community Employment Group, GROW, the West Coast District Health Board, District Councils, the Tertiary Education Commission and Education West Coast.
