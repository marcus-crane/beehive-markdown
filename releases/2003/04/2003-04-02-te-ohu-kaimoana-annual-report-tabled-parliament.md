The Hon Parekura Horomia tabled the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission’s annual report for the year ending 30 September 2002 in Parliament on Tuesday 1 April 2003.

Mr Horomia took the opportunity to congratulate the Commissioners on a remarkable year of achievement – gaining the support of 91 percent of Iwi representing 96 percent of the Iwi affiliate population to report a method of allocation to the Minister of Fisheries.

“This particular financial year was an important one for the Fisheries Commission. They released a number of proposals in December 2001 for allocating the Fisheries Settlement; consulted with Iwi and the wider Maori community; developed a single method of allocation and released that in August 2002. In the last month of the financial year, the Commissioners met again with most Iwi around the country and brought agreement to almost all Iwi.”

Mr Horomia said the Commissioners undertook a phenomenal amount of work during the year and the results are a clear indication of their commitment.

Mr Horomia said the Commission continued to grow the Fisheries Assets in a responsible manner. The Commission reported an after-tax profit of $19.7 million on an operating surplus before tax of $23 million.

He also added that the Commission continues to be a significant source of educational funding, again distributing $1.1 million in the financial year towards training that puts Maori into the business of fishing.

“Since 1994, $8.3 million has been used to educate and train more Maori to participate in the fishing industry,” he said.
