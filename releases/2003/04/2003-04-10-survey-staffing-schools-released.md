Nearly 43 per cent of secondary schools, and 11 per cent of primary schools began the school year with vacancies, according to the annual survey of staffing in state and integrated schools, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The survey results were released today, and are based on a questionnaire taken on the first day of the school year. The response rate was 97 per cent of schools.

“The level of vacancies is of concern. I have invited the secondary teachers’ union, the PPTA, to have discussions with me about staffing initiatives around recruitment and retention to see if there is more than can be done, on top of existing initiatives,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The increase in vacancies revealed in the survey is consistent with roll growth due to the population bulge that has moved from the primary sector through to the secondary sector. It also lines up with international trends.

“According to January preliminary roll data, secondary enrolments were estimated to be around 256,450, an increase of around 8,120 on last year. Actual school rolls will not be known until the March data collections.

“At the beginning of 2003, the 266 secondary teaching vacancies represented 1.7 per cent of the total teaching workforce, compared to 1.5 per cent last year. The survey shows schools managed the vacancies by mainly employing trained relief staff.

“As part of the teachers’ employment agreement settlement last year, the Government promised an extra 373 teachers over and above what is needed for roll growth. This also partly explains the higher level of vacancies schools might have experienced.”

“The situation was also exacerbated by the requirement for approximately 750 extra teachers to teach the more than 10,000 foreign fee paying students in secondary schools.”

Trevor Mallard said the survey also showed that primary and secondary schools appeared to have greater difficulty filling their vacancies this year. The number of re-advertised positions, which indicates the number of positions which are “hard to staff”, represented more than half of all secondary vacancies (up from 42.8 per cent in 2002).

As with previous years, the results showed that vacancies are mostly concentrated in certain subjects, for example science subjects (15.7 per cent of vacancies), technology (16 per cent of vacancies) and English (15.8 per cent of vacancies).

“Teacher supply will continue to be monitored as secondary roll growth continues, and I believe the situation is manageable,” Trevor Mallard said.

“There are a number of initiatives in place aimed at increasing teacher supply. These include targeting subjects where shortages have been identified, for example, the Secondary Subject Trainee Allowances for chemistry, English, computing, te reo Mäori, mathematics, physical education and physics, worth up to $10,000.  
“So far this year over 50 New Zealand trained secondary teachers have received the International Relocation Grant to return home to teach.

“Late last year the Ministry of Education contracted three recruitment agencies to actively encourage New Zealand secondary teachers working in the United Kingdom to return to New Zealand to teach.

“Looking to the future, training providers have told the Ministry of Education there are 217 more secondary trainees teachers enrolled this year compared to last, bringing the total number of new enrolments to 1510,” Trevor Mallard said.

Other initiatives include:  
·Mäori, Pasifika and rural scholarships worth $10,000 each  
·Retraining for former secondary teachers.  
·Returning to teaching allowances.  
·Conversion courses to enable existing primary teachers with degree qualifications to teach in secondary schools.  
·National relocation grants for teachers to move to teaching jobs in other parts of New Zealand.  
·International relocation grants of NZ$5,000 to encourage New Zealand teachers teaching overseas to return home.  
·International relocation grants of NZ$3,000 to encourage overseas trained teachers to come to New Zealand to teach.
