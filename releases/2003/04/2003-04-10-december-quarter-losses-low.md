Work stoppage figures for the December 2002 quarter were some of the lowest seen under the Employment Relations Act in terms of person-days and wages lost, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“Mediation Services played a key role in minimising the losses, ” she said.

While the December 2002 year-end figures were comparatively high this was largely due to the teachers dispute.

“But nevertheless on average figures under the Employment Relations Act continue to be lower than those seen under National’s Employment Contracts Act,” Margaret Wilson said.
