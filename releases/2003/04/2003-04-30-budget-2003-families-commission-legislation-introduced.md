Legislation establishing the Families Commission was introduced to Parliament today and the $28.233m in new funding allocated to it in Budget 2003 was announced.

The Families Commission will act as an advocate for the interests of families within the government and in the public arena. It will also commission research into family issues and parenting support programmes. Four year funding of $28.233m has been allocated in Budget 2003 for the Commission.

Steve Maharey said establishing the commission gives effect to the confidence and supply agreement with United Future and advances the policy priorities of the Labour and Progressive partners in the coalition government.

"Successful parenting and strong families are crucial to the future of New Zealand. We can't expect young people to grow up with aspirations and dreams if they come from neglectful or abusive homes where parents simply do not know what to do.

"The Families Commission will take an inclusive approach to the wide variety of family types that exist in New Zealand. We want to emphasise the important function families perform in our society, rather than promoting any particular family form.

"Funding allocated to the Commission will ensure that it is able to effectively perform its role.

"Labour included plans to establish a Parenting Council to advise the government on future investments in parenting support and education and fund best practice pilots. The Families Commission will have dedicated resources to assume these functions.

"The legislation will be referred to the Social Services Select Committee for public submissions. The government intends to see it passed into law by the end of the year," Steve Maharey said.

**Families Commission - Questions and Answers**

**What is the proposed scope of the Families Commission?**

The Commission will adopt a broad and inclusive approach to families to ensure it encompasses the wide variety of family living arrangements in contemporary New Zealand as well as the roles and functions families play. These roles and functions include: providing emotional, psychological and material support for their members (both adults and children); nurturing and protecting children and other vulnerable family members; and passing on culture, knowledge, and obligations.

**What are the proposed functions of the Families Commission?**

The primary and legislatively mandated function for the Commission will be advocacy. The Families Commission will act as an advocate for families generally, both at the government level and in the public arena. It will not act as advocate for individual family's cases or issues.

In order to fulfil its main function the Commission will also :

- encourage and facilitate informed debate on matters relating to the interests of families;
- increase public awareness and promote better understanding of matters relating to the interests of families, for example;
  
  - the importance of stable family relationships (including those between parties to a marriage or a de facto relationship);
  - the importance of the parenting role; and
  - the rights and responsibilities of parents.
- encourage and facilitate the development and provision of policies to promote or serve the interests of families;
- consider, and to report and make recommendations on, any matter relating to families that is referred to it by any Minister;
- engage with Government to encourage incorporation of family related issues in Government's policy agenda, including by identifying new and emerging policy issues; and
- promote, stimulate, purchase and publicise research on families.

**How will Government ensure that the Families Commission is responsive to the full range of New Zealand families?**

While it is important that the Commission has a degree of independence from Government, Government has also decided that it should be subject to guidance both in terms of its scope and priorities. The Bill establishing the Commission will, therefore, include guidance to provide a transparent frame of reference for the Commission when it undertakes its functions.

The sort of matters that the Families Commission will be required to have regard to include:

- any ministerial statement of Government family policy and/or priorities that is communicated in writing to the Commission;
- the diversity of families and family groups in New Zealand;
- the needs, values and beliefs of Maori as tangata whenua; and
- the needs, values and beliefs of the Pacific peoples of New Zealand; and
- the needs, values and beliefs of other ethnic and cultural groups.

In addition to this statutory guidance and the appointment of Commissioners representing diverse skills and interests, it is also proposed to require the Commission to establish mechanisms to allow it to work effectively alongside and receive advice from various communities of interests. These interests include Maori as tangata whenua, Pacific peoples of New Zealand, other ethnic and cultural groups, parents, children and young people and groups representing their interests, women, service providers, academics, researchers, family law specialists, employers and so on.

It will be up to the Commission to determine how best to give effect to this requirement. In addition to consultation meetings at the community level, the Commission may choose to establish advisory groups to contribute particular viewpoints, for instance on parenting issues.

**What priority will parenting issues have in the Families Commission?**

The Government intends to communicate to the Commission once it is established that it will be expected to have an early focus and place a high priority on families who are parenting children (or caring for other dependants, for example elderly parents, or adult family members with disabilities) to ensure that their needs are addressed across all of the Commission's proposed functions. This does not mean that the Commission will always prioritise parenting issues over other issues. Rather, the Commission will review and adjust its priorities over time, taking into account Government family policy and/or priorities.

**What is the relationship of the Families Commission with other agencies?**

A number of government agencies already play a significant role in the provision of family policy, services and research. It is not intended that these roles should be replicated by the Families Commission.

Effective advocacy for families will, however, rely on the Commission building and maintaining constructive relationships with government and individuals and agencies with expertise and knowledge of family issues.

**How many Commissioners will there be and how will they be appointed?**

The Bill will provide for up to seven Commissioners, including a Chief Commissioner, on a part or full time basis. As well as having skills and expertise relevant to family issues, people with governance and directorship skills will be needed as Commissioners to oversee and govern the Families Commission as a separate legal entity.

**What is the proposed process for the Families Commission Bill and when will this happen?**

The Bill will be introduced and referred to the Social Services Select Committee. The Committee will call for public submissions. The Bill is expected to be passed before the end of the year.

**What funding is being provided for the Commission and how will it be used?**

In this year's budget Government will provide $2.4 million (GST inclusive) in 2003/04 to establish the Commission. Funding of $7.891 million will be provided in 2004/05 for the Commission's operating costs, rising to $8.391 million in 2005/06 and $9.191 million in 2005/06 and outyears (all figures GST inclusive). This operating funding will fund all the Commission's activities including advocacy, public awareness, and the purchase of research.

**Who was consulted during the development of the proposals contained in the Families Commission Bill?**

The proposals for the Commission have been developed in consultation with the United Future party.

Also, the Ministry of Social Development undertook an information sharing exercise on Cabinet's decisions on the Families Commission with around 25 key stakeholders in February and March 2003. These organisations included those with parenting interests, family-related service providers and umbrella organisations, advocates, family law practitioners, academics and union representatives.

**Why is it proposed to establish the Families Commission as a Crown Entity?**

While the Families Commission will receive government funding, it is important that it have a degree of independence so that it can carry out its functions effectively. This is why the Families Commission is to be established as a Crown entity.

Establishing the Commission as a Crown entity means that it is legally separate from the Crown but owned by the Crown. Government has an established framework for Crown entities which includes governance mechanisms and the arrangements for appointments. The Families Commission will be established consistent with that framework.

**When will the Families Commission start?**

The Commission will be established by 1 July 2004.
