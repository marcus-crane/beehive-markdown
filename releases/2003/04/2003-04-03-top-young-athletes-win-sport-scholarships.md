More than 250 talented athletes in the Auckland region have received the Prime Minister’s sporting scholarships to help them reach their sporting and educational goals, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

The 252 Auckland-based scholarship recipients come from a pool of 463 athletes nationwide who were offered this year’s scholarships, worth up to $16,000 per annum.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships are a government initiative administered by the New Zealand Academy of Sport. They were established in 2000 to help athletes pursue academic or trade studies as well as sporting careers.

“This Government has committed $9 million over a three-year period for the programme because we want young sportspeople to achieve excellence. These scholarships help young athletes who have the potential to grow into our sporting greats,” Helen Clark said.

Swimmer Dean Kent was among today’s recipients of the Prime Minister’s scholarships. Dean is currently studying a Bachelor of Business. His outstanding performance at the World Cup in Berlin last year made him the sixth fastest in history for his discipline.

Another recipient was weightlifter George Taamaru. George was seventh at Manchester last year and won gold at the world championships in Malaysia in 2002. George is studying for a Diploma in Business.

“It is important for sportspeople to have balance in their lives. Studying for a tertiary qualification trains them to cope with the pressures of sporting competition. It also ensures other opportunities exist once they retire from their sporting pursuits,” Helen Clark said.

Trevor Mallard said athletes receiving scholarships will have their full tertiary fees paid – up to $10,000 per annum.

“Athletes may also be entitled to an allowance which is dependant upon their study loading. This is a huge help for those who are struggling to make ends meet while juggling a busy lifestyle,” Trevor Mallard said.

Scholarships are available to athletes who are either currently carded by their national sport organisation and accessing services linked to the New Zealand Academy of Sport or athletes from non-carded sports who are prioritised by their national sport organisation.

There will be a second intake for the scholarship programme in June, allowing newly carded athletes to apply.

Trevor Mallard will present the scholarships at a ceremony at AUT Wellesley St Conference Room, Auckland, tonight (starts 5.45pm).
