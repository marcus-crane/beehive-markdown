New Zealand’s 700,000 kiwis overseas are a vital resource and we need to make use of them and their networks, said Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton to Kiwi expats in London today.

Speaking to the Kiwi Expatriate Association (KEA) Jim Anderton outlined aims to better utilise the 20 per cent of the New Zealanders overseas using New Zealand Trade and Enterprise programmes.

“New Zealand Expatriates are a natural referral point for foreign companies looking for places to trade, and many have skills we can use to develop New Zealand industry and create jobs.

“Already we have piloted the ‘World Class New Zealanders’ programme to bring kiwi expertise home but the budget will contain other trade and skills initiatives to build on this.

“I am pleased to announce an Industry NZ and KEA joint award, the World Class New Zealander Award to honour expatriates who give something back to New Zealand. This annual award will recognise an expatriate who has made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand’s economic development, by actively assisting New Zealand industry and building our global connections. The NZ Connection website has details.

“To ensure New Zealand continues as one of the healthiest economies in the OECD (with growth of 4.4 per cent in 2002, and unemployment below 5 per cent for the first time in 15 years) the Labour Progressive Coalition Government is committed to encouraging innovation to maintain sustainable economic development.

"New Zealanders overseas, from PhDs to plumbers, are skilled and have a wide range of influential contacts outside NZ. New Zealanders developed refrigerated shipping for meat exports, jet boating and bungy jumping, along with the tranquilliser gun, seismic 'base' isolators, electric fences, freezer vacuum pumps, the stamp vending machine, the electronic petrol pump, the world's fastest motorcycle, the disposable syringe, and child-proof medicine bottles. We are an innovative nation" said Jim Anderton.
