Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today that after an extended public consultation period, he is satisfied Glen Innes Intermediate School in Auckland should close.

The decision is preliminary at this stage. He has written to the Commissioner of the school, Ann Hunt, asking her to advise him in writing within 28 days if she has any arguments in favour of the school remaining open.

“On my behalf, the Ministry of Education has consulted since December with the Commissioner and staff of the school, with the boards of all other schools in the area, and with other groups who may have an interest in the future of the school,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I have considered all the information provided to me, and am satisfied that Glen Innes Intermediate School should close. Data presented to me by the ministry shows serious roll decline at the school to the point where its on-going viability must be in question. I cannot take any risk that the quality of education provided to the students could be compromised.”

The school will remain open until at least the end of term two this year. A final decision is expected to be announced early in May.

“I know it is not an easy task for communities to consider closing a school but it is important for me to take into account the longer term best interests of the young people in the area,” Trevor Mallard said.
