The New Organisms and Other Matters Bill, introduced in Parliament today, will amend laws governing genetic modification.

The changes, outlined by the Minister for the Environment in February, form part of the government's response to the report of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification.

The bill amends the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 (HSNO), the Medicines Act 1981, and the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act 1997.

The changes focus on providing a practical framework for proceeding with caution in the management of new organisms, including genetically modified organisms, while preserving opportunities.
