Sport and Recreation Minister Trevor Mallard today paid tribute to New Zealand’s greatest motorsport hero and icon Possum Bourne who died in Dunedin early today.

“It was with real sadness that I heard the news of Possum’s death and I am sure most kiwis will be equally sad,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Possum Bourne was a remarkable rally driver and top competitor, arguably the most successful in the southern hemisphere. Possum had a generous and warm personality and he was loved and respected by his competitors and rally fans alike.

“Possum’s career at the top of rally-driving in Australasia has been cemented over more than two decades behind the wheel. He has won a string of international rallies – in Australia, New Zealand and the Asia Pacific.

“As New Zealand’s only professional rally driver, Possum Bourne was a household name and there is no doubt he lifted the profile of the sport in this country and overseas.

“I extend my sympathies to his wife Peggy and their three children,” Trevor Mallard said.
