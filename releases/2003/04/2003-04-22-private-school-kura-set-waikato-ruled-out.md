Education Minister Trevor Mallard today ruled out any satellite arrangement between a private school and a kura kaupapa Maori – as had been proposed for two schools in the Waikato.

Arorangi School, near Tokoroa, and Te Kura Kaupapa Motuhake o Tawhiuau, in Murupara, had proposed an arrangement where the pupils from Arorangi School were being resourced as if they were on the kura’s roll.

“I did not and do not sanction this arrangement in any way. My advice to Arorangi School was to de-register, and I suggested they explore a satellite arrangement with mainstream schools in the local Tokoroa area. But that option did not have enough community support,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Arorangi then did a deal with the kura in Murupara, about 100 kilometres away. The kura entered the arrangement in good faith. Unfortunately there had also been conflicting advice and communications between the two schools and the Ministry of Education. I have expressed my regret to the principal of the kura for this.”

“I expect that the ministry and Arorangi will move now to discuss options available to Arorangi, but I must stress that under the Education Act, it is not possible for the kura and Arorangi to operate any form of satellite arrangement,” Trevor Mallard said.

Satellite arrangements are sometimes used to set up new kura. One condition is that Maori is the language of instruction.

“The kura in Murupara will begin term two next week without the Arorangi pupils who are presently recorded on their roll. I expect that the Arorangi board will make the decision as to whether it continues as a private school or whether its pupils return to the state school system,” Trevor Mallard said.
