Health Minister Annette King says a new nine-month course beginning today will help develop Pacific leaders in the health environment, and make an important contribution to better health for Pacific people in New Zealand.

Fourteen people will take part in this year's Ministry of Health Pacific Health Leadership Programme. It runs until December and follows a successful pilot held last year.

Ms King said the leadership programme would provide many benefits for the participants, Pacific health and Pacific communities.

\`\`Building Pacific leadership capacity in the health and disability sector offers significant potential to improve the health of Pacific peoples. It will be an intense and challenging year for the participants, but the experiences they gain will serve both them and Pacific communities well in the future.''

The leadership programme is delivered by the Emmerson Group, and is funded through the Ministry's Pacific Provider Development Fund. The total estimated cost of this year's programme is $320,000.
