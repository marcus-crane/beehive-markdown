The New Zealand Government is this week listing the following groups and individuals as terrorist entities pursuant to the provisions of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002:

·Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  
·Stichting Benevolence International Nederland  
·Lashkar I Jhangvi  
·Ansar Al-Islam  
·Special Purpose Islamic Regiment  
·Islamic International Brigade  
·Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs

These designations follow a decision by the United Nations Security Council to list these groups and individuals as terrorist entities. They take effect immediately for a period of three years, unless extended.

The decision to proceed with these designations was taken by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Attorney General, pursuant to the Terrorism Suppression Act.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is a self styled warlord who is currently allied to remnant Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Ansar Al-Islam is a terrorist group operating in north-eastern Iraq that closely follows Taliban customs and has declared jihad against secular and non-Islamic groups in the region.

Lashkar I Jhangvi means ‘army of Jang’ a region in Pakistan. The organisation was responsible for the January 2002 kidnapping and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl.

Stichting Benevolence International Nederland is a fundraising entity for organisations, including Al Qaeda, which are engaged in terrorist activity.

Special Purpose Islamic Regiment and Islamic International Brigade are Chechen terrorist organisations which have links to al-Qaeda. The Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs is made up of members of the previous organisations and carried out the attack against the Dubrovka Theatre in Moscow in 2002.

Helen Clark said none of the designated groups or individuals is known to have any current links to New Zealand.

"Nevertheless, designating these individuals and groups as terrorists and terrorist entities will serve to deter New Zealanders from becoming inadvertently involved in their activities," Helen Clark said.

"It will also make it an offence to participate in Stichting Benevolence International Nederland, Lashkar I Jhangvi, Ansar Al-Islam, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, the Islamic International Brigade and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen, recruit members to these groups, provide or collect funds for them or make property or financial services available to them.

"The financing of international terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the international community as a whole and one which New Zealand, as a member of that community, recognises the need to address effectively. These designations assist in that process," Helen Clark said.
