New Zealand’s labour market conditions are expected to remain fairly steady over the next two years, a report released this week by Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey is forecasting.

The Department of Labour report, the Labour Market Outlook – March 2003, which looks at New Zealand’s overall labour market conditions for the year to December 2002 and the outlook to March 2005, says that employment intentions and newspaper job ads have remained high, so solid job growth can be expected in the short term.

The report predicts some reversal of the sharp fall in unemployment the country experienced in the December 2002 quarter, the likely impact being an anticipated rise in unemployment levels above the current low rate of 4.9 percent, tipped for early 2003.

Nevertheless, higher job growth coupled with a fall in labour force growth during the year to March 2005 is expected to lower unemployment back to around 5 percent once again, according to the report.

The report cautions these forecasts should be read in light of important risk factors like current world economic conditions and assumes a quick and successful military conflict in Iraq, a robust recovery to the US and other major economies, as well as gradually declining migration inflows over the next two years.

Steve Maharey said the strength of the New Zealand economy had kept labour market conditions strong despite some fluctuation in employment growth between quarters.

“What is especially pleasing and is an indication that the government’s employment policies are working is that the overall rise in employment growth during the year to December 2002 reflects a concentration of increase in full-time work by 2.8 percent, or 40,000 full time workers.

“Evidence that the government’s strategy of encouraging New Zealanders into the workforce is a success is borne out by indicators contained in the report which showed the unemployment rate for the December 2002 quarter had fallen to 4.9 percent, the lowest rate in nearly 15 years.

“Over the past 18 months the unemployment rate had been fairly steady at around 5 percent, meaning that job growth had roughly matched growth in the labour force, with the number of unemployed totalling 98,000 in the December 2002 quarter, down from 105,000 a year before.

“The report predicts a strengthening in economic growth later in 2004 which is forecast to result in a rise in job growth towards 2.0 percent in the year to March 2005.

“Stronger job growth is expected because of a lift in economic growth, as the external sector enjoys the much-anticipated recovery in the world economy and as the domestic economy benefits from higher export incomes and a return of confidence. Economic and employment growth is thus likely to be more balanced across industries than over the past two years.

“The government is continuing to tackle head-on staff shortages, particularly shortages of skilled staff, which the report identified as being the main constraint to expansion for many businesses.

“While some level of skills shortage is a natural consequence of a dynamic, healthy economy, this government wants to make sure skill shortages don’t limit growth in the country’s productive capacity.

“The Skills Action Plan, designed to speed up the matching of people’s skills to the job opportunities currently available and reduce skill shortages by helping people to make better decisions about education and training, is directly addressing skill shortages.

“To provide seamless access to labour market information from a single website, the government had launched an electronic information portal, WorkSite, www.worksite.govt.nz, and a new on-line publication, workINSIGHT, providing an alternative way to access current and new labour market information”, Steve Maharey said.
