Associate Justice Minister Margaret Wilson today announced the appointment of Judge John Bollard of Auckland as the Principal Environment Judge.

Judge Bollard is the longest serving Environment Judge. He was appointed to the Planning Tribunal (as it then was) in 1988. Before his appointment he was a partner in the firm of Brandon Brookfield, practising extensively in local authority and administrative law.

Judge Bollard will replace Judge Joan Allin who has resigned from the role for personal reasons. Judge Allin will continue to sit as an alternate Environment Judge.
