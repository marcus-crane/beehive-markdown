Education Minister Trevor Mallard has today met with a delegation from Oaonui School, Taranaki about the proposed closure of the school.

“I held a frank discussion with the school delegation and will consider their views as I proceed to make my final decision on the Opunake schools review,” Trevor Mallard said.

Trevor Mallard announced his preliminary decision on the review of schooling in Opunake last month. It is proposed that the number of state schools be reduced from twelve to nine in the area, in order to create sustainable schooling and ensure quality of education for young people in the area.

The preliminary decision to combine Opunake Primary and Oaonui School was taken because of falling rolls in the Opunake area, which look set to continue to fall into the future. A number of small schools are also located in relatively close proximity to each other which are using more resources than a smaller number of larger schools would use.

“Smaller schools are also known to be more vulnerable in terms of the quality of education they can consistently deliver,” Trevor Mallard said.

A final decision, after another period of consultation, will be made in about a month.
