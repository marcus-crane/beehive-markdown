The government is to invest $28m in e-learning developments in the tertiary education sector, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The establishment of the E-Learning Collaborative Development Fund comes on top of $9.8m set aside in the 2002 budget to enable the tertiary education sector to develop e-learning capability and will be used to fund capital projects over the next four years. It follows the recommendations of the E-Learning Advisory Group’s which reported to government last year.

Speaking at an industry training organisations e-learning workshop, Steve Maharey said the government wants to ensure tertiary providers are able to take advantage of technology-assisted tools that enhance student learning.

“E-learning provides many challenges – we’re talking about more than computers. We’re talking about our students being equipped with the skills to participate in an innovative New Zealand.

“The capital funding announced today will ensure that tertiary providers can adopt e-learning tools as part of the range of teaching resources they have available. Computer and web-based learning is not an end in itself, but is is an increasing powerful learning tool.

“Industry training organisations are amongst a group of tertiary organisations that are already showing how e-learning can be used. Examples include:  
·the Plumbing ITO’s development of a training package on core skills in the construction industry, including safe working practices and tool use; and  
·an e-learning training programme for workplace tutors supporting trainees in the seafood industry developed by the Seafood ITO.

“The E-Learning Collaborative Development Fund will support a wide take-up of technology-based learning tools across the whole post-school education system,” Steve Maharey said.
