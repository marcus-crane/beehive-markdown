“Why has ACT declared war on New Zealand business?” asks Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“It’s extraordinary that today the ACT party attacked one of New Zealand’s leading fashion apparel and organic textile companies, Snowy Peak which is owned and run by Peri Drysdale. At the same time they also attacked one of our most successful and experienced private sector chief executives, Craig Boyce.

“Last week it was the Warehouse, 12 of their suppliers and an unsuspecting gaming machine distributor who is trying to develop world class monitoring software.

“Next week I expect ACT’s future leaders Deborah Coddington and Rodney Hide to launch assaults on other innovative New Zealand businesses as they try and take us all back to the 80s and 90s economic decline that their policies led us into.

“It’s not all bad news though; Industry New Zealand has reported that thanks to Rodney Hide’s attack the gaming machine company and has had an export enquiry from overseas for their software,” said Jim Anderton.
