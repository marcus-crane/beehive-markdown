We know that early childhood education makes a significant and critical difference to the way children develop and go on to learn throughout their lives.

Improving participation in early childhood education is one of the highest priorities of our Government – as a country we need to lift our game in this area, so every young kiwi, regardless of their background, can go on to lead a successful and fulfilled life, contributing positively to New Zealand’s economic development.

Equity funding is one initiative the Government is using to help ensure that children from all backgrounds can enjoy the benefits of quality pre-school learning.

I recently launched “Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki” - the first ten-year strategic plan for early childhood education.

The plan sets out a road map for the future of early childhood education in New Zealand and includes specific initiatives to increase participation.

About 60 percent of all children under five currently participate in some form of early childhood education but Maori and Pacific families are significantly under-represented in this area, compared to Pakeha families.

Nearly all Pakeha four-year-olds take part in some form of early childhood education, but only 65 percent of Maori and 78 percent of Pacific four-year-olds are in early childhood education.

There are significant barriers that stop children from accessing early childhood education in particular communities.

If these barriers are not broken down early on, then children will have a tough time getting a decent education, decent qualifications, and a decent job later in life.

More often than not, the under-fives who aren’t getting any education before they get to school, are from families that are less well-off. They come from a low socio-economic background which means they have less spare money and resources to help with fund-raising or paying fees.

Children with special needs such as learning or behavioural difficulties, or children with English language difficulties also face more hurdles in accessing early childhood education.

Extra help is also needed by early childhood education services in isolated areas. They face greater costs in running quality programmes and generating enough funding because of their small size and irregular child attendance.

To tackle the problems being experienced in these communities, our Government in 2001 announced the equity funding system for non-profit community-based services.

The $8 million annual equity funding pool is specifically targeted to services in low socio-economic communities, isolated areas, services with high numbers of children with special needs children or children from non-English speaking backgrounds, and services which provide programmes in a non-english language and culture.

This year is a transition year and from this month 1334 services will receive the funding, as the Government fully implements the policy using the latest census data.

Early indications show that services that have received the funding over the last year have used it in successful, innovative ways.

It’s up to the services to decide how they use the money to meet their individual needs. It could be spent on helping parents with transport costs, or on improving staff: child ratios. The funding could pay volunteer helpers’ expenses, and it might also be spent on extra teaching resources, or professional development for staff, as well as for education for families or whanau.

We are also establishing six centres of innovation next year to undertake research and develop innovative practice for early childhood education. Better information for parents about available early childhood education services is being produced.

But one of the biggest changes goes to the heart of making sure that early childhood education is quality education. All regulated teachers will be required to be registered with the Diploma of Teaching (early childhood education) or higher by 2012.
