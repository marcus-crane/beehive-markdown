A new national Mäori health strategy builds on the strengths of whänau, hapu, iwi and Mäori, Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson and Te Tai Tonga MP Mahara Okeroa said today.

Ms Dyson and Mr Okeroa were at Ngä Hau E Whä Marae in Christchurch today for the regional launch of He Korowai Oranga, the national Mäori health strategy, and Whakatätaka, a plan of how to make it work.

He Korowai Oranga sets the direction for Mäori health development in the health and disability sector for the next five to 10 years.

“The strategy recognises and builds on the considerable strengths and assets of hapü, iwi and Mäori,” Ms Dyson said.

“At its heart lies the concept of ‘whänau ora’ – Maori families being supported to achieve maximum health and well-being, not just for individuals but for communities as well.”

Ruth Dyson said whänau ora would be achieved by organising services around the needs of whänau, hapu, iwi and Mäori communities; increasing Mäori participation throughout the health and disability sector; developing effective health and disability services that recognise Maori models of health and healing; and working cooperatively across sectors.

She said He Korowai Oranga and its accompanying action plan showed the government is serious about its commitments under the Treaty of Waitangi, and about reducing inequalities between Mäori and non-Mäori.

Mr Okeroa said that South Island District Health Boards have already begun developing relationships with iwi and Mäori communities.

“Local runaka have been involved in informal relationships with DHBs and we expect to see these formalised within the next year. These relationships  
will help DHBs ensure that planning, funding and delivery of services contribute to whänau ora and improve the quality of life for Mäori.''  
“Whänau ora is not a new concept for Mäori providers, and we don't have to look far to see a range of innovative services. Christchurch-based Mäori Development Organisation He Oranga Pounamu has more than 20 affiliated health and  
disability service providers in the South Island.

“The organisation is working hard to improve choice, access and service quality for Mäori living in the Ngäi Tahu area, and is helping to build the capacity and capability of Mäori health and disability service providers.''

Ruth Dyson said extensive consultation during the development of He Korowai had indicated a high level of interest not only in the strategy, but in how it would work in practice.

“That's why Whakatätaka is so important -- it looks at goals and performance measures and sets out some of the practical steps the Ministry of Health, District Health Boards and the wider sector will take when working to turn the strategy goals into reality. The plan will be regularly updated as milestones are achieved.”

Today's launch in Christchurch is the last of three regional launches around the country. Health Ministers Annette King and Tariana Turia released He  
Korowai Oranga and Whakatätaka on 13 November in Wellington. The other two regional launches were in Rotorua (November 15) and Manukau City (November  
22).

He Korowai Oranga and Whakatätaka can be viewed on the Ministry of Health website at www.moh.govt.nz or at www.maorihealth.govt.nz.

Questions and Answers about He Korowai Oranga

What is He Korowai Oranga?  
It is the Mäori health strategy, which sets a new direction for Mäori health development over the next 10 years, building on the gains made in the past decade.

The strategy sets out to address unacceptable health inequalities between Mäori and non-Mäori, and the Government's commitment to Mäori under the Treaty of Waitangi, as reflected in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act.

Mäori life-expectancy is eight years less on average than that of non-Maori, while hospitalisation rates for all causes are nearly double for Mäori than non-Mäori.

What does He Korowai Oranga mean?  
Literally translated, it means \`\`the cloak of wellness''. The Mäori health strategy symbolises the protective cloak and mana of the people ? the cloak that  
embraces, develops and nurtures the people physically and spiritually.

Where does He Korowai Oranga fit with strategies already in place?  
The New Zealand Health Strategy 2000 and the New Zealand Disability Strategy 2000 are the Government's platform for action on health and disability, including Mäori health. He Korowai Oranga adds to the principles and objectives for Mäori in both strategies and takes them to the next stage by providing more detail on how Mäori health goals will be achieved.

What is the overall aim of He Korowai Oranga?  
It focuses on whänau ora: Mäori families supported to achieve their maximum health and wellbeing.

Why is whänau ora so important?  
Whänau is recognised as the foundation of Mäori society. As a principal source of strength, support, security and identity, whänau plays a central role in the wellbeing of Mäori individually and collectively.

What is Whakatätaka?  
It is the Mäori health action plan. It describes what needs to be done in the next two to three years to achieve the aims of He Korowai Oranga.

What does Whakatätaka mean?  
It is the weaving of strands to create a pattern that eventually forms a taonga  
such as a korowai (cloak).

Why is there a separate action plan?  
He Korowai Oranga sets a long-term direction. Most actions to implement the strategy, however, are short-term, but will contribute to the long-term aims. Separating the two allows the action plan to be regularly updated to build on achievements.

How will the Government fund the strategy?  
He Korowai Oranga will be resourced from the three-year health funding package set for the health and disability sector from 2002 to 2005. The funding path takes into account changes in population, costs and technology, as well as new policy initiatives such as the Primary Health Care Strategy.

The Government has committed $50 million, $165 million, and $195 million in 2002/03, 2003/04 and 2004/05 respectively to implement the Primary Health Care Strategy. A key objective is to improve access to and effectiveness of primary care services for Mäori.

What about the Mäori Provider Development Scheme?  
The Mäori Provider Development Scheme will continue to be available to help Mäori workforce and provider development. The scheme has been used to support Mäori providers to develop the infrastructure and management capacity they need to be effective, sustainable providers and to support clinical and community-based workforce development. The Government will review the level of funding -- currently $10 million per year (GST inclusive) – and criteria for the scheme to ensure they are consistent with the objectives of He Korowai Oranga.

How many Mäori health and disability providers are there around New Zealand?  
There are more than 200 providing health and disability services around the country.

When will Whakatätaka begin to implement He Korowai Oranga objectives?  
This work has already started. Whakatätaka clearly states timeframes for each action point.

Who is responsible for monitoring He Korowai Oranga?  
The Ministry of Health has the lead responsibility for monitoring progress on the strategy. The National Health Committee will also provide an overview and analysis of the implementation.
