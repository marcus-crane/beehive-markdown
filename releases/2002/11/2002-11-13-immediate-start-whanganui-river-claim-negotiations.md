The Crown and Whanganui iwi will begin formal negotiations immediately over the iwi’s long-standing historical claim in respect of the Whanganui River, Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“We confirmed the mandate of the Te Awa Tupua Negotiation Committee at the weekend and have now resolved issues around progressing the settlement negotiations,” she said.

“This means negotiations can begin immediately.”

The Crown would meet with the mandated representatives straight away to agree the Terms of Negotiations and also to start the substantive negotiations on a settlement package including the Crown acknowledgements and apology, and financial and cultural redress in respect of the river.

A key issue for the negotiations would be the use and management of the Whanganui River, Margaret Wilson said.

“I understand Genesis and Whanganui iwi have had constructive talks and I am confident we can now all work together for the well-being of the river.”
