Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that 17 programmes in schools, national and regional organisations will be funded to ensure New Zealand’s gifted and talented students have the opportunity to reach their full potential as New Zealand’s future leaders.

“Our Government is intent on building the knowledge economy, and laying the foundations for this country’s economic transformation. Helping our talented and gifted children achieve their potential as this country’s future leaders is a critical element of this,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Many of these children are at the crossroads of their development and learning. The programmes I’m announcing today will help them on the right path forward. The learning of all our children needs to be well supported if New Zealand wants to flourish economically, culturally and socially.”

The Government has made $1.2 million dollars available for education programmes targeted at gifted and talented students. National when it was in power did not specifically fund this area of education.

Trevor Mallard announced the details of the programmes at Hamilton Boys High School today. The school is to set up a “virtual online classroom” which will be available to rural students who currently are not catered for. The rural students will have the opportunity to learn with Hamilton Boys High School gifted and talented students who are already in special programmes.

“It’s important to remember that gifted and talented learners have needs that are significantly different from those of other children.

“They require different learning opportunities and may need special emotional and social support to realise their potential.

“The programmes being made available for gifted and talented students are diverse but they all provide opportunities for these learners to interact with others with similar abilities,” Trevor Mallard said.
