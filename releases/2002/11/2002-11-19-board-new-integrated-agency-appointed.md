One of the board¡¦s first tasks will be the appointment of a chief executive designate.

Jim Anderton said the formation of the new organisation, expected to be up and running by the middle of next year, was a response to calls from business and other stakeholders for a single economic and trade development agency.

BACKGROUNDER: INTEGRATION OF TRADE NEW ZEALAND AND INDUSTRY NEW ZEALAND

INTRODUCTION

In September 2002, Cabinet decided in principle to integrate the services currently provided by Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand and to create a new organisation to deliver those services.

The Government, having now considered proposals regarding the integration of Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand services, has agreed to proceed to integrate the two organisations and establish a new organisation to support the development of internationally competitive business.

The new organisation is to be established by 1 July 2003. A Ministerial team comprising the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Economic Development, the Minister for Trade Negotiations and Minister for Research, Science and Technology will oversee the transition process. An establishment Board, which will also be formally appointed as the Board of Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand, will have primary responsibility for managing the transition.

RATIONALE

The main aim of the integration process is to improve service delivery to enterprise, while enabling government to maximise its contribution to the development of internationally competitive business in New Zealand. In particular, integration of Trade NZ and Industry NZ will  
„hMake service delivery less fragmented and confusing for firms, especially through the development of a single customer interface  
„hClarify the linkages between economic development programmes, allowing the elimination of overlaps and the plugging of gaps  
„hIncrease alignment of government interventions, and thereby facilitate the development of a clearer and more focused economic development strategy.

ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIC DIRECTION

The objective of the new organisation is to support the development of internationally competitive New Zealand business.

The new organisation will  
„hContribute to increased exports and investment in New Zealand by strengthening global linkages through trade and investment promotion, and targeted business and international market development assistance;  
„hEnhance industry, regional, enterprise and entrepreneurial capabilities by providing information and facilitating access to skills, expertise and resources; and  
„hContribute to a supportive environment for economic growth by:  
ƒ{Fostering collaborative networks and partnerships among central government, local government, industry, regional, education and research organisations, potential investors, and individual enterprises;  
ƒ{Encouraging the development and delivery of economic development services by the private and non-government sector; and  
ƒ{Co-ordinating the delivery of government economic development assistance to industry, regions and individual businesses.

SERVICE RANGE AND CLIENT SEGMENTATION

The integrated service range, proposed by Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand, will consist of three broad groups of services:

1.Enabling Services ¡V these service will require the new organisation to work in partnership with key stakeholders (e.g. priority sectors, regions, collectives, clusters and other government agencies) to identify systemic opportunities for economic growth, and to facilitate the removal of constraints to growth

2.Growth Services ¡V these services will be targeted at businesses (and groups of businesses) with significant growth potential. These services will include both capability development services and international consultancy services. Growth services are aimed at accelerating business development and enhancing the contribution of business to New Zealand¡¦s economic growth.

3.Foundation Services ¡V these services will support general capability building among entrepreneurs and businesses, particularly small firms and start-ups, through the provision of generic business information, advice and training.

Development of the Service Range: The new organisation will integrate existing services and improve service delivery in the short-term. However, there will be some opportunities for some changes to, and consolidation of, existing services prior to integration.

Looking toward the medium-term, there will be greater scope to make changes to the service range. These future decisions should be based on analysis of which services deliver, or are likely to deliver, the greatest net benefits to New Zealand.

RESOURCE ALLOCATION

Based on existing services, Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand estimate that the combined budgets of approximately $160 million are currently divided across the three broad service areas as follows: enabling services (35-40%); foundation services (10-15%); and growth services (45-50%).
