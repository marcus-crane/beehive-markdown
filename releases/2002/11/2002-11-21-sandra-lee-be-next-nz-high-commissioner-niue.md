New Zealand’s next High Commissioner to Niue will be the Hon. Sandra Lee, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

“The appointment of an experienced former Minister to this position is an indication of the importance New Zealand attaches to its special relationship with Niue.

“As High Commissioner, Sandra Lee will play a key role in ensuring good communication and cooperation as we seek to work with Niue to support the shared goal of the two countries of maintaining Niue's viability as a living community. She brings to this task extensive experience in central and local government as well as in a wide range of community activities.

“Sandra Lee has a longstanding interest in the Pacific and in Pacific Island communities in New Zealand. In recent years, she has participated actively in the work of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP).

“Her political experience and close relationship with the Niuean community make Sandra particularly suited for the role of High Commissioner. She is well placed to work along side the Niuean Government as it addresses the challenges stemming from its small size and population, limited resources and isolation,” Mr Goff said.

Of Poutini Ngai Tahu Waitaha, Ngati Kahungunu and Ngati Toa Rangatira tribal affiliation, Ms Lee was Minister of Conservation and Local Government and Associate Minister of Maori Affairs from 1999 to July 2002. Before entering Parliament in 1993 as MP for Auckland Central, she served on the Auckland City and Waiheke County Councils.

Ms Lee takes up her position in February 2003. She replaces John Bryan, who is returning to Wellington after completing his posting.
