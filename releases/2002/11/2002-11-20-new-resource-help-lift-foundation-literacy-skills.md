A new publication highlights the benefits of teaching foundation literacy in a context that is meaningful to the learner.

Worx 4 Me, published by Skill New Zealand and released today by Associate Education Minister Marian Hobbs, has been developed for providers of vocational education and training. It advocates and shares good practices for literacy development, bringing together findings from recent reviews and evaluations of literacy provision plus information from specialists.

Marian Hobbs said the resource was an excellent tool to help providers equip learners with the vital skills required to participate fully in the workplace and society.

"Learning to be literate in today’s world is an essential part of economic and social well being, both for the individual and for our country," Marian Hobbs said. "Individuals need a range of literacy skills just to manage the everyday demands of working and raising families.

“Worx 4 Me is successful because it is practical, aimed at sharing information and helping tutors find the best ways to assist learners develop their literacy skills in a way that is meaningful to them and their needs. Using workplace-specific language to help deliver the literacy skills can make a big difference to the comfort levels and understanding of the learners involved.

“Raising literacy levels in learners is easier when the training provider’s entire organisation, not just the tutor, is aware of its importance and supports its delivery.

"I commend Skill New Zealand and all the training providers who have contributed to Worx 4 Me.

“Such resources are invaluable to building a knowledge based society. Raising the foundation skills of New Zealanders is a priority in the government’s Tertiary Education Strategy released in May."
