Defence Minister, Hon Mark Burton, announced today the names of the six organisations short-listed for the supply of vessels for the Royal New Zealand Navy under Project Protector. The project includes the Multi-Role Vessel, and Offshore and Inshore Patrol Vessels.

“We are very pleased with the response from the world’s shipbuilding industry to our Invitation-to-Register Interest”, Mark Burton said. “The challenge for the project acquisition team was to select a shortlist for the next phase in the project which is for the short listed companies to be invited to respond to a Request for Proposals. The number of high quality expressions of interest is most satisfactory and those companies short listed are highly credible with extensive experience in ship building”.

The organisations to be invited to respond to the Request for Proposals are BAE Systems of the UK, Blohm and Voss of Germany, DSA of Australia/Netherlands, Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd of Singapore, Tenix Defence PTY Australia, and Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd of the UK.

The next stage entails the completion of the Vessel Performance and Integrated Logistics Specifications following extensive consultation with all client agencies that will task the vessels through the Maritime Coordination Centre. Client agencies include government departments such as the Ministry of Fisheries, Police and Customs as well as civil maritime organisations such as the Coast Guard service.

It is expected that the Request for Proposals will be issued early next year.

In announcing the short-list, Mark Burton said, “the Government is committed to delivering on its promise of a practical Naval fleet matched to New Zealand’s wider security needs. Project Protector will deliver this capability.

“I encourage New Zealand industry to further build contacts with the organisations short listed to ensure that they are fully aware of the world class quality skills, equipment and services that New Zealand companies are able to provide for the construction and through life phases of this project, on a cost competitive basis”.

The Ministry of Defence supported by Industry NZ and the Industrial Supplies Office will also work together to ensure the short-listed companies have a thorough understanding of New Zealand industries capabilities.
