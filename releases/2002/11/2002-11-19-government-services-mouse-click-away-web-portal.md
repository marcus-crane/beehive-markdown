With the new government web portal, finding government services and information has just become a lot easier.

Even though the address is easy to remember – www.govt.nz - I’ve already bookmarked it at home. Having the portal means you don’t have to go hunting for the information you need on dozens of government websites. It’s all there in the one place.

The portal helps you quickly find the information or services you’re looking for, and takes you straight to the right place. You’ll be surprised how many government services are already available on the Internet, and there will be a lot more before too long.

More than 3,500 government services and resources are available, ranging from what you need to know if you’ve having a child or renting a house, to information about study, work or recreation in New Zealand.

If you don’t want to do everything online, the portal tells you how to get in touch with government departments in person or over the phone.

It’s all just a mouse-click away. The portal gives you information at your fingertips – wherever you are, any time of day or night. More and more people expect that these days.

There is a whole new generation of Internet-savvy New Zealanders who look to the web for virtually everything. A lot of the older generation are seeing the benefits too. It’s much easier being at home or at the library using a computer than travelling to our main centres just to join a queue. If you’re in a rural area doing business with government online, when it is convenient for you, is a real attraction.

If you have limited mobility for whatever reason, online government will make your life just a little easier. The portal may be the only place you have to go to find what you need. There is a wealth of central and local government information that you can download or view online – everything from brochures about ways to prevent accidents on farms to forms that you need to fill in to get a passport.

The beauty of the new government web portal is that it explains just enough to get you started. It describes the services in a way that is easy to understand without burying you in the detail. You can see what each agency provides in the area you’re interested in. The site is also simply designed so you don’t need a super-fast computer to get to the information you want.

The portal also makes it a lot easier to see the many ways you can get involved in the way country is run. That’s everything from contacting your MP to getting a copy of your local council’s annual plan. In a small country like New Zealand, pooling our collective wisdom to make the best of what we have is vitally important.

New Zealanders have taken to the Internet enthusiastically. We’re already making use of the power of the Internet up and down the country in schools and colleges, libraries, marae, the workplace, cyber cafes and at home.

The 2001 Census found 37 percent of New Zealand households have Internet access. A recent survey found 70 percent of those surveyed had used the Internet in the last month – that’s more than any of the other 31 countries surveyed.

The portal is just one way the Government is helping New Zealand get on the front foot in the information revolution.
