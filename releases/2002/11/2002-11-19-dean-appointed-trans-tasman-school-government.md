State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the announcement of the appointment of Professor Allan Fels as foundation dean of the new Australia and New Zealand School of Government.

ANZSOG is being established as an international, multi-campus, professional school which aims to equip its students for effective careers in government. The school will offer, in partnership with other universities, a Masters Degree in Public Administration and specialised programmes for emerging public sector leaders.

“The school will provide new opportunities for international and cross-jurisdictional research and learning, and will assist in developing closer relationships between governments, public servants and academics in New Zealand and Australia,’’ Trevor Mallard said.

“This school, which will help develop future public service leaders, is also an important part of our Government’s desire to rebuild and strengthen the public sector,” he said.

The school is being established as a partnership between the New Zealand and Australian governments, universities and business schools. Its New Zealand campus is Wellington’s University of Victoria, while programmes in Australia will be delivered in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Sydney.

The first intake of students is expected to be in May next year.

Trevor Mallard said Professor Fels was an experienced public servant and noted academic. Previously he has served as chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, chairman of the former Trade Practices Commission, and chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority. He has also been director of the Graduate School of Management at Monash University.
