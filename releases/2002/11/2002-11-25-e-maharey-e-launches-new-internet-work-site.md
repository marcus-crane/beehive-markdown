In today’s fiercely competitive world gaining attention for your product isn’t always easy.

But Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey reckons he’s found the answer to grab audience attention when launching a new government internet site on work - get your alter “e”-go to “e”-launch it for you.

While the real Steve Maharey and invited guests looked on from a room at the Wellington Public Library today, ‘Steve Maharey’, an animated cartoon character e-launched the government’s newest internet information gateway about work - WorkSITE - to on-line guests around the country. Because of its smaller file size the animated format allows a greater number of users to ‘attend’ the launch than video streaming would.

“It’s impossible to expect everyone to attend a Wellington launch event, especially if you live in the deep South, for example, and for that matter to grab people’s attention on the diversity of the labour market. Allowing guests to ‘attend’ the launch by logging onto a special launch site and the opportunity to have some fun along the way will hopefully draw attention to what WorkSITE offers,” Steve Maharey said.

Steve Maharey said a key focus of the government’s July Budget were improvements to peoples’ ability to access information on work held by a number of different agencies.

“WorkSITE,) (www.worksite.govt.nz) covers virtually everything there is to know about working in New Zealand. Whether you’re considering a career, actively looking for a job, wanting to change vocations, or start your own business, WorkSITE offers comprehensive information on-line.

While New Zealand is experiencing sustained economic growth and strong growth in jobs – with unemployment levels this year their lowest in 14 years – some firms are finding it difficult to find staff.

“Some level of skills shortage is a natural consequence of a dynamic, healthy economy but the government wants to make sure skill shortages don’t reduce the country’s productive capacity, that’s why we’re launching initiatives like WorkSITE.

“WorkSITE will help speed up the matching of people’s skills to the job opportunities that are currently available and reduce skill shortages in the future by helping people make better decisions about education and training.

“Phase one of WorkSITE will include information on education and training, career and work planning, finding work, finding staff, working for yourself, employment relations, workplace health and safety, research and moving to New Zealand.

“Phase two, operational from next year, will be more customized, adding private sector as well as other Government information, including volunteering, community businesses, ACC, childcare, taxation, income support and the transition to retirement,” Steve Maharey said.
