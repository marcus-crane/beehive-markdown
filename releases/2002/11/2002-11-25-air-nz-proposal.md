“As a Minister in the government and as the leader of the Progressives, I will be giving careful consideration to the Air New Zealand and Qantas proposal in terms of the details we have and how it meets national interest criteria,” Jim Anderton said today.

“These considerations include effective New Zealand control, our ability to exercise New Zealand’s existing and future air rights, and preservation of the unique New Zealand identity of Air New Zealand.

“Other issues include:  
·provision of effective development for international tourism;  
·our domestic air services network; and  
·the preservation of New Zealand based employment.

“Between now and 18 December, when the Government has undertaken to respond to the proposal, I will be part of the careful considerations Cabinet will give to all of these matters.

“In the meantime legal advice clearly requires that all ministers avoid publicly commenting on the detail of the proposal or what we think of it,” said Jim Anderton.
