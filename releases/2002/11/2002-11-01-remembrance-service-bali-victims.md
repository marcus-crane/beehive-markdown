Prime Minister Helen Clark said today a service of remembrance will be held next week for the victims of the Bali bombings. The service of remembrance will be held at Wellington’s Cathedral of St Paul, Hill St next Wednesday (November 6) at 12.15pm.

Arrangements are being made for families of the victims who are able to attend. It is expected that the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and MPs, the High Commissioners of Australia and Britain, and the Charge d’Affairs of Indonesia will take part in the service, along with children from Wellington schools. Members of the public are invited to attend.

“The bombing in Bali shocked our nation and the world. It was a callous act of terror against innocent people and against humanity.

“The service will remember the New Zealanders who lost their lives, as well as those of all nations who were killed, and those who were injured or are still missing.

“It will give New Zealanders an opportunity to show solidarity with the families who lost a husband or wife, son or a daughter, grandchildren, other relatives, or friends, and all those who have been injured and traumatised by this event,” Helen Clark said.
