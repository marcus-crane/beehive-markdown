“Winston Peters’ latest claims in his continued attacks on the New Zealand Immigration Service and its general manager, are yet again unfounded, deplorable and utterly distasteful,” Lianne Dalziel said today.

“Mr Peters’ relentless campaign against the NZIS general manager Chris Hampton, is a tacky personal attack on Mr Hampton’s integrity.”

Responding to Mr Peters’ claims of corruption within the Immigration Service, Lianne Dalziel suggested Mr Peters breathe in slowly for a change, rather than kicking up a stink over nothing.

“Mr Peters today tabled a document in Parliament, saying it was proof of ‘the contract involvement of (BizA2Z) with her department’ when it was no such thing. It was a reference to Enterprise Awards funding which has nothing to do with the Department of Labour or the NZIS.

“The NZ First leader’s vindictive and unsubstantiated attack on the NZIS is part of his desperate campaign against the Chris Hampton, who has been totally up front about his involvement in BizA2Z from the outset. I tabled the full report I received when an Act MP asked questions last year.

“The key points are:

·There was full disclosure by NZIS staff

·The business had no contracts with NZIS

·The NZIS staff members no longer have an interest in BizA2Z.

“I have tabled this document because I have nothing to hide, and I am appalled at Mr Peters’ relentless attacks on Mr Hampton’s reputation.

“Mr Hampton is due to retire before the end of the year, having given almost 40 years service to the Department of Labour, 10 of which were with the NZIS, and I have full confidence in him.

“Mr Peters ought to apologise to Mr Hampton and to the New Zealand Parliament for misleading the House on these matters,” said Lianne Dalziel.
