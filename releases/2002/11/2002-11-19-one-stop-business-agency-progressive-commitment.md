Another Progressive Cornerstone election commitment was achieved today with the formation of one agency to assist business development.

“The Progressive Coalition promised the creation of the one-stop-shop for industry assistance during the election campaign, and this has been achieved with the merger of Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand,” said Economic Development Minister, and Progressive Coalition leader Jim Anderton.

Cabinet has approved a board for the new organisation which will be operating from mid 2003.

“This agency will work with businesses, industries and regions to make the most of favourable economic conditions, and the positive business environment created by this Labour Progressive Government,” said Jim Anderton.
