Cashmere High School has been given the go-ahead to begin building a specialist facility for students with very high physical disability support needs, Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel is announcing today.  
Lianne Dalziel is making the formal announcement at a meeting with Conductive Education Families who were celebrating 10 years in Christchurch tomorrow.  
“This will be an innovative and forward-thinking specialist resource centre for high school teenagers with physical disabilities,” Lianne Dalziel said. “Many of the students will come from Addington Primary School’s Conductive Education programme, and their parents have long wanted this secondary option.”  
The new facility will be in the hub of the school on a prime site. It will join to a block of 15 other classrooms, ensuring students will be fully integrated into the fabric of the school. It has been jointly designed to specifications from Cashmere High School, the Ministry of Education, and the families of children with special needs.  
“There is overwhelming support from families for the new facility. The building plans are fantastic and visionary. The facility has been designed with an eye to the future, is multi-purpose and ensures access to technology,” Lianne Dalziel said.  
“The students will add a richness to the Cashmere community just as the new opportunities they experience will enrich their lives.”  
During 2002, Cashmere High School has set up a new programme for students from Addington in temporary buildings. This put considerable pressure on all concerned. The new facility sees a welcome end to that arrangement.  
“While the physical building will be a tremendous resource, the enduring achievements lie in the partnerships that have been forged between students, families, schools and the Ministry. The partnerships will carry these young people through their time at school and on into the wider community”.
