State Services Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that GoProcure, the whole-of-government e-procurement system, will go live in early 2003, at an estimated annual cost saving to government agencies of at least $6.5 million.

Government departments, and many Crown entities, will use GoProcure to buy goods and services from on-line catalogues with orders being automatically sent to suppliers.

Trevor Mallard says GoProcure will mean suppliers will find it easier and cheaper to deal with government.

“Only one catalogue needs to be maintained, and only one interface established, to sell electronically to all government agencies. That compares to the alternative approach of suppliers building links to many government agencies individually. This will reduce costs for many small and medium-sized businesses.

“Benefits to government agencies will come from automating their procurement processes, and from using GoProcure information to collaborate with other agencies for purchasing. GoProcure will be funded by annual subscriptions paid by departments and many Crown entities,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The State Services Commission’s E-government Unit estimates benefits of at least $6.5 million per annum to government agencies as a result of GoProcure. The annual spend likely through the e-procurement system is about $250 million.”

The GoProcure first phase will run through to October 2003 and is likely to involve five departments and Crown entities. From November 2003 GoProcure will be progressively rolled out to all other departments and large Crown entities.

“GoProcure is a good example of government agencies working collaboratively to achieve whole-of-government efficiency benefits, which will make it easier for business to deal with government,” Trevor Mallard said.

The adoption of e-commerce by Government will encourage New Zealand businesses to go “on-line”, and thus compete for other e-commerce business opportunities in New Zealand and overseas, Trevor Mallard said.
