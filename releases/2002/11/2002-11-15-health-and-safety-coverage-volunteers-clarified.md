Acting Labour Minister Trevor Mallard said today that current proposals on the coverage of volunteers under the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Bill have been clarified.

Trevor Mallard said changes would now be made, which would specifically exclude the following people from prosecution under the bill:

- Volunteers involved in any charitable fundraising activity (including working bees) including for schools, sports clubs and hobby clubs;
- Volunteer sports coaches for schools and sports clubs;
- Parents or any other volunteers supervising school activities outside school grounds (including the transporting of children to and from activities/events).

“However, the bill will now include a duty of care for those people, which the Department of Labour will take an active role in encouraging. But no prosecutions will be involved,’’ Trevor Mallard said.
