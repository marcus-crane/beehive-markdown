2noted that agreement has been reached with Air New Zealand for the government to make an in principle decision on the ownership case, and a conditional decision from the Kiwi Shareholder, within five weeks of the proposal being publicly announced;  
3noted that a favourable Kiwi Shareholder decision will mean Qantas will be advised that approval has been given for the entire shareholding sought by Qantas, subject to:  
3.1there being no material changes to the commercial proposal, or significant new information being revealed, during the subsequent competition and other regulatory processes;  
3.2approval of the transaction by Air New Zealand shareholders, with respect to any portion of shares requiring shareholder approval;

5authorised the Cabinet Policy Committee on 20 November 2002 to have Power to Act in considering the national interest criteria that should be applied as part of the Kiwi Shareholder’s evaluation of the proposal;  
6noted that the intention of the Kiwi Shareholder evaluation will be to reveal all relevant information on the national interest criteria selected by Ministers, and allow the Kiwi Shareholder to make an informed qualitative judgement based on this information;  
7noted that a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of other possible criteria, such as the effect of a commercial alliance on inbound and outbound passenger flows, is more appropriately undertaken through the Commerce Commission’s process than the Kiwi Shareholder evaluation;  
8noted that the Minister of Finance, Associate Minister of Finance (Hon Trevor Mallard) and Minister of Transport will consider further whether it is necessary to maintain the formal separation of regulatory and ownership advice submitted to Cabinet, or whether it would be preferable to synthesise both perspectives into a single piece of advice for Cabinet;  
9noted that Ministers are likely to have access to commercially sensitive information that could influence market participants;  
10invited the Minister of Finance, the Associate Minister of Finance (Hon Trevor Mallard), the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Tourism to form a subgroup of Ministers to develop a communications strategy;
