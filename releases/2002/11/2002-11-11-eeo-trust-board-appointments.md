Labour Minister Margaret Wilson and Women’s Affairs Minister Ruth Dyson today announced two Public Sector appointments to the Board of the Equal Employment Opportunities Trust.

Belinda Clark, Secretary for Justice, and Jo Brosnahan, Auckland Regional Council Chief Executive Officer, have both been appointed to three-year terms.

Belinda Clark has held her Justice role for the past 18 months and her other key management positions include General Manager for ACC and Director of the Office of Treaty Settlements.

“This considerable public sector experience and the fact she has represented New Zealand as a delegate to UN meetings on women and human rights will be a real asset to the Trust,” said the Ministers.

Jo Brosnahan has been CEO of Auckland Regional Council since 1996. Before this, she was CEO of the Northland Regional Council. She has considerable experience in the local government and transport sectors, and spent a year at Duke University, North Carolina as a Harkness Fellow researching leaders of excellence.

“Jo Brosnahan will bring a broad regional perspective, business skills and a wealth of leadership experience to the Trust,” the Ministers said.

The EEO Trust is a charitable trust established jointly by the Government and private sector employers. Its aim is the voluntary promotion of equal employment opportunities to employers as good business practice. The functions of the Trust include the promotion of the benefits of EEO practices, developing EEO resource material, and liasing with employer and union networks and tertiary institutions to promote the Trust’s resources and services.

The EEO Trust Board is made up of nine trustees – five Private Sector Trustees and four Public Sector Trustees
