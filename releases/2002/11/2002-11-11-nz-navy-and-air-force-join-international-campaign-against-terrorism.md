Prime Minister Helen Clark and Defence Minister Mark Burton announced today that a New Zealand frigate and a P3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft would be deployed to international operations campaign against the Taleban and Al-Qaeda as part of the ongoing Operation Enduring Freedom.

Helen Clark and Mark Burton said that in October 2001 Parliament had supported New Zealand’s offer of assistance, including special forces, as part of the response of the United States and the international community to the 11 September terrorist attacks.

“Cabinet has today approved the deployment of a New Zealand frigate to the Operation Enduring Freedom Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO), from now until June 2003.

“HMNZS Te Kaha, currently off West Australia, will be deployed immediately to join the Canadian-led Coalition Task Group, patrolling the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman.

“The Task Group monitors shipping activity in those areas and, in addition to escorting coalition vessels through the Straits of Hormuz, has a responsibility to gather intelligence, intercept and board shipping, and, if necessary, identify and detain Al Qaeda and Taleban personnel.”

Helen Clark and Mark Burton said it was envisaged that Te Kaha would remain on station until February 2003, when Te Mana would take over that role until late June 2003.

“A P3 Orion will provide maritime surveillance support for the Maritime Interdiction Operation for six months from April 2003, subject to suitable basing arrangements being made.

“New Zealand C130 Hercules aircraft have, during the course of this year, provided short-term transport support in and around Afghanistan. That support will continue next year. So too will New Zealand’s contribution of up to four staff officers to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

Helen Clark said that last month’s tragic events in Bali reminded New Zealanders of the continuing threat of international terrorism and the need to work closely with others globally to counter the threat. Indeed, it will require a long-term commitment from all members of the international community to destroy the terrorist networks responsible for attacks on the United States, Bali and elsewhere.

“When I talked to President Bush and other leaders at APEC just two weeks ago, we agreed that international efforts against terrorism would not be short-term.

“At home, New Zealand is neither a soft target nor a safe haven for terrorists. Globally, we are also committed to making a solid contribution. While I am unable to be specific about our special forces’ efforts in Afghanistan, I know they have been widely commended by coalition partners.

“I am confident that Royal New Zealand Navy and Air Force personnel will also play an important part in the international campaign against terrorism,” Helen Clark said.
