The Game and other stories, an Education Ministry CD-ROM which encourages students to read, won the Education category of the TUANZ Interactive Awards held in Wellington last night.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said he was delighted with the success of the innovative CD-Rom, which was developed for the Ministry of Education by Crown-owned educational publisher Learning Media.

“I’d like to congratulate Learning Media and the Ministry. The award is great recognition of the quality of the learning materials that both organisations work together to produce for New Zealand teachers and learners,” Trevor Mallard said.

“ I’m especially delighted that The Game and Other Stories has won an award for excellence in interactive education. This particular CD-ROM is the first of a series to be developed with funding specifically set aside to lift the achievement of Maori and Pasifika students.”

Touch rugby, break-dancing, science fiction, and Jonah Lomu are some of the topics being offered to students on The Game and other stories, which aims to raise levels of literacy in reluctant readers aged 11 to 14, with a particular emphasis on the interests of Màori and Pasifika boys.

The eleven illustrated texts on the CD-ROM have been adapted from the School Journal and the School Journal Story Library series, with each text recorded using the voices of students from Mana College.

All New Zealand schools with year 7–10 classes have received a copy of the CD-ROM, which is designed to be included in classroom literacy programmes.
