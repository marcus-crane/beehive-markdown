Minister of Communications Paul Swain is investigating whether Telecom’s new connection charging regime is in breach of its obligations under the Kiwi Share agreement.

“The government is currently seeking Crown Law advice on this matter, which we expect to have next week,” said Mr Swain.

I have also invited Telecom to meet with with the Minister for Economic Development Jim Anderton, the Minister of Rural Affairs Jim Sutton and myself next week to discuss its new charging regime. This meeting will take place after the government has received its legal advice.”
