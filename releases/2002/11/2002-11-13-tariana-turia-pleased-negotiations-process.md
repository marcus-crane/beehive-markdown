Te Tai Hauauru MP and Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia says she is pleased with the process that has been followed between Whanganui iwi negotiators and Crown representatives.

Following a meeting this afternoon at Parliament, negotiator Ken Mair returned to Whanganui to brief the iwi. He was to seek their input to arrangements that were discussed at the meeting between iwi negotiators and the Crown. A statement was likely to be made tomorrow following a decision by the iwi.

After this afternoon’s meeting, Mrs Turia said the process has been positive and constructive.

“For Genesis Power and the iwi, this has been a step forward, the beginning of a positive relationship that is important for their future.

“The negotiations between the Crown and iwi showed good faith on both sides, and a constructive outcome is a definite possibility,” she said.
