NZ First leader Winston Peters should apologise to New Zealand's ethnic people on International Day for Tolerance this Saturday, Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter said today.

"I fear that Tolerance Day has taken on a new meaning in our country after Mr Peter's repugnant comments last weekend," Mr Carter said.

"Tolerance Day was established in 1995 by the UNESCO to promote tolerance towards other races and religions. It was specifically designed to stamp out discrimination directed at minorities, migrants and refugees."

"In other words it is targetted directly at people like Mr Peters," Mr Carter said.

"Mr Peters wants new migrants to this country to leave their culture at the border. Does that demonstrate tolerance?"

"If Mr Peters is taking a responsible approach to race relations, as he claims, he should be more than happy to offer a formal apology to ethnic people because make no mistake, he has offended them."

"If Mr Peters' refuses to make an apology, then we can all safely ignore him and leave him to his prejudices."
