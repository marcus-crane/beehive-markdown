Huge 2000-year-old totara on land near Taupo are to be formally protected by a new covenant with local Maori, Conservation Minister Chris Carter announced today.

Under the convenant, about 1806 hectares of Titiraupenga native forest will be administered like a Forest Park by the Titiraupenga Trust and the Pouakani Trust, the Maori owners of the area.

"The formal protection of the Titiraupenga and Pouakani Trust lands is a huge step for Maori in the central North Island," Mr Carter said.

"After a long Waitangi claim process involving another nearby block of land, the Trusts have cemented their conservation ideals and ensured that future generations will enjoy the indigenous forest reserve areas for all time," he said.

Titiraupenga Forest sits between Te Kuiti and Taupo and adjoins Pureora Forest Park.  
The newly protected area contains pockets of rimu and matai, and about 120 totara that predate the Taupo eruption 1900 years ago. The area also holds great significance for local Maori.

Titiraupenga Mountain dominates the landscape and features prominently in Maori history. Signs of Maori occupation on and around the mountain can be seen in stone channels dug for irrigated garden sites, pa sites, trenches, and the secondary forestry resulting from cultivation. There are also a number of burial caves on the mountain slopes.

Much of the forest is also coping with the aftermath of extensive logging that took place in the 1950s and 1960s.

An ecological report on the area has found logging has created an imbalance in the forest's natural regeneration cycles. The report estimates it may take the forest several centuries of protection to regain its natural balance. There is also ecological damage caused by possums, stoats and pigs.

The Titiraupenga Trust and the Pouakani Trust aim to manage the property so people can learn about the forest's ecology as well as the cultural significance of the Titiraupenga mountain. They propose to work with Department of Conservation staff to prepare a management plan for the forest in a manner that recognises the mountain's cultural significance.

The covenant is one of a series being negotiated by the Nga Whenua Rahui scheme. The scheme aims to protect indigenous areas on Maori owned land while recognising the special values that iwi place on land. The covenants, or kawenata, negotiated as part of the scheme place emphasis on Maori retaining ownership, management and control of their land.

In return for protecting the land, consideration payments worth a total of $258,750  
were today paid to the Titiraupenga and Pouakani trusts by the Nga Whenua Rahui fund.
