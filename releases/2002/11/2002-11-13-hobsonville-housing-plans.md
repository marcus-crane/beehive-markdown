Housing Minister Mark Gosche is to formally seek part of the former Hobsonville air base to use for state housing purposes.

“This site offers a unique opportunity for the government to develop more housing while also creating economic opportunities,” Mr Gosche said today.

Mr Gosche said he will soon request that the Minister of Lands make part of a 42-hectare parcel of land available for a mixture of housing, including affordable housing for those on low and modest incomes.

“I am delighted to mark the first mile-stone in the creation of what will be an integrated urban community. The aim is a balanced community development that will provide opportunities for a mix of residential housing and ancillary commercial activities. We are working closely with Waitakere City Council to make this happen.

“There is probably no other piece of Crown land anywhere else in the Auckland region that offers such opportunities to influence the quality of urban development.

“There is high demand for affordable housing in Waitakere, but there are limited opportunities for acquiring land in the area. This project will be an enormous help in meeting that demand. It will fit the government’s housing agenda and in the process create employment opportunities. That will help the entire region’s economic growth.”

Mr Gosche said the development would also complement the planned marine industry cluster.

Under the Public Works Act, the balance of the land parcel not required by the Crown will then be offered back to the successors of the former owners.

“The parcel, known as Lot Two, is the latest part of the former base to be declared surplus by the Defence Force. The exact amount of this land needed for housing is yet to be determined.

In addition to the Lot Two land, Housing New Zealand Corporation is keen to acquire more land from the Hobsonville site as the Defence Force declares it surplus.

“It is too early to give details of how the Hobsonville site will be developed overall, but it will include a mix of housing, combined with schooling, parks, reserves and commercial use to help create employment. With that mix I am confident that this innovative development will be highly successful,” said Mr Gosche.
