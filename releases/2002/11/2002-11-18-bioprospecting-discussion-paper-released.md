Associate Minister of Industry and Regional Development Pete Hodgson, today released a public discussion paper on bioprospecting – the investigation of biological resources for commercial purposes.

The paper asks whether New Zealand should promote the potential economic development opportunities and other benefits from bioprospecting. It covers the opportunities available, problems with the current regulatory framework and the advantages of having a bioprospecting policy. It does not address issues associated with the collection and use of human tissues or genetic material.

“Many modern pharmaceutical and industrial products have been derived from the natural world," Mr Hodgson said. “New Zealand has a unique array of indigenous species, both on land and in our large Exclusive Economic Zone. There are sure to be new pharmaceutical and industrial products waiting to be discovered through bioprospecting.

“Currently a company wanting to get involved in bioprospecting is likely to face difficulties in getting clear advice on the relevant regulations and requirements. We have uncertainty in the policy environment and ad hoc controls over access by foreign interests, which does not make the most of the potential opportunities and benefits.

“The government wants New Zealanders to consider how best to gain benefit from bioprospecting and the use of our biological resources, consistent with the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. We want a policy that facilitates responsible access to biological resources with the informed consent of the owners of the resource, on mutually agreed terms. We want a policy that provides for fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from bioprospecting.

Mr Hodgson said the policy would have to recognise and protect the value of Maori knowledge about biological resources, consistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“Work on a bioprospecting policy will not address the larger issues relating to ownership of New Zealand’s indigenous flora and fauna, or the suitability of New Zealand’s intellectual property system for the protection of indigenous knowledge. This is currently being reviewed by the Waitangi Tribunal in response to the Wai 262 claim, which asserts exclusive and comprehensive rights to flora, fauna and other taonga.

"The work on a bioprospecting policy will however examine how the current legal framework could better provide for sharing benefits with Maori and protecting the use of traditional knowledge. This may help the government address the concerns raised in Wai 262.”

Mr Hodgson said comment from stakeholders including researchers and those currently active in bioprospecting, as well as Maori, would be essential for the design of effective policy.
