Sports Minister Trevor Mallard announced today that the successful Push Play campaign, aimed at getting more adults more active, is here to stay and will be geared up next year in a bid to get even more people off the couch.

Trevor Mallard cycled from home into work at the Beehive today – a one-and-a quarter-hour, 25-kilometre journey from Wainuiomata to Wellington - to mark tomorrow’s National Push Play Day.

“Cycling or walking to work can be an easy way to get fit, and to build physical activity into your daily routine – which is what the Push Play programme is all about. It doesn’t need to take up a lot of time,” Trevor Mallard said.

“I’m re-committing myself to at least forty minutes exercise five times a week. The experts say just thirty minutes physical activity a day is worthwhile for your health and wellbeing. You could mow the lawns or just get out and play with the kids. It’s that easy,” Trevor Mallard said.

Regional sports trusts, schools and local authorities – in association with SPARC (Sport and Recreation New Zealand) - will be organising a series of activities around the country tomorrow to celebrate Push Play Day.

“SPARC’S research shows that its Push Play campaign is paying off – more than 140,000 adults are now more active than they were three years ago,” Trevor Mallard said.

Regular physical activity can help reduce the risks of obesity, heart disease, type two diabetes, high blood pressure and some types of cancer. It can also help reduce depression and stress.

SPARC, in conjunction with Professor Adrian Baumann of the New South Wales University, reviewed the Push Play campaign. Prof Baumann described it as “world class” because the message of thirty minutes physical activity a day was clear, simple and still relevant, though the campaign has now run for four years.

“Next year SPARC intends to gear up the Push Play campaign and get even more people more active more often. Details of the extended campaign will be released in the New Year,” Trevor Mallard said.
