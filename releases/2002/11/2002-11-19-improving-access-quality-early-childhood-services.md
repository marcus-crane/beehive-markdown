We all know that increased participation in early childhood education will have a great effect on raising the achievement of our children. In addition, for participation to be meaningful it should engage children, their parents and whanau.

Improving participation in early childhood education is one of the highest priorities of our Government. As a country we need to lift our game in this area, so every young kiwi, regardless of their background, can go on to lead a successful and fulfilled life, contributing positively to New Zealand’s economic development.

For programmes that promote participation and improve access to quality early childhood services to be successful, they need to be driven and owned by local communities.

That’s why the Ministry of Education, in consultation with the early childhood sector, have developed this initiative – the early childhood education design and build scheme.

Local communities and providers of early childhood education will be able to order the supply and delivery of a building, suitable for the delivery of quality early childhood education programmes. The supply and delivery of the building will be complete with site development, ready for use.

The design and build scheme will fill a need from within the sector for quality buildings at an affordable and up-front cost.

Our Government is committed to the provision of high quality early childhood education that can be accessed by all. By assisting early education providers with the building and design of their centres, we will increase participation and contribute towards labour market goals of raising the future skill levels of the workforce.

I recently launched “Pathways to the Future: Nga Huarahi Arataki” – the first ten-year strategic plan for early childhood education since 1989.

The plan sets out a road map for the future of early childhood education in New Zealand and includes specific initiatives to increase participation.

About 60 percent of all children under five currently participate in some form of early childhood education but Maori and Pacific families are significantly under-represented in this area, compared to Pakeha families.

Nearly all Pakeha four-year-olds take part in some form of early childhood education, but only 65 percent of Maori and 78 percent of Pacific four-year-olds are in early childhood education.

There are significant barriers that stop children from accessing early childhood education in particular communities. If these barriers are not broken down early on, then children will have a tough time getting a decent education, decent qualifications, and a decent job later in life.

The early childhood design and build scheme is a step in the right direction, and will move us closer to achieving our goals.

I recently announced that Signature Homes Ltd has been appointed as the Ministry’s preferred contractor for the building and design of centres nationwide.

In order to assist communities in developing centres suitable for the delivery of quality early childhood programmes, indicative designs were developed by the Ministry of Education and Early Childhood Development to illustrate best practice solutions.  
Tenders were invited from contractors to provide a design and build service and Signature Homes Ltd became the successful contractor.  
This was due to a number of factors - their excellent national coverage, competitive price for the service to be provided, technical and professional support and guaranteed contractual performance. Signature Homes will be the Ministry’s preferred contractor for the next three years.  
As much of the initial design work will have been done, there will be considerable savings in time in the pre-construction period.  
The design and build scheme presents the opportunity for early childhood providers to either select a building design from Signature’s catalogue of options or work with Signature Homes to produce a modified design to meet their particular needs.  
The use of the design and build scheme will be entirely voluntary and early childhood providers can choose whether to use the whole service provided by Signature, partial service or continue with their own preferred contracting arrangements. Over the next two to three years we think that up to 80 new early childhood centres will be ordered by providers under the scheme.
