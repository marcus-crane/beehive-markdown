“Industry New Zealand’s first full year of operation shows strong success,“ says Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton commenting on the Industry NZ Annual Report 2001/2.

“We have a window of opportunity to make the most of favourable business conditions and business confidence and Industry New Zealand is working hard to ensure we make the most of this chance.

“The success of the New Zealand economy in future years will depend on how successful New Zealand’s businesses, industries and regions are. Industry New Zealand is doing an excellent job in working in partnership to ensure there are high skilled, high paying jobs and opportunities for New Zealanders.

“Industry NZ substantially achieved or exceeded all performance targets within budget. The Industry NZ contribution to the innovation framework is managing the framework including the four sector taskforces.

“Industry NZ’s Major Investment Service was involved in 51 potential investment opportunities including Jack Links, HIT Lab, and South Pacific Tyres. The new Investment Promotion Agency, Investment NZ, was established within Industry NZ from 1 July 2002.”

“Other successes include 26 regional partnerships which successfully completed their feasibility investigations and capability building phases. Successful industry strategies included Wood Processing, Textiles Clothing and Footwear, Biotechnology, ICT, Design and Screen and Film production.

“Around 80% of Industry New Zealand staff have come directly from the private sector. Their extensive business experience and knowledge is an essential element in Industry New Zealand’s success.

“Industry NZ’s remuneration policy is to pay “total cash” remuneration. Many of the staff from the private sector are used to salary packages, such as vehicles, car parks, bonus payments and other benefits.

“I am pleased to see the establishment of regional offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch which are ensuring a closer relationship between Industry New Zealand and the business community throughout New Zealand,” said Jim Anderton.
