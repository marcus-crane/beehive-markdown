Two reports released today are a significant step toward reducing the risks associated with the use of pesticides and agricultural chemical sprays, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

The reports are The Agrichemical Trespass Ministerial Advisory Committee (ATMAC) Final Report to the Minister for the Environment and Towards a Pesticides Risk Reduction Policy for New Zealand – Summary of Submissions.

"These advance work on reducing the risks from pesticide use generally and agrichemical trespass in particular," Marian Hobbs said.

The Agrichemical Trespass Ministerial Advisory Committee was established last year to investigate and recommend ways to address off-target exposure to agrichemicals. The minister also released for public consultation a discussion document on a pesticide risk reduction policy for New Zealand.

“Through their diverse backgrounds and perspectives on agrichemical use, members have produced a comprehensive report which highlights the importance of good information, good training, and use of best practice," Marian Hobbs said.

"The same applies to the use of pesticides. Thanks to all those involved.

"These two streams of work are part of the bigger picture of managing pesticides and agrichemicals. This includes transferring existing pesticides to the new control regime of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act. The government is considering how these two pesticide management issues will be merged within the overall hazardous substances management framework. Decisions will be made on the next steps early next year.

"In the meantime the reports offer guidance which those who manage pesticides can benefit from."
