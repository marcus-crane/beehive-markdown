Jim Anderton says New Zealand, can and must do better than scapegoating immigrants and needs to give people a ‘fair shake’.

New Zealand has been built by immigrants from all over the world, based on a strong sense of fair play.

“One of our great pioneering traditions has been about recognising the value of people. This meant New Zealand has been first in giving women the vote, looking after our old people and both as a foundation member and good international citizen in helping build the United Nations,” Jim Anderton said.

“New Zealand is a much better society than New Zealand First’s attacks on immigrant citizens portray it.

“We are a tolerant and diverse country with a much better future than the inward-looking isolationism NZ First would have us become,” Jim Anderton said.
