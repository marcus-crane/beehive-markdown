A survey of English language provision for international students shows New Zealand faces important challenges in maintaining its reputation as a provider of high quality export education, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

“It’s important we retain and enhance our reputation as a provider of top-notch export education, but the survey I’m releasing today reveals that quality is variable across the billion-dollar industry,” Trevor Mallard said.

Initiatives are underway to address issues highlighted in the survey, including a resource on cross-cultural awareness and guidelines for teachers in schools.

The proposed export education industry levy and fund is also aimed at addressing the issues with teacher recruitment and qualifications that the survey also highlights, Trevor Mallard said.

Submissions on a recently-released discussion document on the export education industry levy close on November 15.

“While the Government has responsibility for English language provision for migrant and refugee students, providing for the rapid growth in the numbers of full fee paying students should rest with providers themselves,” Trevor Mallard said.

The survey, conducted for the Ministry of Education, reported on the types of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) programmes and the support offered by providers, staffing issues, and practice relating to ESOL governance, business planning and marketing.

“Providers that enrol international students as their core business, such as established language schools, appear most likely to have quality policies and procedures for ESOL provision. But those with few international students or who are new to the industry are less likely to have established polices and practices.”

The survey shows that apart from the majority of private language schools, many providers do not have business plans or policies for English language provision.

“This is concerning, but I expect the position to improve significantly over the next year through the professional development programmes that are now available for schools and tertiary providers, and the ESOL guidelines for schools that are to be published this year,” Trevor Mallard said.
