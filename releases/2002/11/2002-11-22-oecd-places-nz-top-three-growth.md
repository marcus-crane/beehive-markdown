OECD forecasts place NZ in top 3 for growth

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today welcomed the latest OECD forecasts placing New Zealand among the top three for growth this year and among the top eight for growth over the next three years.

The OECD growth track for New Zealand has the economy growing at 4 percent this year and at 3 percent and 3.4 percent over the next two years.

“The picture painted by the OECD forecasts is strongly positive: it has inflation under control, unemployment remaining at current low levels and the government continuing to post budget surpluses.

“That is good news for New Zealand households and reflects well on the quality of the government’s economic and fiscal management,” Dr Cullen said.
