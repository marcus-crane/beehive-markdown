An Auckland rest home is the first health and disability provider to meet new safety standards under the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act that came into effect on 1 October 2002.

Presenting the certificate to Howick Manor Rest Home today, Associate Health Minister Ruth Dyson said certification under the new legislation focused strongly on the standard of care.

“This is an important milestone for the health and disability sector. The purpose of the act and the standards is to promote safe services with consistent standards that will improve the care of people in rest homes, hospitals and homes for people with disabilities.

“The aim is to encourage providers to continually improve their services and to have those improvements acknowledged through certification.”

Ruth Dyson congratulated Howick Manor for voluntarily seeking certification and for achieving it for the maximum three year period. Providers have until 1 October 2004 to move from their current licence to certification.

“Achieving the standards will further enhance Howick Manor’s reputation, and assure both existing and prospective families and residents of the continuing high quality of your services.”

Ms Dyson said the Labour-led government was committed to improving health care services for older New Zealanders.

“Funding for residential aged care facilities and home support services has been increased – although I acknowledge we still have a long way to go to redress years of under-funding by the previous government.

“We have developed a Health of Older People Strategy that provides a national framework for integrated health and disability support services that can respond to the changing needs of older people. A number of initiatives are also underway to strengthen the aged care workforce.”
