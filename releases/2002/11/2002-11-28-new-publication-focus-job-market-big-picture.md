The New Zealand job market - how it works, what opportunities exist for people and how and why it’s changing – is the focus of a new Labour Department publication, workINSIGHT, launched by Social Services and Employment Minister, Steve Maharey, at an international Careers Conference in Wellington today.

Mr Maharey said workINSIGHT will be of particular interest to people choosing education or training, those already studying or in training, people thinking about changing their careers and new or re-entrants to the labour market (e.g. migrants, women returning to the workforce).

“workINSIGHT is one of several initiatives the government is implementing to provide better quality and more accessible information to help people make informed decisions about their involvement in the labour market.”

Mr Maharey said that the publication brings together a raft of quality information on a range of vital issues affecting the labour market. Users will find it of considerable value in making informed decisions on any area relating to the New Zealand labour market.

“workINSIGHT complements a range of measures we’re undertaking through the Skills Action Plan to build skills capability within the New Zealand labour market. This new publication will help people match their skills to the job opportunities available at any given time and help reduce future skill shortages by helping people make better decisions about participating in education and training – or those providing education and training.”

While New Zealand was experiencing sustained economic growth and strong growth in jobs – unemployment levels this year are at their lowest in 14 years – some firms were finding it difficult to find staff, Mr Maharey said.

“Some level of skills shortage is a natural consequence of a dynamic, healthy economy but the government wants to make sure skill shortages don’t reduce the country’s productive capacity, that’s why we’re launching initiatives like workINSIGHT.”

Mr Maharey said workINSIGHT, which is to be published twice yearly in November and May will contain a wide diversity of labour market information useful for anyone making decisions about work.

“The job market is changing all the time. Job opportunities evolve as new products and services are developed that require new kinds of knowledge and skills to produce them.

Not only does the matching process have to keep up with the new opportunities; it is evolving in its own right – as recently as five years ago hardly anyone could imagine searching for a job over the Internet.”

Mr Maharey said workINSIGHT will also be of interest to people looking at job market trends and those following what is happening in specific industry sectors such as manufacturing, construction, retailing and transport and communication, for example.

WorkINSIGHT will be published in hard copy format and will also be available on-line via the government’s new on-line work information portal, WorkSite, launched on Monday, Mr Maharey said.
