Planning Approval Sought For Otago Prison

The government is to seek planning approvals for a corrections facility at Milburn, South Otago, Corrections Minister Mark Gosche announced today.

Mr Gosche said he recently met with residents of the local area to discuss their concerns about the proposed facility, and subsequently delayed making a final decision on the site until he had investigated the issues they had raised.

“Several suggestions for alternative sites were put forward at that meeting, and I have had these further investigated.

“The selected site, approximately five kilometres northeast of Milton, has excellent potential for development and is suitable from a technical, environmental, cost and operational perspective.”

The proposed facility would replace the 59-bed Dunedin prison, which is too small to cope with current inmate numbers.

“Many Otago inmates currently end up serving their sentences outside the region. They could end up as far away as the North Island. A new prison will allow inmates to serve their sentences locally and maintain family, whanau and support links. These links are known to aid successful rehabilitation.”

If approved, the 330-bed prison is expected to open in 2006.
