Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard today welcomed a report from the Commissioner of Police to Police Minister George Hawkins, which looks at ways to improve policing responses in the Auckland region.

The report looks at a variety of proposed solutions to Auckland’s policing issues including crime strategies, resource allocation issues, financial and administrative arrangements and community engagement.

“George Hawkins called for this report because the Labour-led government cares about the Auckland region being able to move ahead economically and socially,” said Judith Tizard.

“We are still dealing with the effects on the region of nine years of neglect by National-led governments.

“National’s Auckland “policy” of destroying the welfare state, neglecting the region’s infrastructure, doing nothing to grow skills or economic opportunities and eroding a sense of community contributed to the increased pressures on Auckland in all areas, including policing.

“Added pressure on the Police comes from the need for good security during the America’s Cup events, the high number of visitors coming through Auckland, high traffic volumes, and increased international movements of goods and people.

“Aucklanders want more Police on the beat and I’m pleased to see that staffing issues are being addressed in a variety of ways. In the past 12 months 200 people have been recruited for metropolitan Auckland and the report indicates that the Auckland districts will achieve their staffing target strength by July next year or the end of 2003 at the latest.

“Auckland’s population is increasing and the Labour-Progressive Government is working hard to develop partnerships to deal with the region’s growth and improve its economic performance for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

“I am delighted that Auckland’s mayors agreed this morning to work in partnership with the Police as much as they can to deliver safe communities for residents.

“George Hawkins and I will keep working with the Police, local government, local communities and our ministerial colleagues to ensure that Auckland continues to get the resources it needs.”

Judith Tizard, who is also Associate Minister of Transport, said Tony Ryall’s latest suggestion to take patrol staff off Auckland’s motorways was pathetic.

“If Auckland’s economy is to grow, Auckland’s motorways need to be able to keep moving. We need patrol staff on the highways as much as we need them throughout the region.

“And an increase in drunk and dangerous driving causing death and injury on Auckland’s roads would be cold comfort to victims of petty theft and vandalism.

“Mr Ryall’s suggestion is yet another example of how out of touch National is with Auckland’s issues.”
