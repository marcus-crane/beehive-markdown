New Zealand's future prosperity will be determined by how well we use our human, physical, natural and social assets, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said today.

Addressing Kaikoura's "Foundation for the Future" celebration Marian Hobbs said other influences include how we use and develop alternative forms of energy, the challenges of urban development, tackling child poverty and migration.

All OECD countries including New Zealand face ageing populations.

"So we will all be chasing skilled migrants as well as trying to retain our own skilled workers," Marian Hobbs said. "The innovative entrepreneur or the school dropout of 2015 is now in his or her key formative years.

"Now is the best time to ensure that those learners have the skills to help them prosper in later life.

"We cannot afford to have any child fail as they develop through the education system."

Marian Hobbs congratulated Kaikoura for making the concept of sustainability a reality.

"You have demonstrated a real energy and vitality for caring for your environment.

"Dealing with increasing tourist numbers and their impacts was putting pressure on the district's infrastructure and the rate take was too small to continue to cope with the improvements and expansions required. The council and community had to think 'outside the box' for innovative solutions and there were individuals prepared to take the lead.

"Too many people assume that economic growth equals damage to the environment. It doesn’t have to. You can have a healthy economy and a healthy environment – and that is what this government is aiming for."
