Te Tai Hauauru MP Tariana Turia says the Memorandum of Understanding, signed at Putiki at 1.00pm today by the iwi of Whanganui and Ministers of the Crown, will help iwi to take the initiative in addressing education issues.

“The iwi of Whanganui have already developed a strategic plan for education,” said Tariana Turia. “It covers pre-school through to tertiary education, both kaupapa Maori and general education, and includes what the iwi as collectives want from an education system.

“By this Memorandum of Understanding, the Ministers of Education and Maori Affairs recognise that the iwi have education goals, and those goals can best be reached by the iwi and official agencies working together,” she said.

“The agreement draws an education strand into the comprehensive economic, social and cultural development plans of the iwi that will ensure a future for their young. These include the regional economic development plan that was signed only a couple of weeks ago.

“This Memorandum of Understanding is a further step by the iwi to take control of their future, and I congratulate them, and the Ministry of Education, on today’s signing,” said Tariana Turia.
