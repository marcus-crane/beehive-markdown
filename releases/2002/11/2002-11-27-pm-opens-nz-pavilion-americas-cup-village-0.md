Prime Minister Helen Clark officially opens the Carter Holt Harvey New Zealand Pavilion at the Viaduct Harbour today.

The Pavilion celebrates New Zealand’s innovation leaders – past, present and future – and highlights the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit driving New Zealand’s success.

Helen Clark says the Pavilion, backed by Industry New Zealand, is an exciting addition to the Viaduct Harbour.

“Innovation, technology and enterprise are essential for our future economic prosperity. The Pavilion celebrates the success of innovative businesspeople who have helped transform the New Zealand economy.”

Minister for Economic, Industry, and Regional Development Jim Anderton said the Pavilion is an excellent way to share leading New Zealanders ideas with each other, and the world.

“The Pavilion has innovators describing what they did, in their own words, and this can inspire other New Zealanders to turn their own ideas into successful businesses.

“It has been made possible by a partnership with businesses which recognises the value of innovation to New Zealand’s economy,” he said.

Sponsors are Carter Holt Harvey, Oktobor, Saatchi & Saatchi, Samsung and principal technology provider Tech-Rentals.

There are sixty monitors inside the Pavilion, featuring innovative companies in the biotechnology, ICT, creative, and niche manufacturing industry sectors.

The Pavilion is open to the public, free of charge, until the conclusion of the America’s Cup in March. It is located on the corner of Halsey Street and Viaduct Harbour Street.
