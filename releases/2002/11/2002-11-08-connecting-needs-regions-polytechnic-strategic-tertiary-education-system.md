INTRODUCTION

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you here today.

You are meeting at a time of imminent change for the tertiary education sector in general, and the polytechnics in particular.

We have reached a transition point in the tertiary education reform process. The design of the overall system framework has now been completed.

The phase of the reforms we are now in is characterised by:  
·working with sector and stakeholders on the design of particular instruments and funds;  
·the impending passage of the Tertiary Education Reform Bill (and I’ll come back to that later), which will in a sense be the formal start-date of the new system; and  
·the sector itself taking ownership of the reforms and making them happen in practice.

This morning I’d like to say a few words about what the new environment is going to mean on the ground. And I want to look at that particularly from the perspective of the regional polytechnic and the communities it serves.

This is not to diminish the important national (and international) role that polytechnics can and do play. Nor are the different levels at which a polytechnic contributes unconnected.

Nonetheless, I’d like to focus on the theme of your conference, which emphasises the regional perspective, and also to reflect our venue today.

THE EXAMPLE OF TAIRAWHITI POLYTECHNIC

In fact, our host for this conference, Tairawhiti Polytechnic, is a useful case in point. Gisborne is a region on the move – and one that this government is getting in behind. It is a region with a number of competitive advantages including a favourable climate, a large land area and coastline and a strong cultural base.

Two standout programmes at Tairawhiti illustrate how a polytechnic can respond to and draw upon the strengths of its region, in a way that gives it national standing.

Firstly, Toihoukura, the Diploma in Visual Arts and Design (Maori). Recognised nationally and internationally as one of the leading schools of contemporary indigenous art, the programme is taught by some of our top Maori artists.

It includes a continuing exhibition programme, which guarantees exposure for the students’ work. Examples are to be found in many Beehive offices and in our embassies around the world.

The closing conference dinner is being held at Toihoukura – delegates should take along their chequebooks and credit cards!

Secondly, the Certificate in Cable Logging. This was developed as the result of a direct approach from industry and is now offered in various locations in the North Island. This programme started over 10 years ago with 14 students and now Tairawhiti anticipates over 200 in 2003.

I’m sure that each of you can think of similar examples from your own institutions.

THE REASON FOR THE REFORMS

In essence, the tertiary reforms are about nothing more mysterious than simply encouraging and supporting this type of behaviour.

We want polytechnics, and other tertiary education organisations, to work individually to identify and meet the needs of your own stakeholders. And to work collectively to identify and meet the needs of the nation as a whole.

We tend to talk about this as increasing the ‘connectedness’ of the system  
Why do we see the need to put more emphasis on connectedness?  
Because we need to be a smart nation.

We’re a small country at the bottom of the world. That means we need to try harder, and work smarter, than everybody else in order to get ahead of the game.

We need to see New Zealand recognised internationally as a land where diversity is valued and reflected in our national identity; a great place to live, learn, work, and do business; a birthplace of world-changing people and ideas and a place where people invest in the future.

How do we get there? It comes down to two words. In fact, if you’re looking for a vision of what this government is about, it’s growth and innovation.

Earlier this year the government published the Growth and Innovation Framework. As leaders of educational institutions I would anticipate that you have all read it. Its aim is to return New Zealand to the top half of the OECD rankings in GDP per capita – and just as importantly, to maintain that position.

Matching skills with increasing specialisation of industry is seen as a vital element. This important work is continuing, with the Prime Minister hosting a Growth and Innovation Forum several weeks ago.

Getting more strategic about skills is a primary focus of the tertiary education reforms. And polytechnics are the place where a lot of the responsibility for this falls: the place where a lot of the action is taking place.

A SECTOR-LED APPROACH

And let me emphasise: that is where the action should take place. With you, in your regions. The system will not be run by remote-control from Wellington.

I want to endorse completely the words of your Executive Director, Jim Doyle, in his report to your AGM yesterday.

There is a middle way between a laissez-faire competitive model and a highly centralized control model. And we intend to take it.

There is no hidden master-plan in a basement of the Beehive, or a locked drawer at the Transition Tertiary Education Commission offices.

The new tertiary education system is about a new culture, a new set of expectations and a new set of incentives.

But the power and the responsibility of determining how to respond to that lies with you, as the leaders of your institutions.

Possibly the biggest challenge for you will be an increased need, in light of the new culture and new incentives, for you to respond collectively, as a sector, rather than each institution working in isolation. But I already see signs of the polytechnics, and their Association, starting to operate in this way.

The role of the Tertiary Education Commission will not be to direct all the operations of this system. Nor will it be to second-guess local innovations.

The TEC will facilitate. Sometimes national stakeholders may not know who to go to in order to address particular skill or knowledge needs.

It will coordinate. Sometimes two organisations might, unknown to each other, come up with plans that are mutually incompatible.

And it may even ask some searching questions. Have you identified all the relevant stakeholders? Are businesses in this industry in your region operating in concert with the whole industry at a national level?

But it will not make arbitrary decisions at the last moment thwarting well-prepared and long-signalled initiatives that institutions have already put a lot of money and time into developing.

In short, the tertiary education reforms are going to require more leadership from polytechnic leaders, not less.

POSITIVE SIGNS OF ACTIVITY

In many cases, you seem to be already reflecting this.

All around are signs that polytechnics have already begun responding to the message that they need to pull together, to operate in a more co-operative and collaborative way.

We are seeing a lot more attention applied to strategic and business planning. Many polytechnics have started thinking about ways to work more closely with other providers and with industry.

Some are providing more targeted applied technical training, with an emphasis on equipping students with the kinds of skills and abilities that local industry wants.

Today’s successful polytechnics are light on their feet: I heard recently of one provider that began work on setting up a ten week driving course. It discussed this with industry and completely changed direction when told that what was needed locally was a two-week forklift-driving course.

At a sector level, I am encouraged by the Association of Polytechnics’ clear commitment to march forward into the new environment, united as a sector.

We welcome the opportunity to use the charters and profiles process to further articulate the role that polytechnics play collectively within the tertiary education system.

COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION

I also commend those who are already making great strides in collaborating with one another. Some of our strongest institutions have already recognised that collaboration and co-operation can bring about significant benefits.

We can see a good working example in the Tertiary Alliance. This grouping of providers in the mid-north region – Western Institute of Technology, Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, University of Waikato, Waikato Institute of Technology, Waiariki Institute of Technology, Wanganui UCOL and Tairawhiti Polytechnic – is working to promote collaborative arrangements that serve their common functions and responsibilities. Creating a strong network of regional opportunities in education is the other key aim.

The TA is offering a pioneering model – one that other TEIs could do well to study – that will allow participating providers to find ways to share good practice, grow relationships and strengthen institutional capacities.

Last year the Alliance was involved in a joint venture with the Tertiary Advisory Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of Education in an assessment of shared services. PricewaterhouseCoopers helped review the opportunities for co-operation and collaboration.

Purchasing/procurement, finance, human resources, payroll, facilities management, information services and technology, and student registry were pinpointed as key areas of attention.

I understand that four working groups (Academic Pathways, Library, IT and Staff Development) are now considering areas where shared services can provide mutual benefits. They are exploring activities as varied as  
·a register of agreed academic pathways among member institutions,  
·co-operative library book purchasing, and  
·common IT equipment procurement.

By linking in with the Collaborating for Efficiency project, I’m sure even greater efficiencies can be made!

COLLABORATING FOR EFFICIENCY

Collaborating for Efficiency is a government/sector initiative that aims to identify and recognise good practice in tertiary institutions and to make sure these practices are widely adopted.

We want to help providers implement good practice and develop collaborative strategies, including thinking about how shared services can benefit their operation.

Put simply, the efficient use of resources means more is available for the delivery of education services.

The project aims to help polytechnics, universities, colleges of education and wananga to focus on achieving efficiencies in a range of areas from entrepreneurial activities through to capital costs and capital management.

Half a million dollars has been set aside to run the project, chaired by Dr Andrew West, chair designate of the Tertiary Education Commission. The Tertiary Advisory Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of Education also supports the project.

Four sub-groups have been established to focus on key areas:  
·staffing costs;  
·capital costs/capital management;  
·entrepreneurial activity particularly in the areas of intellectual property and commercialisation; and  
·sharing of library services.

The Collaborating for Efficiency project is a key area of work for the TEC. In the coming months, members of the steering group and four sub-groups will be working closely with tertiary education institutions, Crown Research Institutes and industry so that the public tertiary education sector can learn from these experiences and share good practice. The steering group is expected to report to me in May 2003.

Rest assured, there is no intention to impose a ‘one-size-fits all’ formula. We know that different practices will work for different types and scales of organisation.

The challenge for you here today will be to review the Collaborating for Efficiency report and consider how you can achieve change within your own organisation that enhances efficiency and effectiveness.

We have set aside a further $10 million within the new Strategic Development Component for a contestable round to occur in 2003.

This fund will look to fund TEIs implementing the recommendations flowing from the Collaborating for Efficiency project.

It will also provide operating funds for assisting sector initiatives such as developing linkages with business communities and other stakeholders as well as collaborative initiatives between institutions.

E-LEARNING

There is also going to be particular funding available to support collaborative efforts in the field of e-learning, as I announced in this year’s Budget. As recommended by Shona Butterfield’s E-learning Advisory Group, we will be setting up an E-Learning Collaborative Fund to allocate capital funding to develop capability. I hope to be in a position to make more detailed announcements about the scale and criteria of this fund before long.

THE ‘SKILL SHORTAGES’ CHALLENGE

It is important that polytechnics are working together for peak effectiveness because they, and the rest of the sector, are currently facing huge expectations.

Scarcely a week goes by nowadays without us hearing some commentator identifying ‘skills shortages’ as a factor limiting industry expansion.

On one level, this is an enviable problem for a country to have to deal with. It is certainly preferable to growing unemployment and weak growth, which New Zealand faced not so long ago.

We also have to be careful about accepting every concern at face-value. Many of what are termed ‘skills shortages’ turn out to be more general ‘labour shortages’. And in many cases the underlying problem is retention rather than a shortage at the skill development end.

I was pleased at the recent Employers and Manufacturers Association Northern conference to see industry taking a real ownership of the issue, and a responsibility for contributing to solutions.

Nonetheless, as this country continues to grow, we are increasingly going to find instances where not enough skilled people are being developing for particular industries, either regionally or nationally.

The first challenge is for us all collectively to get to the point where the wider public clearly recognises that the solution in such cases lies with the tertiary education system. That means the Tertiary Education Commission at the national level, Industry Training Organisations at the industry level, and providers – particularly polytechnics – at the local level.

The second challenge is to then address those shortages swiftly and proactively.

In this respect a key partnership within the sector will be between the polytechnics and the Industry Training Organisations. I have been encouraged by signs of increasing warmth between the two, as evidenced for example in the APNZ-ITF Consultative Group.

On the other hand the government’s decision to cap funding to private training establishments increases the onus on polytechnics to make sure they are meeting all their region’s skill needs. We have made a principled choice that, while private provision has a valuable place, we don’t want to increase our reliance on it any further. Public institutions should and will be the core of the system.

But we are now expecting polytechnics to vindicate that choice by not leaving regions and industries with skill needs that they cannot get met though the public sector.

We need all polytechnics to be out there knocking on the door of all the employers in your community, asking, what do you need and how can we deliver it?

SUPPORTING REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

As I indicated before, the reforms are not just about a new set of expectations. They are also about the government setting up new incentives and developing new ways of supporting tertiary education organisations to meet those expectations.

We have recognised that we cannot just blindly allocate funds on the basis of student numbers and expect that to appropriately support all the various objectives that the country and individual stakeholders might have in mind.

There has been wide awareness of this in the sector with regard to the Performance-Based Research Fund, but that will primarily affect the behaviour of universities.

The private providers will see this next week when the first round of Strategic Priority Fund results are announced. The Strategic Priority Fund allocates new PTE funded places on the basis of niche contributions to the Tertiary Education Strategy.

For polytechnics, however, a clear sign of a more strategic way of allocating new funding is the Polytechnic Regional Development Fund.

The Polytechnic Regional Development Fund is a contestable pool of money within the new integrated funding framework, which is only available to polytechnics. That’s because we see polytechnics as having a unique responsibility within the system as agents of regional development.

The fund starts next January with $2m available in 2003 and 2004, and $1m in 2005.

Our aim is to strengthen partnerships between polytechnics, local companies, regional development organisations, industry training organisations and iwi.

To qualify for an award of up to $300,000, proposals from polytechnics and their local partners have to demonstrate consistency with the economic development strategy being developed by their region and the government’s tertiary education priorities.

What’s more, the awards themselves are just the start. They are intended to fund the development of initiatives that meet local needs. Once up and running, these initiatives are likely to attract tuition funding.

We also hope that these polytechnic-led regional development initiatives will attract investment from business, local government and community trusts. The system should be linking together its research capacity, and working with industry to maximise financial resources.

Once we all begin looking at polytechnics as the hub of regional skills and knowledge development, the possibilities are endless.

REGIONAL DEVELOPMEMENT PLANS

This is where the tertiary education system intersects strongly, and positively, with regional development.

Local authorities are increasingly taking responsibility for economic development in their own areas, and this will only increase with the passage of the new more flexible and enabling Local Government Bill.

Industry New Zealand's Regional Partnerships Programme has been established to assist communities to work together to identify and develop economic enhancement opportunities in their area.

It offers financial support for development strategies and building local partnerships, and grants for major regional initiatives that are consistent with regional strategies, and contribute to the government’s goal of sustainable development.

Initial funding is available to undertake economic analysis and consultation, to develop a regional economic strategy, and further funding is made available to assist regions to address barriers to economic growth, and develop their capability to progress specific economic growth initiatives.

All twenty-six regions, involving 57 local authorities, have now received approval for strategic funding under the Regional Partnerships Programme.

WINE RESEARCH CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE

An example of regional development coming together with tertiary education in a way that has benefit the polytechnic as well as the region is the Wine Research Centre of Excellence at the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

This partnership between industry, research and education was launched last November at the Blenheim campus and will offer a three-year bachelor of Viticulture and Oenology.

A recent recipient of a $2m Industry NZ grant, the centre is an initiative of the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, the Marlborough Economic Development Trust and the Marlborough District Council. The funding will be used for constructing and equipping the facility, with operational costs met by the wine industry.

It’s a partnership between the established Marlborough Centre, including Marlborough District Council, Lincoln University, and the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

It enjoys substantial on-going operational funding from the wine industry. The Centre will open up more opportunities to pursue graduate studies and post-graduate research. The knowledge gained will go back into the region’s wine industry.

This initiative represents a big economic and social boost to the Marlborough region. Wakatu Incorporation and Ngai Tahu have significant investments in the Marlborough wine industry. Training and employment benefits will undoubtedly further enhance Maori economic development in the region.

With half of the value of our wine exports coming from the region, it is clear that greater knowledge and innovation will translate directly into higher export earnings.

The Wine Research Centre of Excellence shows us how a skills development initiative can help bring about good results for our young people and their future employers.

It is a shining example of how we can link up regional polytechnics and their local partners to identify initiatives that will meet the needs of employers now – and in the years ahead.

CONCLUSION

We stand together on the threshold of an exciting and challenging era of quality education provision – an era that will be underpinned by improved efficiency and effectiveness on the part of the polytechnic sector.

The Tertiary Education Reform Bill will be passed in time for the revised commencement date of 1 January 2003. Inevitably, in a busy government with a large legislative programme, no Bill proceeds as quickly as we’d all like it to. But the TERB, as it’s become known, is on track and has secure parliamentary support.

The Tertiary Education Commission will therefore be established at the beginning of the year, giving plenty of time for the new charters and profiles to be agreed by 2004.

Government supports quality polytechnics in the regions and is determined to ensure they remain key players in the new environment.

If we are to achieve national and international recognition as a knowledge economy, collaboration and co-operation among our tertiary institutions must be the hallmarks of our approach.
