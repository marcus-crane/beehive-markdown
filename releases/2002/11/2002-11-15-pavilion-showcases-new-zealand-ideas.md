New Zealand is the home of good ideas and the New Zealand pavilion in the America’s Cup Village will showcase these to the world, says Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

Jim Anderton welcomed the partnership between Industry New Zealand and leading businesses that will see the Carter Holt Harvey New Zealand Pavilion open later this month.

Jim Anderton says that the Carter Holt Harvey New Zealand Pavilion, will be a major highlight for the four million visitors expected to pass through Auckland’s America’s Cup Village.

The Pavilion is one of several Industry New Zealand initiatives fostering a culture of business enterprise. “The Pavilion will inspire visitors through the stories of our innovative business people and outstanding companies from recent start-ups to global exporters in the biotechnology, information technology, niche manufacturing and creative industries,” says Jim Anderton.

“It is heartening to see the strength of New Zealand innovation. Industry New Zealand, Carter Holt Harvey and the participating businesses are to be applauded for their vision of an innovative New Zealand that is internationally competitive and world-class.”

“The more new innovators and entrepreneurs who decide to turn their dreams and ideas into businesses and jobs the more likely it is that living standards for all New Zealanders will rise.

“The Pavilion is a powerful statement to New Zealand and the world that as well as being clean and green, we are a smart, innovative and ideas based nation,” says Jim Anderton.

Industry New Zealand will host the Pavilion and its opening by the Prime Minister Rt. Hon Helen Clark on Wednesday November 27. The Pavilion will be open free to the public seven days a week from Saturday 30 November.
