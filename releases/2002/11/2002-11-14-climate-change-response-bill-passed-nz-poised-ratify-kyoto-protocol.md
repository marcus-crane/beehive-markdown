New Zealand is ready to ratify the Kyoto Protocol following the passage through Parliament last night of the Climate Change Response Bill, says the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The Bill was passed last night by 61 votes to 56. It provides the legal framework for ratification of the Protocol.

The Bill includes powers for the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units that represent New Zealand’s target allocation for greenhouse gas emissions under the Protocol. It enables the Minister to trade those units on the international market. It establishes a Registry to record holdings and transfers of units. And it establishes a national inventory agency to record and report information relating to greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with international requirements.

"The government will ratify the Protocol soon, following the passage of this Bill," Mr Hodgson told Parliament last night. " In doing so we will join the majority of developed nations, including many of our major trading partners. We will meet our international obligations and past commitments. We will be putting this nation in a position to make a measured transition to a carbon-constrained economy, rather than acting late and facing the necessity of more drastic and costly change. We will be setting out on the path to a sustainable energy future."

The government announced last month the domestic climate change policies that will enable New Zealand to meet its Kyoto Protocol target for greenhouse gas emissions, which is to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels over the Protocol's first commitment period 2008-2012.

Mr Hodgson said the last remaining step was for New Zealand to deposit an "instrument of ratification" document with the United Nations in New York. Preparations to do so were under way and New Zealand would ratify within the next few weeks.
