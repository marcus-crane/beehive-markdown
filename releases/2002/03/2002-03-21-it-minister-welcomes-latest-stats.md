Information Technology Minister Paul Swain has welcomed latest IT industry statistics showing increases in sales and services.

The survey from Statistics New Zealand shows that for the 2001 financial year sales of IT goods and services were $6.8 billion – up 3.3 percent on the year before.

“Sales of IT goods and services have grown every year since 1994,” Paul Swain said.

“The really good news is that total exports of computing hardware and software ane related services has reached $770 million - that’s up nearly 12% on the year before.

“There are reports that IT industry sales might slow this year because of the effects of the dotcom crash, September 11 and the fact that people are now being more discerning about their IT spend.

“However these statistics show New Zealand’s IT industry has an extremely good base for weathering any slow down.

“As part of the Innovation Framework announced by the Prime Minister last month, the government is setting up a taskforce in the information communication technology sector.

“Its aim, among other things, will be to identify the growth potential for the industry, the potential barriers to growth and ways to get more focus, coordination and international branding for this important area.

“My trips over the past two years to the USA, UK, Ireland, India and Singapore have confirmed that the New Zealand ICT industry can be a world leader. Business and government just need need to work together to promote and encourage its growth,” Paul Swain said.
