A comprehensive study of dioxin levels in soil in the Paritutu area of New Plymouth, an area that may have been exposed to historical dioxin emissions from pesticide manufacture, will begin soon, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs and Green Party health spokesperson Sue Kedgley announced today.

The Ministry for the Environment (MfE) and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR) will conduct the study which is being funded from a Green initiative agreed by the government during the last budget round. It is part of the government’s continuing investigation into community concerns about dioxin contamination in the city.

"The study will be the most comprehensive soils investigation of its kind ever undertaken in an urban area of New Zealand," Marian Hobbs said. "It will show the community once and for all what the levels of dioxin in Paritutu residential soils are. The study will also help health specialists in advising whether there is any risk to people living in the area."

"The Green Party is delighted that we have secured funding for this important and long-overdue dioxin testing," Sue Kedgley said. "While sites will be selected on the basis of scientific criteria, we also want the community involved in selecting them so that everyone is satisfied that the appropriate sites are being tested."

At the same time as the soil study, the Ministry of Health will be conducting its own study to determine dioxin levels in people who are current and past residents of the area. These current studies complement earlier work on rates of illness in the community by the Taranaki Medical Officer of Health and investigations into alleged waste dumpsites by the Taranaki Regional Council.

Soil will be taken from a number of properties in the area, and the samples will be sent to Wellington for testing by a specialist laboratory. The Ministry for the Environment and ESR will report the results of the study back to the community in late July.

"I would like to thank New Plymouth residents for the help that they have given government agencies so far. A study like this can only happen with the cooperation of the local community so I hope that Paritutu people continue to be involved," Marian Hobbs said.
