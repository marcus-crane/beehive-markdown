More job seekers moved into long-term employment during January than in any other month over the past two and a half years, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

Information supplied by the Ministry of Social Development records that 12,671 job seekers moved into stable employment during the December 2001 quarter – and a further 4,795 job seekers had remained employed for more than three months last month. Forty-three percent of these jobs were found by the long-term unemployed, jobs seekers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks. The Ministry is currently achieving just over 11% above its year-to-date targets.

Steve Maharey said he was particularly pleased that the long-term unemployed were finding work and sharing the benefits of a growing economy.

“The number of job seekers moving into stable employment (in work for more than three months) last month – at 4,795 – is the highest figure achieved since stable employment outcomes were adopted as a performance measure in September 1995.

“Long-term unemployment is the legacy of past governments neglect. The Labour-Alliance government is committed to rebuilding the economic and social fabric of the country and to sharing the gains of economic transformation.

“By January record numbers of job seekers had moved off the register into stable employment in the Wellington and Southern regions. In the other regions numbers of people finding stable employment was also high.

“Overall only 9% of those who were receiving the unemployment benefit in November 1999 are still on the benefit two years later,” Steve Maharey said.
