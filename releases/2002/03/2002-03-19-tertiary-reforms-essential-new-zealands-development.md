The tertiary education reforms now underway are an essential element of the government’s innovation framework, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Speaking to the Economic Development Association of New Zealand conference in Palmerston North this morning, Steve Maharey said the reforms are designed to ‘open up’ tertiary education to a closer relationship with our economy and society.

“Tertiary education has a key contribution to make to the economic and social development of New Zealand. In the government’s recently published Growing an Innovative New Zealand framework this was explicitly recognised.

“The need to develop a better match between skill needs and skilled workers is urgent and we are giving the problem urgent attention.

“The tertiary education reforms now underway essentially treat New Zealand as a ‘developing nation’ that we must transform if we are to return to being a successful nation once again. A well-educated, skilled and adaptable workforce is the essential ingredient in producing a successful economy in this new century.

“We are looking for a quantum shift in the performance and connectedness of the whole tertiary education sector because nothing less will provide us with the skills base to move forward,” Steve Maharey said.
