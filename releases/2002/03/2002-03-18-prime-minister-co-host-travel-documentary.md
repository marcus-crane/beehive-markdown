A Discovery Channel programme co-hosted by Prime Minister Helen Clark will be invaluable for New Zealand tourism, says Tourism Minister Mark Burton.

"This programme will have huge benefits for New Zealand and is a unique opportunity to showcase our beautiful country," Mark Burton said.

The one-hour long programme, which will be filmed next month, will go out to more than 200 million homes worldwide.

New Zealand would be only the second country to feature in this documentary series. Helen Clark follows on from the King of Jordan who co-hosted the first episode.

The documentary format involves a leader taking Peter Greenberg, an Emmy Award winning writer and producer, through their country with a film crew in tow.

Mark Burton said Tourism New Zealand staff in the USA had worked for months to make the deal happen.

"Peter Greenberg is regarded as the pre-eminent travel correspondent in the United States. This high-profile programme will help showcase New Zealand as the ideal destination combining landscape, culture, people, and adventure.

"It will focus on the Prime Minister’s favourite places in New Zealand and will also feature a variety of cultural and adventure activities," Mark Burton said.

Filming with the Prime Minister will take place between April 2-6th. Peter Greenberg will also host two live US radio shows while in New Zealand.
