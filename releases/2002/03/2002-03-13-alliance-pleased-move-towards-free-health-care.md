Moves towards free health care will be made possible by primary health funding announcements made today, Alliance leader and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton says.

The Government will inject more than $400 million in new funding into primary health care over the next three years.

Free health care for school age children was a prominent goal when the Alliance launched a package of ten policy priorities at its conference in November last year.

$50 million has been allocated for this year to go towards primary health care for low income New Zealanders with high health needs.

From next year $165 million will be allocated and Cabinet has agreed it will be applied to extend free or low cost access to primary health care services. The priorities will be reducing costs for school-age children followed by the elderly and others with high health needs.

“No one should be denied prompt medical attention on grounds of cost or ability to pay,” Jim Anderton said.

“Free health care is a fundamental principle for the Alliance, and the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government is making significant, realistic steps towards that goal.”
