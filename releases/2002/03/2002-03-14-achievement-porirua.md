An exciting new initiative to raise educational achievement for all students in Porirua was launched today by Education Minister Trevor Mallard.

Achievement Porirua – Whakatutukitanga Porirua embraces all schools, early childhood centres and tertiary providers in Porirua, with a special focus on Maori and Pacific Island people.

The Minister said measurable change should be apparent within 18 months, with significant improvements against national achievement levels achieved within five years.

“Porirua already boasts many success stories but a lot more needs to be done to ensure all local students are able to achieve their full potential,” he said.

“Achievement Porirua will build on a range of successful educational initiatives already underway in the city and introduce new initiatives where there is an agreed need.

“We know that Porirua schools are energetic, student-focussed and innovative. But we also know many more students leave Porirua secondary schools with no Year 13 qualifications than those from similar schools. We plan to turn that around.”

Trevor Mallard said a similar initiative in South Auckland had achieved impressive results, with improved teaching and learning along with stronger governance and management.

“The SEMO (Strengthening Education in Mangere and Otara) initiative has led to a greater focus on student achievement in those communities. Over the past five years the number of under-performing schools in those communities has dropped from 42 percent to less than 20 percent. Year 1 students’ reading and writing levels significantly increased to close to national averages in 18 schools.

“I am confident that in Porirua we will achieve similar results in improved literacy in the early years of schooling, better school leaver qualifications and higher student retention at schools within the city.”

The project has initial funding of $130,000 to June 30 2002.

“But the project is not about pouring more money into schools in the Porirua area – it’s about how we can better co-ordinate resources and the skills of the network of professionals that are working for better education outcomes for Porirua children,” Trevor Mallard said.

A Steering Group has been formed from the Porirua community to drive the Achievement Porirua initiative. It is headed by Hugh Lawrence, chair of the Papakowhai School Board of Trustees.
