A solid increase in trainees and trainee achievement in the motor industry is being commended by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

Steve Maharey attended a Motor Industry Training Organisation Industry Forum in Wellington today and announced that a new qualification, the National Certificate in Motorcycle Engineering, will be added to Modern Apprenticeships programme.

“Modern Apprenticeships in the motor industry have been extremely popular since their introduction in July 2001.

“As at December 2001, there were 123 Modern Apprentices in the industry. The Motor Industry Training Organisation is also a Modern Apprenticeship Co-ordinator and reported 55 Modern Apprentices as at December last year. Co-ordinators have predicted over 380 Modern Apprentices by 30 June this year.

“The inclusion of Motorcycle Engineering apprenticeships will not only provide young people with qualifications and rewarding careers in the motor industry, but will also help further raise the profile of Modern Apprenticeships,” Steve Maharey said.
