Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton leaves on a 12-day trade mission to China on Sunday.

He will go to Shanghai first, where he will open a seminar on New Zealand forestry at 9.30am Monday morning (Chinese time). He will also meet Shanghai local government authorities and will visit a New Zealand-owned factory.

From Shanghai, Mr Sutton will go to Harbin, in China’s northern provinces. There, he will meet local government authorities and will visit local food manufacturers.

The next stop in the trade mission will be Beijing, where Mr Sutton will meet Chinese government authorities, including his counterpart, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. He will also visit a timber mill in the Tianjin Economic Development Area near Beijing.

Mr Sutton will also visit Dalian, where a memorandum of understanding will be signed between a New Zealand university and a Chinese tertiary institute. He will also meet local government authorities.

From there, the trade mission moves on to Qingdao, where a seminar to promote New Zealand companies will be held. Mr Sutton will visit several facilities of interest to New Zealand companies, and will meet local government authorities.

After leaving China, Mr Sutton will stop in Hong Kong to meet counterpart Brian Chau to discuss the proposed New Zealand-Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership trade agreement, which is currently being negotiated.

There will be representatives of 20 New Zealand companies and organisations travelling with Mr Sutton on the trade mission, ranging from forestry interests to education institutes. Most are already operating in China but are looking to expand their operations.

Mr Sutton said China was a huge market with many significant opportunities for New Zealand companies, but it was not an easy market.
