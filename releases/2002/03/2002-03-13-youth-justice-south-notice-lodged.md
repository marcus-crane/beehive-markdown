Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey has today lodged with the Selwyn District Council a notice of requirement to designate the crown owned Runners Rd site for Child, Youth and Family’s new Christchurch-based Youth Justice Residential Centre - South.

“This is a significant milestone for the Residential Services Strategy”, Steve Maharey said.

“We have undertaken an extensive search for a new site and a comprehensive period of consultation. I am confident that this site is right for the much needed Residential Centre and I am now looking forward to completing the next stages of this project.

“The Burwood community will be pleased also with this milestone. Getting this new residence operational will enable the Department to close the youth justice unit at the Kingslea Residential Centre in Burwood. A notice of requirement to designate the Kingslea site for the new Care and Protection Residential Centre –South was publicly notified by the Christchurch City Council in February.”

Steve Maharey said he hopes that the new Youth Justice Residential Centre – South can be operational by early 2004.

“This is the sixth of seven residences planned nationwide to improve the care, control and rehabilitation Child, Youth and Family is able to provide for vulnerable children and young people and young offenders,” Steve Maharey said.
