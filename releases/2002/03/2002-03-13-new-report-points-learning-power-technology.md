A report released today points the way forward on the use of technology in tertiary education.

*Highways and Pathways*, the report of the 10-member E-Learning Advisory Group established last year, includes recommendations about government leadership, responsibilities to Maori, quality assurance, funding, infrastructure, and intellectual property.

Steve Maharey, Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) today congratulated the E-learning Advisory Group for their report.

“Unusually this report has focused on learners and their needs rather than just the technology. The report has been developed by people with a strong interest in and commitment to e-learning.

“E-learning provides many challenges – we’re talking about more than computers. We’re talking about our students being equipped with the skills to participate in an innovative New Zealand.

“The next stage will be to prepare advice to Cabinet on how the government should implement the report. We already have some building blocks in place. We need to now work out how the government can best support our learners and e-learning.

“But this challenge does not only apply to the government. The report encourages providers, the private sector, industry and the community to work together so that our learners have the highest-quality teaching,” Steve Maharey said.
