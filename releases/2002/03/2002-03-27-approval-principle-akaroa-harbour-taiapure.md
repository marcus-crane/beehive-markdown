Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson has agreed in principle to an application for a taiapure-local fishery for Akaroa Harbour, Banks Peninsula.

A Tribunal of the Maori Land Court will now consider the application by the Onuku, Wairewa and Koukourarata Runaka.

Mr Hodgson said his agreement in principle, which follows consultation with Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia, began a consultative process in which the issue of a proposal for a marine reserve within the proposed taiapure area could be further discussed.

An agreement negotiated in 1998 by Nick Smith MP, then Minister of Conservation, provides for the taiapure-local fishery process to recognise the existence of the Dan Rogers marine reserve application and leaves open the question of how best to achieve marine protection in Akaroa Harbour.

“Consideration of the taiapure application by the Maori Land Court will provide an appropriate forum for the marine reserve issue to be addressed”, Mr Hodgson said. “Before making a final decision on the taiapure application I will be looking again, with relevant ministers, at how the aspirations for both a taiapure and a marine reserve can best be satisfied.”

The Ministry of Fisheries will shortly publish the taiapure-local fishery proposal in the Gazette, major newspapers and a local newspaper and call for submissions or objections to be lodged with the Maori Land Court. The proposal will be available for public inspection at offices of the Ministry of Fisheries, the Maori Land Court, Banks Peninsula District Council, and Environment Canterbury.
