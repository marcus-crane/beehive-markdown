Senior Citizens Minister Lianne Dalziel today welcomed the re-launch of the Age Concern Senior Achievers’ Awards at a special function in Wellington today.

The awards started in 1995 but did not proceed last year due to the previous sponsor changing its sponsorship arrangements. This year the awards have been returned with new sponsorship from Medical Alarms Security Systems Healthcare Ltd.

In re-launching the awards, Lianne Dalziel welcomed the event as an opportunity for New Zealand to publicly acknowledge the contributions of older New Zealanders to the community.

“It is an entirely appropriate time to re-launch the Senior Achievers’ Awards, because this week is Volunteer Awareness Week and these awards specifically recognise the voluntary contributions that older people make to our communities.

“Many of our community organisations would not exist without the time, energy and dedication of our volunteers, many of whom are older New Zealanders.”

The awards are open to New Zealanders aged over 60 years of age, who have made outstanding voluntary contributions to their communities and Lianne Dalziel has encouraged communities to nominate their most active senior volunteers for these awards.
