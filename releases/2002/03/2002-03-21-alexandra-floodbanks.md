Alexandra now has stronger protection to withstand 100 year floods with new floodbanks commissioned today by Prime Minister Helen Clark and Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton.

The new floodbanks became necessary after areas in and around Alexandra were inundated by floodwaters six times in 25 years.

The Labour Alliance Government committed to resolving the issue and worked with local and regional government, Contact Energy, and the local community to find ways to get better protection for Alexandra and its people.

Prime Minister Helen Clark said this was another example of the positive role Government can play in funding and facilitating.

“This was an issue where Government involvement was needed to bring together local businesses, community people, local government, government agencies, and Contact Energy to solve a problem that was larger than local people could address alone.

“I am pleased that Cabinet and Contact Energy were able to agree to spend $22 million (GST inclusive) to protect Alexandra from future flooding in September of 2000 and to see the major work completed so quickly,” said Helen Clark. Total spending has come in at over $27 million.

Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton welcomed the new floodbanks as allowing the region around Alexandra to grow and prosper. “These floods and the threat of future floods were a serious barrier to economic development in the region.

“We were able to solve the issue co-operatively rather than using legal battles and by involving all the parties. Contact Energy deserve recognition for coming so willingly to help find a solution and their contribution of $6.8 million for property purchases and settlement of claims,” said Jim Anderton.  
The flood barriers can accommodate a flood level of 143.25 metres, one metre higher than the highest previous flood peak recorded in Alexandra in November 1999.
