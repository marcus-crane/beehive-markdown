Ethnic Affairs Minister George Hawkins has today welcomed the launch of a nationwide Chinese Lifeline service.

Chinese Lifeline, which offers telephone counselling in Cantonese and Mandarin, has been running for nine years in the Auckland area. Today the service celebrated its ninth birthday, and the fact it is going nationwide with the introduction of an 0800 number – 0800 888 880.

Attending the celebration in Auckland, Mr Hawkins paid tribute to the many members of the Chinese community who have helped to make Chinese Lifeline a success.

“As Minister for Ethnic Affairs, it is always a pleasure to see ethnic communities helping themselves. Chinese Lifeline draws on the skills of both established and newly arrived Chinese immigrants. So the service has provided a chance for the community to come together, and to encourage those who need help to seek it.

“Chinese Lifeline offers assistance on a range of issues, from personal worries, through to helping new immigrants to feel at home in New Zealand – and in doing so, the service is also making a difference to New Zealand as a whole.

“It is great news that even more Chinese New Zealanders will be able to benefit from the Lifeline, with the introduction of an 0800 number,” said Mr Hawkins.
