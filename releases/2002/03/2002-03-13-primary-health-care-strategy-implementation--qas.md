How much extra money is there?

The extra money is included within the Health Funding package announced recently. The amounts are as follows:

$million2002/032003/042004/05Total over 3 years  
Primary health care strategy funding (included in Health Funding Package) 50165 195 410

What will the new funding be spent on?

The Government’s priorities for the new primary care funding (in order of priority) are:  
1.Extra funding will be made available to some Primary Health Organisations covering very deprived populations in order for them to have low fees for all their patients, provide services to ensure care gets to where it is most needed, include services to improve and maintain health as well as restore health, and to move to fairer funding allocations on a population needs basis.  
2.The General Medical Services subsidy for children under six years will be adjusted for inflation since 1997.  
3.As more funding becomes available from 2003/04, it will start to be applied to extend free or low cost access to primary health care services through PHOs. The priorities will be reducing costs for school-age children followed by the elderly and others with high health needs.  
4.Measures will be introduced to help implement the Primary Health Care Strategy in rural areas and to retain and recruit the rural health care workforce.  
5.Primary Health Organisations will be encouraged to set up across the country; they will be funded according to their enrolled population to provide a range of population based services to improve and maintain health as well as treatment services, to address health inequalities.  
6.A range of measures will be introduced to improve take-up of Community Services Cards until such time as increased funding means cards are no longer needed. Improvements to the High User Health Card will also be implemented.

What is the breakdown of funding – PHO establishment, under sixes etc?

The breakdown is being worked on now. The funding will be applied to the six priority areas that Cabinet has agreed. Details of how the funding will be allocated will be submitted for Cabinet approval in April.

It will not be possible to be precise about the allocation as it will depend on a number of factors including:  
·How many PHOs are formed and when (this is a voluntary process and Numbers and timing cannot be accurately predicted at this stage)  
·The make-up of the populations served by newly established PHOs  
·The existing funding arrangements and funding level of providers that form PHOs compared to the funding they will receive under the national capitation formula.

How do you know DHBs won't spend it on other things?

DHBs will not have the option of applying the funding for other purposes. Primary Health Care Strategy funding will be ring-fenced and applied only for the priorities agreed by Cabinet. Any change would require a Cabinet decision.

How will PHOs be established?

The funding will be carefully managed to ensure that providers serving the highest need populations access funding first. A small amount ($3m-$4m) will be available to help get PHOs established. The Ministry will call for applications through DHBs shortly, so providers need to be talking with their DHB about how best to move forward with the strategy.

What will happen to the Community Services Card?

The Community Services Card will be phased out over the next 8-10 years. As it will still be needed by many people over the medium term, improvements will be made to make it more effective. Improvements will include measures to:  
·Increase the numbers of people who get the card automatically rather than having to apply  
·Simplifying the process for low income people to gain a card  
·Making it easier for providers to determine whether an individual has a card.

Will there be any changes to GMS?

The only change to the rates of the General Medical Services subsidy (GMS) is that the rate for under-sixes will be inflation adjusted so that as many under-sixes as possible can continue to get free GP visits. The rate of subsidy will increase from $32.50 per visit to $35 per visit from 1 July 2002. This accounts for inflation from 1 July 1997 to June 2002.

Other funding to reduce the cost of access for patients will be provided through the national capitation formula that is being developed to determine funding for PHOs.

How are PHOs different from Independent Practitioner Associations?

PHOs must meet a set of minimum requirements that do not apply to IPAs. Some IPAs would already meet some of these requirements but very few would meet all of them at this stage. The minimum requirements for PHOs are as follows:  
·PHOs will aim to improve and maintain the health of their populations and restore people’s health when they are unwell. They will provide at least a minimum set of essential population-based and personal first-line services  
·PHOs will be required to work with those groups in their populations (for example, Maori, Pacific and lower income groups) that have poor health or are missing out on services to address their needs  
·PHOs must demonstrate that they are working with other providers within their regions to ensure that services are co-ordinated around the needs of their enrolled populations  
·DHBs will use a national formula to fund PHOs according to their enrolled populations  
·PHOs will use a national enrolment system to enrol people through primary providers  
·PHOs must demonstrate that their communities, iwi and consumers are involved in their governing processes and that the PHO is responsive to its community  
·PHOs must demonstrate how all their providers and practitioners can influence the organisation’s decision-making  
·PHOs are to be not-for-profit bodies with full and open accountability for the use of public funds and the quality and effectiveness of services.

The cost of increasing the CSC income thresholds this year and in future years will be funded outside the current three-year Health Funding Package.

What are Community Services Cardholders entitled to receive?

The CSC entitles family members to higher GP subsidies and lower prescription charges:  
·Adult cardholders receive a subsidy of $15 for a GP visit and only need to pay $3 towards prescriptions.  
·For children over six there is a subsidy of $20 for a GP visit and a charge of only $3 towards prescriptions.

What do the changes to the income thresholds mean for the group of superannuitants whose CSC eligibility was grandparented last year?

Last year superannuitants who were affected by the 1 April increase to the New Zealand Super had their CSC eligibility 'grandparented' to ensure they did not lose their CSC simply as a result of the cost of living adjustment. No individual who was grandparented last year will lose their CSC this year or in future years because of an increase to the New Zealand Super. However, the grandparenting provision will be phased out over time until it is no longer needed.

Why has Government decided to increase the CSC income thresholds automatically in the future?

The annual adjustment to the income thresholds will ensure that the income thresholds reflect changes in the cost of living for all existing and potential cardholders and will ensure that no one loses their card as a result of the annual CPI adjustment to social welfare benefit rates. The automatic increase will provide certainty for low-income earners and those receiving the New Zealand Super that the CSC income thresholds will keep pace with inflation.
