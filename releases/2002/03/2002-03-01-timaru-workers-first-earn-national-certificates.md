Thirty-one team leaders and managers from Timaru have become the first people in New Zealand to attain the National Certificate in First Line Management at level 3, Aoraki MP Jim Sutton said today.

The 31 people, who work for Sanford Seafood Processing and New Zealand Light Leathers in Timaru, received their certificates at a special ceremony in Timaru today.

They are the first people to gain the National Certificate in First Line Management at level 3 on the National Qualifications framework.

Mr Sutton said the achievement was important, both for South Canterbury and for the whole nation.

“Management of both Sanford and Light Leathers have reported that the application of skills learnt during the training for this certificate has been rewarding for those individual managers, their staff, and for the companies involved.

“Such good value is this training, that both companies will have more staff doing this certificate this year. And many of those here today who have completed the certificate at level 3 are aiming to complete the certificate at the next level up.”

Mr Sutton said that by training staff who then applied their new skills at work, businesses were investing in their people and creating greater efficiencies.

“The Labour-Alliance Government is working hard to develop New Zealand as an innovative society. A key part of that involves us working to enable people to learn new skills and to apply them.”

He praised Sanford and Light Leathers, the two training organisations involved (New Zealand Seafood Industry Training Organisation and the Food and Engineering Industry training organisation Compentnz) and training provider Precision Training for their collaborative efforts.

“Most of all, I congratulate those here today who have achieved such a learning milestone. The rest of the country can learn from your experience.”
