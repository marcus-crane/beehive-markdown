Greater cooperation and collaboration in the tertiary sector will be the result of moves to improve credit transfer arrangements between tertiary providers, says Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

A discussion paper on credit recognition and transfer, Supporting Learning Pathways, has been sent to secondary and tertiary education providers for comment this week. Improving credit transfer arrangements - the process by which different tertiary education providers recognise learning undertaken with other providers - was a Labour manifesto commitment.

Steve Maharey said clear and agreed credit recognition and transfer strategies are an essential component of the tertiary education reforms.

"Building genuine opportunities for New Zealanders to participate in learning across their lifetimes is essential today's rapidly changing world. Regular retraining and refresher education is becoming the norm and it is essential that students get credit for the learning they have carried out in the past.

"All parties in the tertiary sector came together under the chairpersonship of Norman Kingsbury to produce Supporting Learning Pathways. Their proposed credit recognition and transfer regime grows out of the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications announced last year to bring order and clarity to the various qualifications offered in New Zealand.

"Supporting Learning Pathways focuses on the learner. It proposes principles, and strategies aimed at supporting the learner and their achievement pathways. It looks at quality assurance, information provision and technology.

"Once agreement has been reached, the credit recognition and credit transfer arrangements will be implemented by the relevant quality assurance bodies as part of their official approval, accreditation and quality assurance roles.

"I congratulate the Credit Transfer Working Party on the development of the strategies covered in the Supporting Learning Pathways document and encourage tertiary providers to read it and provide comment," said Steve Maharey.
