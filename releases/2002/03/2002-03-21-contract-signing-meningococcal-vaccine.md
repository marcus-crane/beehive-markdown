Health Minister Annette King will host the signing of a contract between the Ministry of Health and Chiron Corporation at 4.15pm on 21 March 2002 at the Grand Hall, Parliament.

The signing of this contract marks a significant step in the Government’s commitment to work alongside Chiron Corporation in the search for a vaccine to combat New Zealand's specific strain of meningococcal B disease.

Ms King will host a short function attended by the President of Chiron Vaccines, John Lambert, and a delegation from Chiron Corporation, the Director General of Health Dr Karen Poutasi, the Director of Public Health Dr Colin Tukuitonga, and the Director of the Meningococcal Vaccine Strategy Dr Jane O'Hallahan.
