Commerce Minister Paul Swain has welcomed the Securities Commission’s recommendations on amendments to the law relating to investment advisers.

“The recommendations highlight areas of the law that may need to be strengthened in order to provide the public with adequate protection from disreputable investment advisers,” Paul Swain said.

“The government recognises it is important to keep this area of law under review and believes the work done by the Commission raises important questions that need to be carefully considered.

“After reviewing the Commission’s recommendations I will be in a better position to comment on the actions the government intends to take in this area.

“I have asked officials to report back on the issues by the end of March.

“I have decided to publish the recommendations and have asked the Securities Commission to make them available,” Paul Swain said.

For a copy of the recommendations contact the Securities Commission phone (04) 472 9830 or fax (04) 472 8076 or visit the website www.sec-com.govt.nz.
