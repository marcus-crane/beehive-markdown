I see that my speech here in Christchurch has been entitled “Why Bother?”

Why bother with ‘sustainable retailing’? Why bother worrying about waste? Because waste is bad - it’s bad for our health, bad for the environment and bad for the economy. It costs. New Zealand has a waste problem, and it’s getting bigger and more expensive to deal with each year.

Every year 3.4 million tonnes of solid waste ends up in our landfills. That’s nearly a tonne a year for every man, woman and child living in New Zealand.

In just one month we could fill an entire rugby field with solid waste more than 30-storeys high. And that doesn’t include the huge amount of liquid and gaseous waste that we pour into our environment every day.

There are many other statistics that I could give you about the state of our environment, the decline in biodiversity, the pressure on our air quality, the decline in water quantity and quality. But you’ve probably heard these doom and gloom statistics before.

The question we should now be asking ourselves is a positive, hopeful one: what can we do about it? I will begin by telling you what I am doing about it as Minister for the Environment.

And today I am going to focus on our Waste Strategy. I have a number of projects on the move: NPS on Biodiversity, NES on dioxins/water purity/water allocation/ aquaculture reforms/genetic modification – but most do not involve us in our daily lives. Waste does – important behaviour changing.

THE NEW ZEALAND WASTE STRATEGY  
The Ministry for the Environment and Local Government New Zealand have worked in partnership to develop a vision and an action plan for reducing and improving the way we manage our waste.

I launched the New Zealand Waste Strategy last Friday, surrounded by over 40 babies. Why babies? Because they symbolise the future, and because in their lifetime they will potentially each produce ever-increasing quantities of waste unless we act now to reverse that trend.

Our generation is working towards a better understanding of how to meet our own needs without compromising those of future generations.

The Strategy symbolises a new beginning – It is aimed at a society that values its environment and wants to hand on its resources intact to its children and grandchildren.

The Strategy presents a new vision for managing and minimising waste. It sets out a practical programme of actions, and some far-reaching, longer-term commitments.

I want New Zealanders to be able to look back at 2002 as the year when we finally started to change the way we think about waste.

It was the year we stopped thinking of our land and air and water as dumping grounds and started to understand the importance of protecting these resources as a crucial life support system for generations to come.

Up to now our waste policies have tended to focus on “end of pipe” solutions, dealing with disposal rather than prevention. We have spent so much time dealing with the mess at the bottom of the cliff, that we have had little time to try to divert waste from being created at the top.

But we can no longer continue to just “dump it at the gate” or flush it away without any qualms.

Importantly, this Strategy sets out to solve the waste problem — rather than just transferring it. We can no longer just pay our rates and expect the problem to be solved by someone else.

The Strategy makes it quite clear that waste is our problem, it is everybody’s problem, and each of us has a responsibility to do something about it.

My own department must take a lead. The Ministry for the Environment conducted a Waste Audit on itself a few weeks ago and will produce its own Triple Bottom Line Report in 2002.

EDUCATION

As part of the Strategy, the Ministry for the Environment and Local Government New Zealand are working with councils and the private sector to develop a long-term education programme to help change the way we think about waste. It will be a “Hearts and Minds” programme that helps us all to understand the connections between our actions and our effects on the environment.

To start, the Ministry will be supporting a high profile Auckland Regional Council campaign to help Aucklanders think about the things they can do to protect the environment. If successful, the Ministry hopes an expanded version of this campaign can be extended to the rest of the country.

How does the Strategy affect you as retailers?

Some people may say ‘won’t this strategy simply be another burden on businesses already struggling to cope with increasing compliance costs? My answer is no, waste is clearly a cost to a business. If a business can reduce its waste materials, reduce the energy it uses and reduce the waste it has to pay to send to a landfill, then businesses will save money and the whole economy will benefit.

The strategy contains a number of targets that are applicable to you directly. One of these is that by 2005 at least 10 major businesses will be participating alongside central and local government in developing and promoting waste minimisation programmes within their sector.

One of those businesses could be yours and I challenge you to get involved in a programme that could see your image in the community change from that of Waste Producers to being Waste Reducers.

Another target is that by December 2005, multi-unit properties, like shopping malls will provide space for recycling. In an industry where productivity can be measured by turnover per linear metre of shelf space this is a significant measure.

Targets for Organic wastes will affect the supermarket groups as 95% of organic wastes, much of which is presently macerated and flushed to sewer, are diverted from waste streams and used beneficially. Maceration and domestic insinkerators are not the way. Why do we treat water to a standard good enough to drink, only then to use it to flush wastes down the sink and off to the sewage works through already often inadequate reticulation systems. An expensive plant is then used to digest the waste and create sewage sludge, which is then transported to the landfill and buried.

As retailers you will be interested to know that many consumers have asked why packaging has not been specifically targeted in strategy. Packaging is indeed a big part of our lives and it makes up about 13% of the waste stream.

Great strides have been taken in minimizing packaging waste over the years and I know that more can be done, but packaging is a wide and diverse waste stream, and the strategy has focused initially on large waste streams where immediate action can show results.

I will maintain pressure through the Packaging Council for this process to continue, and for the message to be sent overseas to those who supply excessively packaged products to our country.

Retailers are a critical link in the chain that moves goods to customers and you have a big part to play in helping people to manage their own waste. One of the bigger issues for us to tackle is whether retailers should accept some responsibility for the environmental effects of goods beyond the point of sale.

The concept of ‘extended producer responsibility’ encourages producers and importers to consider the entire lifecycle of their products and encourages businesses to prevent wastes at the source. We will be looking at ‘extended producer responsibility’ by establishing voluntary pilot schemes this year and next. In 2004 we will be looking at whether the costs and benefits of EPR warrant statutory backing.

SUSTAINABILITY – We all have a part to play

The vision of sustainability is a call to rethink our way of doing business. We need to reconsider the design of products to ensure waste reduction. We need to think of sustainability in the creative phase of design. And we need to consider ways in which we can prevent producing waste in the first place.

By taking a preventive approach, the Waste Strategy also recognises the important role that every New Zealander has to play in solving our waste problem.

Waste is not someone else’s problem, it is a problem for all of us and every one of us has a part to play in putting it right.

Until we all recognise the part we have to play in both the problem and the solution, we will continue to needlessly waste resources and money, and further damage our environment.

I dearly hope that in the future, we will all be able to look back at the launch of New Zealand Waste Strategy as the time when New Zealanders were able to transform their positive feelings about the environment into real, everyday actions.

Although New Zealand has made some progress in re-using waste products, the fact that there’s so much waste to re-use is a sign we’re not using our resources as efficiently as we could be.

Some of you here are already making a difference in this respect. You will be hearing from Alan Knight OBE, who will no doubt explain why he bothers at B&Q to run a sustainable business. I am looking forward to learning about how B&Q, with their chain of over 300 stores has made a contribution to sustainability.

You will also be hearing from Councillor Denis O’Rourke, who will, I am sure, explain why he bothers in his description of the great strides that have been made over the last five years by Sarah Gordon and the team from the Recovered Materials Foundation.

You will also hear from Richard Morley-Hall of the Warehouse to talk about why the Warehouse bothers.

Today’s event has been inspired by The Warehouse and the Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand and I thank you for taking this step forward and encouraging retailers into action toward a sustainable retailing.

CONCLUSION  
So why bother worrying about waste and sustainable retailing?

Because it is good for our health, good for our environment and good for our economy.

What are we doing about it?

Central and local government has produced the waste strategy and are working on its implementation and education to ensure its success. We are starting on the road to a sustainable New Zealand.

What can you do about it?

You can take responsibility for your own waste. You can learn from the speakers here today. And by running an environmentally sustainable business, you can help to ensure that by the time the babies at the waste launch are adults, we will be well down the winding road to a sustainable New Zealand.
