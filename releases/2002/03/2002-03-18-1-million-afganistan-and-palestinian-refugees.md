Aid Minister Matt Robson announced today that New Zealand would provide $1 million for rehabilitation assistance in Afghanistan, and to the emergency appeal recently launched by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).

"The people of Afghanistan still require the world's help. New Zeland has pledged to remain engaged and to work with other countries to help rebuild Afghanistan. This further assistance demonstrates our committment", says Mr Robson.

New Zealand will contribute $600,000 towards rehabilitation and construction assistance for Afghanistan. Of this amount $400,000 will be directed towards projects identified in the United Nations Immediate and Transitional Assistance Programme for the Afghan People 2002 (ITAP).

Areas where the New Zealand contribution may assist include: primary education, basic health services and de-mining.

We acknowledge their engagement in humanitarian and rehabilitation activities, by announcing that a further $200,000 will be made available for New Zealand NGO's to continue their work in Afghanistan", says Matt Robson.
