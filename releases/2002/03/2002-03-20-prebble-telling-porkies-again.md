ACT Leader, Richard Prebble can’t seem to stop telling lies. His blatantly inaccurate use of statistics and misstatements of fact undermine his party’s credibility, Justice Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Last month, ACT Leader, Richard Prebble, claimed that the people of Hamilton suffered from a higher rate of violent crime than New York. After we pointed out his “mistake” he admitted to the Waikato Times he was wrong.

“At his party conference on the weekend, though, he was at it again claiming people are more likely to be the victim of a violent crime, of a robbery, a rape, or a grievous assault in New Zealand than in America.

“Once again he was wrong and he can’t blame it on a mistake. He was lying. He knows that US FBI statistical categories do not compare to New Zealand Police categories.

“The NZ Police ‘Violent Offences’ category includes a wide range of serious and lesser violent offences and does not include rape. The FBI ‘Violent Crime’ category he used for New York includes only 4 categories of the most serious offences including rape.

”New Zealand crime rates for serious violent offences are nowhere near the rate the US experiences.

“In any case, the US violent crime rate is at least 300% higher than New Zealand’s. New Zealanders are clearly safer walking the streets of New Zealand then they are walking the average street in the US. Mr Prebble knows this and should stop his lying and scaremongering.

“Mr Prebble damages the credibility of himself and his party in making wildly inaccurate statements in an apparently desperate bid to use fear to try to improve his flagging ratings in the polls,” Mr Goff said.

Violent Crime Rates (per 100,000 population)New Zealand 2000/01 year versus USA 2000 year.

Murder and non-negligent manslaughter1.7,5.5  
Robbery43.8,144.9  
Forcible rape12.5,32  
Aggravated Assault 103.2,323.6  
Total violent crime161,506.1

It must be noted that the difference in time period and differences in definitions and reporting procedures between jurisdictions mean that these figures are not completely comparable either. However, they are much more comparable than Mr Prebble’s statistics.
