Manurewa MP George Hawkins has been confirmed as Labour’s candidate to stand in the Manurewa electorate at the next election later this year.

At a confirmation meeting, held over the weekend, George Hawkins won unanimous endorsement for the Manurewa Labour Electorate Committee (LEC).

“I am delighted to receive the endorsement of the Manurewa LEC. This year I will be campaigning very hard to keep Manurewa in the Labour camp. I also want to ensure that Labour wins the highest possible party vote in this electorate.

“I don’t take anything for granted and we will run a vigorous campaign for the re-election of a Labour-led government led by Helen Clark,” George Hawkins said.
