Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs today denounced Winston Peters’ self-styled crusade against the ‘Wellington problem’, saying it did his party no credit to seek to advance itself by attacking public servants.

The Evening Post reported today that Mr Peters has declared war on Wellington’s public servants.

Marian Hobbs said that Mr Peters’ attacks were illogical and an unwarranted smear on the entire public service.

“Representing the electorate in which most civil servants work, I know more than most MPs just how dedicated New Zealand’s public service are to serving their community with integrity.

“As a Cabinet Minister I see public servants working very hard day-after-day to implement the policies of the Labour-Alliance government.

“Quite frankly Winston Peters’ comments lack integrity and make me question his real motivation. As a former Minister he will know that faithfully serving the government of the day, and delivering essential services to New Zealanders, requires dedication, professionalism and real commitment.

“The government I am proud to be a member of has asked a lot of the public service. We are trying to restore the balance in New Zealand society after more than a decade of widening social and economic gaps.

“The demands on the public service to adopt a fresh approach and to deliver new programmes have been very large. It’s simply not acceptable to attack those who can’t defend themselves.

“Mr Peters knows that public servants serve the government whatever its political persuasion. It is not the public servants that determine the policy, it is the politicians. To attack those who can not respond is not something to be proud of.” Marian Hobbs said.
