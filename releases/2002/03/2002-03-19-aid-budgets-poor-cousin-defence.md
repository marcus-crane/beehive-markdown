19 March 2002 Media Statement

“The richest countries release only a trickle of aid to poor countries while spending trillions on armaments, including nuclear weapons,” says Minister responsible for International Development Matt Robson.

Matt Robson was speaking from Mexico where he is attending the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development. Most of the world’s leaders are attending.

“Not only that, wealthy countries often profit from the arms trade with the very countries which receive their aid.”

“Yet the absence of civil conflict and violence is vital if we are to have any hope of reducing poverty and creating good economies in countries like Afghanistan.

“We have proved that we can have an international coalition to fight terrorism. Now we must prove that the same coalition can fight poverty. To do that, the right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing.

“There is no point in giving aid with one hand and selling armaments and weaponry with the other.

“Donor countries – and New Zealand is no exception – need to re-examine their comparative levels of defence and aid spending.

“We must resist the pressure to return to the days of the nuclear umbrella. Stability will come through an increase in development and poverty reduction, not an increase in military spending.

New Zealand has a ratio of defence to aid expenditure of 6.2 to 1 – higher than the OECD average.

“If all developed countries re-directed 1% of their defence budgets into aid, we could lift millions out of poverty. With a 4% reduction poverty could be eliminated and with it the greatest source of terrorism,” says Matt Robson.
