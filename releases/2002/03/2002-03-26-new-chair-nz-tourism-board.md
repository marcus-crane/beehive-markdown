A new chair has been appointed for the New Zealand Tourism Board, Tourism Minister Mark Burton announced today.

The current Deputy Chair, Wally Stone, will take up a three-year appointment next month. He succeeds the retiring Chair Peter Allport, who has completed his three year term. The changeover will take place at the next Board meeting, scheduled for April 30th.

"Wally Stone is Managing Director of Whale Watch Kaikoura, an award winning company that has developed from humble beginnings in 1988 into one of New Zealand’s leading attractions," Mark Burton said. "He has served on the New Zealand Tourism Board since 1999 and was a member of the tourism sector steering group that put together the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

"I am sure Wally will continue to display outstanding leadership in his new position," Mark Burton said.

Mark Burton said that Peter Allport has made an extremely important contribution during his term as chair.

"His appointment in 1998 came at a particularly challenging time for the New Zealand Tourism Board. Under his stewardship Tourism New Zealand has been placed on a sound footing and has made significant progress. The Board has developed and consolidated the 100% Pure New Zealand marketing campaign, which has been well received by the industry and overseas markets alike. Peter's leadership was also important in the tourism industry's positive response to the challenges posed by the events of 11 September 2001.

"I am greatly appreciative of Peter's contribution during his three year term as Chair of the New Zealand Tourism Board and I am sure Wally will carry on the good work," Mark Burton said.
