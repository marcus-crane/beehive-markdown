Minister responsible for Community and Voluntary Sector, Steve Maharey, is encouraging MPs from all over the country to take on volunteer duties, or spend time talking to voluntary groups, as part of Volunteer Awareness Week.

Steve Maharey said that more than 50 MPs took part in Volunteer Awareness Week last year in recognition of International Year of Volunteers.

“I am keen to see the momentum from the International Year of Volunteers continue.

"The idea is for MPs to either spend time helping out in their community, or recognise the contribution of volunteers within their community in some other way. I will be hosting a meeting with a number of volunteers in my community to discuss issues affecting them.

“The goal is to raise awareness of the enormous contribution volunteers make to our society and to encourage more people to take up volunteering.

"Not only will this give MPs a greater appreciation of the wonderful work carried out by volunteers, but it is also hoped we will encourage more New Zealanders to become involved in volunteering."

Steve Maharey said the Government is also funding a national volunteering conference to be held in Christchurch on 21-23 March (details at www.volunteeringnz.org.nz) and is putting money into growing the national network of volunteer centres.

Volunteer Awareness week runs from March 11 to 17.
