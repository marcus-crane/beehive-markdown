Whiteware buyers will be able to compare energy costs between appliances easily when new energy efficiency regulations take effect on April 1.

The regulations under the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 make energy rating labels mandatory for most major domestic whiteware items on retail.

The labelling uses an easy-to-recognise ‘star rating’ on a scale of one to six. Models with the least energy efficiency will receive a one star rating, while the best performing models currently on the market generally rate between three and four stars. The scale allows room for improvements in technology.

The labels also highlight the approximate annual energy consumption of an appliance, based on standard usage. This allows consumers to see the approximate annual running costs and total energy costs over the appliance’s lifetime - costs that are currently difficult to determine.

Domestic refrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, dishwashers, air conditioners and heat pumps will have to be labelled under the new regulations.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) is managing and monitoring the introduction of the regulations and their application under joint New Zealand and Australian Standards.

“The value of this scheme for consumers is that more stars means more savings,” said Energy Minister Pete Hodgson. “Consumers can make more informed buying decisions based on the total cost of an appliance over its lifetime and the total benefits it offers.”

Mr Hodgson said increased consumer awareness of the cost savings of energy efficient appliances was expected to increase demand for better performing models.

“This labelling regime is part of a national strategy to make New Zealand’s use of all forms of energy more efficient. Using less electricity will help delay the need for expensive new power stations and will help protect the environment by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.”
