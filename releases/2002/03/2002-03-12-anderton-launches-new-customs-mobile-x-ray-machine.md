The new Customs mobile x-ray machine which stands at 1.65 m will be put through its paces by Acting Minister of Customs Jim Anderton today as he screens express cargo.

“This will help the Customs Service deal with increasing challenges such as organised terrorism, drug rings, and wildlife smuggling,” said Jim Anderton at the DHL warehouse in Auckland.

Jim Anderton said the new machine, a Heimann Hi Scan 9075, gives Customs greater ability to screen packages and personal baggage at different locations such as warehouses and wharves.

Previously, Customs had to transport suspicious cargo to a central location such as an airport to use fixed equipment.

“This will provide greater flexibility, and increase the service’s capability to detect and prevent narcotics and goods such as firearms, and weapons components from crossing our borders. With the threat of terrorism and the increasing risk of smuggling of NZ wildlife the unit should be kept very busy,” says Jim Anderton.

“We are pleased to be able to use the new mobile x-ray machine to efficiently screen suspicious packages, with less delay to legitimate shipments,” says Allen Bruford, NZ Customs National Manager.

The unit will initially be used to inspect air and sea cargo, and the baggage of cruise passengers.

DHL Worldwide Express offered its $8 million airside facility at Auckland International Airport as the venue for the launch.

“We were more than happy to be able to show our state-of-the-art facility to Mr Anderton” said DHL’s general manager in New Zealand, Phil Rountree.

“This airside facility, opened in June last year, is an investment in the New Zealand economy and in particular those businesses which power the New Zealand economy.”

DHL is about to become a partner in NZ Customs’ business partnership programme, FrontLine, which provides a framework for partnerships between Customs and individual businesses to detect prohibited goods and illegal activity, facilitate the movement of legitimate goods, and promote community development through International trade.
