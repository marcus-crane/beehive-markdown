Crime statistics for the 2001 calendar year are largely good news, with crime down, resolutions up and burglary at a 20-year low, Police Minister George Hawkins said today.

"Recorded crime dropped, and the resolution rate for all crime increased to 42 percent.

"The downward trend in burglaries continued last year. Since becoming government, we have driven burglaries down to 60,345 recorded offences per year. Things have certainly changed for the better since burglaries hit a high of 96,322 per year in the 1990s, under the National government. (A drop of over 37 percent)

"In 2001 there were over 6000 fewer burglaries than in the year 2000 - that is 119 fewer burglaries every week.

"Burglary is a significant crime, because it is a known entry point to serious crime. This government is committed to cracking down on burglary, and the police are working hard to get results.

"Other good news includes a two percent drop in dishonesty crimes overall (burglary, car conversion, theft, receiving and fraud), and a six percent decrease in the number of sexual offences.

Mr Hawkins voiced his concern at the increase in violent crime shown in the latest statistics.

"Any increase in violence is concerning and unacceptable. However, it is important to look at what sort of violence accounts for this increase. It is not the more serious violent crimes like homicide and robbery (which actually decreased in 2001). The increase in violence is accounted for by more recorded "street disorder" type crimes, like assault, intimidation and threats. In recent years the police have become less tolerant of street disorder, which may partly explain this increase.

"The police are keeping pace, resolving an impressive 77 percent of all violence last year. But as a community we must all refuse to tolerate violence - in homes, or on the streets. The police are just one part of the solution.

"Overall, the police are doing a great job and I congratulate them on keeping crime in check, said Mr Hawkins.
