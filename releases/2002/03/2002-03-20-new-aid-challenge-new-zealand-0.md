“New Zealand will give close attention to increasing its aid budget from 0.24% of GNP where it stands today.

“The target of 0.7% was called for in Mexico today,” says Minister in charge of aid, Matt Robson.

Matt Robson was speaking to the United Nation’s Financing for Development Conference in Mexico where each developed country was challenged to meet the new target.

“The aim is to look at increasing our aid budget in incremental stages in conjunction with other Western countries,” he says.

“However I will need to discuss the nuts and bolts of how we get to 0.7% and in how many stages, with my cabinet collegues so that realistic goals are set.”

The European Union has already set its first incremental target of 0.39% by 2006.

“New Zealand is some way from achieving this. We presently sit on 0.24% - just on the OECD average.

Aid levels have dropped over the last ten years while development needs have grown.

Matt Robson in turn has challenged the richest countries to consider dropping their military budgets by 1%.

“If all developed countried re-directed 1% of their defence budgets into aid, we could lift millions out of poverty. With a 4% reduction, poverty could be eliminated and with it the greatest source of terrorism.

“No-one wants to see an expensive and devestating escalation of weapon of mass destruction, whether nulcear, biological or chemical. That money for those terrible wepons should be spent on meeting the basic needs of the poorest people in the world,” says Matt Robson.
