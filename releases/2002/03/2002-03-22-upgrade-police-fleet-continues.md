Police Minister George Hawkins highlighted government spending on the police vehicle fleet, at the handover of ten new Police vehicles in Manukau.

“When this government took office, the police fleet was in a state of disrepair. Vehicles were aging and had too many kilometres on the clock, due to underspending on the replacement programme. Many police districts had been forced to rely on their communities, to provide sponsored vehicles.

“Police need the right tools to get the job done, and we recognise that the vehicle fleet must be properly funded by government. So far we have invested over $40 million to get the vehicle replacement programme going again, which equates to over 1000 extra vehicles for police on the beat.

Mr Hawkins said projected spending on the police vehicle fleet is set at $15 million per year for the foreseeable future.

The vehicles handed over today were:

> Traffic  
> 1 x Station Wagon for the Bay of Plenty  
> 2 x Utilities for Auckland Motorways
> 
> Rural Stations/Search & Rescue  
> 1 x 4x4 for Oxford (Canterbury)  
> 1 x 4x4 for New Plymouth

> Urban General Duties  
> 1 x Station Wagon for Auckland  
> 1 x 2WD Utility for Wellington
