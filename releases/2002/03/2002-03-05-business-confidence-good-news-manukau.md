A big increase in business confidence, reported in the latest National Bank’s business survey, is excellent news for Manukau City residents, says Manurewa MP George Hawkins.

According to the survey a net 16 percent of firms expect general conditions to improve over the coming year, a big improvement from December last year.

“Businesses are confident about the economic outlook, which is not surprising given other good news recently. Unemployment and interest rates are hovering at low levels and the domestic economy has been humming along nicely.

“What is particularly exciting for me is the good economic conditions that we are enjoying in Manukau City.

“Residential construction, manufacturing and an improving retail sector are contributing to employment and economic growth. This is likely to continue following increased migration flows fuelling demand for housing in Manukau City.

“Annually the Manukau economy contributes around $8.5 billion to the New Zealand economy – around eight percent of GDP. Under this government the economy in Manukau City continues to grow steadily.

“I am pleased that business confidence continues to improve. This is important and will help fuel economic activity and employment growth locally,” George Hawkins said.
