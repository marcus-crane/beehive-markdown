Section 8(4) of the Act provides that, in exercising its jurisdiction under Part VI of the Broadcasting Act 1989, the Commission comprises, in addition to its permanent members:

Two persons (not being public servants directly connected with the administration of this Act or the Broadcasting Act 1989 or members of the House of Representatives), who shall be appointed by the Governor-General on the nomination of the House of Representatives, as members of the Electoral Commission, one of those members to represent the Government and one to represent Opposition parties.

Members are required for regular monthly meetings which usually last for half-a-day and are held in Wellington. It is likely a two-day meeting will be called in June or July to hear parties’ submissions. Other meetings are held as and when required.
