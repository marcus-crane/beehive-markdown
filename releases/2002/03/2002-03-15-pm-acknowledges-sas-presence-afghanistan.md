Prime Minister Helen Clark today formally acknowledged the presence of members of the SAS in Afghanistan.

Helen Clark said that as the SAS was working alongside the forces of other nations, news of their presence was already in the public arena.

“The government’s reluctance to confirm the presence of members of the SAS in Afghanistan has been based on a desire to minimise the risk to those serving overseas and to their families left behind.

“The government will continue to observe a policy of refusing comment on the specific location or mission of SAS members,” Helen Clark said.
