Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey is backing a new publication calling for better school-to-work partnerships.

Steve Maharey launched Business and Schools in Manukau this afternoon, published by the City of Manukau Education Trust (COMET). The publication reports a study commissioned from the University of Auckland showing very few of the 121 schools in the city have links with the business community and the world of work.

Steve Maharey said far too many young New Zealanders have trouble making the transition from school to post-school learning and the workforce.

“The days of leaving school and walking straight into an entry-level job are long over. Today young people need greater literacy and numeracy skills than ever before and they need a good understanding of the demands of the 21st century workforce.

“Better and more formalised connections between schools and businesses are essential if we are to successfully bridge the gap.

“School-business partnerships must have real substance if pupils are to get the real benefits that they can deliver. It’s also vital that schools work with industry training organisations and tertiary institutions to ensure that what they teach will count toward post-school qualifications.

“As the research on Manukau schools reveals there are many different kinds of partnership approaches. The Labour-Alliance government through its Modern Apprenticeships and Gateway programmes have added further options schools can choose.

“What is vital is that many more strong, formalised relationships between schools and local businesses are developed so that young school leavers get the best possible start in the workforce we can give them,” Steve Maharey said.
