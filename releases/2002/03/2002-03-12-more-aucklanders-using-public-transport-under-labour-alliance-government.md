Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard is delighted with the latest figures on public transport patronage from the Auckland Regional Council.

“More and more people are using public transport to get around Auckland. This confirms that working towards an integrated transport solution for Auckland is the right approach,” says the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister with Auckland Issues.

Aucklanders took 1.4 million extra journeys on public transport in the Auckland region between July 1 and December 31, 2001.

“That is a seven percent rise over the same six month period in 2000,” says Judith Tizard, also Associate Minister of Transport. “And that’s on top of a 7.6 percent increase in 2000-2001 and a seven percent increase in 1999-2000.

“Since this government kept its promise to help find solutions to ease Auckland’s congestion, public transport patronage has risen consistently, with the largest increases in fifty years.

“Government-led changes to the way passenger transport has been funded means the Auckland region is benefiting from increased convenience for public transport users and easing of traffic congestion.”

In November 2000, Transfund New Zealand, the government’s transport funding agency, introduced a new approach to public transport funding. Under Transfund’s Patronage Funding Scheme, the more passengers carried in a region, the greater the funding from Transfund.

A ‘Kick-start’ initiative was also introduced to help regional councils establish, as quickly as possible, new services and infrastructure improvements that will help grow patronage.

Late last month the government announced the Moving Forward transport package, which will provide more funding for roads, public transport, transport alternatives such as walking and cycling, and road safety. Patronage funding has been allocated another $36 million on top of $70 million already allocated this year.

“The transport package also gives the Auckland region more flexibility in planning transport solutions,” says Judith Tizard.

Last week Transfund announced ‘Kick-start’ funding for substantial bus service improvements on routes between Auckland and Waitakere cities, which are expected to significantly further reduce traffic congestion in shopping areas and major corridors, particularly at peak times.

“I’m delighted that the government’s patronage funding scheme is helping the Auckland Regional Council achieve such excellent results,” says Judith Tizard.

“The ARC has taken up the opportunities that the increased funding provides and the public is enjoying the benefits of a wide range of new and improved services.

“The Council’s Rideline service is in high demand. The Rideline call centre is handling more enquiries than ever before, and the Rideline website is also in high demand, which shows Aucklanders are willing and able to get quality information about their passenger transport system.

“Public transport is not only beneficial to the environment and for Aucklanders who need it to get around the region; it is also a more efficient use of our roading system.

“We have built up an excellent relationship between central and local government and the transport agencies, as well as providing a transport advocate for Auckland. The Labour-Alliance government believes strong partnerships are the key to achieving progress for New Zealand.”
