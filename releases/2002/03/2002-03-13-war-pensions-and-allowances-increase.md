All war pensions and associated allowance payments available to assist veterans will increase from April 1st, as part of the annual cost of living adjustment, Minister of Veterans' Affairs Mark Burton said today.

"The increase of 1.82 percent in the net rates equates to the increase in the cost of living for the year to December 2001, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)," Mark Burton said.

Examples of the increases in the weekly rates are:

·For a veteran on a 100% War Disablement Pension the increase is $2.78 to $155.53.  
·For a veteran on a 160% War Disablement Pension the increase is $4.45 to $248.85.  
·For a person receiving a Surviving Spouse's Pension the increase is $2.05 to $114.73.  
·The Attendant's Allowance increases $5.15 to $288.06.

Other allowances to be adjusted in line with increase in the Consumer Price Index include the Clothing Allowance, Travel Allowance and Funeral Grants.
