8 March 2002Media Statement  
Cullen on Air New Zealand result

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the Air New Zealand half year result was broadly in line with expectations.

“The government insisted as a condition of last year’s rescue package that the company develop a credible plan to return to financial health.

“That strategy is still only in the very early stages of implementation and will take a little while to deliver results,” Dr Cullen said.
