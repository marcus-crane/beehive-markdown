Associate Minister of Labour and Alliance Industrial Relations Spokesperson Laila Harré has called for ultra-liberals to put an end “once and for all” to attempts to liberalise shop trading hours after the resounding defeat of Rodney Hide’s Shop Trading Hours bill last night.

“This is the third time in the last few years that Parliament has voted against shops opening on all or one of Christmas Day, Good Friday and Easter Sunday. My message to Rodney Hide and his fellow ultra-liberalists is that it’s time to put this issue to bed, time to stop flogging a dead horse”, said Ms Harré.

Hide’s bill called for shops to open on Christmas Day (defeated 100-18), Good Friday (defeated 97-22) and Easter Sunday (defeated 70-47).

Laila Harré and the Alliance have consistently opposed liberalisation of shop trading hours.

“Our opposition to liberalisation is not limited to concerns about the impact on workers’ and retailers’ choice. It is also, and fundamentally, about the intrinsic value of Christmas day, Easter Friday, Easter Sunday and ANZAC day as days for non-work, non-commercial, community, family, cultural and religious activities.

“I am very pleased that a huge majority in parliament has endorsed this position in throwing Hide’s bill out, “said Ms Harré.
