Manurewa MP George Hawkins is delighted that 18 early childhood services in his electorate will receive extra funding with the introduction of equity funding for the early childhood education sector.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard revealed plans this week of how this key government policy will be implemented.

George Hawkins said equity funding is a further step in the government’s commitment to achieve across-the-board improvements to the education of young children.

“This extra funding will allow centres to operate on a more level playing field. We know that quality early childhood education improves a child’s chance of succeeding in life. This new system has the potential to make significant differences within many centres,” Mr Hawkins said.

“In Manurewa, centres will benefit from $205,351.35 in total. These include: Alfriston Road Kindergarten, Clendon Community Childcare Centre, Finlayson Park Kindergarten, Leabank Kindergarten, Redoubt North Kindergarten and Roscommon Kindergarten.

“I’m confident that these centres will use the extra funding to give their children a better foundation for life-long learning,” Mr Hawkins said.

The first payments are going out to centres this week. The equity system will deliver an extra $8 million a year, nationwide, to eligible community-based services.

“In this case, the Government is directing most of the additional money to early childhood education services in lower socio-economic communities,” Mr Hawkins said.

2002 is a transition year for the introduction of the equity funding initiative. The first payments will be smaller than those which services will receive once the initiative is fully implemented in November 2002. The initial allocation in March will benefit 1121 services, with further services coming on board when actual equity indices are determined later in the year.

Equity funding is available to licensed and chartered, community based early childhood education services:

·In low socio-economic communities;  
·In isolated areas;  
·Which are based on a language and culture other than English;  
·Which have significant numbers of children with special education needs.

George Hawkins said that the additional funding means eligible early childhood services will work more effectively with children who have learning and behavioural difficulties or who are from non-English speaking backgrounds.

“Centres to use the extra funding for things like additional curriculum resources, Improved staff:child ratios, professional development for staff and education for families, and meeting children’s nutritional needs,” Mr Hawkins said.
