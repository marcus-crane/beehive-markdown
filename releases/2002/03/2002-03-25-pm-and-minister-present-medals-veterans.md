Prime Minister Helen Clark and Veterans' Affairs Minister Mark Burton will today present medals to veterans for service in five separate operations between 1946 and 1994, which have not previously received New Zealand medallic recognition.

Last year, Helen Clark and Mark Burton announced a range of measures to improve medallic recognition for those who had served New Zealand in military operations since World War Two. A new Operational Service Medal is available to an estimated 50,000 service personnel, and a range of new and existing medals are being awarded to recognise specific operations for which no recognition has previously been forthcoming.

Helen Clark and Mark Burton will today present medals to naval veterans who served during the occupation of Japan 1946-49, at Suez in 1956 and off Malaysia in the 1960s; to New Zealanders who served during the Vietnam War; and to Air Force veterans of peacekeeping service in Rwanda in 1994.

"The reaction to the government’s medals initiatives has been overwhelmingly positive," Helen Clark said. "A medal provides tangible recognition and appreciation of a person's service to this country. Sadly, this has not always been forthcoming in the past."

Mark Burton said that most of the issues relating to recognition for operational service have now been settled.

"In many of these cases, veterans have waited decades to receive the proper recognition for their service from the government and people of New Zealand. It has been a great privilege to meet and hear from veterans who at long last are able to wear a visible token of recognition and appreciation for their service."

10 veterans are receiving medals today (1.15pm) at Parliament's Grand Hall. They include David Cox, President of the Royal New Zealand Returned Services’ Association, who served on HMNZS Achilles in Japan in 1945-46. A brother and sister who both served in Vietnam are also recognised today. Mr Chris Turver served in Vietnam as a war correspondent in 1965 and his sister, Ms Deanne Hamilton, served as a nurse in Vietnam with the New Zealand surgical team in 1967-68 and again with a Save the Children Fund team in 1970-71.

Notes on Medals/Recipients

New Zealand Service Medal 1946-49

The New Zealand Service Medal 1946-49 recognises service during the post-war occupation of Japan. Eligibility has now been extended to those who served on HMNZ Ships Gambia and Achilles during the early stages of the occupation.

Recipients:  
Mr Montague Hirtzel (Gambia)  
Mr David Cox, RNZRSA President (Achilles)

New Zealand General Service Medal “Near East”

A new award recognises those who served on HMNZS Royalist during the 1956 Suez campaign. Royalist was present during the early stages of the British invasion of Egypt, but was withdrawn at the request of New Zealand. Although the New Zealand personnel were eligible for the Naval General Service Medal “Near East”, this was not accepted by New Zealand, as the government had not authorised participation in the operation. Although valid, this decision overlooked the primary reason for awarding medals – to recognise the service in question. Veterans of this service have long argued that their service should be recognised.

Recipients:  
Mr Albert Carpenter (Royalist)  
Mr Walter Inglis (Royalist)

General Service Medal “Malay Peninsula”

Service during the confrontation with Indonesia during the 1960s was recognised by the General Service Medal with the clasps “Borneo” or “Malay Peninsula”. An overly restrictive interpretation of the qualifying criteria meant that many New Zealand personnel; were not recognised. A new interpretation has resulted in eligibility for the GSM “Malay Peninsula” being extended to those who served in Malaysian waters on HMNZS Royalist in 1965 or HMNZS Otago in 1965.

Recipients:  
James Blackburn, (President, HMNZS Otago Association)  
Commander Robert Adams (Royalist)

New Zealand General Service Medal “Vietnam”

A range of service, both military and civilian, in Vietnam was excluded from recognition by the Vietnam Medal. This New Zealand General Service Medal with the clasp “Vietnam” will now recognise, among other things, some short-term military service, and a range of humanitarian assistance.

Recipients:  
Mr Chris Turver (NZPA correspondent 1965)  
Ms Deanne Hamilton (Nurse, NZ Surgical Team 1967-68)

New Zealand General Service Medal “Rwanda”

Service with the RNZAF detachment that delivered relief supplies in Rwanda in 1994 will now be recognised by the award of the New Zealand General Service Medal with the clasp “Rwanda”. New Zealand contributed a Hercules aircraft to the UNHCR relief effort following the genocide in Rwanda.

Recipients:  
Flight Lieutenant Blair Houlihan  
Sergeant Lesley Mayer
