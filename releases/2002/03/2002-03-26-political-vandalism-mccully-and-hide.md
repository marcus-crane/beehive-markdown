Murray McCully and Rodney Hide are getting desperate in their unrelenting attacks on New Zealand Post, State Owned Enterprises Minister Mark Burton said.

"The anonymous document tabled today offers nothing new," Mark Burton said. "Allegations contained in it have been made before.

"It must be remembered that it was the New Zealand Post Board that instigated the PricewaterhouseCoopers investigation into Transend. It was New Zealand Post that established an at-arms-length process that gave all employees the opportunity to make anonymous allegations. And it was New Zealand Post that publicly released the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and has acted to remedy the procedural deficiencies it identified.

"This was a thorough and independently conducted process.

"Murray McCully and his self-stated "good friend" Rodney Hide are engaging in political vandalism of the worst sort," Mark Burton said. "These two MPs are happy to destroy the value of a taxpayer-owned company through the use of innuendo, unsigned and unattributed statements, half-truths and personally-motivated witchhunts.

"As I have repeatedly stated to Messers McCully and Hide, if they have any evidence of wrong-doing, they should make it available to me.

"And rather than responding to Mr McCully's unsavoury plea for confidential company information, any New Zealand Post employee who holds a genuine concern should make use of the legal protection offered by the Protected Disclosures Act.

"That is the proper course of action," Mark Burton said.

For months now mccully.co and his good friend Rodney Hide have been the recipients of a positive avalanche of correspondence from within NZ Post. And the ongoing Committee inquiry provides a real opportunity for public-spirited employees within Post to ensure that the truth is finally exposed. Remember, fax 04 473 3856.
