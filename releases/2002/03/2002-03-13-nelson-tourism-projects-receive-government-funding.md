Tourism Minister Mark Burton today presented cheques to support two of Nelson's most exciting tourism projects.

The World of Wearable Art received $20,000 and the Wakefield Quay Promenade project $30,000. The funding comes from the Minister's Tourism Facilities Development Grants Programme.

"I am delighted to support these two outstanding developments," Mark Burton said.

"The new permanent home for Wearable Art is a cultural showcase and a nationally significant tourism facility. The new funding support will be used to develop the curation department, which will house the permanent collection.

"The annual Wearable Art show is already a tourism icon and Nelson's premier annual visitor event. The WOW visitor complex expands a four-day event into a year round visitor attraction. And tours through the backstage wardrobe department will add real value to the WOW experience."

Mark Burton also presented a cheque to the Nelson 2000 Trust, which is developing the Wakefield Quay area.

"This project will provide public amenities of considerable benefit to locals and visitors alike," Mark Burton said.

"The grant of $30,000 from the Tourism Facilities Development Grants Programme will be used to fund the wharf development, from which tourism boats and harbour tours will operate.

"There has been excellent community support as the trust endeavours to raise the $3 million needed to complete a comprehensive project which will give Nelson a waterfront area to be proud of.

"The government funding being provided to these two Nelson projects illustrates our determination to support worthy projects which come from and continue to have the strong backing of local communities," Mark Burton said.
