Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Pete Hodgson departs New Zealand for Los Angeles tonight to promote New Zealand as a film-making destination.

Mr Hodgson will speak to film industry executives and others at a “Celebration of New Zealand Film-Making” hosted by the New Zealand Consul-General in Los Angeles on Friday night \[Los Angeles time].

The event, supported by Investment New Zealand, the Consulate-General and Trade New Zealand, is one of the Government’s initiatives to maximise the benefits for New Zealand from the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

Entertainment will be provided by Neil Finn and participants will include Peter Jackson, Sir Ian McKellen and other Lord of the Rings stars.

Mr Hodgson returns to New Zealand on Monday morning.
