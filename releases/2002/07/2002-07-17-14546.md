Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today announced what is likely to be the last round of enterprise awards before the election on the same day as he has announced 200-400 new jobs at Jack Links a new Mangere factory.

“These 30 enterprise awards show again the success of the Enterprise Awards Scheme in supporting and encouraging small businesses with good ideas.

“In the last two years Industry NZ has allocated 552 awards totalling $5 million and I have visited many of these award winners, meeting innovative and entrepreneurial kiwis doing what they do best,” said Jim Anderton.

The 30 Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards in this round amount to $290,000.

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Jack Links also announced by Jim Andertoin today is a joint venture between New Zealander John Corner and American beef jerky company Jack Link’s will result in 400 new jobs over the next two years.

“Instead of sending raw, low-value commodites overseas, this plant uses advanced technology to create a high-value export product.

“Not only does this mean added value in the global marketplace—it also means sustainable, long-term, skilled jobs for New Zealanders,” said Jim Anderton.
