Work began today on the long awaited $2million Kapiti police station with the onsite turning of the first piece of earth by Police Minister George Hawkins.

The new complex will be built alongside the current rundown station on the corner of Rimu and Kapiti Roads in Paraparaumu. Its opening early next year would be warmly welcomed by the station's 38 sworn and three non-sworn staff, who had endured rundown facilities since the idea of a new station was first mooted over 7 years ago, Mr Hawkins said.

That staff had to wait so long could be attributed to the National Government, who during their last four years of Government spent an average of only $725,000 annually on capital works, Mr Hawkins said.

"It is with some pride that I can point to Labour's plan to spend $60m over the next 5 years, or $12million per annum, on capital works," Mr Hawkins said.

The new complex would allow staff at Kapiti to continue their outstanding policing record, which included overseeing a 25 percent drop in burglary rates in the last year, he said.

Mr Hawkins acknowledged the presence of Labour candidate for Otaki, Darren Hughes, at the ceremony and the support of former MP Judy Keall for the new station.
