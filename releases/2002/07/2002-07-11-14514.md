The Minister of Conservation, Hon Sandra Lee, today announced the appointment of two new Guardians of Lake Wanaka, and the re-appointment of three others.  
She said the new appointees were Bill Hislop, of Wanaka, who will be the chairperson, and Laurel Teirney, of Dunedin. They join re-appointed members Dr Mike Floate, of Tarras, as well as Chas Morris, and Sally Waast, both from Wanaka.  
Mr Hislop is the former Chief Ranger of Mount Aspiring National Park, while Ms Teirney is a resource management consultant with a background in fisheries, particularly freshwater fisheries.  
“The Guardians continue to play an important oversight role in the preservation of Lake Wanaka, which is one of the few southern lakes with an unmodified shoreline," Ms Lee said.  
"The lake is protected by special legislation that provides the Guardians with a watchdog role to ensure that the lake and its shoreline remain unspoilt for the enjoyment of future generations.”  
The Guardians of Lake Wanaka are empowered under the Lake Wanaka Preservation Act 1973 to report and make recommendations to the Minister of Conservation.
