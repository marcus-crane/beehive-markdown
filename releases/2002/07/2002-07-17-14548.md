Associate Education Minister Marian Hobbs says a nationwide review of school transport is in progress. It is due to report at the end of 2002. The Rawene-Omanaia school transport situation will be considered within this review.

The service has been operating outside policy and is due to finish at the end of this year. Similar services operating outside a nationwide standard have been advised of closure.

"Fairness to every rural student is important," Marian Hobbs said.

"I asked the Ministry of Education to attend a Rawene community meeting yesterday to ensure that their case is represented in the review. I will not, in the middle of an election campaign, be changing my decision to close the service

"I am encouraged by advice that Rawene and Omanaia School Boards have begun to work together towards a combined solution. Such co-operation will find a better solution than the antagonism of the past."
