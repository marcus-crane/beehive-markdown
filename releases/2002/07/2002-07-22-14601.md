The Thames-Coromandel District Council will receive an ex-gratia payment of up to $330,000 in response to last week’s civil emergency, Civil Defence Minister George Hawkins announced today.

The payment comes on top of a $20,000 contribution, announced by Prime Minister Helen Clark last Saturday, to the Thames-Coromandel District Council Mayoral Relief Fund, as well as enhanced Taskforce Green assistance, Mr Hawkins said.

“Support for the cleanup of the area by workers of the Taskforce Green scheme could cost up to $22,500 and involve around 30 workers for up to three weeks,” Mr Hawkins said.

A once in a 150-year rainfall hit the area’s catchments on 21 June. Over 100 homes were damaged or destroyed by flooding.

This followed a less severe event in January which cost the District and Waikato Regional Council $320,000 combined, excluding roading repair costs.

“A report will be prepared for the Cabinet Committee on Expenditure and Administration and presented by 27 February next year on more appropriate ways to assist Councils respond to future natural disasters,” Mr Hawkins said.
