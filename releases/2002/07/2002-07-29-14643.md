New Zealand’s next Ambassador to Turkey will be career diplomat Jan Henderson, Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

Mrs Henderson is Director of the Chief Executive’s Office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She served previously in Bangkok, Honiara and Washington.

“The relationship between New Zealand and Turkey started on the battlefield, but has evolved into one of genuine warmth and mutual respect. This was symbolised by the annual ANZAC Day commemoration at Gallipoli.

“We now have a wide-ranging relationship with Turkey, including regular political consultations, high level visits and vibrant commercial links. There is considerable scope to build further on our political and trade links.

“As a window on a vibrant region, Turkey has a lot to offer New Zealand. It is important that New Zealand is well represented there,” Mr Goff said.

Mrs Henderson will take up her posting early next year. Based in Ankara, Mrs Henderson will also be accredited as Ambassador to Israel and Jordan. She replaces Alan Cook, who is returning to Wellington.
