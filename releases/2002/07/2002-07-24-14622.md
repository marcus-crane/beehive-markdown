The killing of 15 Palestinians, including 8 children, in an air strike by Israel can only further entrench the cycle of violence in the Middle East, says Foreign Minister Phil Goff.

“New Zealand condemns all violence deliberately directed against civilian populations. In that respect, this killing of innocent civilians is no different from the suicide bombings against innocent Israelis.

“Violence of this sort only invites retaliation and moves the parties further away from resuming negotiations to find peaceful solutions to the conflict in the Middle East.

“Palestinians and Israelis are destined to live alongside each other. There is no solution in violence which simply entrenches the bitterness and hatred of each side against the other.

“It is time for leadership on both sides to show the courage to break out of the current cycle of violence and retaliation and to seek a fair, peaceful and permanent resolution of the issues left outstanding at the Camp David talks,” Mr Goff said.
