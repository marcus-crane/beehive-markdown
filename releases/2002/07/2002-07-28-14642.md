Defence Minister Mark Burton said this morning that he was deeply saddened to learn that a New Zealand soldier had died in an incident near Dili, East Timor.

The New Zealand Defence Force has confirmed that Private Dean Robert Johnston was found dead near Dili. He was attached to the National Command Element of the New Zealand contingent. "Our immediate thoughts are with the family of Private Johnston, who was 20 years old and was originally from Christchurch but was based in Linton prior to deployment to East Timor as part of the 6th New Zealand Battalion Group ," Mark Burton said.

United Nations military police are investigating the incident. Private Johnston’s death is not believed to be the result of military action.

"The government extends its deepest sympathy to Private Johnston’s family and comrades.”

"Private Johnton’s death brings to five the number of New Zealand servicemen who have died in East Timor since we committed troops to the international peacekeeping force in 1999.”

Defence Minister Mark Burton will not be making any more statements until reports are received from the Police investigation.
