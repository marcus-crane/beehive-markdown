Transport Minister Mark Gosche says Labour’s transport policy will help New Zealand’s economic development as well as meeting social and environmental goals.

“Labour is committed to developing sustainable transport that is safe, affordable, integrated and responsive to the diverse needs of users. That is our vision for New Zealand’s transport system in 2010.

“To achieve that vision we first have to deal with the years of under-investment by the previous government. The $227 million land transport package we announced earlier this year is helping fund the largest ever annual expenditure on land transport. This financial year $1.1 billion will be spent on roading, and other land transport projects.

“That funding will ensure a more efficient, effective transport system. It includes $348.6 million for new roading construction projects, up $34 million on last year, and $85 million for passenger transport - double what it was in our first year in government. It also includes the first ever funding specifically for regional development, with $26.7 million allocated for this.

“In Auckland there will be approximately $320 million spent on roading and other land transport projects in the coming year.”

Labour’s plans for transport in its second term include:

·legislation to implement major changes to land transport, including to allow public-private partnerships to finance large roading projects  
·changing the mandates of transport agencies Transit and Transfund to ensure they reflect government priorities and take a longer-term view of land transport  
·requiring both agencies to review all major projects currently planned to ensure they meet the government’s strategic objectives  
·implementing the New Zealand Transport Strategy to provide a clear direction across all modes of transport (land, air and maritime)  
·continuing to encourage an efficient public transport system, including working with local authorities and operators to ensure they have the confidence to invest in public transport  
·publishing a walking and cycling strategy  
·implementing a road safety strategy for 2010 that will include more resources for policing rural drink driving and heavy vehicle enforcement, piloting a novice driver training programme and developing safety management systems for use by road controlling authorities.  
·further steps to reduce emissions from cars, including developing fuel consumption labelling for some vehicles and continuing work on vehicle emission requirements for most imported vehicles.  
·implementing policies to improve the long-term management of the New Zealand rail network  
·developing long-term safety strategies for the rail, aviation and maritime sectors.

Mr Gosche said that no other party had such a long-term vision for transport.

“This policy looks to the future. Too often the transport policies of previous governments have been ad-hoc and opportunistic. In land transport in particular this government inherited a long legacy of neglect.

“Labour’s policy offers a balanced vision for the future. The policy recognises the economic imperative of improving our transport system, but also embraces social and environmental concerns.”
