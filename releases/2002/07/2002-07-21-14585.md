The Department of Conservation can confirm it has been asked to help find a solution to the dispute over Young Nick’s Head.  
Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced today that he had asked Conservation Minister Sandra Lee to get DOC involved in resolving the dispute.  
DOC’s Director-General, Hugh Logan, says the landmark site contains important conservation and heritage areas, and his department welcomes the chance to be involved in discussions about their future.  
Mr Logan doesn’t rule out the possibility of an offer of purchase of the headland area but says it’s too early to say what will happen.  
"DOC will be talking to the key people involved and we hope to start that process this week," he says.  
"I don’t want to jump ahead to any conclusions about the type of outcome we’ll reach. At the same time, I’m confident that if the parties talk to each other and there’s goodwill involved that we will be able to make significant progress in resolving the matter."
