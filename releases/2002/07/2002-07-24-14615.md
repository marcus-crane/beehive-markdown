Defence Minister Mark Burton confirmed today that he has asked the Chief of Defence Force to proceed with implementing the proposed joint use of RNZAF Woodbourne’s aviation training facility with the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

“It is sensible to utilise spare RZNAF capacity to benefit the development of aviation in New Zealand,” the Minister said today.

“I have asked the Chief of Defence Force to proceed with implementing the proposed joint use of the training facility, subject to his satisfaction with the proposal and any operational constraints that may exist,” he said. “I understand that it may be possible to have the first course utilising these facilities as early as February 2003.”

“This is a good example of a ‘cross Government’ approach, involving Ministers in Industry and Regional Development, Tertiary Education and Defence portfolios, working co-operatively”, Mark Burton said.
