Hutt South MP Trevor Mallard today paid tribute to the Lower Hutt SeniorNet group and the work that they were doing to ensure older New Zealanders were armed with the computer and technology skills that their grandchildren take for granted.MP for Hutt South Trevor Mallard with Hutt City Mayor John Terris today presented the Lower Hutt SeniorNet Club with a plaque celebrating SeniorNet’s 10th Birthday in New Zealand.“In the last 10 years our Information Technology “culture” has grown dramatically. Today more than half of New Zealand homes have a computer. That means more homes have a computer than have a dishwasher or a Sky box.“New Zealanders are amongst the world leaders in terms of our internet subscription rate – and top users of internet banking and online travel.The work of SeniorNet ensures older New Zealanders can keep up with these advances while also staying in touch with people here and all around the world,” Trevor Mallard said.As part of our E-govt strategy we are concentrating on leading and supporting our knowledge society through public sector innovation.“Congratulations to Telecom who have been a proud supporter of SeniorNet in New Zealand since it began. Telecom and Xtra provide free connections and start up grants to each new club,” Trevor Mallard said.
