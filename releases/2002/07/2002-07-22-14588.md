Education Minister Trevor Mallard has approved $7.88 million for new property at Westlake Girls’ High School in Auckland.

He announced the grant while opening the school’s new gymnasium today.

The new money will enable the Westlake Girls’ High School to fully support projected roll growth in the North Shore over the next few years.

The proposed development to be undertaken for the $7.88 million budget comprises three stages. These involve the construction of new buildings and the reconfiguration and upgrading of existing spaces to ensure the school has the capacity to meet demographic challenges.

“Westlake Girls’ High is located within one of the fastest growing areas in New Zealand. The population has grown by over 7% between the 1996 census and the 2001 census,” Trevor Mallard said.

Projects include a new technology block, new gymnasium complex, science laboratories and major upgrade works to existing classroom blocks.

“This government is committed to creating sufficient capacity to support roll growth. It’s important to continually improve existing school learning and teaching environments through providing the right mix of property, quality and quantity.”
