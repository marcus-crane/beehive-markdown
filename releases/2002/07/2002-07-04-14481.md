"It is quite unacceptable for young people to be able to buy alcohol without producing ID,” said Tariana Turia, Associate Minister for Health.

The Minister was commenting on a survey released today by the Alcohol and Public Health Research Unit and others, in which less than half of 18-year olds were asked for ID when buying alcohol.

“No liquor outlet should be selling alcohol without asking young people for ID.

“This is a serious issue, given the number of young people binge drinking and needing medical treatment for alcohol abuse,” she said.
