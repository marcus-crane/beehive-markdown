DOC to mediate solution to Young Nick’s Head dispute

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today asked Conservation Minister Sandra Lee to get the Department of Conservation involved in finding a solution to the dispute over Young Nick’s Head.

This may involve the government, through DOC, taking ownership of the headland area.

“It is very important that people talk to each other to find a settlement and the potential purchaser is prepared to make significant concessions.

“Ngai Tamanuhiri want to see their traditional access preserved and the government wants to ensure an appropriate status for the historic headland area.

“We must remember that the present owner left New Zealand many years ago and has no intention of returning. The property is not in the best shape and at present, there are no guaranteed access rights.

“It ought to be possible with good will to find a solution that recognises all reasonable aspirations as long as people are prepared to talk to each other,” Dr Cullen said.
