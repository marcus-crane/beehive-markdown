Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey chowed down with children from Royal Oak Primary School this morning to promote the importance of children starting each day with breakfast.

The 6th annual Get Going with Breakfast month kicked off today. The school-based campaign teaches children about the importance of eating breakfast.

Steve Maharey said dieticians warn that for young peopple to perform to their potential both mentally and physically, a healthy breakfast us a must-have every day.

"Medical research indicates that children who have eaten breakfast are able to learn more readily - it's a very important meal which too many kids are missing out on.

"I hope this campaign reaches all New Zealand children and their families. Breakfast skipping by children occurs across our whole society and its important that, whatever the reason, we get the message out that it is really important to start the day with a healthy breakfast so that you can learn and play effectively.

"The Get Going with Breakfast campaign is being sponsored this year by Anchor, Bonita Bananas, Quality Bakers, Just Juice and Sanitarium. These companies are to be congratulated for their commitment to kiwi kids," said Steve Maharey
