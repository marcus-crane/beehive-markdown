The Minister of Tourism, Mark Burton, hosts his Australian Federal and State counterparts at the annual Tourism Ministers Council meeting in Auckland, Wednesday, September 11.

Tourism issues, including air services, marketing initiatives, heritage tourism, the international tourism developments, and policy development will be explored in formal sessions. Delegates will also be taken for an hour’s sail aboard NZL40 on the Waitemata Harbour.

Mark Burton said, ”I will have some good news about tourism to share with my Australian colleagues in New Zealand, including:  
·International visitors spending $5.7 billion in the year ended June, 2002.  
·Domestic tourists spending $6.27 billion on travel within New Zealand last year.  
·The medium to long-term outlook for tourism remains positive with international arrivals forecast to increase by an average annual rate of 6.3 per cent to 2007.

“ It is important for the tourism policy makers in Australia and New Zealand to meet to share, review and to plan so as to ensure improved efficiency for the high-value tourism industry,” Mark Burton said.

“Given that New Zealand and Australia are long-haul holiday destinations for tourists from Europe, North America and northern Asia it makes good sense for the two countries to work closely together, particularly to maximise the benefits of duel destination as well as trans-Tasman travel.”
