Education Minister Trevor Mallard made a commitment to secondary teachers at the PPTA annual conference today to make the transition to the National Certificate of Education easier for them, through extra workshops and teacher training.

“Now NCEA is here, we can’t afford to lose momentum,” Trevor Mallard said.  
“I remain convinced that there is real benefit in the new system – it offers better information and more diverse learning pathways.”  
Feedback from teachers had been important in getting the details right for the implementation of the NCEA and there would now be additional professional development, he said.  
“I am committed to maintaining and improving the level of support in order to manage workload pressures. I want to make the transition easier.”  
Trevor Mallard announced the following initiatives to ease the transition:  
·Level 2 training material addresses the problems identified in level 1 training material  
·Three days professional development this year for each teacher during senior examinations (one level 2 professional development workshop and two school only days)  
·Generic workshop on assessment design early in term one next year  
·Level 2 workshop early term two next year  
·Level 3 workshops in term 2 and late in term 3 next year  
In addition software problems area being worked on, the number of school relationship manager positions is being doubled, and our communications are being improved, Trevor Mallard said.
