West Coast-Tasman MP Damien O’Connor has welcomed the increased profile Monteiths will have throughout the West Coast through the expansion of its Wild Food Challenge.

“Monteiths is an icon associated with our region and we have to use it to attract visitors and develop further the concept of the West Coast as a place of quality hospitality.”

Mr O’Connor said the challenge also linked food and alcohol in a way that should promote responsible consumption, which was also beneficial for West Coast beer connisseurs.

He said that at the time of the debate over the brewing of Monteiths, DB chief executive officer Brian Brake gave him an assurance they would welcome any initiatives on the West Coast to build on the Monteiths brand for our mutual benefit.

“The Monteiths Wild Foods promotion run in the major cities throughout New Zealand have contributed to the growth in Monteiths sales, but also the profile of our region. We cannot afford to waste the opportunity such promotion by a major corporate in this country can bring to the West Coast.”

The West Coast Monteith's Wild Food Challenge will take place in November 1 to 30 this year and will be the first time the national competition will be held in the West Coast.

The inaugural West Coast Challenge will take place in Karamea, Westport, Punakaiki, Moana, Greymouth, Hokitika, Franz Josef, Fox Glacier and Haast. It will be run separately from the national Monteith's Wild Food Challenge, which is held in Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin during June and July every year.
