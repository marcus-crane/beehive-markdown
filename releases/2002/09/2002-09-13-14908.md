Act MP Deborah Coddington seems to have an alarming inability to take in more than one sentence at a time, says Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change Pete Hodgson.

“Ms Coddington has expressed outrage at my recent reply to a written Parliamentary question, in which I said there are no estimates of the economic impacts of climate change policies beyond the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period.

“Unfortunately it seems she was unable to proceed from the first sentence of the reply to the following paragraph, which explains why there are no such estimates. In short, it says that forecasting after 2012, when the first commitment period ends, would be highly speculative and no credible results could be obtained.

“Negotiations for the greenhouse gas emission targets that will apply in the second commitment period do not begin until 2005. Domestic policy effects, international developments, energy and emission trends, and domestic and global economic fortunes cannot be modelled a decade from now without substantial uncertainty.

“Apparently the Act Party believes we should waste taxpayers’ money on economic modelling that is beyond the limits of credibility. That is a little weird, even for them.”
