A new Office for Disability Issues has been set up within the Ministry of Social Development.

Speaking at the official opening of the office today, Disability Issues Minister Ruth Dyson said it was the third landmark event for people with disabilities in as many years.

“First we established a ministerial portfolio for disability issues to provide a voice for people with disabilities inside government. Then we developed the New Zealand Disability Strategy to give us a vision and framework for action. Now we have set up the Office for Disability Issues to provide strong leadership and coordinated action across all sectors.”

The role of the office is to give policy advice on disability issues, lead the implementation and monitoring of the disability strategy, and work closely with the disability sector.

“The office will work with DPA as the national voice of people with disabilities to build a strong relationship with other parts of the sector,” Ms Dyson said.

The office will be led by Jan Scown, who has held a range of senior positions in the disability sector for more than 20 years, and was formerly chief executive of the Community Living Trust in Hamilton.

Six full-time staff have been employed initially, expanding to 10 full-time staff over the next five years.

Ms Dyson thanked the Ministry of Health’s Disability Services Directorate for its work in getting the disability strategy up and running.

“The directorate has done an excellent job in developing and monitoring the New Zealand Disability Strategy. It will will continue to have a close relationship with the new office, but will now be able to focus on its core area of responsibility, disability support services.”
