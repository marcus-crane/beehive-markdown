Flood-affected farmers are to get help from the Government, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Mr Sutton said assistance had been granted from the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry to help farmers in the areas affected by floods on August 6 and 7.

He said $20,000 would be granted from MAF’s adverse events fund to pay for co-ordination of the relief effort, preparation and delivery of three technical seminars to advise farmers and horticulturalists of their options and priorities to minimise risks to their business, and for rural trust financial counselling services.

“Associate Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor and myself have come to Gisborne to see for ourselves what further is needed. We will then be able to report to Cabinet on Monday exactly what is needed.”

Mr Sutton said that Enhanced Taskforce Green funding allocation required Cabinet to give approval first. Under the enhanced programme, the Government pays 100 per cent of employment costs.

Enhanced Taskforce Green funding is usually allocated when a civil defence emergency is declared, but Mr Sutton said that every case should be decided on its merits.

“That is why Mr O’Connor and I have decided to come and see for ourselves.”

He thanked local MP Janet Mackey for keeping him and officials informed about what was happening in Gisborne.

“I am pleased that I and my officials are able to act swiftly to help those who have been affected.”
