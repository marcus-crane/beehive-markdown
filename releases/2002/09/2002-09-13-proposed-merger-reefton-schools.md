West Coast-Tasman MP Damien O’Connor is reassuring residents that nothing has been finalised regarding the proposed merger of two schools in Reefton.

It has been proposed that Reefton Primary School and Inangahua College be merged to form an area school.

Mr O’Connor said the Education Ministry had clearly signalled its view that the merger was in the best interests of education of local children in the future.

“I can see some real benefits in the merging of the two schools, but I understand the concerns of residents to ensure that we get quality staffing, that we get proper resourcing, and that we get an ongoing commitment to work with the community.

“I’ll be keeping close contact with Education Minister Trevor Mallard, and I can assure people that no decision has been made.”
