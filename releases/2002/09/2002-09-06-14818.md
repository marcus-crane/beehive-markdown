“If the voters of New Zealand, including those of the West Coast, had wanted to relitigate the West Coast beech logging issue, they would have voted ACT in the recent General Election.”

This was the response of newly appointed Forestry Minister Jim Sutton to a press release by Acting ACT Leader Ken Shirley, who called on Mr Sutton to reverse the earlier decision of the Labour-led Government to end logging in Crown-owned native forests.

“I appreciate Mr Shirley’s vote of confidence in myself, but urge him to join me in accepting the democratic decision of the people in this matter”, Mr Sutton said.

“After all, if in the fullness of time the people come to accept that it is indeed possible to manage a proportion of public indigenous forest for sustainable production of our unique and special timbers, without sacrificing the environmental and social vaues of the forest, the opportunity will still be there.”
