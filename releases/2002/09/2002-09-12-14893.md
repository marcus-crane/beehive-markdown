The Office of Treaty Settlement's briefing to the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations is now available.

The Office of Treaty Settlements is a specialised, semi-autonomous unit of the Ministry of Justice established in 1995. It is the lead government agency for treaty negotiations, implements settlements, oversees settlement legislation and provides policy advice to the Minister.

While focusing on the progress of historical claims, the paper provides an overview of the Treaty sector. It highlights current issues and lists the status of settlement negotiations to date.

"Settlements are progressing at an unprecedented rate," Margaret Wilson says. "This briefing acknowledges the complexities of negotiating durable and final settlements, but also the steps taken to improve the overall process."

The briefing will be posted at [www.beehive.govt.nz/briefings/maori/home.cfm](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/briefings/maori/home.cfm)
