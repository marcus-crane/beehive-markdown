PM:The Cabinet today has had a discussion on the issue of leaky buildings—it’s the first meeting we’ve had since the report from the overview group commissioned by the Building Industry Authority, since it put its report forward. And we are considering how we might facilitate consumers getting claims mediated. Officials have been doing a lot of work on that. Initial indications from industry and local government are very positive around such an approach. We’re not ready to make announcements today, but should be in a position to say something a little later in the week.

Trevor is here to comment on the Government Superannuation Fund issue and Mark Burton to comment on the Defence break-in.

Coming up this week—a relatively quiet week—Annette King launches new primary health-care organisations tomorrow; the Reserve Bank has its official cash rate review; Michael Cullen will be with Moody’s on Wednesday; Mr Mallard is launching an Internet initiative with early childhood on Thursday.

Coming up in the House, we’re hoping this week, which does have a private members’ day in it, to make some progress on Government legislation, particularly the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill (No 4), which is revenue-generating and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Bill. First readings that we hope to get started on—the Hop Industry Restructuring Bill, the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Bill, and the Ngati Ruanui Claims Settlement Bill. And then, as I said, Wednesday will be taken up with private members’ business.

Mark Burton, you need to get away. So first on defence.

Hon. Mark Burton: Thank you. As you know, early morning, Saturday, 28 September security staff at Defence Headquarters in Stout Street were alerted to an unauthorised presence in that building. The breach was contained to a limited number of workstations on the 4th floor. There is a broken window in the office of Jerry Mateparae, Chief of General Staff of the New Zealand Army. There is currently scaffolding erected outside that window as part of the project to waterproof the building’s windows.

An examination of the premises was conducted by the scene of crime officers and military police in the early hours of Saturday morning. Investigations are still continuing. Currently interviews are being conducted with all 4th floor staff to ascertain what, if anything, has been taken.

At this time there is no evidence at all of any secure information being breached. No security containers have been breached nor has any attempt been made to access secure computers containing sensitive information. These computers have a restricted access requiring password and a shut-down at the end of each working day. The Defence Headquarters operates a “clear desk” policy, which means all sensitive material must be secured at the end of each working day. All sensitive documentation must be signed out at the beginning of each day and signed back in at the end of each day.

A complete security review is already under way. This review is being undertaken by senior Defence staff, Defence Headquarters security staff, military police, and civilian police. In a briefing with senior Defence staff and military police this morning I made it very clear that I expect to be fully informed of this review every step of the way and that I expect any practical recommendations made to increase the level of security will be implemented swiftly and efficiently. I am happy to take questions.

Media:How long has the scaffolding been there?

Mr Burton:A few days, I think.

Media:So it was there at the time of the break-in?

Mr Burton:Yes, it was.

Media:Why were the ladders taken down from within it?

Mr Burton:As I understand it, the ladders are not easily accessible from the ground.

Media:Can you clarify. The break-in was detected while the person or persons were still on the premises?

Mr Burton:I believe so, but the details, obviously, of the inquiry are still very much being followed through by police, and I certainly don’t want to comment in any great detail on that.

Media:Since the building houses not only the Defence Headquarters but the Security Intelligence Service it must be embarrassing that people could have got access so easily?

Mr Burton:Well, the details of how access was gained, as with all of the details in the investigation, are yet to be determined. Of course it is not good. That’s why a serious response is being made very quickly. The important thing is that the detail is quickly worked through. A review of all existing procedures, some of which were very much, as I have indicated, effective in ensuring (a) that the presence of an intruder was in fact known, and (b) that certainly secure information, it would seem, was not in any way jeopardised.

Media:So this intruder once discovered, escaped?

Mr Burton:Yes.

Media:Do you know whether it was just one or have you any idea how many were there?

Mr Burton:Again I don’t want to comment on that detail at this stage.

Media:Is there anything to suggest they were after information peculiar to that building or that it was just opportunistic?

Mr Burton:Again whilst an investigation is still under way, preliminary indications are that there was no particular reason to believe that this was about targeting information held in the building.

Media:So there is no clear idea of point of entry or point of exit?

Mr Burton:I am saying that all of the detail relating to entrance and exit are part of the investigation that is under way. It would be premature for anyone to jump to any conclusions about any of that.

Media:The National Party has suggested that it may be impossible to tell whether it was burglars or Special Forces. What do you say to that?

Mr Burton:Well, the National Party has made a number of rather extreme comments. I think it would be more responsible for them to await the outcome of the police inquiry. That’s the responsible and prudent thing to do, it seems to me. I think to start making those sorts of wild claims based on nothing at all is irresponsible, quite frankly.

Media:So you are ruling out foreign spies?

Mr Burton:I’m simply saying that a police inquiry assisted by military police is under way, and I think we should all wait for the outcome of that, rather than beginning a series of ever-escalating speculation of what may or may not be.

Media:Have you any early indication of what was taken? I know that everyone is still taking a stocktake, but they would know if there was a TV or something has gone?

PM:The key to the whisky cupboard.

Mr Burton:I don’t think any of the models were taken, either. But the short answer is, I think by the end of today we’ll have a pretty good idea, as the interviews of all the people on the floor—as you can appreciate, because of the range of things that people hold in their offices, both official equipment and personal items, it is pretty hard to be conclusive about that. I’m expecting a further briefing late today, and may be in a position to provide more information after that.

Media:Any reaction from overseas Defence Forces?

Mr Burton:No.

Media:Does New Zealand have any information of any foreign government here interested in it?

Mr Burton:I couldn’t possibly comment on that, but, as I said, most importantly, there is no reason to believe that any secure information or sensitive information has been breached at this point.

Media:What security system—audible alarm or video surveillance—was there?

Mr Burton:You had to ask the question, but I think you will understand that it would be irresponsible of me to comment at all on what the details of the security arrangements are. What is clear is that any shortcomings in it are going to have to be rectified. There are a number of measures involved in the security of that building, some of them were important in detecting the presence of someone in the building who shouldn’t be there. I can’t comment beyond that, because I think that would be to further jeopardise the security of the building in the future.

Media:What about it being swept for bugs or anything like that. Have they done that?

Mr Burton:The security of the building and certainly that sort of sweep is part of the regular security of that sort of building.

Media:Does the mere fact that someone got in and got out without being apprehended, into a building that houses Defence Headquarters and Security Intelligence Services must be of grave concern?

Mr Burton:It’s a concern but it’s also factual, we should bear in mind, the access was limited to one part of the building. Whether or not attempts were made to get anywhere else in the building, they certainly weren’t successful.

Media:So the fact they got into even one part means—?

Mr Burton:No, it’s not good, and that’s obviously why when I met first thing this morning with senior Defence officials there is no doubt as to the importance that we place on having this matter thoroughly investigated, full cooperation with both the civilian and military police, and the recommendations on any security requirements will be implemented very quickly.

Media:What was the scaffolding doing there in the first place?

Mr Burton:Dealing with a problem of moisture getting to the building?

Media:Leaky building!

Mr Burton:Of a different sort. We don’t own this building. It’s a very old building, too, I point out.

Media:Was it military police or civilian police who attended first?

Mr Burton:The incident was initially responded to by building security, Defence officials. The military police came into the building first and then the civilian police. Since then the civilian and the military police have been cooperating.

Media:Do you know how long they were in there, the intruders?

Mr Burton:I don’t have that detail at this time.

Media:Was the offender caught on camera at all?

Mr Burton:There are security cameras as part of the building, and that’s the detail that may be known at some future point.

Media:Is it a possibility that it was an inside job?

Mr Burton:Look, there is a police investigation under way, and I think the responsible thing is that they will, obviously, start with a blank piece of paper as to all possibilities and investigate.

Media:Will this review be contained to this building, or will you be reviewing security at all defence and sensitive areas?

Mr Burton:I think we have a specific issue to deal with. In terms of general security and building security and Defence establishment security, that is a matter under constant consideration and evaluation. I have no doubt that base commanders, for instance, will be taking note and having some considerable thought as to whether there are any measures they need to look at. It is a healthy reminder to us all that any building is potentially vulnerable, and in this instance a thorough investigation is well under way.

Media:What else is on the 4th floor?

Mr Burton:That is essentially the Chief of General Staff’s floor, so it’s the head office, if you like, of New Zealand Army.

Media:Did I understand you to say that you weren’t confirming that entry was by this broken window? Is it possible then the intruder got out of the broken window, is that what you are saying?

Mr Burton:No, I’m not saying that at all. I’m saying the means of entry to the building may or may not have been through that window.

Media:That wasn’t already broken though?

Mr Burton:No, the window wasn’t broken prior to this event.

Media:The SIS won’t be offering this person a job when you find him?

Mr Burton:I couldn’t possibly comment. No, I wouldn’t have thought so. OK, thank you.

Hon. Trevor Mallard: There was some publicity this morning around the question of the valuation of the Government Superannuation Fund assets. This is a relatively complicated matter, but it is designed to show the fund’s share of the liabilities from the Government Superannuation Fund, which people will remember was closed to new entrants in 1992. Currently, the taxpayer, the Government, covers 70 percent of the payments, roughly, and the fund covers about 30 percent. Those figures are an indication of why there were some liabilities around the area and probably why previous Governments made some decisions to close it.

The valuation is driven by a number of factors: by interest rates which drive the discount value, by interest assumptions going out into the future, by assumptions around individuals’ earnings. Because this is a defined benefit scheme, it depends on the average salary of the last 5 years of the people as they retire and periodic changes in life expectations in the tables that flow from that. The liability of this fund is something which is not—they are not sort of simply derived.

Government made a decision a couple of years ago, and has been moving to implement it, to progressively move to a more diversified basis for the scheme, for the investments of this scheme previously held in Government stock. The reason for that was that in the year to 30th June 2000 the return was 3.75 percent gross, about 2 percent when one take inflation out of it. We felt that that was not a good return on the fund, although one would see that when one has ups and downs in other years sometimes it can be better than the alternative. The objective of the scheme is to try and get a diversified portfolio with growth out over the 30 to maybe 50 years that the scheme is likely to last, because, obviously, people are no longer going into it.

I am advised that as a result of the investments that have been made over the last 12 months there has been a small profit—a small before-tax profit—made by the fund, but it is below the expectations that one would have. Because of the passive fund taxation liabilities it will be a small tax loss on the part of the fund. But, remember, that is when one considers it, when this all washes out all we are doing is working out how much the fund pays and how much the Government pays. When there is a tax loss it just washes through into the other part of the Government accounts, anyway.

I’m informed that the results of these losses on the investments will be that next year the taxpayers will have a liability of about $3.5 million extra to pay towards those people who have retired and are collecting Government superannuation.

Media:Does the fund’s exposure to overseas share markets \[inaudible] … are there grounds to rethink that strategy?

Mr Mallard:Well, I’m sure there will be continued rethinking on the part of a lot of people involved in funds management as to the balance between passive arrangements, bond arrangements, New Zealand equity versus overseas equity. That is something that is ongoing. I think that was ongoing well before this loss became clear.

Media:In the main the June 2000 figure was a very small profit—was it perceived as worse in this situation, the change of strategy?

Mr Mallard:That’s right. One of the things that happens is that when you diversify and you have some upside potential you also have some downside potential. In this case, quite clearly, it would have been better to put the money into the Post Office, and the return could well have been slightly more in that case. And that is something that we are told happens on about a 20-year basis.

Media:Should this fund, though, be risked in that way?

Mr Mallard:Well, what I would like, as a taxpayer, to happen is that the exposure of the taxpayer in the longer term is one that is minimised, and to do that, on average you want to have higher returns rather than lower returns. That is the objective of this diversification.

Media:That means taking risks?

Mr Mallard:What that means is that, like individuals sometimes take some risks as far as their investments are concerned, and they have sometimes some very good years and occasionally some years which are not as good. And this fund has had one of those years.

Media:When did the fund first start diversifying?

Mr Mallard:My understanding is that it was in November of last year.

Media:In its statement of intent it said it expected to make a loss of say 400 million in any 1 year as 1 in 20 years, yet it has managed 315 in about 7 or 8 months.

Mr Mallard:Yes, it’s certainly getting to the outside of its 20-year probability in a way that I indicated earlier.

Media:Do you have the full figures for that?

Mr Mallard:I don’t have the full figures. The board is currently meeting. I think we’re not due to get the figures until tabling some time in the middle of October. It may be as a result of this publicity we can bring the exact figures forward.

Media:Did it get to the 44 percent allocated to overseas investment?

Mr Mallard:Not yet.

Media:What is it at the moment?

Mr Mallard:I think we’ll get those figures from the board following their meeting.

Media:Do you expect a fuller briefing after this meeting?

Mr Mallard:I expect that I’ll get a fuller brief. I think more importantly I hope that you can have a fuller briefing too, so that you can understand the situation, which, while at first glance, doesn’t look that good, but if you consider the way that Government funding goes, an exposure of three and a half million dollars extra, cash to be paid out on the part of the Government next year, I think you’ll see it’s not quite as serious as some people might be making out.

Media:Do you think questions need to be asked …\[inaudible].. have been investing in these international equities.

Mr Mallard:I think if one looks at the international equity market, most people who have been involved in that have taken some hits in the past year. But clearly the board, which is responsible for this, and I want to make very clear that I would not advocate—and I’m sure Dr Cullen wouldn’t advocate—a hands-on approach as far as specific investments are concerned. I think that would be most inappropriate from a ministerial point of view.

Media:Since the balance statement we have been talking about, the international share market continues to go down and yet the full extent is that they are heading towards 44 percent down to 32 percent of international equities. Has that been revised?

Mr Mallard:I’m sure the board will be looking at its exposure and trying to make some decisions as to long-term market direction—

Media:Doesn’t the Government want to have a word to the board?

Mr Mallard:If I or they had an answer to that, as to what was the appropriate point to make the investment, I think that probably neither of us would be here.

Media:Why did Treasury have access to the June quarter figures but not to the previous three quarters?

Mr Mallard:I don’t know.

Media:Are you satisfied the authority is meeting its substantial prudent diversification investments best practice … \[inaudible]

Mr Mallard:Well, I think it’s making an effort to diversity its portfolio and put itself into that position. It is clear, with hindsight, it would have been better to leave the money in the Post Office or the Kiwibank and gain interest on it or in Government stock. But it is under a clear direction from Government to, over the longer term, make sure that you and I as taxpayers don’t have to pay any more than we have to. And having money which has a net 1.75 percent return or a net 2 percent return is just not good enough.

Media:In addition to the pure equities market losses are we also looking at forex losses because the Kiwi has appreciated a lot in the last 7 or 8 months?

Mr Mallard:I think the figures that we will get at the end will be net and will include all of that. I mean, what’s clear is that they’ve done relatively well in the bonds area but the equities area hasn’t done well.

Media:What I’m asking now is their exposure, is that fully hedged or part-hedged?

Mr Mallard:I don’t know about the degree of hedging of the exposure, but my understanding is that at each point they take the current situation into account and fully incorporate that into their accounts, so we do see the gains or losses as they occur.

Media:Will the Government be making its displeasure known to the fund managers?

Mr Mallard:No. I think what we will make clear is that we would like to have in the medium and longer term a much better return than the 1.75 to 2 percent return that occurred in 2000 and was predicted out into the future, because that is not good enough. But there are clearly some issues and some rebalancing, which will occur as a result of this. I mean, clearly the New Zealand stock market is more attractive now relative to others, compared to what it used to be. But I will probably stop there or I will get myself into some other trouble about commenting on markets.

Media:Market stocks started dropping on September 11th, a month later the fund started investing in international equity markets. Was there room for a U-turn at that point—hey, we know the markets are dropping?

Mr Mallard:I think it is fair to say that there is always room to revise investment intentions and direction. People who know how far markets are going to drop are pretty rare, and there are none of them in this room. Thank you.

PM: Any other questions?

Media:Just on the leaky buildings, why are you not going to be saying anything until later in the week?

PM:I want to have a little more complete information before we do that.

Media:Can you tell us anything about the Crown Law opinion? Did that look just at whether the Government was liable or did it look at the question of who might be liable?

PM:No, they didn’t look at who might be liable. It was simply satisfying the Government that there were no issues for us.

Media:Did you watch the Warriors game on the weekend?

PM:Bits and pieces. I thought the end was particularly satisfying.

Media:Are you going to go on Sunday?

PM:It’s very tempting.

Media:Have you decided?

PM:No. It’s very tempting, as the national patron of New Zealand rugby league, I can say.

Media:They expect you to be there, Prime Minister?

PM:They may well.

Media:Are you going to respond to that?

PM:Of course.

Media:So you will be going?

PM:No, I said I will respond.

Media:You haven’t been contacted by the Sydney Morning Herald journalist who was locked out of the Warriors’ locker room, who was reported as saying she would be contacting the Prime Minister’s office here about—

PM:No, it hasn’t been elevated to the Prime Minister’s level yet. Maybe she rang Mr Howard.

Media:Can you explain why for the second time in a month the immigration points have been raised?

PM:Presumably because of overwhelming demand.

Media:There is no concern that this might affect Government’s target of attracting skilled migrants?

PM:No, but the target would be vastly superseded if we didn’t exercise controls.

Media:Can I ask you what the purpose is of your newly established media unit?

PM:Have you not been at press conferences for the last two months?

Media:I was just wanting to get some details on what it is for?

PM:Well, as you know, and as I’ve been saying for some weeks, we’ve had a review of how we spend money on press officers, and we have determined that not every associate Minister needs a press officer. Associate Ministers in a number of cases are now working through Ministers’ press secretaries, and the money saved from that is going into a communications unit, whose job is to take a broader view of how we are getting news about what the Government is doing out to those who are affected by it, for better or worse. For example, one can think of situations with Budgets. I recall back in the year 2000 Mr Mallard had something over 30 new education initiatives in the Budget. It would probably defy any of us in this room to remember one or two within a week of the event, but there were a lot of announcements which were of interest to a lot of people. Now it is not the job of the news media to faithfully report every Government announcement, but what the Government likes to do is to see that people who are affected by announcements at least have some kind of chance of hearing about them. So through a communications unit we can make sure that if there is something of interest to kindergartens, it gets to kindergartens, if there something of interest to a particular sector it gets to a sector. That is the purpose of it.

Media:Winston Peters has compared it to the Tass Agency in Soviet Russia. What do you say to that?

PM:Well, that is ridiculous. I’ve just made the comment that it is not the job of the news media to print every statement of the Government, but obviously the Government is going to try to endeavour to get information about what it does do out to those who are affected by it. Tass, of course, operated under a totally State-controlled system, with State-controlled papers, distribution channels and so on. It’s farcical that such a statement could even be taken seriously by Radio New Zealand.

Media:What about your response to the Ombudsman’s report which looked at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet?

PM:Well, I’ve made no response to the Ombudsman’s report.

Media:Why not?

PM:I haven’t been asked to make a response to it.

Media:Well, I’m asking you now. Would you like to make a response to it?

PM:Well, the Ombudsman has questioned the practice, which has always prevailed, with respect to advice from a policy group in the Prime Minister’s department to the Prime Minister. The practice which has always prevailed, under every Prime Minister, is that those bits of advice are not released. I’m not sure why the Ombudsman has chosen to comment on it while I’m Prime Minister; the same comment could equally have been made going back going down through the ages as long as there has been such a group.

Media:Will you be making any changes in response to the report?

PM:No, I’m not intending to make any changes, but I wouldn’t even normally see a request for such information. The practice has been that it hasn’t been released.

Media:Has the Government made any progress on Maori Television broadcasting?

PM:No discussion today.

Media:Can you confirm the Crown Law opinion said that there is no doubt the Government wasn’t liable in respect of leaky buildings. Does that include its agencies?

PM:\[answer inaudible]

Media:Are you able to tell us more about leaky buildings later this week?

PM:We are expecting something in the course of the week.
