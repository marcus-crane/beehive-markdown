Cullen backs stock exchange September 11 gesture

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Michael Cullen today endorsed the New Zealand Stock Exchange’s decision to delay trading for two hours on the anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attacks as a mark of respect for the victims and their families.

“It is appropriate that we use our status as the first stock exchange in the world to open to make this gesture – especially as the New York attack occurred in the middle of the financial district,” Dr Cullen said from Mexico where he is attending the Apec Finance Ministers’ Meeting.

“The grief and revulsion caused by the attacks are still fresh.”

The government will participate in a variety of commemorations on 11 September itself.

The Prime Minister will participate in a tree planting ceremony at the United States Embassy in Wellington and will attend, with several other MPs, a special memorial service in Wellington Cathedral. Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff will represent the government at two commemorative services in New York.

Dr Cullen will seek leave to move a motion of remembrance in the House and will invite other party leaders to join him.
