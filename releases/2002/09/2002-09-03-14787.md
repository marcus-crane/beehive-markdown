Attorney General Margaret Wilson has commissioned an independent report on the current approach to the appointment, administration, servicing and termination of judicial and quasi-judicial appointments.

Sir Geoffrey Palmer has been appointed to conduct discussions with relevant office holders and agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Courts, the Crown Law Office and the State Services Commission.

Attorney-General Margaret Wilson said the aim of the report was to gather and analyse information so the Government could consider how to provide a more co-ordinated and efficient approach to this complex and difficult area of public administration.

Sir Geoffrey is expected to report to the Attorney General by 1 November 2002.
