Acting Finance Minister Trevor Mallard said the June GDP results, showing growth of 1.7 percent over the quarter and 3.5 percent over the year, are well above market forecasts and ahead of the PREFU forecasts.

“The GDP figures indicate an economy in good heart despite risks internationally,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The momentum in the economy suggests that it is well placed going into the second half of this year.”
