Energy Minister Pete Hodgson has welcomed National energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee’s belated recognition that National’s legacy of disruption in the electricity industry means Labour’s Power Package reforms are “desperately needed”.

“It is a relief to see a National politician finally acknowledge that Max Bradford’s radical changes to the electricity industry have not delivered the nirvana Mr Bradford promised,” Mr Hodgson said. “After voting against the legislation that makes repairs to the system possible, Mr Brownlee is now urging me to hurry this government’s reforms along. Although it is possible he is confused, I welcome his support.

“I am surprised, however, to see a National politician advocating more government direction of state-owned enterprises, in this case the electricity SOEs. He has effectively suggested that ministers direct the SOEs to suspend their commercial judgement for the sake of public policy considerations, which would put the directors in a very difficult position.”
