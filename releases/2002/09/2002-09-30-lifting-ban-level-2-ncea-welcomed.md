Education Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the PPTA decision to lift its ban on implementing level 2 of the NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) in secondary schools next year.

“I’m looking forward to discussing with the PPTA its final conference recommendations on NCEA, ” Trevor Mallard said.

He was pleased PPTA members had had a considered discussion on the implementation of level 2 of the NCEA next year.

“I recognise there was a tension between those teachers and those schools which did not feel ready to go ahead with level 2 next year and other teachers and schools which are demanding NCEA goes ahead,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The decision of PPTA members seems to reflect the middle ground that we’ve been trying to reach in the sector.

“I know that many teachers have found the transition too hard and too confusing. We have put initiatives in place to make the transition easier,” Trevor Mallard said.

Software problems are being worked on, the number of school relationship managers has doubled and communications with schools are being improved.

Teachers will receive three days professional development this year and workshops next year, and problems identified during the implementation of NCEA level 1 are being fixed.

“We can’t afford to lose the momentum, now that NCEA is here,” Trevor Mallard said.

For those schools that choose to offer a transitional Sixth Form Certificate next year, guidelines are being prepared.
