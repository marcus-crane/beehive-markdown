Minister of Transport Paul Swain has had assurances from the relevant safety and accident agencies that an investigation into Friday night’s incident, in which an Air New Zealand plane lost a portion of wing flap soon after take-off, is underway.

“This morning I met with the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). TAIC has informed me that it has already begun a formal investigation into the incident.

“The CAA, which is responsible for safety and regulatory issues, will be informed of any potential safety recommendations during the investigation.

“Investigations like this often involve consideration of highly technical issues so it’s important that it be done thoroughly.

“However I have been advised that any matters requiring urgent action will be dealt with immediately.

“The incident on 24 August, in which a panel fell from the wing of another Air New Zealand plane, is currently the subject of a CAA investigation. I have been advised that the CAA has issued a statement today.

“Air New Zealand has an excellent safety record. The public needs to have confidence that agencies independent of government are taking these issues very seriously. I have full confidence in the ability of those agencies to investigate these incidents thoroughly and recommend any appropriate action.”
