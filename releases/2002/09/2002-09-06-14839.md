In her role as Attorney General, Margaret Wilson has received two briefings - from the Crown Law Office and Parliamentary Counsel Office. Each outlines the respective office's role and functions.

And in her new role as Minister of Courts, Margaret Wilson received a departmental briefing outlining the continuing modernisation programme, which has been underway for the past five years.

The major developments in both portfolios - including the establishment of a Supreme Court, and the Law Commission Report into the Structure of the Courts - were announced last term.

The briefings will be posted on the government website: [www.beehive.govt.nz](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/briefings/justice/courts/home.cfm)
