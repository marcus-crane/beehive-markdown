Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today launched a website that will promote the hundreds of cultural activities available to New Zealanders and international visitors during the America’s Cup period.

“The Essential New Zealand website, www.essnz.com, was conceived as a way to take advantage of the America’s Cup to showcase New Zealand to the world as a nation with a talented and dynamic creative sector,” said Judith Tizard today at the Auckland Art Gallery.

“The ESSNZ project is intended to promote cultural highlights not just in Auckland but throughout New Zealand to encourage visitors to travel during their time in New Zealand for the Louis Vuitton Challenger Series and the America’s Cup Regatta.

“The message to international audiences and New Zealanders is that when they experience our unique cultural activities, they experience the essence of New Zealand.”

The ESSNZ website www.essnz.com holds over 200 New Zealand cultural events including large outdoor spectaculars, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Royal New Zealand Ballet tours, art gallery exhibitions, choral concerts, local drama seasons and summer festivals.

As the website can continually be updated, information will remain current, and events will continue to be added during the America’s Cup period. The website can be searched by time period, region and art form, and provides on-line booking access.

“The benefits of ESSNZ are expected to include a boost in ticket sales, a potential boost to the tourist industry as people travel to take in cultural events around the country, and the opportunity to enhance New Zealand’s overseas image,” said Judith Tizard.

ESSNZ originated from the cross-government Major Events Group set up to improve coordination of government’s involvement in large-scale events. The project has been overseen by a steering group of member agencies of the Major Events Group headed by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, and the project manager is Vanessa Zigliani.
