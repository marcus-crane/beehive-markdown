More than $700,000 has been invested in community organisations who work with children and families on the West Coast, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey and West Coast-Tasman MP Damien O’Connor said today.

A report detailing the $78.9m in funding provided to over 900 service providers by Child, Youth and Family for the year ended 30 June 2002 was tabled in Parliament this week. West Coast providers received $702,170, up from $558,902 during the 2000/01 financial year.

West Coast-Tasman MP Damien O’Connor said while the government can't solve community problems alone, but it does have a big role to play.

“By working in partnership with community agencies, West Coasters are able to get access to specialised services often developed locally to meet the needs of our region. We want to see a strong network of community services supporting families to raise their children in safe, nurturing and empowering environments,” Damien O’Connor said.

Funding was provided to West Coast community organisations for a variety of services:  
·information and advice services, $7,820;  
·education and prevention services, $97,867;  
·family well-being services, $427,873;  
·counselling and rehabilitation services, $153,020;  
·strengthening providers and communities, $15,590.

Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said the funding allocations were focused on responding to West Coast needs identified during local consultation meetings run by Child, Youth and Family.

“In the financial year now underway (1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003) the government has further increased the funding available to community organisations working with children and young people and their families. A total of $86.587m will be available nationally, up from $79.9m in the year to 30 June 2002.  
“Decisions on how this funding is to be allocated, including how much of it will be spent on the Coast, will be taken shortly and will take into account consultation with communities across the country on the needs they themselves identify as most pressing,” Steve Maharey said.
