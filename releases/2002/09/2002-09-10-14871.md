Minister of Transport Paul Swain today released the briefing papers provided to him by the Ministry of Transport, the Land Transport Safety Authority, Transfund NZ, Transit NZ, the Aviation Security Service, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Transport Accident and Investigation Commission and the Maritime Safety Authority.

Mr Swain said he was looking forward to the next three years as Transport Minister as there was a lot of important work to be done in the portfolio. “Getting an effective, efficient and sustainable transport system is critical for New Zealand’s social and economic development. What we are after is a more co-ordinated approach. This will include more flexible funding arrangements, an improved rail network and legislation to enable public private partnerships to fund infrastrucutre,” he said.

“The New Zealand Transport Strategy, to be released later this year, will guide decision making by government and its various agencies across the sector,” said Mr Swain.

“The NZTS is based around the vision that by 2010, New Zealand will have an affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable transport system.”

Mr Swain said the key piece of transport legislation to be passed this term would be the land transport mangement bill which would allow for public private partnerships to fund new transport infrastrucuture. “We are aiming to introduce the bill to Parliament before the end of the year.
