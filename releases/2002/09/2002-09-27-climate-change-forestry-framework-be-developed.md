Discussions between Government and forestry sector representatives over climate change policy have produced a broad consensus on the way forward, says Pete Hodgson, the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change.

“We have agreed to develop a “Forestry Framework” that will look at how climate change policies and other Government initiatives can be brought together in the best interests of the environment, wood processors, forest growers and the economy generally,” said Mr Hodgson.

"New Zealand is fortunate to have substantial forest sink credits, which will help significantly in New Zealand meeting its Kyoto Protocol obligations. The Crown has decided to retain the credits to help minimise the costs to the country and maximise the opportunities the Protocol presents.

"The forest sector naturally wants due recognition of the role it has played in generating those sink credits — and of the importance of a vibrant forestry sector where New Zealand benefits from the processing of this important renewable and growing resource and generates more credits in the future. I'm pleased to report that we've made real progress toward meeting the sector’s objectives as we refine the policy response to climate change.

"In July, officials and sector leaders undertook a joint study tour of Finland and Norway to explore best practice in greenhouse gas emissions management. As a result of that tour and subsequent discussions, the government and industry leaders now have broad agreement on the way forward.

"Over the next few weeks we will be developing a Forestry Framework agreement. Issues to be considered for inclusion in the framework include:

·Lifting the limit by which the Government will accept liabilities for carbon released by deforestation;

·Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements for competitiveness-at-risk forestry processors;

·Providing incentives for energy efficiency projects, especially in the wood processing sector;

·Exploring incentives for the creation of new bio-energy plants - a key component in moving New Zealand towards a renewables-based energy future; and

·For forest owners, exploring incentives for the creation of permanent (non-harvest) sinks.

"In addition, there is significant scope for more coordination between the Government's climate change policies and other initiatives including the wood processing strategy, the growth and innovation strategy, energy strategies, the evolving transport strategy and regional development programmes.

"Overall, if New Zealand is to benefit fully from the new opportunities from the Kyoto Protocol, we need a vibrant and expanding forest industry."
