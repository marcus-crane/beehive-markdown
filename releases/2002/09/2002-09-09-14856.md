Minister for Information Technology Paul Swain has welcomed the Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand’s National Broadband Applications Project, launched in Wellington today.

The project will bring together a core group of 100 business and community leaders from ten particular sectors of the economy and society who will meet in Nelson in November to brainstorm how their sectors can embrace broadband technology.

“The initiative fits well with the Government’s overall broadband strategy and will particularly complement the Nationwide Broadband Strategy announced earlier this year,” said Mr Swain. “It’s the applications that will ultimately drive the use of broadband internet and be of benefit to communities and the economy.”

In addition to funding from nine commercial sponsors, the Ministry of Economic Development and Industry NZ have together committed $75,000 to the National Broadband Applications Project.

Mr Swain said he would like to thank the Minister of Economic Development Jim Anderton and the MED for contributing to the project.
