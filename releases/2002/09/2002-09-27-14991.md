Acting Finance Minister Trevor Mallard said that the business confidence figures in the latest National Bank survey show that fewer businesses in September expect business conditions to decline than was the case in August.

“This reflects the widespread belief in the capacity of the New Zealand economy to adjust to and weather external shocks despite recent developments on the world stage.”

“While New Zealand has been able to survive the global downturn last year in good shape, it is not immune from international risks. It is important that we do not under-estimate or over-exaggerate these risks,” Trevor Mallard said.

“At the moment business seems to be fairly comfortable with our economic outlook.”
