ACC is taking the safety message to children, road users, swimmers and boaties in its biggest-ever summer injury prevention campaign.

Launching the ThinkSafe Summer Campaign, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said people could enjoy themselves and be safe at the same time.

“While things we enjoy like swimming and boating are great fun, they can also be dangerous if people are careless. Swimming between the flags, always watching children near water, checking the marine forecast and wearing a life jacket when boating keep people safe without affecting their holiday enjoyment.”

Primary schools have already distributed more than 200,000 summer safety activity books to children aged 5-12, with a total of 300,000 likely to go before the high-profile safety blitz finishes at the end of January.

ACC chief executive Garry Wilson said a bit of planning could make the difference between a successful holiday and one with tragic consequences.

“Thinking safe doesn’t take a great effort. Things like checking tyres before heading off and planning breaks on the journey don’t take long, but they can make all the difference.”

Drivers could also reduce road deaths by keeping their speed down, he said.

“An average 1.5kph drop in speeds on the road has contributed to a steady decline in the road toll, from more than 500 fatalities three years ago to less than 440 in the year ended in September.”

ThinkSafe Summer has two parts. The first focuses on the lead-up to Christmas and the distribution of activity books and materials.

Television commercials go to air from December 15 and continue until the end of January.

Hard-hitting water safety advertisements, which have aroused comment when previously screened, will resume from December 26.  
Advertisements and posters in this period will also remind people of the preparations they can make to reduce the risk of injury once they are on holiday.  
The campaign’s second phase, beginning on 20 December, will have a strongly regional flavour, focusing on the eight popular holiday destinations: Bay of Islands, Coromandel, Taupo/Rotorua, Tauranga, Nelson, Hawkes Bay Auckland and Queenstown.

The regional programme will be spearheaded by local ACC injury prevention consultants who will lead teams of five or six students at the major holiday destinations.

The students will distribute the activity books, a million stickers and other safety materials including 250,000 posters, to holiday-makers.

Ms Dyson congratulated everyone involved in ThinkSafe Summer including BP, the Automobile Association, McDonalds, the Pharmacy Guild, the Motor Trade Association, Water Safety NZ, the Interislander and WaterSafe Auckland.

ThinkSafe Summer Messages

BoatSafe  
·Know the 'rules of the road' at sea so you can avoid collisions.  
·Always check the marine weather forecast before you go out. If in doubt, don't go out.  
·Ensure someone ashore knows where you are going, who is onboard and when you are due back.  
·Everyone in the vessel must have a correctly fitting life jacket – remember they only work when you wear them.  
·A responsible skipper ensures everyone on board knows what safety equipment is carried, where it is stowed and how to use it.  
·Don't go out with only children accompanying you. You need to have at least one other responsible adult aboard.

PoolSafe  
·ALWAYS supervise children near water.  
·Poolside surfaces are slippery – walk, don’t run.  
·Don’t be a fool in the pool – check the depth before you jump or dive in.  
·Ensure all pools and spas are securely fenced off (your local council can assist with the legal requirements).

RiverSafe  
·Don’t swim in strong currents.  
·Check the depth and for hidden objects before you dive in.  
·Rivers can change quickly. Check the riverbed each time you swim.  
·Never attempt to cross if the water is discoloured or there is debris being carried by the current. Always be prepared in case you are not able to cross.  
·Never swim alone

BeachSafe  
·Swim at beaches patrolled by surf lifeguards.  
·Swim between the flags.  
·Don’t swim or surf when you are tired and cold.  
·Know your limits; stay out if in doubt.  
·Never swim alone.

Safety on the Road  
·Share the driving on a long journey.  
·Keep your distance – only a fool breaks the two-second rule  
·Stick to the speed limit and drive to the conditions. Remember: sometimes the limit may be too fast for the conditions.  
·Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  
·Every time you’re in the car, whether you are going near or far, always remember to Make it Click! Ensure everybody is wearing the appropriate safety restraints.  
·Recognise the signs of tiredness: heavy eyes, day-dreaming, yawning. If you have these symptoms pull over and take a 20-minute break.  
·Keep alert. Watch out for pedestrians and other vehicles.  
·If you are on a motorcycle always wear protective clothing. A little sweat is preferable to a lot of blood.

Vehicle safety  
·Planning your summer trips means making sure your vehicle is safe and you have allowed plenty of travel time.  
·Plan your trip to allow for a 10-minute break every two hours.  
·Check your tyres, including the spare, are in good condition and properly inflated.  
·Replace any safety belts that are fraying, weak or have cuts in the material. A damaged or worn safety belt can break or stretch in a crash.  
·A full vehicle service is recommended before you make a long journey.  
·Ensure your mechanic inspects the condition of your brakes, tyres, suspension and exhaust.  
·Ensure all vehicle lights and indicators are working normally.  
·Never plan to drive your vehicle if it does not have a warrant of fitness.

Safety with Children  
·Supervision is essential, especially when you are in an unfamiliar place. Keep young children within sight and reach at all times.  
·When riding scooters, skateboards or bikes, make sure helmets and other safety gear is worn.  
·Anyone supervising young children near water must know how to swim and be familiar with resuscitation techniques.

Safety at Home  
·Avoid painful slips, trips and falls by ensuring all tools, bikes, toys and outside equipment are put away when you have finished using them.  
·Check your ladder is properly secured, top and bottom, before you use it.  
·Empty paddling pools when not in use.  
·Ensure all pools and spas are securely fenced off (your local council can assist with the legal requirements).
