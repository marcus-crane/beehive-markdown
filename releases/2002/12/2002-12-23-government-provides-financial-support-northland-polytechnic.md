A Crown loan of up to $5.5m is to be extended to Northland Polytechnic and a Crown Manager appointed to assist it to meet its operating requirements while a longer term plan to ensure its future viability is further developed.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said Northland Polytechnic has been facing significant financial difficulties. A Crown Observer was appointed to the Polytechnic’s Council earlier this year to help it face its financial issues. The loan and appointment of a Crown Manager gives the government some confidence that the polytechnic will be able to address its current weak financial position.

Steve Maharey said the government remains committed to developing long term options for viable tertiary education provision in Northland.

“The Polytechnic is now able to get on with the important work of refocusing itself on how it might better meet regional needs of students, business and industry in the New Year.

“The appointment of a Crown Manager should provide further capability to assist with this work.

“While I am deeply disappointed at the poor financial performance of Northland Polytechnic over the last few years, I understand that recent changes and a review at the Polytechnic should help to mitigate against a further deterioration in financial performance. The review aims to return Northland Polytechnic to viability in 2003 and with this financial support it should achieve this objective.

"Northland Polytechnic is working hard to secure its ongoing viability. There appears to be some way to go so that it can rectify losses recorded over the past two years. Ultimately the focus of this work is to ensure that the community has access to quality polytechnic-based tertiary education in the region that is aligned with the needs of students and industry,” Steve Maharey said.

Te Tai Tokerau MP Dover Samuels said he was pleased that government support has been made available for public tertiary education provision in Northland. Mr Samuels has been meeting with Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey on the future of Northland Polytechnic.

“The availability of quality tertiary education is an essential tool for the economic and social development of Northland. The government has shown that it is prepared to back its commitment to retaining tertiary education in our region with resources.

“This is a great Christmas present for Northlanders. I encourage students considering enrolling at Northland Polytechnic in 2003, but who have not yet done so because of concerns about the state of the institution, to sign up,” Dover Samuels said.
