NZ First leader Mr Peters scored another own-goal in his press statement on the jailed paua smugglers in Auckland, Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel said today.

"Mr Peters said the problems had started with 'stupid immigration policies that allowed criminals into the country in the first place'," Lianne Dalziel said.

"That comment is another classic own-goal by Mr Peters because the smugglers were granted New Zealand residence under the policies that were written in 1991 when he was a member of the Cabinet.

"Two of the smugglers were granted residence in 1992, one in '93, and one in 1997 when he was actually Deputy Prime Minister.

"Mr Peters should engage the brain before putting his mouth in gear."
