Health Minister Annette King says a strategy to reduce the crippling burden of cancer is essential in tackling this country's second leading cause of death.

"Most of our lives have been affected personally in some way by cancer, which accounts for more than a quarter of all our deaths. About 16,000 people develop cancer each year, excluding skin cancer, and about 7500 die as a result."

Ms King today launched a public discussion document: Towards a Cancer Control Strategy for New Zealand, outlining goals to reduce the incidence and impact of cancer in New Zealand.

She also launched a Health Ministry report Cancer in New Zealand: Trends and Projections, forecasting cancer risks and burdens over the next decade.

"This technical report will provide a stronger evidence base for the Cancer Control Strategy. Projections are particularly important to help plan for future need. Reducing the impact of cancer is one of the Government's top 13 health priorities.

"The aim of cancer control is to reduce the number of people who develop cancer and ensure a better quality of life for those who do develop the disease."

Ms King urged people to have their say on the discussion document. "Cancer control means addressing services, monitoring, workforce development and  
many other issues. This needs a real commitment and long-term involvement from stakeholders, the Government, non-government organisations, and the  
public."

The document, developed by the Ministry and the NZ Cancer Control Trust, encompasses cancer prevention, screening, early detection, treatment, rehabilitation, support and palliative care. It pulls together advice provided by five expert working groups and builds on work already done by the NZ Palliative Care Strategy, the NZ Cancer Treatment Working Party and the Paediatric Oncology Steering Group.

Towards a Cancer Control Strategy for New Zealand outlines six goals:  
·reducing the incidence of cancer through prevention  
·reducing death and disability through effective screening, early detection and treatment  
·improving timely access to effective and acceptable activities and services  
·improving the quality of life for those living with, recovering from and dying of cancer  
·improving the planning, co-ordination and integration of activities and services to control cancer  
·improving the planning, co-ordination and integration of cancer research, evaluation, monitoring and surveillance

Ms King said Cancer in New Zealand: Trends and Projections projects significant increases in the cancer burden from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s.

"It predicts increases of 50 percent for males and 44 percent for females for registrations, and 17 percent for males and 24 percent for females for mortality. These projections reflect mainly an increasing and ageing population."

The report projects that lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer mortality among females, while prostate cancer will emerge as the leading cause for males.

Ms King said a series of public meetings on the discussion document would be held throughout the country between now and mid-March. Feedback will be incorporated in the final strategy, due to be introduced mid-2003.

Public meetings will be advertised in local newspapers and a schedule of the meetings will be posted on the Ministry website www.moh.govt.nz, and the  
New Zealand Cancer Control Trust website: www.cancercontrol.org.nz.

Individuals or groups can access the document online and provide mailed or  
electronic submissions. All submissions are due by 5pm Friday, March 14 2003.

Questions and Answers

Towards a Cancer Control Strategy for New Zealand

What is "cancer control"?  
Cancer control is an organised approach to reducing the burden of cancer. It recognises that the disease cannot be eradicated in the foreseeable  
future, but its effects can be minimised. Cancer control aims to reduce the number of people who develop cancer and improve the quality of life for those who do develop it.  
Cancer control needs a planned, systematic and co-ordinated approach. Establishing a Cancer Control Strategy offers the most rational means to achieve the maximum degree of cancer control, even when resources are constrained.

Why do we need a cancer control strategy?  
While the standard of cancer control services is high here by international standards, the largely ad hoc way services have developed has led to some  
gaps and fragmentation.  
The lack of co-ordinated oversight over the last decade of workforce development has created chronic gaps and shortages in some areas of the cancer workforce, exacerbated by limited specialist training opportunities.  
This, coupled with inadequate funding, has resulted in unacceptable waiting times for people requiring treatment for their cancers, and inequitable access to services for socially disadvantaged and geographically isolated groups, unable to afford travel and other costs.

Who is the strategy aimed at?  
The Cancer Control Strategy is for all New Zealanders. It is also for professional and charitable agencies with a major involvement in cancer activities including Government and non-government agencies whose work impacts on the delivery of cancer services and activities, and the wide range of individuals involved in managing and delivering cancer activities and services.

By promoting an integrated approach to the provision of cancer control activities and services the strategy will encourage and assist providers to work more closely together, and provide a common understanding of where each provider fits in the overall spectrum of cancer control.

What principles are included in the discussion document?  
All actions to reduce the incidence and impact of cancer should be guided by the following principles:  
·Strive to maintain the autonomy and dignity of the individual and be sensitive to the needs of individuals and their families  
·Reduce inequalities between different populations  
·Provide timely and equitable access for all New Zealanders to cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care, regardless of their ability to pay  
·Provide high quality services that inspire confidence  
·Actively involve patients and communities at all levels  
·Provide a planned, co-ordinated and collaborative approach  
·Use an evidence-based approach  
·Respect the rights of people to make informed choices about their care  
·Recognise and respect cultural diversity  
·Acknowledge the special relationship between Maori and the Crown under the Treaty of Waitangi

Who are the groups that have worked to develop the cancer control strategy discussion document?  
The Ministry of Health has worked closely with the New Zealand Cancer Control Trust (NZCCT). A Cancer Control Steering Group was established in October 2001 to drive the development of a New Zealand Cancer Control Strategy. The steering group comprises members of the NZCCT, cancer control stakeholders and experts, and the Ministry of Health. Five small Expert Working Groups of representatives across the cancer control continuum, from  
prevention, screening and early detection, treatment, rehabilitation and support, to palliative care, provided advice for the discussion document.

What is cancer?  
Cancer is a generic term used to describe a group of over 100 diseases, which occur when malignant forms of abnormal cell growth develop in one or  
more organs. These cancer cells continue to divide to produce tumours. Cancer cells are malignant and can invade adjacent structures and spread via the lymph or blood to distant organs. Some of the biological mechanisms that change a normal cell into a cancer cell are known, while others are not.  
Cancer differs from most other diseases in that it can develop at any stage in life and in any body organ.

How will the Cancer Control Strategy be implemented?  
After the strategy has been finalised, an implementation plan will be developed by the New Zealand Cancer Control Steering Group. A phased introduction of the implementation plan may be required.

Cancer in New Zealand: Trends and Projections

How was the data collected?  
The Cancer Registry of the New Zealand Health Information Service (NZHIS) provided cancer incidence (registration) data for the years 1954-1998. For some cancers, data for early years had to be filtered out or adjusted because of major changes in reporting, coding or classification. The NZHIS provided cancer mortality data for the years 1970 to 1999, and Statistics New Zealand provided population estimates and projections for the years 1951 to 2016.

What cancers were looked at?  
Twenty-six cancer sites (22 for males and 24 for females) were selected for modelling, in addition to childhood cancer and all adult cancers.

How was the modelling done?  
Models are based on patterns in the historical data with respect to three time dimensions: age, period (year of diagnosis or death) and cohort (year  
of birth).  
These patterns are modelled and projected into the future, separately for incidence and mortality. The projections are from the five year period centred around 1996/97 to the five year period centred around 2011/12.

What will the projections be used for?  
The projections provide one way of assessing need. They will be helpful in developing, implementing and evaluating the Cancer Control Strategy, and should also be helpful for planning related services at District Health Boards.

How reliable are the projections?  
Future cancer rates are influenced by many factors, some not reflected in the historical patterns. So we would not expect the projections to accurately predict what actually happens, particularly the further out we go from the present. But where actual rates differ from projected rates, analysing the reasons may be useful. Projections will be updated regularly as new data becomes available.

What were some of the main projections?  
·The risk of cancer (all types combined) to increase slowly, while the burden (count) increases more steeply as a result of demographic forces (the increase in size and ageing of the population)  
·This increase in risk results from an increase in rates of non tobacco-related cancers.  
·The rates of tobacco-related cancers to fall in males, while some (eg lung cancer) continue to rise in females  
·Colorectal cancer incidence rates to fall in both genders  
·Melanoma incidence rates to fall in females and increase slowly in males  
·Stomach cancer incidence rates to continue to fall in both genders  
·More than 10 percent increases in incidence rates for several minor cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), kidney and bladder cancer  
·Prostate cancer incidence rates to increase steadily, while mortality rates increase only marginally  
·Breast cancer incidence rates to continue to increase while mortality rates decrease  
·Cervical cancer is projected to continue to decrease in both incidence and mortality rates (and counts)  
·Lung cancer to drop in ranking for males but increase to first place for mortality in females (overtaking breast and colorectal cancer)  
·Prostate cancer to become the first ranked cancer for both incidence and mortality in males.
