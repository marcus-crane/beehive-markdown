Auckland Issues Minister Judith Tizard says the government’s commitment to helping Auckland meet its infrastructure needs is even stronger with the release of the New Zealand Transport Strategy and the introduction of the Land Transport Management Bill today.

“The Labour-Progressive Government supports Auckland’s needs and this legislation will allow for more long-term planning of transport projects in the region,” says Judith Tizard.  
Transport Minister Paul Swain said the Bill introduces more flexible funding for transport projects and expands the roles of Transit New Zealand and Transfund to focus on land transport as a whole, and not just roads. To encourage more long-term planning, Transfund and organisations seeking funding from it would now have to prepare 10-year financial forecasts.  
“The current, narrowly-focused, short-term approach to land transport funding is not working for Auckland or New Zealand. The Land Transport Management Bill takes a much more creative approach. Auckland can look forward to improved road, rail, sea and air transport, and our communities will benefit from a growing economy and improved environment,” said Judith Tizard.  
“The Auckland region has the greatest capacity to increase New Zealand’s GDP earnings, but its infrastructure issues including transport affect its economic growth and its environment.  
“Today’s announcements build on the government’s Moving Forward package earlier this year and increased funding from Transfund in June, in meeting the commitment we made to the Auckland region three years ago to help implement its regional and passenger transport strategies to build an integrated, efficient transport network.  
“We bought back the Auckland rail corridor so that the region could develop the rail network to help address traffic congestion. We introduced patronage funding which has seen an increase in public transport use in Auckland.  
“Reducing traffic congestion continues to be the focus in Auckland, and I am particularly pleased that major projects are happening as a result of the $320 million in Transfund funding that has gone to Auckland in this financial year.  
“The first sod has already been turned on Auckland’s central motorway junction, which will reduce the heavy traffic demands on the city, and improve motorway links. Construction is also underway on Grafton Gully, the Puhinui Interchange, with funding of ongoing design work being allocated for the Greenhithe Deviation.  
“Among projects now on Transfund’s priority list for funding approval are investigating improvements to the length of motorway from Newmarket Viaduct to Greenlane and from the Harbour Bridge to Victoria Park Viaduct.”  
Judith Tizard, who is also Associate Transport Minister, said the Land Transport Management Bill is in-line with the New Zealand Transport Strategy, also released today, which defines the Government’s vision for the country’s transport system as ‘affordable, integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable’ by 2010.  
In 2002/03 alone, the Government will spend $1.5 billion on roading construction and maintenance, road safety initiatives, public transport assistance, promoting walking and cycling, and reducing the impact of transport on the environment.  
The Land Transport Management Bill will be referred to a select committee for consideration, and legislation is likely to be enacted in 2003.
