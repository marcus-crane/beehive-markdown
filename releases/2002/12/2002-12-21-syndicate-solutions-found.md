The taskforce set up to find accommodation for syndicate bases, should Team New Zealand retain the America’s Cup in 2003, has selected an extension to the Halsey St wharf as the preferred option, Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard announced today.

“At the end of the 2003 challenge, four syndicate bases will be lost because of commercial development. So it was critically important that a plan was in place to manage demand from current and new competitors should Team New Zealand successfully defend the challenge,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The preferred option will create an extra two bases for syndicates. The taskforce looked at options within the Auckland region, but its preference was for options in and around Viaduct Harbour. This reflected to a large degree the desire of challengers and Team New Zealand to retain the Village concept.”

“This solution should come as a relief to all the parties involved and ensures Auckland won’t lose out in the event of another Louis Vuitton and America’s Cup regatta in the city. The America’s Cup in 2000 generated an extra $640 million in economic activity, $473 million of that in Auckland.”

The taskforce, chaired by Trevor Mallard, included Auckland City Councillor Scott Milne, America’s Cup Village Ltd chairman Peter Kiely, Ports of Auckland CEO Geoff Vazey, Viaduct Holdings Ltd’s Rob Campbell, Team New Zealand’s Ross Blackman and Peter Harrison of the GBR syndicate.

The taskforce considered 13 options for additional bases, and over two months of intensive work the options were narrowed down to four that were all investigated in more detail.

Option 2 (a), the extension of the Halsey Street wharf to provide for two or three new bases, was selected as the first preference for a substantial change. The cost of this option is estimated at $16 million.

“This option won’t impact on the navigation within Viaduct Harbour. It will in fact increase the public viewing places as a new floating breakwater will be built.”

The taskforce also selected option 9, the widening of the western viaduct to the south to provide for two new bases, as its second preference in the event that the option 2 (a) didn’t proceed.

“Both options, in conjunction with a reconfiguration, will accommodate between nine and ten two-boat sites. If demand is greater than that, then it’s possible to pursue both options at the same time, which would result in up to twelve sites. “Alternative temporary accommodation will be readily available for storage while new construction proceeds,” Trevor Mallard said.

The Government will work with Auckland City, America’s Cup Village Ltd and its owner Infrastructure Auckland, and cup participants on funding options.  
Regulatory consent applications will be prepared over the next two months, with applications to be lodged at the end of the 2003 America’s Cup regatta.

The taskforce will also undertake further consultation with affected parties before the lodging of the applications, Trevor Mallard said.
