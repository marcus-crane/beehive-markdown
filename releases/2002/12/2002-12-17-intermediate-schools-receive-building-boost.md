Intermediate schools will receive a property boost of about $49 million to help bring them up to standards set in a new property guide, Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced today.

“The new property guide replaces a 32 year old code that was well past its use by date,” Trevor Mallard said.

“This guide will determine the quantity of property a school needs to deliver an effective learning and working environment for the 21st century.

“The $49 million means schools will get considerably more property resources – helping to meet the needs of new curricula and new technology.”

Under the new guide, schools will have the freedom to decide how best to use their extra property. This will enable them to develop different solutions to suit their own educational programs.

The guide provides for additional teaching spaces in the science areas, music, computers, dance and drama - an average of 29% increase in area over the old code. There are also increases in area for administration, library and multi-purpose spaces.

“It’s great that intermediate school principals have been so enthusiastic about this. Without their support, the current review couldn’t have been undertaken as efficiently and effectively as it has,” Trevor Mallard said.

Guides for primary and secondary schools have already been completed and together the three will be used to develop additional guides for schools teaching years 7-13 (inclusive), wharekura, area and middle schools.

“Intermediates will be brought up to the new guide’s standards progressively, with priority given to schools with the greatest area deficiencies. $50 million has been set aside this year to address deficiencies at Primary, Secondary and Intermediate schools.

14 intermediate schools will have their deficiencies addressed this year.
