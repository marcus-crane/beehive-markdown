Tënä koutou katoa.

Welcome and thank you for coming to the launch of the second edition of the Office of Treaty Settlements' Healing the Past, Building a Future.

The launch represents an important milestone in this government's commitment to the Treaty settlements process. It demonstrates the excellent progress made by the Crown over the past few years to develop a negotiation and settlement process that is constructive and fruitful.

Healing the Past, Building a Future has been revised in order to reflect both the development of policy since 1999, and the experience of iwi who have gone through the negotiations process in recent years. It also incorporates the government's principles for the resolution of historical Treaty claims that I released in 2000.

The book is designed as a guide to the settlement process - it gives a detailed explanation of the process to claimant groups and other interested parties, and it provides an easy reference for Crown officials to use in working with Treaty settlement issues.

It is also a valuable and accessible source of information for any member of the public who wishes to learn more about the Treaty settlements process. This guide will prove invaluable to the iwi who are just beginning the process of settlement, and to those groups still to come.

Thank you to those involved in revising the guide  
I wish to thank all those who have worked on the development of this revised edition - the staff at the Office of Treaty Settlements, and particularly Te Uri o Hau, Ngati Ruanui, Ngäi Tahu and the other groups who have allowed their experiences in the settlement process to be used in the guide.

**Recent progress in settlements**  
This launch is also an excellent opportunity for those involved in the Treaty sector to reflect on and celebrate the excellent progress made with Treaty settlements in the past few months. We have seen the new approach taken by the Waitangi Tribunal complement this government's more streamlined settlement process.

In my time as Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, I have seen many milestones in the settlement process reached, most recently Terms of Negotiation signed by the Crown and Te Rarawa - one of the iwi of the Far North - just last week. I have also, on behalf of the Crown, signed an Agreement in Principle with Ngä Rauru in May, and initialled Deeds of Settlement with Ngäti Awa in July and with and Ngäti Tuwharetoa (Bay of Plenty) in October. In October, the Te Uri o Hau Claims Settlement Act was passed into law, and the Ngäti Ruanui Claims Settlement Bill had its first reading in the House. To be part of the conclusion of the settlement process is a privilege and encourages all those who work so hard on Treaty settlements.

**Building on past experience**  
The settlement of Treaty of Waitangi claims is complex, and with every new settlement, the Crown and claimants face new and challenging issues. Although Treaty settlement policy is constantly developing, it is important to be consistent and fair, and to ensure the process moves forward smoothly. It is also important the lessons we have learned in the past do not get forgotten, so that we build on experience rather than having to reinvent the wheel. Making sure we note and explain these lessons is pivotal to the integrity of the settlement process. Not only does recognising past experience assist new negotiations to progress with knowledge and clarity, but it is also essential that the process is transparent and open, in order that negotiations are conducted in the utmost good faith.

**Role of government departments in settlements process**  
It is important everyone working within it understands the Treaty settlements process. There are about 10 government departments and agencies involved in the historical Treaty settlements process, which is co-ordinated and lead by the Office of Treaty Settlements. The high level of competency and dedication demonstrated by all those individuals working within the Treaty sector is integral to this dynamic and successful process.

**Public education on the Treaty and settlements**  
It is also important for the wider public to be able to find out how the Treaty settlement process works. This government is committed to informing the wider public about the significance of the Treaty of Waitangi for New Zealand, both in the past and for the future. Our nation cannot settle historical injustices without the support and understanding of its people. Healing the Past, Building a Future is one such mechanism, designed to make the settlements process clear and transparent to all. We have embarked on a journey as a nation, and bringing citizens with us is fundamental to its ultimate success.

**Conclusion**  
Thank you all for coming along to this launch. It is wonderful to see so many groups and agencies represented here today. Thank you for your commitment to the process, for your hard work, and for your encouragement.

Copies of Healing the Past, Building a Future are available here tonight, and can also be downloaded from the Office of Treaty Settlements' website. My officials will also be sending out copies of the guide to universities, libraries, schools and interest groups nation-wide.

I encourage you all to take advantage of the opportunity to talk to the Office of Treaty Settlements' staff here tonight, who are available to answer any questions you may have. Together we can look forward to further development, achievement, and resolution in the settlement of historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.
