Terrorism, climate change, the 20th anniversary of CER and the US-Australia free trade negotiations will all be discussion topics at talks between the New Zealand and Australian Foreign Ministers this weekend.

Foreign Minister Phil Goff will host his Australian counterpart, Hon Alexander Downer, in Taupo on 20-22 December 2002 for their regular six monthly Ministerial consultations.

"The agenda for the talks will concentrate on the major issues in our relationship. These include next year's 20th anniversary of CER. We will discuss ways we can appropriately mark this significant milestone, including possible initiatives for the future of the relationship.

“Global and regional issues will be discussed including the campaign against terrorism, Iraq, developments in the South Pacific and illegal migration and refugees.

“The talks come at the end of what has been a turbulent and, for Australia in particular, a tragic year. Our meeting will provide a useful opportunity for us to remember what we have in common and to reinforce and expand our unique relationship,” said Mr Goff.
