Key outdoor safety groups are to receive a funding boost in excess of $1m, Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins announced today.

The New Zealand Mountain Safety Council will receive $225,000, Water Safety New Zealand $506,500, and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard Federation $281,600.

Mr Hawkins said along with Surf Lifesaving New Zealand these were large, well-established, voluntary organisations which for many years had received substantial funding from the Lottery Grants Board.  
“However, a decline in Lotteries Commission profits has meant that the Lottery Grants Board has been unable to maintain the level of funding it provided in previous years,” Mr Hawkins said.

“Today’s announcements will meet short-term problems facing outdoor safety groups in the 2002/03 financial year, by funding the shortfall in allocations relative to 2001/02 Lottery Grants Board funding,” Mr Hawkins said.

Surf Life Saving New Zealand would not receive a grant as it recently received a grant of $500,000 from the New Zealand Community Trust, which would more than offset any reduction in funds from the Lottery Grants Board.

Mr Hawkins said the grants were a one-off, short-term measure.  
“These key organisations provide valuable service to New Zealand and it is important a lasting solution to their funding issues is found,” Mr Hawkins said.
