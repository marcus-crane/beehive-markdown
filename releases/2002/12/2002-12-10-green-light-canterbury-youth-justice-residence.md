Child, Youth and Family has been given the green light to proceed with the development of its new Canterbury youth justice residence, Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

No appeals were received on an earlier decision to develop a purpose-built residence, to be known as Youth Justice South, for up to 40 children and young people placed with Child, Youth and Family for care and control reasons on the Crown-owned Runners Road site.

Steve Maharey said he is pleased that a site acceptable to the community has finally been found for this much needed residence.

“I acknowledge the input of the surrounding community and the positive relationship that has been established with Child, Youth and Family in getting to this point.

“In particular the Canterbury Community Working Group, led by Jim Anderton, played a very important role in the selection, assessment and consultation of the Runners Road site.

“No appeals means that Child, Youth and Family now has the green light to get going on developing the 8.6 ha site and constructing the buildings that will make up the new residence.

“Work will start soon on improvements to Runners Road and the installation of a groundwater bore that will supply water to the residence. Early in 2003, the main earthworks and building construction will begin. Youth Justice South is expected to be operational in 2004.

“Once Youth Justice South is up and running, the youth justice activities currently at the Kingslea Residential Centre in Burwood will be relocated and the youth justice unit at Kingslea closed”, Steve Maharey said.
