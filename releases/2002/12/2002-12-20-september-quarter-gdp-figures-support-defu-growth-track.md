“The GDP figures for the September quarter support the growth track in the December Economic and Fiscal Update,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

“This augurs well for the New Zealand economy as we move into summer,” Dr Cullen said.

The figures show activity increased 1 per cent over the quarter and 3.9 per cent over the year. The growth was driven by the household sector and by tourism and continues the solid economic performance of the last four quarters
