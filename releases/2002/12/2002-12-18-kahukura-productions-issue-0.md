“The issues resulting from the Kahukura Productions collapse have to be sorted out for the good of the New Zealand film-making and film-watching community,” Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard said today.

“The New Zealand Film Commission has kept me well informed since the earliest indications of Kahukura’s difficulties. The commission has sought appropriate legal advice in their efforts, throughout the liquidation proceedings, to have the films released and the creditors of Crime Story paid.

“Everyone regrets Kahukura’s collapse and the commission has worked conscientiously to deal with a serious and complex situation that is not of their making.

“I note that during these unfortunate circumstances, the commission has continued to fund the development and production of New Zealand films and brought a delegation of overseas film producers to New Zealand which has resulted in five co-production agreements. The commission continues to work to improve script development and has made commitments to a wide range of new and ongoing projects.

“I also note that though the funding arrangements for Kahukura Productions Limited were similar to those used several times in the past, the commission has now changed its policies to require separate shelf companies to be established for each individual production, thus avoiding similar problems with any future production funding agreements.

“Once Kahukura’s affairs are wound up and I have seen the liquidator’s report, I am happy to get advice as to whether more information or investigation is needed, and I am happy to meet anyone, especially Peter Jackson, with concerns about the Film Commission’s work.

“The commission’s staff and board members are continuing to work in the best interests of the New Zealand film industry, but the Film Commission has to work within its Act and will continue to do so to achieve the best possible outcome for everyone.”
