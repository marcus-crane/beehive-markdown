Minister for State Owned Enterprises Mark Burton has today released previously unpublished information pertaining to allegations regarding the Airways Corporation of New Zealand’s 2000 bid for a share of UK-based National Air Traffic Services.

Mark Burton said that “the information was previously withheld, as the bid was still in progress. Now, however, this process has been concluded, and I have decided that, with the passage of time, it is appropriate to release further details.

“It is important to note that this information is not new. It was available in full to both myself and the Auditor-General when the original allegations were made. To be properly understood, It should be considered in conjunction with the Auditor-General’s original report, as well as with the substantial documentation that I released in 2001.”
