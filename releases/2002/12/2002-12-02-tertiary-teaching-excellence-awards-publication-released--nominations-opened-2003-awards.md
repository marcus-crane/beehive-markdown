A new publication profiling recipients of the 2002 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards was released today at the Association of University Staff annual conference by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

The 2002 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards publication released today describes the work of the 2002 recipients who received their awards in June. The awards were made for the first time in 2002. The booklet aims to promulgate these examples of outstanding teaching practice throughout the tertiary education sector. Nominations were also called today for the 2003 awards

Steve Maharey said the Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards recognise excellence in tertiary teaching, promote good teaching practice and enhance career development for tertiary teachers.

“Government sees the awards as an important element of the Tertiary Education Strategy. Excellent teaching is essential in all education and training and we have not recognised this adequately in the tertiary sector in the past.

“We hope other tertiary teachers will be able to read about the philosophies and techniques of this year’s winners and use the information to review and refine their own teaching.

“The tertiary teachers recognised in June are using their awards to improve their teaching practice:  
·Supreme Award winner Welby Ings (Auckland University of Technology) will be contributing most of the award towards his PhD research. He has also used the award to purchase electronic equipment for use in his classes and to assist him to attend and speak at two International Design Educators next year;  
·Sustained Excellence Award winner Tim Bell (University of Canterbury) has used the funds to purchase equipment to help him with multimedia presentations. This equipment will assist with the "unplugged" programme Tim runs; and,  
·Sustained Excellence Award winner Delwyn Clark (University of Waikato) used her award to extend her study trip to the United States. She has also been invited to contribute to a special forum on innovative case teaching at the International Strategic Management Society Conference in altimore next year.

“Up to nine awards will be available again next year for excellence across three categories as well as a supreme award. The categories are Sustained Excellence, Excellence in Innovation and Excellence in Collaboration. The recipients of the excellence awards receive $20,000 each and the winner of the supreme award receives $30,000.

“Professor Graeme Fraser, Assistance Vice- Chancellor (Academic) at Massey University, will again chair the selection committee, consisting of representatives from throughout the tertiary sector,” Steve Maharey said.

All tertiary providers, including universities, wananga, polytechnics, colleges of education and private training establishments, have been invited to make nominations for the 2003 awards. Nominations close on 31 March 2003 and recipients will be announced at a ceremony in mid-2003. The awards are administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.
