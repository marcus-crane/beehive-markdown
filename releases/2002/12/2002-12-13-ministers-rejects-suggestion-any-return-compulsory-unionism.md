The review of the Employment Relations Act will include consideration of how collective bargaining provisions can be strengthened and I am sure that the government will receive a number of proposals around this, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

“The government has an open mind as to how this may be achieved and is not yet actively considering any specific proposals. I would note that bargaining agents fees are not part of Labour Party policy.”

One of the objectives of the Act is promotion of freedom of association and there is no intention to undermine that, Margaret Wilson said.
