On this, Human Rights Day, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio Vieira De Mello has sent Member States the following message:

*"We commemorate today the creation of one of the most important testaments of our times: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is an occasion to reflect on our human rights achievements as well as to rededicate ourselves to overcoming our shortcomings."*  
(Sergio Vieira de Mello UN High Commissioner for Human Rights)

In this context, I am delighted to be here this evening at the launch of the National Plan of Action for Human Rights. I cannot think of a more appropriate way for New Zealanders to commemorate and celebrate Human Rights Day than with the launch of a Plan of Action for Human Rights in New Zealand. The development and implementation of a National Plan of Action for New Zealand is a rededication of our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in this country.

To be credible, an action plan must be built around a commitment to universal human rights principles. These principles must be the standard for a new era of communication and collaboration between the government and people to ensure New Zealand's long-term social and economic future. For, it is increasingly recognised that not only are these principles important to the wellbeing of individuals and communities but they are an essential component of economic and social progress.

The concept of developing a national plan of action for human rights was first proposed by Australia at the World Conference in Vienna in 1993. The basis of Australia's recommendation was simply that external pressure to bring about change is not effective and in order to advance human rights, a commitment from a nation's government and people is necessary. Since the World Conference, a number of states have developed national plans of action for human rights and human rights education. Countries that have developed full national plans of action that have been lodged with the Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights include: Australia, Canada, Norway, and South Africa. Now, it is time for New Zealand to take up the challenge.

In its simplest form, a National Plan of Action represents a strategic plan for the long-term fulfilment of international human rights obligations and implementation of domestic human rights policies and standards. However, international experience in countries that have already developed a NPA reflects the reality that there is no single form a plan should take. Clearly it should reflect certain general principles such as transparency and accountability but it is important each country start from its own actual political, cultural, historical and legal circumstances. To achieve this end, the process for the development of this plan must be fully consultative and include the active participation of government.

As many of you will know, in May 2000, the government commissioned an independent ministerial re-evaluation of human rights protections in New Zealand. This re-evaluation team was directed, among other things, to consider whether New Zealand would benefit from a NPA and, if necessary, to recommend a process for its development. In summary, the re-evaluation team recommended that:

1. The Government begin a consultative process for the development of a NPA in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (1993).
2. The \[Human Rights] Commission be the lead agency that drives the NPA.
3. A high level steering group be established to support the Human Rights Commission.
4. Senior government representatives be closely involved in all stages of the development process. This recognises that the NPA will require governmental action and endorsement.

With these recommendations and a number of other recommendations in mind Government developed and passed the Human Rights Amendment Act 2001. This legislation reflects the recommendations of the re-evaluation report team and recognises that it is time for the government and our national human rights institutions to work together to facilitate greater public discussion and education of all human rights. Accordingly, this Act provides that a function of the Commission is "to develop a national plan of action, in consultation with interested parties, for the promotion and protection of human rights in New Zealand" (section 5(2)(m)).

The Commission plays a vital role in legitimising and communicating human rights values in society and in extending protection and assistance to vulnerable groups. This role makes the Commission the ideal body to be charged with the development of a NPA. The task of developing a NPA is a valuable opportunity for the Commission to facilitate frank and free discussion within the community about the various dimensions of human rights, and to further its role of education and advocacy.

I think it is particularly important to emphasise also that this project must be regarded as a national undertaking involving all elements of society. For it to be effective and meaningful it must be owned by the entire population and will require productive cooperation between government and civil society.

The National Plan of Action will be an integrated and systematic national strategy to help realise the advancement of human rights in New Zealand. It will be:

- an audit of the human rights situation in our country that identifies areas in need of protection and improvement,
- a commitment to concrete measures that can be adopted to build and entrench a culture of human rights for the enjoyment of all, and
- a framework for sustained and coordinated ways for the country as a whole to protect and promote human rights in the next five years.

The NPA may raise significant issues relating to legislation, policies, priorities and funding so it must not be rushed. I am pleased the Commission has set up a process that will enable all sectors of the community to be involved. Setting targets that can be measured and are clearly achievable will also be vital to the plan's credibility. A comprehensive and structured approach will be more likely to ensure that the concerns of specific or vulnerable groups, such as children, minorities and migrants are effectively addressed. This plan will not only be a strategic blueprint for the future development of human rights protections but it will also be used by the government and civil society to monitor and assess the observance of such rights and protections.

On that note, I wish to take this opportunity to thank and commend the Human Rights Commission for the preliminary and planning work it has done on this project to date. I am reassured in the knowledge that this project will be led and advanced by such a committed and experienced body of human rights advocates and I am confident the Commission will rise to the occasion and formulate a plan that is coherent, progressive and welcomed by New Zealanders.

As I noted earlier, the Plan also requires the commitment and support of government and many government agencies. I am pleased to record the support of my colleagues for the launch of the project. A Government Liaison Committee of key departments has also been set up to advise the Commission and facilitate public sector input to the plan.

To conclude, today marks the anniversary of a momentous occasion in the history of the world. It is fitting we are here to celebrate and to mark this day with the launch of a progressive plan for the advance of human rights protections in New Zealand. Each of us here today recognises that the understanding and effective promotion of human rights at both the international and domestic levels is a constantly evolving process. As such, a National Plan of Action for Human Rights in New Zealand will no doubt be an integral part of this country's evolution. I have no doubt the fulfilment of human rights in this country will strengthen social harmony and will advance the process of sustainable development.

Once again, I thank the Commission for taking up the challenge on behalf of all New Zealanders and extend the best wishes and support of the Government to this endeavour.
