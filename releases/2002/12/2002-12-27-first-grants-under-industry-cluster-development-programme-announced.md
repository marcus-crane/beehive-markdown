Regions and industries will benefit from Jim Anderton’s announcement today of $562,000 from Industry New Zealand to support twenty industry clusters in a range of key industries.

Industry Clusters including wood processing, film production, organics and software will receive $28,125 each to engage a facilitator. The facilitators will work to share expertise, identify common goals, and develop shared supplier and marketing information so that the individual businesses in the cluster can all prosper.

“By supporting industry clusters, regions and groups of businesses can co-ordinate their strengths and use their combined size to generate increased sales as well as taking advantage of savings,” said Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“I am pleased to see Industry New Zealand has funded clusters in all three key Government innovation industries, biotech, Information and Computer technology and in the creative industries.

“Sixty proposals were received. The funding was allocated to clusters that offered the greatest benefits to their regions and were clearly aligned with their region’s economic development strategy, said Jim Anderton.

Clusters can include universities, CRIs, polytechnics, expert advisers, distributors, retailers and customers linked in a value-adding chain.

The Cluster Development Programme builds on the pilot cluster programme run by Industry New Zealand from January to June this year.

The pilot provided insights into how the development programme should be run and identified the benefits that participants in the pilot experienced. Those benefits included a focused commitment from a cluster facilitator, a catalyst for further action, establishing the credibility of clustering as a tool, and the build up of networks and trust.

Negotiations are underway for AFT to provide the Agritech cluster with a farm and dairy in Pennsylvania, and the cluster will provide a NZ share milker and NZ agricultural equipment, dairy bull semen, machinery, electric fences and consultancy advice. The demonstration farm will act as a selling point for NZ Agritech members and encourage more USA dairy farmers to adapt and adopt appropriate New Zealand farming practices.
