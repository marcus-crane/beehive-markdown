“The 2003 Budget will reinforce the government’s reputation as a careful fiscal manager and advance New Zealand further along the path to a strongly growing and socially cohesive society,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

He was commenting on the release of the 2003 Budget Policy Statement and the 2002 December Economic and Fiscal Update.

The BPS establishes the broad parameters in which next year’s budget will be set. It identifies four priority areas:  
·higher living standards for all through growth and innovation, including initiatives to develop, attract and retain skills and talent and to increase New Zealand’s global connectedness;  
·supporting a productive and cohesive society through investing in health, education and social services and through the establishment of a Commission for the Family;  
·reducing crime and the impacts of crime; and  
·investing for the future through a broad-based capital programme and through the partial pre-funding of New Zealand Superannuation.

“These were all strong themes in our previous term and will be continued through our next three budgets, beginning with the 2003 Budget,” Dr Cullen said.

The documents show a benign economic outlook and a strengthening fiscal position.

“The New Zealand economy has been one of the stronger performing economies  
in the OECD over the last few years and is projected to continue to perform strongly.

“Growth is tipped to average a little above 3 per cent and wage increases a little under 3.5 per cent a year over the forecast period; inflation to stay firmly within the 1 to 3 per cent band and unemployment to remain at roughly current levels.

“And, while some deterioration is likely in the current account deficit, it is not expected to exceed 5 per cent of GDP.

“Fiscal projections are for a pattern of rising surpluses: $3.5 billion in 2002-03, $3.8 billion in 2003-04, $4.5 billion in 2004-05 and $5.2 billion in 2005-06.

“This represents a significant improvement on the surplus track contained in the 25 June Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update and reflects a higher tax take together with lower finance costs arising from lower debt levels.

“The borrowing programme for the current year has been cut back by $900 million to $2.5 billion. The forecast for next year has been cut back from $5.6 billion to $3.4 billion.

“Gross debt is already below the government’s target of 30 per cent of GDP and is projected to keep falling steadily.

“These figures show we are well on the way to achieving our fiscal targets. But the risks to growth are mostly on the downside and, as the weaker growth scenario in the Defu demonstrates, even a small change to the growth path would move the fiscal numbers around significantly.

“So it is important that we maintain a tight fiscal stance,” Dr Cullen said.

The 2002 Fiscal Strategy Report flagged the government’s intention to shift away from a three year spending cap toward a more flexible and responsive form of fiscal management. The BPS explains how the new approach will work.

“Basically instead of managing to a pre-set figure established at the start of the Parliamentary cycle, the government will manage to its operating balance and gross debt tracks. It will formally reassess its spending requirements at the start of each budget round, and will include both operating and capital spending in the calculation.

“The solitary focus on operational spending has led to gaming and has created a number of perverse incentives. This new system is saner, cleaner and much more honest.”

The spending package outlined in the BPS has three main components:  
·$1.1 billion in 2003-04 and $1.05 billion in each of the next two years for new operating expenditure;  
·$800 million in 2003-04, $500 million in 2004-05 and $360 million in 2005-06 for capital spending;  
·$1.2 billion in 2002-03, $1.8 billion in 2003-04, $2.146 billion in 2004-05 and $2.310 billion in 2005-06 towards the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

“In our previous term, we achieved one of the strongest sets of Crown accounts in the OECD while also establishing a positive role for the government in the economy and delivering on our key social objectives. We plan to build on that heritage over the next three years to the greater good of all New Zealanders,” Dr Cullen said.
