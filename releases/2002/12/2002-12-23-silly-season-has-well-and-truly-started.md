It is demonstrably clear the silly season has started, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today in response to a claim by National that the new health and safety legislation effectively bans smoking.

“The Bill has not suddenly identified second hand smoke as a hazard,” she said. “It has always been a significant issue particularly in the hospitality sector.

“Employers and employees have had a duty under the Health and Safety in Employment Act for the past 10 years to identify hazards and take all practicable steps to ensure health and safety in the workplace,” Margaret Wilson said.
