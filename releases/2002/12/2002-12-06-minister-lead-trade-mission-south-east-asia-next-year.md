Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton is to lead a trade mission to Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines in March.

Mr Sutton said the trade mission, proposed for March 19-29 next year, would focus on timber and building products, food processing, and consultancy services.

He said there were significant opportunities for New Zealanders in the Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

The Philippines is New Zealand’s 13th largest market, growing at around 5% a year.

Opportunities exist for companies involved in timber, wood processing, building products, food processing equipment and a wide range of consultancy services. New Zealand will also have a significant presence at WORLDBEX (17-23 March), a major building products (including timber products) trade show in Manila at this time.

Cambodia is a small but rapidly growing market for New Zealand. Opportunities exist for companies involved in transport infrastructure (road, rail, port, airport), tourism development, power generation, agriculture/food production and consulting services.

Viet Nam is another rapidly growing market and New Zealand exports to Viet Nam have already reached almost half the level of the exports to the Philippines. Growth is expected to continue at high levels and timber exports, for example, rose by over 50% in the past year. Opportunities also exist for companies involved in consultancy, from infrastructure development to energy. Food processing technology is also sought after.
