Police Minister George Hawkins has welcomed the addition of 78 more police officers, following tomorrow’s graduation ceremony at Porirua’s Police College.

The 78 graduates from the Sir Ivor Richardson Wing 207, will include 63 male and 15 female officers. Of these, 34 are bound for Auckland including 16 for Counties Manukau, 11 for Auckland City, and 7 for North Shore/Waitakere Rodney.

Of the 258 officers to graduate from the Police College in the 15 weeks since 23 August, 109 have gone to the Auckland area, including 78 in the 10 weeks since 4 October, Mr Hawkins said.

“It is expected another two wings due to graduate on 21 February and 28 March next year, will place another 87 officers in the three Auckland areas,” Mr Hawkins said.

These, along with the 80 experienced officers expected to arrive in Auckland from the United Kingdom in the new year, the start of the modern cadet trainee programme, the funding of 60 non-sworn support staff, and the bringing in from around the country of other officers, would continue to allay public perception of a shortage of officers in Auckland.

Canterbury would receive 12 new officers, Wellington 8, Eastern 6, Bay of Plenty 6, Central 5, Southern 3, Northland 2 and Waikato 1 following tomorrow’s graduation ceremony, Mr Hawkins said.
