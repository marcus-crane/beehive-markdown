Associate Minister of Energy, Harry Duynhoven today launches PowerSafe, an industry and government initiative to improve electrical safety.

“PowerSafe is a blueprint for New Zealand's electricity industry to improve safety with electricity and electrical products over the next five years and beyond,” said Mr Duynhoven.

"This blueprint is the result of 18 months' cooperative effort between industry, consumer and government representatives on electrical safety issues," Mr Duynhoven said. "It observes international best practice, with solutions tailored for New Zealand conditions. PowerSafe covers the spectrum of electricity suppliers and users, including transmission and distribution companies, small and large industrial users, appliance suppliers and workers."

From recent accident information reported to the Energy Safety Service, on average 77 people are injured each year from using electricity, and 5 are killed. These figures do not include electrically caused fires, where on average another 46 are injured and 7 killed every year.

The industry will maintain a forum to implement and monitor the PowerSafe safety objectives. It will consider technology change and compliance costs in delivering improved safety.

"An active and responsive approach to safety is especially important given the level of innovation and change in the industry," Mr Duynhoven said. "The New Zealand market for electrical products changes rapidly, with new and more diverse products continually being introduced.

“Everyone has a responsibility to enhance safety in such a changing environment. PowerSafe provides the industry with the focus to do that, with measures to improve the safety awareness and behaviour of consumers as well as the electrical industry. This is a visionary and practical safety plan for the electrical industry."
