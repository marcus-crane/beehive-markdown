Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel said today that a decision on whether to recommend control be declared on airfield activities at Auckland International Airport would not now be made until late in the first quarter of 2003.

The delay is due to the complexity of the issues involved, and the need to give full consideration to the Commerce Commission's final report and the submissions received.

The Commerce Commission reported to the Minister of Commerce on 1 August 2002 on its inquiry into airfield activities at the major international airports. It recommended that airfield activities at Auckland International Airport be subject to control.
