Minister of Tourism Mark Burton has today welcomed the results of Statistics New Zealand’s latest accommodation survey.

The survey indicates that the underlying trend in guest nights has been increasing since June 1998. Total guest nights for the year ended October 2002 showed an increase of 6 percent in comparison to the October 2001 figures, and 14 percent higher than October 2000.

“Tourism continues to represent one of New Zealand’s most promising economic opportunities. Tourism is becoming a key driver of economic development in New Zealand, with foreign exchange earnings from overseas visitors jumping 95 percent since 1997 to a total of almost $6 billion.  
“Earnings are up 14 percent on 2001 alone, and 88 percent of all visitors say they will return to New Zealand.  
“Tourism is a big industry with an even bigger future, and these figures support that.”  
International guest nights increased by 11 percent and domestic guest nights by 3 percent. The North Island registered an increase of 8 percent in total guest nights, with the South Island up 4 percent.

Mark Burton is impressed by the sector’s ongoing positive growth.

“Tourism is playing an important role in New Zealand’s economy. Our focus continues to be on promoting New Zealand as a sustainable, world-class, high-quality, year-round destination.

“The current tourism market is creating challenges for the industry world-wide. However, these statistics prove New Zealand’s tourism market is continuing to grow and prosper.

“A key factor in the tourism sector’s success has been the partnerships the Government has forged with the industry. As a result of these relationships, a positive and cooperative environment has developed, where industry-wide solutions to ongoing issues of sustainability are being developed.

“I thank the entire industry for their hard work, and congratulate them for the success that is reflected by these statistics.”
