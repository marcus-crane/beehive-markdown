A family whose daughter died when a farm bike overturned, today helped launch a resource kit and video aimed at keeping children safe around All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs).

The Bowling family of Marlborough joined Police Minister George Hawkins, ACC Minister Ruth Dyson, and children from Lower Hutt’s Dyer St School in the Beehive Theatrette to launch the kit.

Eight-year-old Georgina Bowling was killed when the four-wheeled bike on which she was a passenger overturned on the family farm in October 2000.

Police minister George Hawkins welcomed the resource, particularly its message that no child under 16 years should drive an ATV.

“Given that the summer school holidays are nearly here and more children and young visitors will be around farms, it is timely to remind people that ATVs are farm machinery and not toys,” Mr Hawkins said.

ACC Minister Ruth Dyson said the video and resource book sent a strong message to children, adults and communities about the dangers of ATVs.

“The video and workbook are an excellent educational resource, with a powerful message about the dangers of ATVS, especially for children. I commend and admire Georgina’s family for working with ACC and the Police to share their experience of their daughter’s death and help prevent similar deaths from occurring.”

The video was funded by ACC for distribution by Police Education Officers.
