New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Iran’s Minister for Research, Science and Technology, Dr Mostafa Moein, jointly announced today a new bilateral arrangement to facilitate study in New Zealand by Iranian students and the creation of joint PhD programmes by Iranian and New Zealand universities.

Under the arrangement New Zealand will accept up to thirty Iranian government-funded post-graduate students a year for study at New Zealand universities said Mr Goff.

Iran’s Ministry for Research, Science and Technology will select the students and has already concluded Memoranda of Understanding with several New Zealand universities at which students will be placed. The Iranian government will provide sponsorship and support for the students, while the New Zealand government will facilitate the issue of their visas in Tehran instead of in Singapore where most visas are issued.

The arrangement marks a further significant strengthening of the relationship between New Zealand and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

“New Zealand is an internationally recognised provider of top quality education services and we look forward to the entry of Iran’s students into our universities,” Mr Goff said.

The new arrangement was welcomed by Dr Moein. “My Ministry is committed to securing opportunities for overseas study for our talented students who can then return equipped to make valuable contributions to Iran’s further economic and social development,” he said.
