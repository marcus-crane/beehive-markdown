Environment Minister Marian Hobbs today announced the membership of Toi te Taiao: The Bioethics Council, which was recommended by the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification.

"The council is an advisory body charged with enhancing New Zealand's understanding of the cultural, ethical and spiritual aspects of biotechnology," Marian Hobbs said, "and ensuring that the values held by New Zealanders are considered in its use.

"The Bioethics Council is an essential plank in the regulation of GM which the government undertook to establish before the moratorium expires next October.

"The people appointed are well respected in their communities and exemplify the key attributes required of the council. This includes an open and inquiring mind and the ability to deal with complex issues, the respect and trust of their peers and the community, good judgement, excellent communication skills and time to dedicate to the Council.  
"The collective membership brings a range of skills, including knowledge of science particularly biotechnology, ecology, and social science, tikanga Mâori, Mâori development, ethics, cultural and spiritual values of New Zealanders."
