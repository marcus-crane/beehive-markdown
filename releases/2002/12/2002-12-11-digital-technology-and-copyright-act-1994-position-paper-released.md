Associate Commerce Minister Judith Tizard has announced the release of a position paper “Digital Technology and the Copyright Act 1994”.

The Ministry of Economic Development paper outlines the Ministry’s suggested policy responses to the issues arising from the current review of the implications of digital technology for the Copyright Act 1994. It also gives further consideration to issues raised by relevant new international standards, in particular the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organisation "Internet Treaties".

“New Zealand’s intellectual property laws, including the Copyright Act, are an important element of our innovation framework,” said Judith Tizard. “Copyright is the basis of legal protection for the creative industries and is also vital in any industry that involves design or planning, the production of consumer goods or the expression of ideas or information.”

The position paper forms the basis for a second round of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including copyright owners, creators and users of works of copyright.

“I encourage submissions from authors, musicians, producers, directors, copyright owners, users of copyright works and the wider public on the proposals discussed in the paper,” said Judith Tizard.

Submissions will be considered in the development of policy recommendations to be presented to the government on possible legislative reform and New Zealand's possible accession to new international copyright treaties.

Submissions on the position paper should be sent to:

Attention: Victoria Pearson  
Regulatory and Competition Policy Branch  
Ministry of Economic Development  
PO Box 1473
