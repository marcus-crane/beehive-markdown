Health Minister Annette King said she was pleased to confirm the new Chair of the Health Research Council is Massey University’s Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Graeme Fraser.

Professor Fraser has chaired over 20 committees and participated in many more during his time at Massey University.

As Professor of Sociology at Massey University, Professor Fraser’s roles have included being the head of Massey’s Sociology Department, managing the University’s Child Care Centre, chairing the Doctoral Research Committee and conducting reviews of several key areas of the University’s operation.

Professor Fraser has also been appointed to various statutory bodies, including the Naitonal Research Advisory Council and the Medical Research Council.

Ms King said the main functions of the Health Research Council include: to advise the Health Minister on national health research policy; to administer funds to implement national health policy; to foster the recruitment, education, training and retention of those engaged in New Zealand health research; and to promote and distribute the results of health research.

“With such a diverse and full background, Professor Fraser is very well suited to chair the Health Research Council. I look forward to his contribution in this new role,” said Ms King.
