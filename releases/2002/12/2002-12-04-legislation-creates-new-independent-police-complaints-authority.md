Justice Minister Phil Goff introduced legislation today which is part of the Government’s move to enhance the independence of the Police Complaints Authority.

The Independent Police Complaints Authority Amendment Bill amends the Police Complaints Authority Act 1988.

“The Bill and funding to employ independent investigators will give the re-named Independent Police Complaints Authority an enhanced investigative capacity of its own, independent of the police.

“The legislation arises from the review of the PCA conducted by Sir Rodney Gallen. Concerns about the perceived lack of independence of the Authority were at the heart of the review.

“The changes this Bill will bring do not reflect a dissatisfaction with the PCA’s track record. During its 14 years in existence, the overwhelming majority of complaints dealt with have been shown to be thorough and fair.

“But it is vital for the public confidence in the body that there be no doubt as to the impartiality of the investigations and findings of the PCA.

“That is reflected in the adoption of the major decision arising out of Sir Rodney’s Review to provide the PCA with an enhanced investigative capacity of its own. While the Authority has statutory authority to conduct its own investigations, it lacks the resources to do so.

“A investigative team of six will be established under the new legislation consisting of a team leader, four investigators and a support person. Budget 2002 provided for $307,000 in new money to help establish this team with a further $885,000 additional funding from 2003/04 onwards.

“It is envisaged the IPCA will initially undertake independent investigations of the most serious cases such as those where a member of the Police acting in the execution of duty causes, or appears to cause, death or serious bodily harm to a person.

“Currently the PCA is a single person. The Bill provides for the membership of the Independent Police Complaints Authority to increase to three members. The Chair will be a current or retired Judge and will be supported by two other members. The expansion of the authority’s membership will allow for a wider representation from the community and will assist in engendering confidence in its independence.

“After 14 years of operation it was sensible to look at how the PCA could be improved and its independence enhanced. Sir Rodney’s review was a valuable step in this process and this legislation will complete the task,” Mr Goff said.
