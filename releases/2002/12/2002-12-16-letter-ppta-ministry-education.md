Dear Kevin

Ministers have reviewed whether the Alternative Dispute Resolution Panel should be reconvened to reconsider and finally resolve the issue of G3 Equivalent Teachers.

Ministers decided before last week’s mediation that they would be willing to see the Panel reconvened if necessary.

They have now confirmed that the Panel should be reconvened pursuant to recommendation 14 of the Panel’s final recommendations dated 19 August 2002.

As a consequence, I will be making arrangements to reconvene the Panel with all possible speed.

I should explain the background to this decision.

Government does not concede that there is any legal obligation to reconvene the Panel on recommendation 14, and remains of the view that reference of this issue to the Ministerial Taskforce on Secondary Teacher Remuneration would be appropriate.

However, Government acknowledges the urgent need to resolve the issue relating to G3 Equivalent Teachers.

You will be aware that considerable progress has been made on assessing qualifications as comparable to a degree, or level 7, on the Qualifications Framework. This work is on-going and will be made available to the Panel.

Yours sincerely

Chris Collins  
Senior Manager
