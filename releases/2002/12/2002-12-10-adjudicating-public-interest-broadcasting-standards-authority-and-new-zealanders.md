Introduction

It’s a pleasure to be here and to have the opportunity to speak as Minister of Broadcasting to you all, to look back at what has been achieved in the broadcasting portfolio in recent times, and to consider what we want to get done in the year ahead.

To those who fear that this sounds ominously like a strategic planning session, let me reassure you that Peter and Evan have helpfully provided me with a time limit, at the same time as they have, perhaps recklessly, given me my head in terms of speaking on ‘broadcasting matters of concern to me’.

Looking back on 2002

My own view is that 2002 was an important year in terms of our continuing to develop the platform for the effective involvement of government in broadcasting.

Parliament will soon pass the Television New Zealand Bill. This legislation changes the organisational form of the state television broadcaster and ensures that it is no longer bound by solely commercial considerations. The legislation also contains the Charter, which will guide TVNZ in becoming more responsive to the expectations and requirements of its diverse New Zealand audiences.

This year has also seen the development of the Code of Practice for New Zealand Music Content on Radio. This was developed in response to a government position paper, though it is very much the Radio Broadcasting Association’s creation, and will be operated and monitored by the Association. This shows what can be achieved when members of the broadcasting sector look strategically at the role they can play in supporting New Zealand creative talent - and giving New Zealanders the opportunity to hear the expression of their own culture on the radio.

A key role in our broadcasting environment is of course played by NZ On Air, whose wide area of responsibility includes the promotion of New Zealand music; funding locally made television programmes; funding public radio networks; and supporting Access Radio.

The government this year increased the baseline funding for NZ On Air to $97.121 million per annum. This is a considerable investment in New Zealand broadcasting.

Recently released results from a NZ On Air survey show that 77% of New Zealanders want to see New Zealand programmes on television and radio, and 62% want to see the number of New Zealand –made programmes increase. This would indicate that government’s support of public service broadcasting is very much in tune with what the New Zealand public is wanting.

Challenges ahead

There is still much work to be done, and I am looking forward to the next set of challenges. These include:  
·the implementation of the TVNZ’s legislation, incorporating the Charter, as early as possible in the New Year;  
·establishing an appropriate means to ensure more New Zealand content on television;  
·supporting the trial nationwide Pacific broadcaster Nui FM;  
·managing issues associated with the development of digital television, and with the renegotiation of access rights to radio spectrum;  
·considering the issue of the portrayal of violence on television; and  
·establishing enhanced radio services for young people.

Public broadcasting in this new century

Underlying all these things - what we have done, and what we plan to do - is a fundamental shift in the way government thinks about broadcasting, and about government’s own role in relation to it.

Since 2000 government has reclaimed the right and the obligation to involve itself meaningfully in broadcasting. We recognise the importance of the public service role, and have made a commitment to non-commercial broadcasting, as part of a mixed broadcasting economy.

We see broadcasting as having a key cultural role, reinforcing and extending our sense of ourselves, of the diversity of people that make up the population of the country in which we live, and of the international context of 21st century lives.

The part broadcasting media play as effective tools of an informed, educated and culturally- aware citizenry is at least as important – more important, many would say - as their being componentry in the machinery of commerce.

Put simply, this government regards ‘users’ of broadcast media as citizens, not simply as consumers. We are committed to having in place a set of policies that support this recognition - and to maintaining an intelligent overview, so that the policy settings remain relevant and useful.

The role of the Broadcasting Standards Authority

Within such a perspective, the importance of the work of the Broadcasting Standards Authority is highlighted.

I firmly believe that if we are to have broadcasting services that are respected and relied on by the citizens of this country, then we also need to have in place a mechanism to ensure that those services uphold appropriate standards. What some might choose to regard as a meddling check on freedom of expression, I see as recognition of the enormous power, influence and impact of broadcasting media.

Under the Broadcasting Act 1989, it is the Broadcasting Standards Authority that has the perhaps unenviable task of implementing Parliament’s decision that there will be a central, legislatively-mandated body to ensure that the power, influence and impact of our broadcasting services are not put into effect in ways that are at odds with society’s expectations.

I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of the Chair, members and staff of the Authority.

Let me say, by way of empathetic detour, that, though my years as a politician have been satisfying and rewarding, I have now and then had experiences which have usefully enhanced my personal understanding of the concept of ‘thankless task’.

I know full well that hard work, careful deliberation and well-considered decisions can be portrayed as otherwise by those who happen to take a different view.

There are those who have, in recent times, criticised the Authority with respect to its composition, processes and decisions.

The government does, of course, respect the right of people to have their own view about the existence and operation of Crown bodies. I like to think, though, that those views are generally informed by an accurate understanding of the relevant issues. This, regrettably, is not always the case.

The issues with which the Authority deals are complex, and significant – and the decisions it makes are never going to be those which can satisfy all parties. I know that the Chair, the members and the staff of the Authority undertake their work with commitment, expertise, and integrity. As Minister of Broadcasting I consider myself the beneficiary not of political cronyism, but of informed, professional, careful decisions about the standard of what we receive through our broadcasting services. This is a benefit I share with all New Zealanders.

Thank you, then, to the Authority, for the good work of the year. Let me take the opportunity now to invoke Part III Section 23 of something approximating the Broadcasting Act – I consider it desirable that each person here has a very merry Christmas, and as Minister of Broadcasting, I do so direct. Happy holidays, everyone.
