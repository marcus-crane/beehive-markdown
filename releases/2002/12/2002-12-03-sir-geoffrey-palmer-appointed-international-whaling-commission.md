Former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer has been appointed as New Zealand's representative on the International Whaling Commission (IWC), Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced today.

"Sir Geoffrey’s appointment comes at a crucial juncture in New Zealand's efforts to protect whales from commercial exploitation. Our pro-conservation stance at the IWC is under threat from efforts to stack the organisation with countries which support commercial whaling.

“Sir Geoffrey brings political experience, personal standing and skills in law and multilateral negotiations to this position. These skills will be invaluable in working in the international environment to ensure that whale numbers are not further depleted.

“Sir Geoffrey’s strengths mirror those of his predecessor, Jim McLay who served New Zealand so well as IWC Commissioner for 9 years.

“Jim McLay brought to the job political experience, a legal background, excellent leadership and management qualities, and a passionate devotion to the cause of whale conservation.

"He has been an outstanding commissioner, who won the respect of even those who opposed his endeavours. Jim McLay’s standing and influence in the Commission served New Zealand’s policy interests extremely well.

“I know other New Zealanders would wish to join with me in paying tribute to his efforts and thanking him for a job well done,” Mr Goff said.
