Freelance journalist Tapu Misa has been appointed to the Board of the Broadcasting Standards Authority, Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Ms Misa replaces Dr Bronwyn Hayward who resigned in September 2002. She will serve out the remainder of her term which ends in May 2004. It is anticipated that Tapu Misa will then be reappointed for a full three year term.

The Broadcasting Standards Authority is an independent statutory body established under the Broadcasting Act 1989. It hears complaints, issues advisory opinions on broadcasting standards and ethical conduct to broadcasters, encourages the development and observance of codes of broadcasting practice, and conducts research on matters relating to broadcasting standards.

“Tapu Misa is a freelance journalist with an extensive career across a variety of media. She will bring a great deal of experience to the role.

“She currently writes a regular column for the New Zealand Herald and Mana magazine. Earlier this year she was awarded Pacific Print Journalist of the Year by the Pacific Island Media Association.

“Her appointment will ensure the Board has the appropriate mix of skills and experience,” Steve Maharey said.
