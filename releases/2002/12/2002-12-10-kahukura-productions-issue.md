“I have been regularly briefed by the NZ Film Commission Board chairman on the Kahukura Productions Limited issue since it first became obvious that Kahukura was in financial difficulty,” said Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard.

“I have received no information to suggest that the Film Commission has made improper payments.

“Katherine Rich doesn’t understand that the Film Commission is in negotiations with the liquidator and obviously cannot discuss specific issues until there is some settlement.

“The Film Commission has been in a process of intense negotiations with the liquidator involving complex legal issues and competing interests.

“I am as concerned as the NZ Film Commission, the filmmakers and the creditors are, in these unfortunate circumstances, to have the films completed and seen by their intended audiences, and have the creditors paid.

“The first concerns have to be to ensure the four films made can be completed and seen by their intended audiences, and have the creditors of Kahukura Productions Limited (in liquidation).

“Katherine Rich’s ill-informed political grandstanding is not going to help the process.”
