Minister of Transport Paul Swain celebrated the arrival of Auckland’s first renovated train at the Auckland Railway Station this morning.

The train is the first of 10 ADL trains being renovated over the next few months.

“The renovation of the trains is another step in the process of delivering a high quality rail service in Auckland,” said Mr Swain.

“Auckland’s traffic congestion is a serious problem that affects all New Zealanders and this government is determined to do something about it. Our decision to give priority to severe congestion resulted in Transfund NZ allocating $320 million, almost a third of its budget, to Auckland roading and passenger transport. This money is already being spent on projects such as improvements to Spaghetti Junction.

“However funding roads is only part of the answer. Getting more people onto public transport is important and this rail project, which compliments the bus service, is critical to resolving Auckland’s traffic and environmental problems.

“The government’s $81 million purchase of the Auckland rail corridor gave Auckland’s local authorities the opportunity to set up a world-class rail system and they have seized on this opportunity and are making progress.

“The Britomart project is progressing on time and to budget and is due to open in June 2003. Good progress is also being made on upgrading existing train stations. The Auckland Regional Council and ARTNL have recently agreed to appoint a project manager to oversee the rail project and the ARC is working with Tranz Rail to introduce increased frequency and extended hours of operation from the middle of 2003.

“Rail has an important role to play in easing Auckland’s traffic problem and I’m pleased to see that progress is being made,” said Mr Swain
