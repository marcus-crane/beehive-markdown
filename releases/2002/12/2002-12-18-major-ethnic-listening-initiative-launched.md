A major Government initiative to engage with ethnic communities was launched today by Ethnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter.

The first of about 15 listening forums planned with ethnic communities throughout the country took place at the Mount Eden War Memorial Hall in Auckland.

Moslems from all over Auckland were invited to put their views to the Government, represented by Mr Carter and New Zealand’s first Moslem MP Dr Ashraf Choudhary.

“This series of forums is designed to give ethnic people a chance to put their concerns, issues and ideas to the government directly,” Mr Carter said.

“It is an acknowledgement of the fact that ethnic cultures make an enormously valuable contribution to our country.

“I chose to start this series by meeting with the Moslem community because Moslems everywhere have had a very difficult twelve months. The New York and Bali terrorism attacks have focussed unwelcome attention on what is a fundamentally peaceful religion.

“It is appropriate that at the end of the Moslem holy festival of Ramadan, and on the eve of the Christian festival of Christmas, an effort is made to ensure that Moslems feel included in New Zealand society.”

Mr Carter said that there were many interesting and disturbing issues raised at the Forum.

They included:  
·The racial abuse of children in New Zealand schools and Moslem women on the streets;  
·A lack of family counselling services that were sensitive to the cultural differences of the Moslem community;  
·The fact that Arabic was not taught as part of the school curriculum, despite it being one of the most widely spoken languages in the world;  
·The actions of some schools in forcing young Muslim men to shave, despite it being contrary to their religious beliefs.

“I will be taking these concerns away to examine what the government can do to resolve them,” Mr Carter said.

He said the next forum was planned with the Korean community in February and another with the Russian community would follow shortly after.

“This Government’s desire to embrace the diversity of our country is genuine. These forums are one way that we can demonstrate our belief that different cultures enrich our society.
