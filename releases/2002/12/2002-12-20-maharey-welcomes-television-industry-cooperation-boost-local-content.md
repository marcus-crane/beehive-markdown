Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey is welcoming the formation of a new television industry group working to develop voluntary targets for New Zealand programming for the major free-to-air networks.

The group comprises Television New Zealand, TV3, the Screen Production and Development Association and NZ On Air. In a memorandum of understanding signed today, the group is pledging to develop three year local content targets to be broadcast by members and to define genres that need particular emphasis. The group will review its targets on an annual basis.

Steve Maharey said the government supports industry initiatives to boost the amount of NZ made programming on television through industry led, voluntary, genre-specific targets.

“This is a great initiative which I warmly welcome. The Code of Practice for New Zealand music, which operates in a similar way on commercial radio, has significantly boosted the amount of Kiwi music on air and there is every reason to believe a similar initiative will also work well on the major free-to-air television networks.

“The group who have signed up to the memorandum have been meeting with me over recent weeks. I have been impressed by their commitment to making and showing more New Zealand programming and their willingness to work cooperatively together.

“Labour pledged in our election broadcasting manifesto to increase the level of New Zealand content on television and we reserved the right at the time to impose mandatory quotas to achieve this. Partnership within the industry to reach New Zealand programming targets is a far more preferable mechanism.

“New Zealanders have regularly shown they will support local programming. Just last month NZ On Air audience research showed overwhelming support for more New Zealand made television.

“The agreement signed today shows the industry has recognised viewer preferences for more New Zealand-made programming and that they are confident it will be supported by New Zealand audiences,” Steve Maharey said.
