The Aranui (Christchurch) and Wairoa communities are to receive a total of $426,000 over each of the next four years as part of the expansion of the Stronger Communities Action Fund (SCAF), Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The funding was provided in this year’s Budget to enable two additional communities to join the pilot programme that has been operating since 2000. SCAF empowers individual communities to identify local social needs and to provide targeted social services to meet them.

Steve Maharey said an interim evaluation of the SCAF programme indicates it has had a positive impact on the seven local communities it is operating in.

“Local funding decisions made by the communities that are part of the SCAF trial are well integrated with other government funded programmes. This ensures that the community has access to a continuum of social services able to meet a wider range of needs.

“Child, Youth and Family will now be working closely with the fundholder organisations in each of the new sites; the Christchurch City Council in Aranui, and the Kahungunu Executive Trust, subject to community consultation, in Wairoa.

“At a public meeting in Wairoa on 12 December the Department will seek the community’s endorsement for the Kahungunu Executive Trust to act as fund holder for the project. If the Wairoa community agrees, the Trust will work with the people of Wairoa to determine the community’s social needs and how best to address them.

“The Aranui community, through the Aranui Community Trust, has already made significant progress in identifying a vision for their community and work on the Aranui Renewal Project is underway. This project is a partnership between Housing New Zealand Corporation, the Christchurch City Council and the Aranui Community. The SCAF fund will assist the Aranui Community Trust to achieve local solutions to local problems.

“Aranui’s priorities for future developments have been identified through community consultation. These priorities include the re-design of under-utilised Wainoni Park that will include a safer playground with a rock climbing area for older children.

“As part of the Aranui Community Renewal Project twelve two-story units in Portsmouth were demolished after consultation. Once the site was cleared, design workshops were held with the community to determine what kind of housing should be built.

“This renewal project has provided employment opportunities for people living in Aranui. The project also worked with the local high school and Aranui Primary School to set up a mentoring project between older students and younger students.

Aranui High School itself was the first Christchurch high school to set up the academy system (now followed by other schools) which enables students to specialise in sports like rugby, netball and water sports while still doing academic subjects part of the day.

Te Kupenga o Aranui is another education initiative in Hampshire St to help encourage high school children (aged 13 - 15) to keep getting an education after they have been suspended or expelled or if they have been truanting from local high schools,” Steve Maharey said.

Other local community initiatives in Aranui include:  
·the development of a local health directory;  
·the Aranui Affirm family festival that provides information on health, careers and education in a carnival atmosphere;  
·Project Pegasus, a youth initiative that targets young offenders in the region of East Christchurch and has an excellent success rate in reducing re-offending rates; and  
·Supergrans, a budget advisory service and home support service in Hampshire St that provides individual advice for local residents.

SCAF is already operating in seven areas around the country: South Hokianga, Glenn Innes, Ranui (Waitakere), Whakatane, Mangakino, Porirua and Awarua (Bluff). It encourages communities to identify their needs, supports innovative ideas from within communities to address these needs, tests new approaches to local decision making, and increases the strength and capacity of communities in need.
