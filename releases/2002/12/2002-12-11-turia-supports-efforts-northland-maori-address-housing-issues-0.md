Associate Housing Minister Tariana Turia is encouraging the tangata whenua of Whatuwhiwhi, in the Far North, to continue with a private housing scheme.

Ten days ago a house that was being moved onto Maori land was burned to the ground.

“I totally support the efforts of iwi to address their housing issues in the Tai Tokerau,” said Tariana Turia.

“I am disgusted that a house, owned by Maori, sited on Maori land in Whatuwhiwhi to house a Maori whanau appears to have been deliberately burned.

“It concerns me further that the local Karikari community has been reported as being pleased with the burning of the home,” Mrs Turia added.

“It appears that some people in Karikari, whether part Maori or not, are more interested in the value of their private properties than the urgent housing needs of the tangata whenua, and someone is even prepared to indulge in acts of terrorism, which others endorse”.

“If it is not racial and not political then what is it?” asks Mrs Turia.

“We should all be concerned with what has happened. The government has been working with tangata whenua on rural housing and community development programmes throughout the far north. We will not tolerate vigilante action which endangers life and safety, frustrates progress and threatens community relations.

“I hope this act of violence and intimidation does not deter people like Shane Jones from continuing to house his people, ” Mrs Turia said.
