Broadcasting Minister Steve Maharey and Green MP Sue Kedgley today met with the working group appointed to oversee new research into violence on television.

The research project will look at the portrayal of violence on our television, examine international research for information which could be relevant in this country and evaluate the public policy tools available to control the level and nature of violence on television in New Zealand. The study results from a Green Party initiative to investigate violence on television, for which $300,000 was negotiated during the 2002 Budget. As part of the cooperation agreement between the government and the Greens the project will continue.

Steve Maharey said the depiction and incidence of violence on television continues to be an issue of concern to New Zealanders.

“Many New Zealanders are concerned about the level and nature of violence on television. Parents, in particular, worry about the consequences for their children of viewing violent programming.

“The research project will look at the international evidence on the effects of exposure to television violence, what is being broadcast on our screens and advise whether there is any further cause for concern.

“Importantly the study will also evaluate the tools available in New Zealand to control the level and nature of violence on television – the Broadcasting Standards Authority, the Broadcasting Act 1989, codes of practice and the TVNZ Charter – and see how these stack up with responses in other countries.

“The government has appointed a nine-member working group made of broadcasters, programme makers, consumer advocates and academics to select and oversee the researchers who will carry out the study. The researchers will report through the working group to me in September 2003,” Steve Maharey said.
