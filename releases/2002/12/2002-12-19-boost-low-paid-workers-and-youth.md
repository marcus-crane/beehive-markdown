Low paid workers will receive a 6.25 per cent boost in income following changes to minimum wage rates announced today by Labour Minister Margaret Wilson.

From 24 March next year, the adult minimum wage rate will increase from $8.00 per hour to $8.50 and will apply to all workers aged 18 years and over.

The youth minimum wage rate, applying to 16 and 17-year-olds, will increase from $6.40 to $6.80 at the same time.

Margaret Wilson said the new rates reflect the Labour-led Government’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a fair, robust and socially acceptable set of minimum employment standards for the benefit of all New Zealanders, but particularly the low paid.

The latest changes to minimum wage rates are estimated to benefit 27,400 adult workers and about 7,100 16 and 17-year-olds.

“The increased rates will have a minimal effect on employment levels given the current low level of unemployment and the strong demand for labour,” Margaret Wilson said.
