Education Minister Trevor Mallard today applauded the contribution to the kohanga reo movement made by retiring Kohanga Reo National Trust chief executive Iritana Tawhiwhirangi.

“Iritana is at the forefront of the kohanga reo movement and truly passionate about improving educational outcomes for Maori children. Her drive, commitment and energy have hugely increased the participation of Maori kids in early childhood education,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Without Iritana’s significant contribution, many children would never have had the opportunity to take part in early childhood education, let alone Maori immersion classes.”

“I will very much miss the free and frank discussion I used to have with Iritana. I appreciated her honesty and her enthusiasm for working with government on advancing education for Maori.”

“I will also miss being summoned by Iritana to her Featherston home or her headquarters.”

“I am sure that in whatever direction Iritana goes, that she will continue to be a mentor to those that follow.”

“I wish her all the very best,” Trevor Mallard said.
