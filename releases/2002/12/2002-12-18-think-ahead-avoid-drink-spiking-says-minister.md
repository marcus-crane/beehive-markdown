Follow simple rules and minimise the chance of encountering spiked drinks, Police Minister George Hawkins says.

At the launch of the police “Watch yourself, Watch your friends,” campaign to highlight the problem of drink spiking, Mr Hawkins said alcohol was the most common drug used to assist sexual assault.

“A spiked drink is a hazard anyone thinking of having a night out should be aware of,” he said.

“Drinks can be spiked at any gathering where alcohol is available, including pubs, clubs, bars and private parties. In crowded, noisy environments people may not notice that a drug has been slipped into their drink, especially if they have already been drinking,” he said.

Drinks that have been spiked may not necessarily change colour, taste or smell, but within 20 minutes people could feel dizzy, sleepy and disoriented before falling unconscious. Unable to defend themselves, they could be at risk of rape and sexual assault and later may not remember what had happened.

However, thinking ahead, avoiding risky situations and friends looking out for each other would lessen the chance of having drinks spiked, Mr Hawkins said.

A Police brochure outlining ways to combat drink spiking recommended people:  
·buy their own drinks  
·think twice before accepting a drink from a stranger  
·avoid sharing drinks  
·watch while drinks were poured at the bar, or bottles or cans opened  
·watch drinks of friends while they were away from the group eg. dancing, in the bathroom or talking to others  
·refuse cloudy drinks, those with changed colour or consistency, or which didn’t taste right  
·if suddenly feeling hot or ‘out of it’, ask someone trustworthy to take you or your friends to a safe place  
·stick with drunk, uncoordinated, confused, faint or sick friends  
·take friends to a safe place and tell other friends, bar or security staff if it was believed drinks have been spiked  
·ring 111 for an ambulance if someone collapses.  
·keep suspicious drinks for evidence – tell the bar manager
