Education Minister Trevor Mallard is hoping for a positive start to the 2003 secondary school year by offering to go back to the Alternative Disputes Resolution Panel with the PPTA over the issue of non-degree teachers accessing a new top pay rate.

“I want a positive end to this issue, as we head into Christmas and the festive season. I also want a clean and positive start to the 2003 secondary school year so teachers and their students can focus on education, with no other distractions,” Trevor Mallard said.

The Alternative Disputes Resolution Panel in August recommended a $250 million settlement to the secondary teachers’ pay dispute that was ratified by 88 percent of the PPTA’s members. But the panel at the time said it couldn’t make a definitive recommendation about what should happen to the non-degree teachers.

“Recommendation 14 of the ADR’s final recommendations for the settlement of the secondary teachers collective agreement, states that the panel was prepared to reconvene if the parties were unable to “resolve the issue of whether G3 equivalent teachers should access the additional increment payable on 5 February, 2003, or the new step 14’,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The ministry, on my instruction, is agreeing to the panel reconvening to give a recommendation on the issue left open by recommendation 14.”

“The ministry will propose a list of degree-equivalent qualifications to the ADR panel,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Research has been going on to determine exactly which qualifications will be assessed as being degree-equivalent (level 7 or above on the NZQA qualifications framework) to enable teachers to access the new top salary scale. For instance, the Diploma in Home Science and Diploma in Physical Education from Otago University meet this test, as do other qualifications around the country.”
