The failure of industry partners to agree on their share of funding for the Bovine Tuberculosis Pest Strategy was disappointing, Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said today.

Changes to the way the strategy is funded were set out in an board of inquiry report, an independent critique of the Animal Health Board’s strategy, carried out earlier this year.

The Bovine TB strategy is paid for by the Crown, local authorities, and industry.

Mr Sutton said he was looking for a robust way forward for the different livestock  
industries (dairy, beef, deer) to share the costs of funding the Bovine TB pest management strategy.

“I’m disappointed that the industries involved haven't yet agreed amongst  
themselves.

“I’m hoping there will be some Christmas spirit and that this agreement will be forthcoming soon. If not, I will be forced to make a decision in the New Year.”

Mr Sutton said the Bovine TB pest management strategy was important for New Zealand exporters.
