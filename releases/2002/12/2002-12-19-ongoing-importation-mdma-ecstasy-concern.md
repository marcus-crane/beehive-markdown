Customs Minister Rick Barker said that the arrest of another illegal drug courier this week reflects the excellent work being done by Customs Service staff and other law enforcement agencies.

The arrest late on Tuesday night followed the interception of approximately 600 grams of the Class B drug MDMA, also known as ecstasy.

However, Mr Barker said he was still concerned at the rise in the number of ecstasy seizures this year.

“So far in 2002, Customs and the Police have seized the equivalent of more than 255,000 MDMA tablets. This compares with only 9,352 tablets in 2000 and 83,488 last year.

“The large scale of some of those importations and their frequency would suggest the involvement of sophisticated international drug trafficking syndicates.”

This year Customs has detected MDMA being carried by arriving air passengers in their luggage, strapped to or concealed in their bodies and inside cargo shipments.

“This wide range of concealment and the methods of importation employed present significant challenges to Customs staff and investigators, so it is especially pleasing to see the number of traffickers caught at the border increasing.”

Mr Barker said New Zealand was experiencing a worrying worldwide trend in the use of amphetamine-type substances such as MDMA, methamphetamine and other illegal drugs.

“This trend is being considered for a report to the Ministerial Action Group on Alcohol and Drugs, which is responsible for driving the Government’s campaign to minimize the harm caused by alcohol and illicit drug use.

This week Cabinet approved the reclassification of another worrying illegal drug, methamphetamine, from a Class B to a Class A controlled substance.

Mr Barker said the reclassification demonstrated how concerned the Government was about such drugs and reinforced its commitment to reduce their demand, therefore limiting associated problems caused by habitual use.

“Those responsible for importing and manufacturing these types of illegal substances be warned. Any drug couriers arrested at our borders will have to contend with even wider police search and detention powers for Class A drugs.”

The Ministerial Action Group on Drugs and Alcohol is chaired by Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton and includes Justice Minister Phil Goff, Police Minister George Hawkins, Associate Education Minister Lianne Dalziel, Customs Minister Rick Barker, Youth Affairs Minister John Tamihere and Associate Health Minister Damien O’Connor.
