There is more that government can do to help New Zealand businesses grow and succeed, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton said today on the release of the 2002 Business Practices and Performance Survey.

Published under the title Firm Foundations, the study’s underlying premise is that better practice results in improved operational outcomes. Jim Anderton said there is more for business, industry groups and researchers to do.

“There is no magic bullet. Success is the result of a process of continuous improvement,” Jim Anderton said.

New Zealand firms scored highly in information gathering and customer focus, but did less well in innovation, strategic planning and in some areas of employee practice.

“For businesses, the issue is what they do internally to ensure they have the skills and systems in place to thrive in the global economy. The study shows that business improvement is not about one-off, solutions but about continuous improvement in all aspects of business practice.”

Jim Anderton said the results confirmed that the government’s focus on strengthening innovation, fostering skills and talent, reducing compliance costs, strengthening small business and improving the delivery of government services to business was on the right track.

“The Government is working on all of these issues, but the study shows we need to do more, especially in improving skills, reducing compliance costs and making it easier to access relevant publicly funded business development assistance.

“Modern Apprenticeships, the Talent Visa and other initiatives will help to reduce skills shortages. The Government has responded to all the issues covered by the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs. And integrating Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand will give business a one-stop-shop to deal with business assistance programmes.

“It is essential for New Zealand to ensure that more small businesses flourish. In New Zealand almost all of our businesses are small in comparative world terms. The Government is committed to continuing to working in partnership to help our businesses to grow and this study is the latest example of that commitment,” Jim Anderton said.
