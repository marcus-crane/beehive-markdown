The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Neil Walter, has been appointed chair of the Environmental Risk Management Authority, Environment Minister Marian Hobbs announced today. He replaces Jill White whose term has expired.

Two new board members, Manuka Henare, a senior lecturer in Maori Business Development at Auckland University, and Dr Max Suckling, a Canterbury scientist, replace Prudence Kapua and Dr Lindie Nelson, whose terms have expired.

Board members Professor Colin Mantell and Anthony Haggerty have been reappointed.

"The nature of ERMA’s work has changed with the findings of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification and the commencement of the hazardous substances part of the HSNO Act," Marian Hobbs said. "The authority's skill base must be broad and encompass disciplines ranging from chemistry and ecology to business and environmental management.

"Neil Walter's long experience in the highest levels of the public sector will ensure well-coordinated and efficient decision-making by the Authority. The reappointments of two members will maintain board continuity and expertise in health-related issues, management, hazardous substances, emergency management and knowledge of industry.

"Mr Henare has expertise in Maori culture, economics and ethics and Dr Suckling is an expert in integrated pest management, biosecurity, and ecology."
