New Zealand deeply regretted and opposed North Korea’s decision to reopen nuclear facilities capable of producing nuclear weapons material, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said today.

North Korea has announced it will resume operation of nuclear facilities frozen under a 1994 Agreement with the United States.

“This development is a setback to efforts to resolve nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner. We have called upon North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and fulfill its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

"Pyongyang's decision will also further erode the international community's trust in North Korea. North Korea's apparent interest in pursuing a nuclear programme is an obstacle to resolving its critical economic problems with international support.

“A strong message of concern was delivered to the North Korean Ambassador, Mr Chon Jae-Hon, during his visit to Wellington last week.

"We strongly support international calls for North Korea to relinquish its nuclear programme in a speedy and verifiable manner,” Mr Goff said.
