State Services Minister Trevor Mallard today welcomed the release of the State Services Commission’s ground-breaking survey of career progression in the Public Service, the Career Progression and Development Survey, 2000.

More than 6,500 public servants took part in the survey, which contains information relating to public servants’ career aspirations, their access to training and development opportunities and factors that might have helped or hindered their career progression.

Speaking at the launch of the survey, Trevor Mallard said he had a special concern to ensure that the public service attracts and retains excellent people.

“As a government, we can't achieve our goals alone. To achieve these goals, we need support from a strong, diverse, and innovative public sector. We need to ensure that the public service is viewed as a good career option for talented people as well as to encourage capable people to stay on and progress their careers.

“Until now, knowledge of conditions in the public service has been largely based on anecdote and hearsay. For the first time we now have information based on solid data and analysis.”

“As far as we are aware, only Canada has conducted a survey of this nature and of this magnitude,” Trevor Mallard said.

The survey findings will be used to provide a benchmark against which to measure progress in future surveys and in the development of programmes to make the Public Service a career of choice.

The recently released Ministerial Advisory Committee report on The Review of the Centre made a number of recommendations for improved Public Service performance. One was the development of a ‘Human Resources Framework’ for the Public Service – a more systematic and uniform approach for the employment, development and career management of public servants. The survey results will directly inform the implementation of this recommendation.

“If public servants find their jobs satisfying and fulfilling; if management is constantly aware of ways to improve the working environment; if there is an ongoing focus on skill improvement and professional development – then I believe we can go a long way to improving the capability and reputation of the public service,” Trevor Mallard said.
