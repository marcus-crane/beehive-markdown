Environment Minister and Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs is congratulating Wellington City Council for introducing a kerbside recycling scheme for inner city residents.

The council is trialling a scheme for 200 residences in the area between Willis Street and Cambridge Terrace, using plastic bags instead of the traditional green recycling bins.

"Inner city apartment living creates its own problems for waste disposal," Marian Hobbs said. "It's most encouraging that our city managers have come up with a new system to allow more people to contribute the recycling of waste.

"When I launched the New Zealand Waste Strategy last month I said we all have a role to play in reducing waste. Our individual efforts and those of our local body representatives have a huge impact on protecting our environment for future generations."
