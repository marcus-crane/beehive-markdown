The levy proposal was introduced into Parliament today as a Supplementary Order Paper to the Tertiary Education Reform Bill and was referred to a select committee for consideration and submissions. It is intended that the levy would come into force on 1 January 2003. It would be used to fund a wide range of activities relating to industry development, promotion and quality assurance. These include: additional professional training for providers, new information and promotion resources, marketing, a scholarship programme and increased market and industry research.

“The export education industry has grown rapidly, with student numbers doubling since 1998, and contributes around $1 Billion to GDP,” Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) Steve Maharey said today.

“New Zealand has created a strong reputation as a provider of international quality education. The opportunity is to build on this reputation. This means reinforcing quality, diversifying products and markets, broadening participation and achieving sustainable, balanced growth. We also need to manage some risks that arise from the rapid expansion of the industry.

“The levy will be compulsory to avoid issues of “free-riders” taking the benefits but not contributing. It will be set in a way that reflects the benefits an institution receives from enrolling overseas fee-paying students. The government will take a direct role in the collection and allocation of the levy initially, with the intention to transfer these functions to the industry once sufficient capacity has developed.

“When announcing financial assistance previously the Government said that industry funding would be required in future. It is important that this levy is introduced without delay, to ensure that the good work already underway continues and that the export education industry continues to develop and mature,” Steve Maharey said.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said that the $900 levy that secondary schools already paid would be offset against the new charge.

“Although the levy to schools is used to compensate the state for areas like the use of buildings – government has agreed that this new levy should not result in an additional cost to schools,” Trevor Mallard said.

“Export education has a positive future in this country and the government will continue to support it. Along with the direct financial benefits, hosting overseas students enriches our understanding of other cultures and builds important friendships – great in itself, and an invaluable investment for the future of trade and international relations,” Trevor Mallard said.
