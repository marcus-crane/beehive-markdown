Subsidised work scheme statistics for the long term unemployed issued by ACT MP Muriel Newman this afternoon are inaccurate and corrected figures were supplied to her office this morning, says Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey.

A statement issued by Mrs Newman, using the incorrect data, claims that the government has reduced the number of long-term unemployed placed into subsidised work since the election. However the corrected data supplied to her office this morning by Associate Social Services and Employment Minister Ruth Dyson reveals that more than 600 people who had been registered unemployed for more than 2 years were placed into subsidised work in the year to November 2001 than in the year to November 1999.
