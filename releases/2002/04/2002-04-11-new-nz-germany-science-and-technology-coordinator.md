German-born Auckland robotics scientist Dr Werner Friedrich is the new representative for New Zealand science and technology in Germany.

Dr Friedrich, a programme manager with the Crown Research Institute Industrial Research Ltd has an excellent record as a researcher and considerable experience in technology development and commercialisation. Born in Germany, but a New Zealand resident since 1983, Dr Friedrich has maintained close professional links with the research community in Germany. He is also New Zealand’s representative on the International Advanced Robotics Programme and was awarded a Royal Society Science Medal in 1997.

In his new role as Coordinator of the New Zealand/Germany Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement Dr Friedrich will create opportunities for New Zealand researchers and technology based businesses to work with their German equivalents. He will also keep the New Zealand Government informed of science and technology developments in Germany.

“New Zealand enjoys a very constructive, and mutually beneficial, relationship with the German science and technology communities. Germany is a world leader in both basic and applied research and Dr Friedrich’s efforts will ensure that New Zealand’s innovators are well-connected to this important partner. His scientific background and record of working with industry make him well suited to keep relations between the two countries moving forward.”
