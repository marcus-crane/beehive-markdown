Following today’s announcement of the final electorate boundaries for this year’s general election, Laila Harré has confirmed that she will be seeking the Alliance nomination for the new West Auckland electorate of Waitakere.

“This is a very diverse electorate with a lot of young families who stand to gain the most from an active Alliance in Government, “ said Laila Harré.

“I will be seeking the Alliance nomination for Waitakere and we will be campaigning hard to win the seat.”

Laila Harré today took possession of a local electorate office in Henderson. An official opening of the office will take place in the near future.
