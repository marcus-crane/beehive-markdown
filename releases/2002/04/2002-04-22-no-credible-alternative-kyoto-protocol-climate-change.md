Business New Zealand is mistaken in suggesting there is a credible “alternative international approach” to climate change besides the Kyoto Protocol, says the Convenor of the Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

“Climate change is a global problem, which means concerted international action is the only remedy,” Mr Hodgson said. “The Protocol, which is the fruit of a decade of United Nations negotiations, is simply the only concerted international action on offer.

“The climate change research alliance between Australia and the United States is not an alternative to an international agreement that is likely to be ratified by the majority of developed nations. The Protocol establishes workable, global mechanisms for the long-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The US-Australia partnership bears no comparison, nor does it pretend to.

“The US proposes to reduce emissions intensity, by improving energy efficiency, but expects that total emissions will continue to grow with the economy. I am concerned that Business NZ does not appear to understand this.

“I am pleased, however, that the policy principles endorsed by Business NZ so closely reflect the principles the Cabinet adopted earlier this year. And I note that many of the specific policies advocated by Business NZ are already being addressed by the Government, through measures including the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, the electricity reform process and the Transport Strategy.”
