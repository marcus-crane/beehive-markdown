Tourism Minister Mark Burton has welcomed the appointment of Ray Salter as General Manager of the new Ministry of Tourism.

"The Ministry of Tourism has evolved from the Office of Tourism and Sport as part of the government's response to the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010.

"Ray Salter will lead a Ministry that is expected to be proactive in developing a cross-government approach to tourism.

"This government has developed a very strong set of relationships across the tourism sector, and Ray Salter will have a challenging but rewarding role to play," Mark Burton said.

The new Ministry of Tourism will be officially launched in a function at Parliament on Tuesday, April 16th.
