Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Steve Maharey is praising Trust Waikato for supporting a new umbrella organisation for Waikato region social service groups – Social Services Waikato – which was formally launched this afternoon.

Social Services Waikato has been established to provide support, advocacy and training for social service organisations in the greater Waikato region. It will be funded for three years in the first instance by Trust Waikato and has a commitment to longer term funding depending on results.

Steve Maharey said the work of Social Services Waikato and the support it has received from Trust Waikato are excellent examples of communities making their own decisions.

“I congratulate Trust Waikato for taking the initiative to ask its community what it needs and for providing the resources to meet those needs.

“Social Services Waikato’s goal of building a confident and vibrant social services sector in the Waikato is something we can all support. The decision by Trust Waikato to fund the organisation initially for three years will enable it to establish a strong base and a clear role.

“Community trusts are already an increasingly important source of funding for the community sector. Gaming machine trusts are also assuming a more and more important role as more people are turning to this form of gambling.

“I congratulate the Waikato community on this exciting social service initiative,” Steve Maharey said.
