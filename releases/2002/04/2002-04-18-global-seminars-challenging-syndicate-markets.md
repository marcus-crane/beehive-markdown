A series of seminars to promote New Zealand through the America’s Cup kicks off in London this week. (Thursday evening London time)

Minister for the America’s Cup Trevor Mallard said there would be 12 seminars in countries where there is a challenging syndicate

More than 100 guests will be attending the London seminar, which will be co-hosted by Her Excellency Governor General Dame Silvia Cartwright and His Excellency High Commissioner Russell Marshall.

Additional speakers will be Burns Fallow, one of the senior members of Team New Zealand's design team, and Peter Harrison, backer of the Great Britain challenger syndicate.

“The event will profile the America's Cup Regatta and tourism. It will also place an emphasis on promoting the technology, marine and food & beverage industries. These are all sectors that have been positively impacted by the America's Cup event,” Trevor Mallard said.

“A number of New Zealand companies have donated produce and the guests will sample the best of New Zealand venison, lamb, green lipped mussels, hoki, kiwifruit, water, steinlager and wine.

“Tourism, Investment and Trade New Zealand have undertaken an integrated campaign to target high net worth individuals and influential business contacts. They aim to increase business opportunities for New Zealand companies and build a strong association of New Zealand with the America's Cup.

“During the seminars, potential visitors to New Zealand will be encouraged to not only come to the regatta, but to travel to a variety of regions throughout the country.

“The seminars are one of a number of initiatives the government is funding to help New Zealand realise the potential that hosting the America’s Cup offers our country. In January we announced funding of nearly $3 million for this purpose. It is a good investment – it is estimated that the last event generated $640 million of economic activity in New Zealand,” Trevor Mallard said.
