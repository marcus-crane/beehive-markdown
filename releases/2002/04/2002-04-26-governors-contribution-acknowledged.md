26 April 2002Media Statement  
Dr Brash’s contribution acknowledged

“Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash has been a leading central banker, recognised around the world for his commitment to price stability,” Finance Minister Michael Cullen said.

Dr Cullen was commenting on Dr Brash’s announcement today that he was resigning from the Bank to stand as a list candidate for the National Party at the next general elections.

Dr Brash advised Dr Cullen of his decision this morning before making it public.

“Assuming Dr Brash is sufficiently highly-placed on the National list to make the cut, I look forward to facing him across the House,” he said.

The Deputy Governor, Rod Carr, will take over from Dr Brash as Acting Governor.
