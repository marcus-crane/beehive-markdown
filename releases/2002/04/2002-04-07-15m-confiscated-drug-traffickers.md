Justice Minister Phil Goff has this week ordered cash and assets valued at over $1.5 million seized from drug traffickers to be paid to the Crown.

The assets confiscated from convicted drug traffickers represents property derived from the sale of drugs and has been forfeited under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

“The biggest haul was $626,257 worth of property and cash seized from members of the Tribesmen motorcycle gang, convicted of drugs and money laundering offences.

“Among the property the convicted gang members have had to forfeit to the Crown were four Harley Davidson motorcycles and a staggering $406,870 in cash found at a residence.

“Another forfeiture order relating to two people convicted of drug-related offences yielded almost $600,000 in motor vehicles, cash and real estate.

“The remainder of the $1.5 million is made up of four other forfeiture orders against people all convicted of drug-related crimes.

“The drugs being pushed by the traffickers included LSD, methamphetamine and Fantasy as well as cannabis. The offenders received prison sentences of between two and thirteen years imprisonment.

“Confiscation of assets derived from crime is absolutely essential to the message that those who peddle drugs ought not to profit from their crimes.

“There is some satisfaction in knowing that instead of contributing to the lifestyle of criminals this money will now be used for the general good in areas such as health and education,” Mr Goff said.
