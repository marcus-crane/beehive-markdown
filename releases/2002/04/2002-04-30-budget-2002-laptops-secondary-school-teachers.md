The Budget this year will include $25 million over five years to support the leasing of laptops for secondary school teachers, Education Minister Trevor Mallard said today.

The arrangements would see government contribute two-thirds of the cost of a laptop with either schools or individuals paying the other third.

Trevor Mallard told the secondary principals’ conference in Auckland today that the initiative followed on from the government’s $10 million deal with Microsoft last year to provide up to date software free of charge to schools, and the provision of laptops for principals.

“We’re using our bulk buying power to get some really good deals for schools. What we have been able to do with laptops for principals is drive the cost of a laptop down from $4,500 to $3,000.

“In this year’s budget – we are setting aside $25 million over five years for laptops for secondary teachers. Permanent, full-time secondary teachers or their schools will have the option to lease a laptop over a three-year period. Government funding will meet up to two thirds of the total cost of leasing with teachers or schools meeting the other third. After three years, the teacher or school would have the option of either entering a new lease deal or purchasing the laptop – expected to be at about 10% of the original value.

“Access to laptops will provide the opportunity and stimulus needed to motivate teachers to become effective users of ICT, to improve their teaching practice and to improve student achievement.

“Familiarity and good use of the laptops will also help with workload issues by cutting down on some of the meetings and paperwork. Administration will become more efficient.

“I hope that a majority of your teachers will take up this offer. It has certainly been the case with similar overseas offers,” Trevor Mallard said.
