An information campaign to educate the public on the New Zealand Superannuation Fund will begin on Sunday, 28 April and run until 11 May, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

The material is designed to be strictly informational, has been cleared by the Audit Office and is in line with the Cabinet Office’s Guidelines for Government Advertising.

"The launch is in line with a recommendation from the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and should be welcomed by the National Party as it picks up on a challenge from Bill English in the House on 24 July during debate on the New Zealand Superannuation Bill.

"Mr English said: Let the government get the graphs out and get out on the road and on television. Let the government get the millions of dollars it has spent on other publicity campaigns and use those funds to tell people about the policy on superannuation.

"He is right. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund is one of the biggest and most significant policies enacted by the New Zealand Parliament in many years.  
It carries big implications for fiscal management, and for the level of security New Zealanders can expect in retirement. It is important people know what is involved," Dr Cullen said.

The advertisements will run on television, in the newspapers and on iwi and Pacific radio stations. They will be followed by a leaflet drop to all households.

The campaign will cost a little over $1 million and is being run for the government from the Treasury. The contract was put to competitive tender, and was won by advertising agency Singleton Ogilvy & Mather.
