Gregory Fortuin is somebody who was able to make a positive difference in a very difficult job as Race Relations Conciliator, Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia said today.

"What Gregory believes in profoundly, is a vision of a diverse but harmonious country. He has spoken eloquently of the role of the Treaty of Waitangi in nation building.

"To be hounded by people deliberately misconstruing the facts is extremely unfortunate. Particularly given his history and that of his country – a history of conflict and pain and reconciliation.

"Race relations is something that he understands well and something that is important in our country. His contribution during his time as Race Relations Conciliator can be characterised by his personal commitment and the breadth of understanding he bought to the issues that people and communities face.

"Gregory Fortuin took a passionate and proactive approach in his role as Race Relations Conciliator and above all, he is a very good man," said Tariana Turia.
