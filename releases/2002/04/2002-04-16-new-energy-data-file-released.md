Energy Minister Pete Hodgson today released the latest edition of the Energy Data File, a compilation of energy statistics published twice a year by the Ministry of Economic Development.

The January 2002 edition of the Energy Data File contains comprehensive statistics on energy supply, demand and prices to September 2001, including:

·Total primary energy supply in the year to September 2001 grew by 0.6%, compared to the preceding 12 months, to 772 petajoules. This includes net imports of oil and oil products.

·Total petrol consumption in the year to September 2001 declined by less than 1%. Premium unleaded petrol consumption declined by 9%, but this was largely offset by a 2% increase in consumption of regular unleaded petrol.

·Consumption of diesel increased by 2% and LPG by 17%.

·New Zealand's production of crude oil, condensate and naptha was relatively unchanged from the preceding year, and our self-sufficiency in oil at 34% was relatively unchanged.

·Coal production in the year to September 2001 was 4.1 million tonnes, an increase of 12% on the previous year. Coal exports grew by 240 kilotonnes, a 16% increase.

·New Zealand gas production in the year to September 2001 rose by 6%, with 78% coming from the Maui field. About 37% was used for petrochemical production, 47% for electricity generation and 16% for industrial, commercial and domestic purposes.

·The gas use for electricity generation (including cogeneration) in the year to September 2001 at 114PJ was 24% higher than in the previous year. Constraints on hydro generation in the cold, dry winter of 2001 caused greater need for gas generation.

·Total electricity generation for the September year 2001 at 38,690GWh was about 2.7% higher than for September year 2000. Preliminary indications are that transmission losses increased and electricity consumption grew by only about 1.3%. Further data on consumption are awaited.

For the calendar year 2000, renewable forms of energy contributed about 135PJ of consumer energy, about 29% of total consumer energy. The proportion has remained essentially static in recent years.
