Corrections Minister Matt Robson is calling on the Act Party to remove its 'Truth in Sentencing' billboards following Muriel Newman's opposition to the new prison in Northland.

Yesterday the Environment Court gave the green light for a new regional prison in Northland.

The court ruled that there was ‘a public need for a regional prison in Northland’ and that the site was appropriate.

"If Act wants longer prison sentences, then it is going to have to build new prisons.

"Unfortunately, wherever I try to build a new prison, the Act Party campaigns against it. They prefer to stick with billboards.

“Even when the Environment Court and all expert opinion has approved the site, they still oppose a prison.

“This government has responded to the public of New Zealand and increased sentences for the most violent offenders with the Sentencing and Parole Bill.

“But in order to have longer sentences, we need more prison cells.

“On top of that, Act attack this government for building a new safer prison at a cost of about $100 million when their own Truth and Sentencing policy would cost $1 billion dollars in extra prison space.

“This is political hypocrisy at its worst.

"Get real Muriel, if you’re anti-prison you can’t be anti-crime,” says Matt Robson
