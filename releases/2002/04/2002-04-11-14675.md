Hutt South MP Trevor Mallard today welcomed the opening of the Naenae branch of Kiwibank, which returns banking services to Naenae for the first time in four years.

“When Paul Swain and I decided to open an electorate office in Naenae, there were four banks in the shopping centre, and within four years all had closed their local branches, “ Trevor Mallard said.

“Having local banking services has been a high priority for many constituents, particularly those who prefer to do banking and shopping in the same area.”

“Elderly people have been among the strongest lobbyists for local banking services to return to Naenae.

“I expect the Kiwibank will provide some more rejuvenation of the local shopping centre.” Trevor Mallard said.
