New Zealand's 2700-plus school principals now have a "one-stop-shop" on the internet for information, communication, and even "private" spaces for discussion with colleagues.

"LeadSpace" has been set up by the Ministry of Education as part of the $27 million principal leadership and development initiative announced in last year's budget.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard launched the site from Asnet Technologies Ltd in Rotorua by taking part in an online chat session this afternoon with principals from around the country.

"It will help make the busy and often stressful days of principals a bit easier," Trevor Mallard said.

"On the web site, school principals will be able to access the information they need to do with school property, staffing, curriculum, regulations and entitlements.

"They will soon be able to access the details of their school's funding, as well as data on schools' performance so that they can compare their own with similar schools.

"Information on good practice, along with case studies and discussion opportunities will also be available through "LeadSpace". An important part of it is online facilitation. Former principals will be appointed as online facilitators later this month."

Trevor Mallard said that principals were also being equipped with laptop computers.

"By the end of last month, 600 principals had received their laptops and the total will be up to 1500 by the end of this year.

"We recognise that well-informed, up-to-date, and effective leadership of schools is critical to the success of students."

**Background information on LeadSpace**  
LeadSpace has four main parts:

- e-Net (hosted on Think.com) is the principals' online network. It is open only to principals and will offer private, reflective, and facilitated on-line forums within which principals may gain professional support, share ideas, and learn through working with others;
- the Leadership area contains information on good practice, school culture and development, professional readings and case studies;
- e-Admin (private area) is a password-secure area for principals where they can access Property Management Information System (PMIS) data and eventually the Management Information and Resourcing (MIR) system. Principals will be able to use these immediate and responsive interfaces with the Ministry to make e-returns and applications. e-Admin (Tools) offers open access to forms and templates needed for school management and leadership; and
- the Knowledge area contains regulations, policies and official documents so that principals can quickly find the information they need to help them in their decision-making.

LeadSpace is the first large-scale Ministry of Education portal. In simple terms, this means it is a web site sitting on top of many different information sources, giving school principals quick and easy access to the information, tools and templates they need. They will find the information they need organised in a logical and familiar way, using everyday language.

Because the information held within LeadSpace is in electronic form, it can be easily and regularly brought up to date. This will benefit principals, as will the ability to access the information from any Internet-connected computer, in their offices, homes, or elsewhere if they choose.

While designed with principals in mind, LeadSpace may also assist school trustees. They will be able to access its open areas any time for information on a wide range of issues to do with school governance and management.

Leadspace has the potential to be a specific avenue where information for, and dialogue between, principals on a specific subject could occur.

Take, for example, NCEA. Examples of best management and leadership practice could be located in the Leadership area of the website. This would be drawn from actual practice identified by ERO, NZQA and the Ministry. There would be a hyperlink to the NCEA website from this area and vice-versa.

A more immediate avenue for feedback and discussion on issues occurring through the implementation of the NCEA would be e-Net. Here principals could share ideas, give advice, ask questions and receive instant feedback from their colleagues or an experienced principal in the 'Hot seat'. Equally, e-Net gives the Ministry an avenue to gauge what the current issues are and an opportunity for instant engagement with the sector (this would be made possible through the facilitator).
