Prime Minister Helen Clark today congratulated Xanana Gusmao on his election victory, saying he had won an overwhelming mandate to complete East Timor’s transition to an independent democratic state.

“It has been a long struggle for the East Timorese people in their struggle for the right to self-determination as an independent state. Today’s election result is a milestone as the country ventures down the path to nationhood.

“We must not forget the many East Timorese killed, and the many more who suffered in that country’s long struggle to independence. Their sacrifices make it incumbent on us to do all we can to support democracy in this fledgling nation.

“Xanana Gusmao has been a key figure in East Timor’s path to independence. He is recognised internationally as someone with outstanding leadership qualities, and we wish him well in the complex task of firmly establishing a government based on democratic values,” Helen Clark said.
