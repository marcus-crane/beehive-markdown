Production at the tyre factory will increase 65 per cent to 2.4 million tyres per year generating millions of dollars in local economic activity.

“Industry New Zealand has been working closely with South Pacific Tyres and will continue to work with the company on their expansion.

“New Zealanders are benefiting from the lowest unemployment in 13 years and there are jobs being created all across New Zealand.

“Every region I have visited has a positive story about new jobs and businesses. The problem in regions is not a jobs shortages but skills shortages.

“We need to celebrate the innovation and successes of our businesses as these businesses will determine how successful we are in the future.

“This success also demonstrates that New Zealand is a competitive place to manufacture goods due to our strong support of business and low cost structure,” said Jim Anderton.
