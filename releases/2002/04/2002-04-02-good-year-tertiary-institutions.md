Tertiary institutions will receive more than $200m in additional government funding this year because of student roll growth, increased funding rates and new targeted support for research, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

Steve Maharey said it was important to identify the significant additional resourcing provided by government given recent statements made by Otago Vice-Chancellor Graeme Fogelberg calling for additional resources.

“Tertiary institutions, and universities in particular, have had a good year.

“There has been a substantial increase in tuition funding, worth $158.2m in revenue, due to an increase in student enrolments and the 2.6 per cent increase in funding made as part of the last budget. This now appears to be well in advance of inflation for the calendar year.

“This means a real increase over and above inflation in the funding institutions receive from the government.

“On top of the across-the-board increase tertiary institutions:  
\* will continue to benefit from the $60.6m that is going into funding Centres of Research Excellence over the next four years ($7.113m for 2002);  
\* will receive a share of the one-off $35m Strategic Change Fund which will distribute funds from 1 July;  
\* they will receive the lion’s share of the additional $4.3m allocated to the Marsden Fund and the New Economy Research Fund by Research, Science and Technology Minister Pete Hodgson in the last budget; and,  
\* Otago and Auckland universities will share the $5m cash boost allocated to the Heath Research Council this year.

“In total, tertiary education institutions will receive over $200m more in direct Government funding this year over and above what they received in 2001. The net result of this increased funding and enrolment growth has been some improved balance-sheets for a number of institutions.

“The government has been very clear with the tertiary education sector that it does not have the ability to inject substantial funds into the system in one hit, rather the sector can expect, and has been receiving, a rising tide of funding year-on-year. It’s now clear that this approach is paying dividends,” said Steve Maharey.
