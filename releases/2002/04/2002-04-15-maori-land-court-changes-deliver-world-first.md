Work that took months to complete can now be completed in days, Minister for Courts Matt Robson told a gathering at Parliament tonight celebrating the success of the Mäori Land Court modernisation.

“Just a year or two ago, Mäori land records were kept in 12 million pages of paper records that could only be accessed by travelling to each Mäori Land Court registry, and were managed using paper-based systems designed by Chief Judge Fenton 137 years ago, says Matt Robson.

“It could take days of camping at the Court to painstakingly thumb through the precious documents, going back and forth to the records room, handling cumbersome binders, photocopying pages, assembling files, relying on card indexes, waiting months for files to be sent from office to office. These days are now over.

“At the heart of the changes is the Mäori Land Information System – MLIS – which contains a complete computerised index of all Mäori land title and ownership information. All of this information can be accessed at every Mäori Land Court and anywhere else where a Court officer has a laptop computer and can connect to the network.

“This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first and only record of its kind anywhere in the world of the land base of an indigenous people.

“For the Mäori Land Court, and more importantly for Mäori land owners, the future has arrived. We can all feel proud of the success that has been achieved – success that means a much better service for Mäori land owners,” says Matt Robson.

Matt Robson said the new system, conceived, designed and implemented by Mäori Land Court staff, was completed on time, within budget.
