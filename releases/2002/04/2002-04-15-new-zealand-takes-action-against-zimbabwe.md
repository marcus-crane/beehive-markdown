The Government has formally put in place a ban on travel to New Zealand by twenty key members of the Zimbabwe Government and administration in an announcement today by Foreign Minister Phil Goff.

"The ban has been placed on individuals implicated in a serious way in undermining the rule of law and promoting or allowing human rights abuses.

"It follows closely the list of individuals banned by the European Union, Canada and the United States.

"The list includes Mr Mugabe, many members of his Cabinet, the heads of the armed services , police, intelligence and corrections as well as a number of top public servants.

"All are people about whom there is evidence linking them with abuse. We will monitor closely the lists in place in other countries and add to our blacklist further names if evidence comes to hand to warrant any such additions.

"There is also a process in place under the Customs and Excises Act to ensure that no arms sales or instruments capable of being used for repression are permitted as exports to Zimbabwe.

"We will consider a freeze on the assets of Mr Mugabe and his close associated if there is evidence that they have or are attempting to place them here.

"The suspension of Zimbabwe from the Councils of the Commonwealth should be considered as only the first step which needs to be taken by the Commonwealth.

"We have also promoted the exclusion of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth Games which is the public face of the Commonwealth.

"There is limited support from other countries for such a move at this point. However as Zimbabwe continues to refuse to engage with the Commonwealth Secretary-General and as evidence comes to light of continuing repression of opponents, the Commonwealth must consider full suspension of Zimbabwe.

"The consequence of this would be automatic exclusion from the Games.

"New Zealand is also co-sponsoring an EU resolution in the current session of the Commission on Human Rights against abuses by the Zimbabwe Government.

"Further evidence is now coming to light of fraud in the Zimbabwe elections as well as reports of new killings and mass detentions. Both justify New Zealand continuing to demand decisive action against the government of Zimbabwe by the Commonwealth and other international agencies," Mr Goff said.
