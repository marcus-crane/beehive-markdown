The cut-off date for public submissions on the Retirement Villages Bill is fast approaching and Senior Citizens Minister Lianne Dalziel is urging people to take the opportunity to have their say.

The deadline for submissions on the legislation, which is currently before the Justice and Electoral Select Committee, is this Friday, 26 April 2002.

Lianne Dalziel is reminding interested individuals and organisations to get their submissions in before the deadline.

“The proposed legislation is designed to address the needs of retirement village residents in a comprehensive way, covering financial concerns, as well as retirement village life being covered by a Code of Residents’ Rights. Some of the detail has been left to the development of an Industry Code of Practice, and this has been the subject of some of the concerns already raised with me.”

Lianne Dalziel urges the public to get involved in the process.

“I encourage you to feed into this process with your comments and opinions on the Bill.”

Justice and Electoral Committee chairperson Tim Barnett has indicated that the Committee is willing to travel around the country to make sure that the opportunity for oral submissions is widely available.

Copies of the Bill are available at Bennets Bookshops, or at the Ministry of Social development’s website at www.mds.govt.nz/keyinitiatives

Submissions should be sent to:  
Tim Barnett, MP

Justice and Electoral Select Committee
