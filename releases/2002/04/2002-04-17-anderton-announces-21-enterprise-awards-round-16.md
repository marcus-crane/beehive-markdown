Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton today announced 21 Industry New Zealand Enterprise Awards.

“It is impressive that the number of applications for enterprise awards is increasing and the standard of applications is much higher than the first rounds. New Zealand has thousands of innovative businesses and we need to celebrate these,” said Jim Anderton.

There have now been 460 awards totalling $3.96 million since September 2000.

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
