Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia said today that the Maori Television Service board had acted appropriately in promptly suspending and then dismissing its chief executive.

"The Board has moved swiftly to deal with this situation and I have been assured that a full report will be provided to shareholding Ministers as soon as it is available.

"Work is continuing to ensure that Maori Television gets on air.

"A new Chief Executive will be sought for the Service and the work of the Service to date will be carefully checked.

"Both this government and its predecessor accept the obligation to promote te reo me nga tikanga Maori through the medium of television. The government will continue its support for getting a quality service on air,” Parekura Horomia said.
