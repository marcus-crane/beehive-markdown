Conservation Minister Sandra Lee will lead the New Zealand delegation to a conference in the Netherlands called to strengthen global cooperation on managing the Earth's biological resources.  
The conference on the Convention on Biological Diversity in The Hague will focus on trying to achieve

- a stepped-up war on invasive 'alien' species;
- the adoption of the first-ever guidelines giving multinationals access to genetic resources-such as plants for producing new pharmaceuticals-in return for a fair share of the profits and benefits going to the country of origin and local communities; and
- strong economic incentives to convince companies and other stakeholders to pursue measures that will reverse the tide of deforestation.

Some 2,000 participants from 182 governments and the European Union are attending the conference which got underway at the start of this week with technical meetings for officials, and runs until 19 April.  
Ms Lee leaves this weekend to join the New Zealand delegation at the Hague. It includes DOC, Agriculture and Forestry, and Fisheries officials and representatives of the scientific community, as well as Foreign Affairs diplomats from Wellington and from our United Nations mission.  
The Conservation Minister said she would be taking advantage of the international gathering to unveil a new initiative to combat invasive alien species on islands. The initiative has been developed by New Zealand and the World Conservation Union, on behalf of our Pacific Island neighbours and other island countries.  
"Introduced pests are a curse for many island nations," Ms Lee said. "In New Zealand, every night an estimated 70-million possums chew their way through 21,000 tonnes of choice native forest foliage, as well as a wide range of bird's eggs, chicks and insects, while posing the risk of spreading bovine TB and endangering our beef and venison export trade."  
Ms Lee said other pacific island countries were undergoing similar problems. On Tahiti Island a South American ornamental tree was shading out significant areas of native forest and was contributing to landslides. On Christmas Island, the crazy ant during one 18-month period killed an estimated three million red land crabs.  
"The aim of the new initiative would be to conserve island biodiversity by building the capacity of the small island states to manage their invasive alien species," Ms Lee said. "The New Zealand government has made a considered decision to take a capacity building approach as the better alternative to the much slower option of developing a binding protocol. Such a protocol might require years of discussion before a consensus could be reached, and would inevitably reflect an unsatisfactory 'lowest common denominator' approach."  
Ms Lee said on the question of access by multinationals to New Zealand's genetic resources, the government would be looking to safeguard all its options. She said the Wai 262 Treaty of Waitangi claim over our indigenous flora and fauna had not yet been resolved.  
"I have been advised that some countries are pressing for patent law reforms, trade rules and the establishment of an international register of traditional knowledge, " Ms Lee said. "New Zealand would be reluctant to support such proposals unless they are sufficiently flexible to enable the government to fulfil its Treaty obligations and to develop domestic solutions that reflect our particular circumstances."  
Ms Lee said delegates would look closely at an experts report on whether an ambitious plan to halt deforestation should be adopted. She said one aspect likely to be robustly debated was a proposed Plant Conservation Strategy that recommended targets including the managing of 30 percent of productive land, by 2010, in ways consistent with plant diversity conservation. This would apply to forestry, agriculture and horticulture lands.  
"The implications of this approach need to be carefully considered in a national context," Ms Lee said.
