Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey and Ministry of Social Development StudyLink National Manager Lorraine Williams nailed up new ‘StudyLink’ signage up at the Palmerston North student services processing centre this morning as the service unveils a new look for the services it provides to over 140,000 students each year.

StudyLink, formerly known as Work and Income Student Services, is the nation-wide service responsible for providing financial support to tertiary and some secondary students. This year StudyLink received over 59,022 student allowance applications and 134,455 student loan applications. Its 0800 889 900 contact centre received an average of 30,392 calls per week during its peak processing period (October to March) – and 61,378 calls during its busiest week in February.

Steve Maharey said the change reflects the decision to reorganise services under the Ministry of Social Development umbrella allowing StudyLink to become a distinct service of the Ministry offering a one-stop to student.

“StudyLink will now be identified as a distinct service of the Ministry and will offer a one-stop for all services to students.

“The new StudyLink name will also eliminate confusion between the Ministry’s service and the student service units operating on many campuses around the country. Education providers, students’ associations and advocate groups have reacted positively to the formation of StudyLink.

“The formation of StudyLink comes at the end of a second trouble-free summer of service to students. A $6m investment by the government to improve the student loans and allowances processing system in October 2000 has successfully ironed out the problems experienced over the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 summers.

“Over the summer season now completed StudyLink exceeded all its performance standards and recorded a 93% student satisfaction rate (peformance standard 85%)," Steve Maharey said.

The change to the StudyLink name, complete with a new logo, is being gradually phased in to keep costs to a minimum, with the new identity likely to be fully incorporated on all brochures and stationery by October as stock is replaced. The Ministry has invested $4,000 developing the new StudyLink identity and $9,000 producing new signage and making alterations to voice recording systems.
