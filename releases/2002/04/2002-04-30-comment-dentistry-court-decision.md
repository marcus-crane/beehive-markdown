The government is considering a Dunedin High Court decision, issued today on funding provided to the University of Otago for dentistry training during the 1990s, Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said today.

The case relates to cuts made by National Education Minister Lockwood Smith in 1994 to dentistry tuition subsidies. As a result of the cuts the fees charged by the university to students rose substantially. The Labour-Alliance government increased funding for dentistry training soon after its election in December 1999, which saw tuition fees halved.

Steve Maharey said he had received a preliminary briefing on the Court decision and he was awaiting further advice from the Crown Law Office. He said he would not be making any further comment on the decision until he had an opportunity to discuss this advice with his colleagues.
