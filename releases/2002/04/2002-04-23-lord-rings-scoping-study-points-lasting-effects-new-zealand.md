The study, released today, was undertaken for the New Zealand Film Commission by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc.

The NZIER uses three scenarios for possible film industry growth resulting from The Lord Of The Rings. The most optimistic is for a possible takeoff of film entrepreneurial activity with $122million per annum in average additional production financing.

“The making of this trilogy entirely in New Zealand shows that film is a high-tech industry that can deliver an enormous amount of prosperity to the nation,” says Judith Tizard.

“Peak period employment during The Lord Of The Rings production reached 1500 people per week. Post-production continues to involve 350 people.

"Unlike overseas productions which carry out post-production in other countries, this magnificent New Zealand trilogy will continue all its post-production here in New Zealand for the next two years.

"Post production spending will continue to inject very large amounts into the New Zealand economy.”

The Lord Of The Rings used 5000 New Zealand vendors in fields ranging from digital effects, catering, transport, telecommunications and construction. As well as the scale of these numbers, Judith Tizard said the report shows how there will be lasting effects on people, ideas and attitudes.

The report says that The Lord Of The Rings "has left significant intellectual property and human capital gains, which are … central to any assessment of its impact."

In the report’s foreword, the film trilogy’s director Peter Jackson notes he is delighted to see this first public study of the long term contribution to New Zealand made by The Lord of the Rings.

“I am committed to international filmmaking driven creatively from New Zealand and I look forward to many other New Zealand filmmakers making their films here using the best talent New Zealand and the international filmmaking community have to offer for the benefit of New Zealand as a whole both economically and culturally,” Peter Jackson writes.

Judith Tizard highlights seven main categories of lasting effects which the report expects to result from the production of the trilogy:

Raising the international profile of NZ talent and the infrastructure for production and post-production;  
Upskilling the screen production industry at technical and management levels;  
Establishing a foundation of creative entrepreneurship centred on the film industry;  
Significantly changing attitudes towards larger projects;  
Broadening the film-related infrastructure;  
Enhancing Brand New Zealand through increased international tourism awareness;  
Building a potential for spinoff industries in physical and digital effects, merchandising and miniatures.

“The Lord of The Rings has presented a unique opportunity to showcase our country and our film industry to the world, and this report points to the long-term, lasting benefits,” says Judith Tizard.
