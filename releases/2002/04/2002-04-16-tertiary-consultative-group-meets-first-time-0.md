Tertiary Consultative Group meets for first time

A new forum on tertiary education issues is meeting for the first time today.

The Tertiary Consultative Group brings together a wide range of stakeholder organisations with an interest in the post-school education system. It will work with the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) and government agencies to provide an opportunity for the government and the sector to develop a shared understanding of sector plans and activity and the changing tertiary education policy environment.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said the Tertiary Consultative Group will meet 2-3 times annually and will be an important forum to progress the government's programme of reforms to improve the relevance and capability of the post-school education system.

"The tertiary education system is undergoing significant reform at present. Legislation currently before Parliament establishes a new funding and regulatory environment and reorients the system outwards to focus more explicitly on New Zealand economic and social development.

"The Tertiary Consultative Group brings together all the key peak organisations representing public and private tertiary providers and ITOs, quality assurance bodies, student, staff and external stakeholder groups - together with the relevant government agencies.

"It will provide a forum to:

- hear the views of all parts of the reshaped sector about the development of strategic direction for the post-compulsory education system;
- engage on proposals for future policy development;
- share information about initiatives and activities which might lead to improved outcomes;
- advise on the performance of existing tertiary education policy; and,
- receive project briefings and establish ad-hoc project based working groups to provide advice to the Minister as necessary.

"The government hopes the Tertiary Consultative Group will be an important forum for those within and without the sector to have an ongoing strategic dialogue as the reform programme progresses and beds in," Steve Maharey said.

Attached is a list of the peak organisations represented on the Tertiary Consultative Group and its draft terms of reference.

In the last decade or so, the New Zealand tertiary education system has made significant gains in terms of responsiveness to student needs, and in terms of increasing national participation levels. However, the current model for tertiary education has resulted in a fragmented system lacking in clear direction. A vision of future-focused leadership of the tertiary education system based on an agreed strategic direction for the system as a whole underpins the current tertiary reform agenda. This vision requires a significant paradigm shift for the tertiary education sector. It entails the shift from a demand-driven focus and associated competition to a focus on national priorities and associated strategic use of resources, including greater collaboration.

The Government established the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) in April 2000 to provide advice on the future strategic direction of the New Zealand tertiary education system. TEAC has now produced four reports: Shaping a Shared Vision, Shaping the System, Shaping the Strategy, and Shaping the Funding Framework.

In the context of the current tertiary reforms the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) has welcomed the suggestion to establish a tertiary education consultative group. The establishment of this group reflects the Government's desire for a co-operative and collaborative tertiary education system that is more strategic and efficient in order to be responsive to New Zealand's social and economic development needs.

**Purpose**

The Tertiary Consultative Group will work with the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) and will provide an opportunity for the Government and the sector to develop a shared understanding of the policy environment and of sector plans and activity. The group will be asked to engage on a range of tertiary education issues and will provide a forum for the sector representatives to exchange information with both the Minister, and other parts of the system. An ongoing strategic dialogue between the Minister and the sector is envisaged.

In particular the Tertiary Consultative Group will:

- provide system-wide sector perspectives and assist in the ongoing development of the wider strategic direction of the system;
- engage on proposals for future policy development;
- provide a forum for the group to share information with the Minister and each other about outcomes, planned or actual initiatives and activities which might lead to improved outcomes;
- monitor and advise on the performance of existing tertiary education policy; and,
- receive project briefings and establish ad-hoc project based working groups to provide advice to the Minister as necessary.

**Membership**

Membership of the group will be broadly representative of a wide spectrum of interests across the tertiary system so that it can reasonably provide advice on the system-wide policy environment and share information about planned and actual activity within the system. Represented in the group will be public and private tertiary providers and ITOs, student, staff and external stakeholder groups. The Ministry of Education, the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and Career Services will also be in attendance. The Ministry of Education will provide support to the Tertiary Consultative Group.

**Duties**

The members of the Tertiary Consultative Group will be expected to:

- meet up to three times a year with the Minister, with extra meetings if necessary;
- reflect both the interests and activities of particular groups within the system and an understanding of the wider strategic direction of the system;
- review briefing material and be cognisant of the tertiary education policy environment; and,
- provide advice on the performance of existing tertiary education policy, and engage on proposals for future policy development.

**Meeting Procedure**

The standard meeting procedure will be:

- agendas to be circulated prior to meetings;
- the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) to convene and chair meetings;
- if the Associate Minister is absent then another Minister, or Secretary for Education, to deputise;
- meetings will be planned to be no longer than half a day;
- the Ministry of Education will provide support for the meetings; and,
- particular sessions of meetings may be run under Chatham House rules.
