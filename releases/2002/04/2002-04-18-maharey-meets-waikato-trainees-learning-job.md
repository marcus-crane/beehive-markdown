Young people taking part in Modern Apprenticeships and the Gateway school-to-work scheme met with the Minister who introduced the new programmes in Hamilton this afternoon.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey met the trainees who are learning on-the-job with Responsive Maintenance, a company contracted by Housing New Zealand to maintain their rental housing stock throughout the central North Island.

Steve Maharey said Modern Apprenticeships and Gateway are two new programmes the government has introduced to give young people prestige pathways into industry and nationally recognised qualifications.

“It’s really important that young people make a successful transition from school and into their first job. Gateway and Modern Apprenticeships offer young people new alternative training routes into work – because polytechnics, universities, and other traditional forms of tertiary post-school do not appeal to all young people.

“Young people can participate in Gateway while they are still at school. It provides opportunities for senior school students to participate in learning towards national qualifications in real workplaces, and have that learning integrated with their wider courses of study. Nation-wide, Gateway caters for over 1,000 students in 24 schools, and involves over 200 employers.

“Modern Apprenticeships is proving very popular across the country. It combines the best of the apprenticeship tradition with the latest workplace education thinking. The government is well on target to meet, or exceed, the target of 3,000 young people in Modern Apprenticeships training by the middle of this year.

“Responsive Maintenance is an ideal company for these two programmes. It covers a wide range of industries including building and construction, glazing, electrical, plumbing and gas fitting, paint and paper hanging and business administration – meaning young people gain a wide range of work-experience.

“The firm employs 11 modern apprentices and also provides a place for one student each from Huntly College and Hamilton's Fraser High School. Many other of the firm’s 82 staff are also participating in work-based training,” Steve Maharey said.
