The Associate Minister of Justice Hon Margaret Wilson has decided to call for further expressions of interest in the position of Race Relations Commissioner.

This follows Gregory Fortuin's decision to withdraw his name from consideration.

Margaret Wilson said while there were good calibre applicants among those who have already expressed an interest in the position, there might be other suitable people who did not put their names forward originally believing Mr Fortuin to be a strong candidate.

"For this reason I have decided to provide a further opportunity for people to express an interest in the job. Advertisements have been placed in major newspapers and people have until Friday, April 26 to register their interest in the position."

Margaret Wilson said she hoped to make an appointment in June. Gregory Fortuin would remain as Race Relations Commissioner until this time.

People interested in the position should contact the Ministry of Justice on telephone (04) 494 9730 or email: [philip.gini@justice.govt.nz](mailto:philip.gini@justice.govt.nz) for an information pack.
