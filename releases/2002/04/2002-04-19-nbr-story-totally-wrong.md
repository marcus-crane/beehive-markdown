Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton says a report in this morning’s National Business Review claiming he or the Alliance received a donation from Sovereign yachts is wrong.

“No donation has ever been sought or received.

“NBR has apparently fabricated the claim and then printed a denial. It is sleaze befitting the paper’s status as a newsletter of the anti business ACT Party,” Jim Anderton said.
