Speaking at the Oxfam launch of its ‘Rigged Rules and Double Standards’ Report on World Trade, Development Minister Matt Robson said that the Minister of Trade and the Minister for International Development were no longer talking past each other in New Zealand.

“As an NGO, Oxfam has taken a brave step to say that free trade can assist development. But it has made it equally clear that trade cannot be on the terms of the richest countries if benefits are going to flow to the poor, says Matt Robson.

“It is no use granting tariff free entry if the developing country does not have the infrastructure to benefit and if the trans-national companies in that poor country leave their workers at a starvation level.

"As important as market access is the commitment of richer countries to drastically increase aid levels to build the infrastructures and technical capacity of developing countries so that the rhetoric becomes reality. Aid levels have actually decreased in the last decade despite countries signing up to heady goals for poverty reduction.

"We accept Oxfam's point that trade is a powerful force for poverty reduction but that the richest countries of North America and Europe have largely shut them out of access. And even if access is granted the playing field is so tilted that poorer countries are not in the game.

"We also accept that the WTO, the IMF and the agreements such as GATS and TRIPS need reexamination. The institutions have to be organizations of the developing countries not just the instruments of the richest nations. New Zealand must accept the challenge of Oxfam to consider how these world trade organizations and instruments can be further reformed.

"Oxfam in its report card on New Zealand says that we have tried hard but that we can do much better.

"They want us to go further in reducing our own tariff barriers for poor countries and to rapidly increase our aid budget of $265 million. They also want us to do more to ensure that multinational companies become good corporate citizens.

“New Zealand is already moving along the path of development aid making a difference for poverty reduction. We have a new semi-autonomous aid agency NZAID which will focus on poverty reduction. We have been active participants in the development goals set at the Doha WTO conference and have committed $370,000 to a technical capacity fund for the South Pacific. We have contributed over $6million to world debt relief even though we are not a creditor country. We will be advocating even greater debt relief measures in world forums.

“I am presently examining how we can work with multinational companies in New Zealand to see that they meet the OECD guidelines for good corporate citizenship.

“I am taking a proposal to cabinet to consider a strategy for New Zealand to meet its international commitment, reconfirmed at the Millennium Development Goal Conference 2000, that we would reach the 0.7% of GNI target by 2015. We are presently on 0.24% of GNI.

“New Zealand recognizes the importance of treating development as a necessary part of the equation in our own trade strategies. The days of the Minister for Trade and Minister for Development working separately have come to an end, says Matt Robson.
