Health Minister Annette King says a stocktake of the New Zealand health workforce, which collates information on more than 100,000 health and disability workers, will be invaluable for future workforce planning.

The New Zealand Health Workforce: A Stocktake of Issues and Capacity 2001, released today, is the first report of the Health Workforce Advisory Committee. It brings together information on the wider health workforce including social workers, support workers and other health workers for the first time.

"The health workforce is not confined to doctors and nurses. All of those working in the sector need to work together to improve the health of New Zealanders. Individual employers or health practitioners cannot solve health workforce issues alone and solutions need to be found collaboratively."

Ms King said the stocktake would provide a valuable tool in helping position the health sector to implement the New Zealand Health Strategy.

"And recently, for example, I announced funding to begin implementing the Primary Health Care Strategy. We need to start building the sort of workforce necessary to improve access to primary health care and overall health outcomes.

"While this report shows us there are more Maori health workers than ever before, only 5 percent of the registered workforce are Maori. We need to plan to increase this number as well."

The stocktake also identifies workforce capacity and key workforce issues, including recruitment and retention. The committee is aware of short-term workforce issues, but wants to ensure a foundation is laid to address workforce needs in the future. “We haven’t planned well in the past, but we must plan well from now on,” Ms King said.

Directions and options for the workforce will be outlined in the committee's next piece of work, a discussion document due to be released mid-year to be followed by consultation with the health sector. This will focus on addressing the workforce implications of the Primary Health Care Strategy, health workforce education, promoting a healthy hospital environment, building Maori health workforce capacity, building Pacific peoples’ health workforce capacity and building the health and support workforce capacity for people who experience disability.
