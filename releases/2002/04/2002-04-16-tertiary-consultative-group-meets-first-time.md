A new forum on tertiary education issues is meeting for the first time today.

The Tertiary Consultative Group brings together a wide range of stakeholder organisations with an interest in the post-school education system. It will work with the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) and government agencies to provide an opportunity for the government and the sector to develop a shared understanding of sector plans and activity and the changing tertiary education policy environment.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey said the Tertiary Consultative Group will meet 2-3 times annually and will be an important forum to progress the government’s programme of reforms to improve the relevance and capability of the post-school education system.

“The tertiary education system is undergoing significant reform at present. Legislation currently before Parliament establishes a new funding and regulatory environment and reorients the system outwards to focus more explicitly on New Zealand economic and social development.

“The Tertiary Consultative Group brings together all the key peak organisations representing employers and workers, public and private tertiary providers and ITOs, quality assurance bodies, and tertiary students and staff – together with the relevant government agencies.

“It will provide a forum to:  
\* hear the views of all parts of the reshaped sector about the development of strategic direction for the post-compulsory education system;  
\* engage on proposals for future policy development;  
\* share information about initiatives and activities which might lead to improved outcomes;  
\* advise on the performance of existing tertiary education policy; and,  
\* receive project briefings and establish ad-hoc project based working groups to provide advice to the Minister as necessary.

“The government hopes the Tertiary Consultative Group will be an important forum for those within and without the sector to have an ongoing strategic dialogue as the reform programme progresses and beds in,” Steve Maharey said.
