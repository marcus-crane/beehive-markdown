Broadcasting Minister Marian Hobbs says she is confident Parliament will pass the TVNZ Bill in time for the public broadcaster to become a Charter-focused crown owned company by July 1.

The bill was reported back to Parliament today with some recommended amendments.

"The amendments are the result of the public submission process and I am comfortable with what the Commerce Committee has recommended," Marian Hobbs said. "The fact that the committee could not agree on the bill being passed reflects the fact that the government does not have a majority on the committee.

"The core purpose of the legislation, to turn TVNZ into a crown company focused on implementing the Charter rather than a profit-driven state owned enterprise, remains unchanged."
