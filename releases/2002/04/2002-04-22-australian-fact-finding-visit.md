Attorney-General Margaret Wilson will visit Australia this week to see first-hand the operation of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and the Australian Electoral Commission in Canberra.

Margaret Wilson is currently reviewing judiciary accountability in this country and considering setting up a judicial commission to deal with complaints against Judges.

Proposals for a single electoral agency that would have integrated responsibility for all the country’s electoral administration are currently before Cabinet.
