Cabinet Minister Sandra Lee, Patron of the Waiheke RSA, will lead the New Zealand delegation to the annual Gallipoli commemorations on ANZAC Day, 25 April.  
“The battles at Gallipoli hold a special place in New Zealand’s history. It will be a huge honour to represent New Zealand at Chunuk Bair and the other battle sites on ANZAC Day. I shall be wearing a commemorative red poppy given to me by the Royal New Zealand Returned Services Association, " Ms Lee said.  
“The Gallipoli campaign is still firmly etched in the New Zealand psyche. Our connection to those old battles has led over time to New Zealand's ongoing friendship with Turkey. My short visit will enable me to meet members of the Turkish government, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to further develop this warm bilateral relationship."  
“Attendance at the Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove Bay and the New Zealand national service at Chunuk Bair is a chance for us all to reflect on the terrible toll this campaign took and its role in forming our nation. I expect it to be both an emotional and an uplifting experience,” Ms Lee said.  
Ms Lee left during the weekend to attend an international conservation conference in The Hague. She will fly from there to Istanbul on 20 April for official meetings in Ankara in the period leading up to ANZAC Day.
