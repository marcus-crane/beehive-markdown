Health Minister Annette King today presented former Association of Salaried Medical Specialists national president John Hawke with the association’s first-ever life membership.

Ms King made the presentation at a one-day conference in Wellington on the subject of health professionalism. The conference was jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Health and ASMS.

Ms King said she was delighted to be given the honour of making the presentation. “It is appropriate that this award is being given during this particular conference on the role and nature of professionalism in the health system.

“John has had a distinguished career in providing specialist dental care within the public health system in Auckland. He has been a proud advocate of quality dental and medical services being provided by the public system.

”He has been a leader in his field and has also played an impressive role in representing the interests and well being of both his dental and medical colleagues within many professional organisations in Auckland and nationally.”

Ms King said John Hawke was a foundation National Executive member of the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists when it was formed in 1989, and was the association’s third National President (1995-97).

”He is a most fitting recipient of the association’s first life membership award,” she said.
