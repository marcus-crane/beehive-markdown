The Greenberg documentary is an unprecedented opportunity to profile New Zealand to a worldwide audience, Tourism Minister Mark Burton said.

"Murray McCully is scraping the bottom of his sleaze barrel with his attack on the Prime Minister for hosting the documentary."

"Peter Greenberg is regarded as the number one travel correspondent in the USA and is hugely influential in the American travel market. Tourism New Zealand has been trying for many years to get Mr Greenberg down to New Zealand, and was delighted when Helen Clark said yes after being approached by Mr Greenberg to co-host a documentary.

"Tourism New Zealand has a long-running and fruitful relationship with the Discovery Channel which is making the documentary. In keeping with previous partnerships, Tourism New Zealand is contributing to the cost of making the programme. It will pick up accommodation and transport costs – including those of the Prime Minister.

"Tourism New Zealand receives $55 million a year to promote New Zealand. The contribution it is making to the cost of this documentary may prove to be one of its best value-for-money investments.

"Helen Clark's only involvement in the development of this project was agreeing to co-host it and identifying some of her favourite parts of New Zealand. She recognised the unparalleled opportunity that it presented.

"Mr McCully almost destroyed Tourism New Zealand during his time as Minister – and he's back at his destructive worst," Mark Burton said.

"This government will continue to take positive initiatives and accept opportunities to promote New Zealand's interests, while Mr McCully, like his leader, sits and grizzles in Wellington."

Q&A  
Peter Greenberg – ‘The Royal Tour’

1\. What is the Royal Tour?  
A new television series which looks at countries through the eyes of the men and women who lead them. Peter Greenberg from NBC acts as the co-host with the leader. The premiere episode was filmed with King Abdullah II of Jordan.

This hour-long television programme is an unprecedented opportunity to promote New Zealand to Tourism New Zealand’s target markets around the world.

As the guide, the content is driven by what the leader enjoys doing in their country.

2\. What are the Benefits for New Zealand  
The opportunity to present New Zealand to an international audience of such a size is unparalleled.

The programme will screen on Travel Channel into 61 million homes in the United States, and on Discovery Channel worldwide into over 120 million homes. The show would also be screened a number of times as would the advertisements for the show.

The launch of the show would also receive media attention with a gala event in New York, where there will be opportunities to incorporate the New Zealand message.

3\. Why New Zealand’s Prime Minister?  
Peter Greenberg invited the Prime Minister to co-host the show. This was done via Tourism New Zealand’s US office. The Rt Hon. Helen Clark would be the first woman head of state in the series. Peter Greenberg is interested in New Zealand and the Prime Minister particularly because she has gained a reputation for her love of the outdoors and an active and adventurous lifestyle. As well as her interest in New Zealand’s arts and culture.

4\. Who is Peter Greenberg?  
Peter Greenberg is regarded as the number one travel correspondent in the US and is hugely influential in the American travel market.

He is a world expert on travel and travel related issues. As well as being an Emmy-award winning writer and producer, Peter Greenberg is also the Travel Editor for NBC and chief correspondent for the Discovery Networks/The Travel Channel. Mr Greenberg is the Editor at Large for the National Geographic Traveller Magazine and is a regular columnist and radio commentator in the United States. (A detailed biography is available). Peter Greenberg is the Executive Producer of ‘The Royal Tour’

5\. What makes this programme any different?  
The documentaries are unique in terms of their perspective, quality and presentation. A programme that presents the country from the leader’s point of view gives a unique slant.

Tourism New Zealand has been trying to convince Mr Greenberg to come down to New Zealand to film for some years now. It has taken seven months to organise for him to come down for the Royal Tour trip.

8\. How long will it take to film?  
There has been one pre-production reccy by Peter Greenberg to New Zealand which took three days. An advance crew were in New Zealand for three weeks to archive research and location scouting. Filming will take place from the 31 March to 8th April, with the Prime Minister taking part from the 2nd to the 6th April.

9\. When will it screen?  
The programme is scheduled for broadcast in the latter half of the year.

10\. Where will it screen?  
The Royal Tour will go out to 61 million homes via the Travel Channel in the US and 120 million homes through Discovery Channel, plus multiple showings on Discovery Channel Worldwide. It will not screen on free-to-air television in New Zealand. It is estimated at least 26 million people who are prime targets for New Zealand travel.

11\. Are there any other PR opportunities for New Zealand related to The Royal Tour?  
Upon the launch of the show on Discovery and Travel Channels both, a gala event at the production company’s expense is planned in New York as part of the launch. This may also involve a spot on NBC’s Today Show where Peter Greenberg is the regular travel correspondent. This presents an opportunity to gain a profile for New Zealand around the event.

For the show co-hosted by the King of Jordan, the US media accompanied part of the shoot to gather material for ‘exclusive’ promotions around the premiere of the show. Tourism New Zealand is currently negotiating to ensure a similar media presence.

Peter Greenberg hosts a live talk back radio show on ABC radio in Los Angeles every Saturday morning from 8am – 10am from wherever he happens to be in the world. (NZT 5am – 8am) He will be in New Zealand for the Mar 31st and Apr 6th shows.
