The government is to undertake a comprehensive review of the regulatory and funding systems for early childhood education over the next 15 months.

Education Minister Trevor Mallard said the Budget contained $775,000 for the review, which he said was long overdue.

“The current regulatory and funding systems have been in place for some time. Over time a number of ad hoc changes have been made to these systems. The time has come to have a comprehensive review of the way we regulate and fund ECE services to ensure that system meets the government’s current and future goals in early childhood education,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The regulatory and funding systems will be reviewed at the same time so coherent system is developed to ensure quality ECE is provided in the most effective way.

“The review is a chance for the ECE sector to have their say about how the ECE regulations and funding systems will work in the future. The review will improve quality in the sector and also reduce compliance costs to ECE services.

“The government places great importance on increasing participation in quality early childhood education. Later in the year, we will be releasing our strategic Plan for ECE.

“The review is necessary to support that plan,” Trevor Mallard said.
