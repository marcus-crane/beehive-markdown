Cabinet Minister Hon Margaret Wilson will represent the New Zealand Government at tomorrow’s dawn Anzac Day Service in Sydney.

She will lay a wreath in memory of the thousands of young New Zealand men and women who died in service to their country.

“I appreciate the opportunity to take part in this commemoration which will not only remember the fallen but play tribute to the special bond between New Zealanders and their Australian comrades,” she said. “Comrades who still serve together in the cause of peace in places such as East Timor.”
