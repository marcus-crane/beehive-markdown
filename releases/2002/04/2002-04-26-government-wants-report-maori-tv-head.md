Government wants report into Maori TV head

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said he was concerned at an article in today’s New Zealand Herald casting doubt on the CV and credentials of John Davy, the newly appointed chief executive of the Maori Television Service.

“I will be expecting a full report from the Maori Television Service and will also be asking Treasury to undertake their own inquiries,” Dr Cullen said.

He will be making no further comment at this stage.
