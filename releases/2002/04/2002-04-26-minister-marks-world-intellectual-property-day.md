Seminars and writing competitions are among several activities being organised to mark World Intellectual Property Day and to highlight the importance of intellectual property in an innovative, creative and growing economy, Associate Minister of Commerce Laila Harré said today.

She today highlighted the work of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in promoting an efficient enforcement system for intellectual property rights on World Intellectual Property Day. (26 April 2002).

“Today is the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s second World Intellectual Property day. The theme for today’s activities is encouraging creativity.

“This is exactly the thinking behind the government’s growth and innovation framework. Today is an excellent opportunity to think about the importance of intellectual property regulation to innovation.”

Laila Harré said the government had a number of important initiatives underway to ensure that New Zealand’s intellectual property framework was effective and up to date. These included:

·A review of the implications of digital technology for copyright. The government has been consulting widely on this issue and is in the process of considering the wide range of submissions received from interested parties;  
·Reviews of both the Patents Act 1953 and the Plant Varieties Act 1987. The government has recently released two discussion papers on these Acts, inviting comment from interested parties. The closing date for submissions on both papers is 26 July 2002.  
·A Trade Marks Bill to modernise the Trade Marks Act 1953 is currently before Parliament.

To mark World Intellectual Property Day, the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) has organised a number of events to improve awareness of intellectual property rights within the community. These include:  
·An essay competition for tertiary institutions and a short story/poetry competition for secondary schools ($2000 worth of prizes donated by the New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys);  
·An open day at the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) in Lower Hutt.  
·A seminar entitled “Protect Your Ideas” to be held at Massey and Victoria universities

Laila Harré noted the importance of raising public awareness of intellectual property rights as a means of combating the theft of intellectual property, an issue of growing concern.

But raising awareness was not simply a matter for government, she said. Rightholders themselves had an important role to play. In this regard, the Minister noted the example of the music industry, which had actively sought to educate the public about CD piracy.
