The development of the conservation ethic in New Zealand is the subject of an exhibition running at Archives New Zealand from April 29.  
Archives New Zealand has a key role to play in ensuring government accountability by keeping and maintaining records of government activity over time. It does this by setting standards for maintaining and making accessible government records.  
Archives New Zealand chief executive Dianne Macaskill said the exhibition, entitled “Reclaiming our Natural Heritage”, has been drawn from records held in the national archive.  
“It shows how the original settlers from Europe moved from viewing this country as an untamed wilderness consisting of, as one writer described it, ‘gloomy forest and repulsive and rugged waste’, to valuing its natural beauty.  
“The exhibition traces the development of government policies and procedures in dealing with the natural environment, and government’s interaction with the various lobby and interest groups over time.  
In particular the role of Maori in preserving New Zealand’s natural assets is celebrated in the exhibition with the inclusion of the original deed of gift for Tongariro National Park.  
“We are especially pleased and proud to have the deed on display. This gift from Chief Te Heuheu Tukino of Ngati Tuwharetoa was the beginning of our unique collection of national parks and as such is an historic document of immense importance,” Ms Macaskill said.  
The exhibition is to be opened by Conservation Minister Sandra Lee and runs until late October.
