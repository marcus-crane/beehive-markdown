Prime Minister Helen Clark will travel to London to represent New Zealand for Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.

Helen Clark said that the Queen Mother was held in great respect by New Zealanders of all ages.

“The Queen Mother’s courage during World War II was very important in boosting the morale of New Zealand and its troops, along with those of all other allied nations, during the bleakest days of the war.

“The Queen Mother was in every respect a remarkable woman whose lifetime spanned more than a century and who meant a great deal to New Zealanders,” Helen Clark said.

Helen Clark will fly to London on Sunday evening and leave for New Zealand after the funeral on Tuesday.
