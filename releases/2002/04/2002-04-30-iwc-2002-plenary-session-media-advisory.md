The 54th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission will take place during the week of the 20 May 2002, in Japan. It is being preceded by meetings, already underway, of various 'technical' sub-groups.  
Media accreditation details, for New Zealand organisations sending correspondents to cover proceedings, are located at http://www.iwcoffice.org/PressInfo2002.htm  
The media will be permitted to attend and film and record all Plenary sessions, subject to availability of space and practical limitations on movement, camera positioning etc in order to avoid disruption of the proceedings.
