Prime Minister Helen Clark announced today that she will visit Indonesia from 5-7 May for a meeting with President Megawati Soekarnoputri.

Helen Clark’s visit follows a meeting between the two leaders in Shanghai last October at the APEC leaders' summit.

“Indonesia’s significance in the Asia-Pacific region means that it is in New Zealand’s interests to engage closely with Jakarta on issues of common concern” Helen Clark said.

“Developments in Indonesia can affect the stability of our region. My visit will provide an opportunity to consolidate New Zealand’s bilateral links with Indonesia, and to develop a closer working relationship with Jakarta on a range of questions including people smuggling and terrorism.

“New Zealand has a growing trade relationship with Indonesia. Our sizeable overseas ODA programme there is targeted to assist poverty alleviation and governance initiatives.

“In addition to my meetings with President Megawati and other senior political figures, I will also be meeting Muslim leaders and non-governmental groups to seek an update on how the Indonesian Government is progressing its reform goals in the economic, governance and human rights areas,” Helen Clark said.
