Media Statement

A new residential facility to open in Roscommon Rd, Wiri, is a welcome addition to the range of options for dealing with young offenders, says Manurewa MP, George Hawkins.

Speaking today at ceremony marking the start of building of the new Youth Justice Northern facility, Mr Hawkins said 46 young people aged between 14 and 17 in the care of Child, Youth and Family could be accommodated at the site.

The facility included a six bed criminal justice unit and increased from 75 to 90 the number of youth justice beds available in New Zealand.

“Strengthening the ability to deal with youth offending in this way is a positive move in that it will reduce the number of young people in police cells,” Mr Hawkins said.

He was joined at the tree planting ceremony by a number of local community leaders including Manukau Mayor, Sir Barry Curtis.

Representatives of Social Services Minister, Steve Maharey, and Child, Youth and Family also attended.
