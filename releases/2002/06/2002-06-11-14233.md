·Parekura Horomia, Minister of Maori Affairs  
·Laila Harre, Minister of Youth Affairs  
·Ruth Dyson, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister of Social Services and Employment

“Ministers will participate in workshop sessions on social inclusion and social development; education, employment and community enterprise; health; children and young people; and housing and transport.

Hamilton West MP Martin Gallagher and list MP Dianne Yates will also attend tomorrow’s forum.

“The Hamilton Social Development Forum is being hosted by the government and has been co-ordinated by the Ministry of Social Development,” Helen Clark said.

The forum is being held at the Hamilton Baptist Church complex from 1.30pm.
