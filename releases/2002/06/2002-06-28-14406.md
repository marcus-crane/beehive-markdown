The Associate Minister of Health, Hon Tariana Turia, has welcomed the release today of guidelines for organising safe after-ball parties.

The guidelines have been developed by the Alcohol Advisory Council (ALAC), in response to growing controversy about student-organised parties following school balls.

Last weekend in Wellington, Police arrested eight young people after alcohol-fuelled incidents at two private after-ball parties.

“After-ball parties can be safe and enjoyable, if they are well organised,” said Tariana Turia. “They are not much fun for anyone if they get out of control.”

“These guidelines aim to get schools and communities to work with young people, to encourage safe and responsible behaviour at social events.

“Adults and communities must think how they can help, by giving guidance and responsible support to our young people.

“What we really want is a cultural change – where binge drinking and drunken behaviour is not acceptable to young people. To achieve this, we all need to work together – government, communities and schools, whanau and families.

“The information in these guidelines is really needed, and I commend ALAC for producing practical and useful information in time for this year’s ‘ball season’,” said Tariana Turia.
