Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey is giving his strong support to New Zealand’s third national Children’s Day to be held on 27 October.

Plans for Children’s Day 2002, which is organised jointly by Barnardos, the Office of the Commissioner for Children, Child, Youth and Family and Save the Children, were announced to pupils from Mt Cook School at Wellington Zoo this morning.

Steve Maharey said Children’s Day is a great way for families and whanau to celebrate the place of children in our society.

“The first two Children’s Days have seen hundreds of events throughout the country aimed at encouraging families to give time to each other. It is a great opportunity for for Government and non-government organisations to work together for the children and families of New Zealand.

“This year the Government has boosted the support we provide to Children’s Day by appointing a project manager to help organise the day’s activities.

“I’d like to encourage communities throughout the country to get into the spirit of Children’s Day and organise activities in their area on Sunday 27 October.

“The theme of this year’s Children’s Day is about giving children new experiences, so let’s all get out and do things together with them,” said Mr Maharey.
