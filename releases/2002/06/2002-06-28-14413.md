Transfunds investment in New Zealand’s regional roading network is a huge benefit to economic development says Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton.

“For the first time in many years all our regions are growing, and this is creating pressures on infrastructure including roads, rail, and telecommunications.

“Transport infrastructure is essential for regions, and this commitment of over $1 billion is a huge boost to regional development.

“I am particularly pleased to see Auckland needs addressed. The Auckland region is a significant part or our economy and traffic gridlock in this key region need to be addressed.

“Regions such as Waikato, Hawke’s Bay, and the central North Island have the wall of wood from our maturing forests descending on them, and one of the key factors in industry growth is the ability to transport processed wood products to our regional ports.

“I am also pleased to see that some significant Canterbury projects have been addressed particularly completion of the four-lane widening of the Main North Road in Christchurch.

“As well as the downstream efficiency benefits of this spending the investment in construction will also be a boost to regional development,” said Jim Anderton.
