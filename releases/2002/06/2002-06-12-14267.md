FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

There are no plans to close Kamo Volunteer Fire Brigade, Internal Affairs Minister, George Hawkins, says.

Responding to questions from National MP for Whangarei, Phil Heatley, Mr Hawkins said the Fire Commission had told him there were no plans to close Kamo Volunteer Fire Brigade, “or any Northland volunteer fire brigade”.

“In fact, a new station has recently been approved for volunteers at Onerahi,” Mr Hawkins said.

Raising fears of closure in a community which included families still reeling from fire related tragedies and still coming to terms with the loss of loved ones, was despicable, Mr Hawkins said.

“It’s probably to be expected from a National MP as we go into an election, but raising baseless fears in an already traumatised community is nothing short of despicable.”

Mr Hawkins said he had visited the Kamo Fire Station twice in the last 15 months and had been impressed by the work of the volunteers. ENDS
