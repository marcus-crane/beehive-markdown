6 June 2002Media Statement  
Yesterday’s leftovers reheated

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said Act’s economic policy for the 2002 general elections was yesterday’s leftovers reheated.

“Last election Act won just 7.04 percent of the vote yet here it is serving up the same fare again: tax cuts, asset sales, the dismantling of worker’ rights, the removal of any constructive role for the government in the economy and a return to the discredited ‘trickle down’ theory.

“We’ve heard it all before, and the public knows that it means a reduction in social services and a huge increase in social inequality.

“Either Act is incapable of understanding that its ideas are repellent to the vast majority of New Zealanders or it understands but is incapable of responding.

“It is a sign of madness to keep doing the same thing and expect a different result,” Dr Cullen said.
