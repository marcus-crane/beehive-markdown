Jim Anderton says he has proposed Pokarekare Ana be given status as a national song, alongside our National Anthem.

“Sport should not be the only source of New Zealand identity and pride,” Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said.

“What makes New Zealanders unique is our identity – as individuals, as communities and as a nation.

“There is nowhere else like New Zealand. Our land and our people, our cultures and our heritage are special.

“If New Zealand is to do better economically and socially we need to be more confident about who we are,” said Jim Anderton.

“One of the distinctive musical sounds of New Zealand is Pokarekare Ana. For New Zealanders overseas to hear it playing is spine tingling. I would support giving Pokarekare Ana status as a national song for less formal occasions than our national anthem.”

“The Australians have Waltzing Matilda alongside their national anthem and Pokarekare Ana could fit proudly alongside ours.

Progressive Coalition policies encouraging New Zealanders to take ownership of their own destiny will be released during the campaign.
