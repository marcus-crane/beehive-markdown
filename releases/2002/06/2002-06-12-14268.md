EMBARGOED TO 8.30AM, 31 MAY 2002

Howick’s Picton St police station is to relocate to larger premises in nearby Moore St, Police Minister George Hawkins, said today.

Police will move to the Manukau City Council owned building, currently housing the Howick Ward office, once the building had been extensively refitted.

The refit was expected to cost between $600,00-$800,000.

Mr Hawkins said the move suited the needs of both parties.

“The Picton St station has become cramped and is no longer suitable for staff, while the Moore St property has room for 35 staff, but currently houses only 13,” he said.

The new office will be the base for 37 sworn and non-sworn police staff, with no reduction in staff numbers.

“We expect the new building will come as a welcome relief for staff who have had to work in less than adequate conditions,” Mr Hawkins said.

Council staff will begin the move from the Howick Ward office in October. ENDS
