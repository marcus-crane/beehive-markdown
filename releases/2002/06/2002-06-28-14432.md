Settlement of the Ngati Kahu historical Treaty claims will move a step closer tomorrow when Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson travels to Karepori Marae in the Far North.

There she will formally mark the Crown’s recent decision to recognise the mandate of Te Runanga-a-Iwi o Ngati Kahu (the Runanga) to represent Ngati Kahu in negotiations.

“I am delighted Ngati Kahu have achieved this, the first milestone in the Treaty settlement process,” Margaret Wilson.

“Far North representations have long been fraught with differing views on how to progress toward negotiations and ultimately settlements. This Deed of Mandate is the result of tireless efforts by many people over many years.”

“The Runanga have demonstrated they have a strong support base and have accepted the terms and conditions of the mandate, which requires the involvement of all of Ngati Kahu.”

Margaret Wilson said the next step is for Crown officials to work with the Runanga to develop the Terms of Negotiation.
