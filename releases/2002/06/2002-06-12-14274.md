Jim Anderton confirmed that he always understood from the Progressive Coalition that the new party would not qualify for broadcasting funding unless it had been registered for three months before the dissolution of parliament.

“They always understood that and so did I.”

“Broadcasting funding is, however, only one part of any election campaign and we will be using other opportunities to get our message across.

“Forming a new party in these circumstances in some ways is ‘mission impossible’. However, I am standing on an excellent record of achievements and the commitment to be a stable coalition partner for Labour.

“Because it appears more than probable that I will again receive the confidence of the people of Wigram voters, and because the Prime Minister has said she would like to see me in Cabinet again, any MPs elected with me will be in a strong position to further the achievements started in this term of Government.

“A vote for the list which I am on is a vote for MPs who will be part of the next Government,” Jim Anderton said.

Jim Anderton says he will make an announcement on standing for the election on Tuesday after parliament has been dissolved.
