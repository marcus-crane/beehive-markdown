The National Party’s defence policy makes airforce jet fighters more important than jobs, deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton says.  
“National is saying that buying a fleet of fighter jets is a higher priority than jobs, health care or education.  
“They have made it their most important issue by announcing their policy the day after the election is called.  
“The message National is trying to send is that fighter jets are the most important election issue.  
“I believe jobs are more important than jets.  
“National can’t attack the economy because the regional economies of all 14 regions of New Zealand are thriving and 104,000 new jobs have been created in two years.  
“It can’t attack the government on health or education, because it still wants to reduce essential public services such as health care and increase fees for education. That is why National is able to make its number one commitment the purchase of a fleet of fighter jets,” Jim Anderton said.
