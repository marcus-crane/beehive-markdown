Foreign Minister Phil Goff will be hosted by his Australian counterpart, Alexander Downer in Canberra for their regular six-monthly Ministerial consultations.

“We will be discussing a wide range of topics, including New Zealand-Australia matters, the South Pacific as well as regional and global issues.

“The India-Pakistan situation will be on the agenda as both New Zealand and Australia look to diplomatic solutions to address the tensions in the region.

“Progress on security and peace in the Solomon Islands will be a key discussion item relating to the Pacific.

“New Zealand and Australia continue to work together on combating the problem of people smuggling.

“CER’s 20th anniversary, the Prime Minister’s recent visit to Australia and the fight against terrorism are among other matters which will be discussed,” Mr Goff said.

Friday’s meeting follows on from the Mr Goff and Mr Downer’s last Ministerial meeting in Queenstown in December 2001.
