The Government is moving to ensure the quality of home care services for people with disabilites in the lower North Island is improved and services are better placed to meet every one’s needs, says Minister for Disability Issues and Associate Minister of Health Ruth Dyson.

Earlier this year eight out of 15 current providers of home care services in Hawkes Bay, Hutt Valley, Manawatu/Horowhenua/Tararua, Wairarapa and Wellington/Kapiti were to lose their contracts because they did not meet Ministry of Health requirements.

Those contracts have since been rolled over while the Ministry develops a new collaborative process that ensures provision of high quality, reliable and secure services.

The Ministry has now started a project, working with home care service providers, the Disabled Persons Assembly, ACC, district health boards and Age Concern, to develop a coordinated response to meeting home care needs.

Ruth Dyson says the aim of the project is for the Ministry to develop a continuing partnership with providers, caregivers and clients to achieve:  
·high quality, reliable and secure services;  
·a stable workforce with appropriate training;  
·monitoring provisions which include client satisfaction;  
·open and informed complaints procedures, and opportunity for improvement of services in response to any complaints;  
·cooperation between the Ministry of Health, district health boards and ACC on provision of services;  
·constructive partnerships and working relationships between all parties – the ministry, providers, clients and caregivers.

“This is the type of cooperative and constructive approach that we intend to develop throughout the health and disability system,” says Ms Dyson. “It will result in high quality, reliable and secure home care services, where all the parties work as a team to ensure everyone’s needs are being met.”
