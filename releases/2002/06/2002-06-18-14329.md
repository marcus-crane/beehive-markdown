Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Tariana Turia saluted her colleague Sandra Lee today, following Ms Lee’s announcement that she will not seek re-election to Parliament.

“I hope Sandra Lee’s voice will continue to be heard on matters affecting our people, long after her departure from Parliament at the end of this term,” said Tariana Turia.

“Sandra has been a passionate advocate for tangata whenua and Maori communities, while she was in opposition, and even more effectively as a Cabinet Minister in this Government.

“She fought to ensure that tangata whenua voices were heard, and their opinions considered, by Ministers and officials, as part of the ordinary processes of government.

“Conservation and Local Government are tremendously important to tangata whenua. These portfolios can be a battleground, or a forum where constructive relations can build up trust.

“As a Minister, Sandra helped establish solid working relationships and clear communication between tangata whenua and the Government. New Zealand has seen the benefit, and we can all learn from that approach.

“I have worked most closely with Sandra as Associate Minister of Maori Affairs, and I want to pay tribute to her vision and determination that our people should be able to take charge of their own development,” said Tariana Turia.
