Foreign Affairs Minister, Phil Goff, condemned the latest suicide bombing in Jerusalem which killed 19 people.“There is absolutely no cause which justifies the deliberate murder of children and civilians.“Hamas stands condemned for the killing of these people and the further entrenching of bitterness, anger and hatred that it will cause.“These extremists however must not be allowed by their actions to exercise a veto over the resumption of peace talks to end the violence.“The killing of innocent people on both sides emphasises the need for both Israeli and Palestinian leadership to return to negotiations aimed at resolving the conflict. “The endless cycle of attack and retaliation can only serve to increase the suffering of Israelis and Palestinians alike.“Both sides and their international supporters need to focus on a settlement which guarantees Israel’s right to secure and recognised borders and the Palestinian’s right to their own state and the opportunity to improve their social and economic conditions,” Mr Goff said.
