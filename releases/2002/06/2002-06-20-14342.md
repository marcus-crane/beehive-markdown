Associate Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Judith Tizard today praised the J. Paul Getty Trust for awarding $100,000 from the prestigious Getty Grant Program to the Antarctic Heritage Trust.

“I’m delighted with this vote of confidence by such a reputable international agency,” said Judith Tizard.

The grant is the largest Architectural Conservation Planning Getty Grant ever given to a New Zealand institution, and the first to benefit a project in Antarctica.

The funds will help the Antarctic Heritage Trust in planning its project to conserve historic huts built by the first Antarctic explorers.

“This international recognition is an indication of the importance of the Trust’s work in Antarctica,” said Judith Tizard. “It is recognition that what the Antarctic Heritage Trust is doing is significant not only to New Zealand, but to the world.

“I would like to warmly thank the Getty Grant Program for its generosity, and congratulate the Antarctic Heritage Trust on this international acknowledgement of its pioneering work.”
