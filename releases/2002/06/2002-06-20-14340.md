Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed the decision of the Brazilian court in Macapa to find the six men accused of killing Sir Peter Blake guilty.

"The government is pleased that the perpetrators of this appalling crime have been brought to justice, giving some closure to this tragic event.

"We thank the Brazilian Federal authorities for the prompt manner in which they have dealt with this tragedy.

"Although the verdict will not bring Sir Peter back, it will at least give the Blake family the consolation of knowing that his killers have been brought to justice," Helen Clark said.

The verdict and sentence were announced today in open court in Macapa, Brazil.

Sir Peter was shot dead on 5 December 2001 during a bungled burglary attempt on board the Seamaster which was anchored on the Amazon River near Macapa, Brazil.
