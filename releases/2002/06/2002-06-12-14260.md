Expenditure on capital works within the Police force has topped $90 million in the past two years, Police Minister, George Hawkins, said today.

‘Since July 2000, Government investment in police capital items has included $31.4 million on vehicles, $24 million on property, $22 million on information technology and $14.3 million on minor and other capital projects,” Mr Hawkins said.

The $24 million spent on police property in that period compared with $1million spent in the last two years of the previous National government, he said.

“Specifically, approved projects included $3.2 million on a new Police station for Invercargill, $2.1 million in Paraparaumu, 2.5 million in Oamaru, $1.8 million on the Manurewa station, $800,000 on refurbishment of the station at Howick, and $600,000 on extensions to the station in Kaikohe,” he said.

Police had committed $12 million to capital expenditure for the years 2000/01 and $10 million for the period 2001/2002. ENDS
