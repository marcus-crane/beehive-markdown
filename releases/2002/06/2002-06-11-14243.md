Associate Minister of Energy Paul Swain announced today that the Government and other parties have signed an agreement for the funding of the permanent resettlement of Mr and Mrs Hoffman.

The New Plymouth couple were forced out of their home last August when an abandoned oil well began leaking a mixture of water and small amounts of oil and gas in their backyard. Since moving out of their home the Hoffmans have been living in rented accommodation paid for by the Government.

“I am pleased that Mr and Mrs Hoffman will be able to put this behind them and get on with their lives,” said Mr Swain.

“Our priority has always been to see that the Hoffmans are resettled and it is pleasing that we have been able to reach an agreement with the other parties and the Hoffmans on a comprehensive package,” said Mr Swain.

Work is continuing on the best way to plug the well. “The Government is working hard to finalise preparations for the plugging of the well,” said Mr Swain. Officials from Crown Minerals are working with the local councils and representatives of the oil industry to determine the best technical solution. “ I want to assure everyone concerned that the Government is committed to plugging this well,” said Mr Swain.
