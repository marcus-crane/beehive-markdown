Media Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Internal Affairs Minister, George Hawkins, has called on New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown, to stop his attacks on the personal integrity of Chief Censor, Bill Hastings.

Mr Hawkins was responding to another call from Mr Brown that Mr Hastings be removed from his job.

“I reiterate what I said only two weeks ago to Mr Brown’s first demand Mr Hastings be removed from his job, which is: I have faith in Mr Hastings’ work, in the work of his staff and in the processes followed by his office,” Mr Hawkins said.

Contrary to Mr Brown’s latest media release, he was not having second thoughts on Mr Hasting’s suitability for the role of Chief Censor.

“I repeat, I have no intention of seeking Mr Hasting’s removal from his office,” Mr Hawkins said.

Mr Hasting’s current term in the role expires in October.

As was appropriate in the lead up to a general election, a number of political parties, including New Zealand First, were being consulted on Mr Hastings reappointment, Mr Hawkins said.
