Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton reported today that all 14 regions of New Zealand are showing positive growth, with nine of them growing at over four percent.

He also announced the completion of the Tararua Regional Partnership agreement.

“All the regions of New Zealand are now actively participating in regional partnership plans. This fulfils one of my key election commitments.

“Regional partnerships are revitalising our regions and communities and creating sustainable jobs.

“The latest report from Industry New Zealand says that 81 innovative companies have received a total of $6.6 million in Business Growth Grants.

“We have also made 522 Enterprise Awards totalling $4.6.

“These programmes illustrate this Government’s commitment to investing in regional development.

“Investment at this level has had a profound and positive impact on small businesses and entrepeneurs throughout the regions and cities of New Zealand.

“Public-private partnerships allow New Zealand businesses to speed their growth, create jobs and secure our economic future.”

Latest figures show that over 100,000 new jobs have been created during the first two years of this coalition government.

Or as Jim Anderton describes it, “One new job every 12 and a half minutes.”
