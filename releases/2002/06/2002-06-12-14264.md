17 May 2002Media Statement

Internal Affairs Minister, George Hawkins, supports the work of the Chief Censor, Bill Hastings, and has no intention of seeking his removal from office.

"I have faith in Mr Hastings’ work and in the processes followed by his office," Mr Hawkins said today.

He was replying to a media statement released this morning by New Zealand First MP, Peter Brown.

Mr Brown said he had arranged to meet Mr Hawkins next week, and intended to seek the present censor’s removal on the grounds he had 'failed dismally to uphold the required standards of decency on behalf of the community'.

Mr Brown said as a former Mayor, Mr Hawkins would be aware of the dangers to communities of the 'unchecked dissemination of unadulterated violence, sex and wanton destruction which has become the hallmark of the current censor’s approvals in recent times'.

Mr Hawkins said the only truth in the press release was that he had agreed to meet Mr Brown.

"I will meet with Mr Brown, if only to explain the processes used by the Chief Censor to maintain a balance between control of objectionable and restricted publications and individual freedom of choice," he said. ENDS
