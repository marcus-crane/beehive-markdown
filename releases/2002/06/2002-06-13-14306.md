Labour remains committed to the introduction of a new Holidays Act, Labour Minister Margaret Wilson said today.

Earlier this year the Government announced key changes to current holidays legislation that would provide more certainty and clarity around leave entitlements, enhanced entitlement to bereavement leave and to sick and domestic leave, and the payment of penal rates for working on a public holiday.

“Labour Department officials have been working on the technical detail of the proposals in consultation with the Council of Trade Unions and Business New Zealand since they were first announced,” Margaret Wilson said. “This work will continue with the aim of introducing a Bill post-election.”

Margaret Wilson said Labour had also clearly signalled its intention to continue working toward a solution for the protection of employees’ terms and conditions of employment in the event of sale or transfer of business, or where the work of employees is contracted out.

“Pay equity is another area in which Labour has signalled its intention to continue to research options around equal pay for work of equal value,” she said.
