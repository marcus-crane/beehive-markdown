Cabinet Minister Sandra Lee today confirmed rumours that she has been consulting family and Auckland Central electorate supporters this week on the possibility she may retire from Parliament.  
Ms Lee said she had decided to make a statement to “clear the air” because as she continued her discussions with family and friends, it was inevitable that a growing number of people would become aware she might not stand again.  
“I have been under pressure to stand again to contest the Auckland Central electorate against my Cabinet colleague Judith Tizard, but I do not wish to split the centre-left vote and allow a repeat of the Auckland city Mayoralty debacle,” Ms Lee said.  
“I believe the only reason John Banks is Mayor is because the vote was split, and Aucklanders, in particular pensioners, are suffering as a result.  
“It is no secret that I considered at the commencement of this Parliamentary term that it was likely to be my final term in the House, but the melt-down of the Alliance threw up important factors that had to be considered such as the stability of the government itself.”  
She said an announcement will be made on Monday as to her future intentions.
