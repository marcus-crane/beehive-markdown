Justice Minister Phil Goff has recommended to the Governor General the convictions of Alec Waugh be referred back to the High Court.

Mr Goff asked former High Court Judge Sir Thomas Thorp to conduct an independent review into Mr Waugh’s application for the Royal prerogative of mercy.

“I have received and considered Sir Thomas’s report and have concluded in the light of Sir Thomas’s recommendations that the matter should be referred to the High Court.

“The High Court can consider questions relating to Mr Waugh’s convictions and whether he should be granted a rehearing of the charges.

“I am prohibited from commenting further on the matters contained in the report as Mr Waugh’s case is subjudice.

“It is important not to prejudice matters that will come before the court,” Mr Goff said.
