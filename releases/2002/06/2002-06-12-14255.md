Charities working party delivers 2nd report

The charities working party has recommended changes to make it easier for individuals to receive tax rebates on donations to charitable organisations working overseas, such as the Red Cross.

In its second and final report the government appointed working party also comments on improving the definition of charitable purpose.

“This work is of high quality and will be a valuable resource but I believe we should not make any changes in this important and complex area until we have seen the results of similar work being done in other commonwealth countries.

“Accordingly I do not anticipate any legislative change to the definition in the immediate future,” Dr Cullen said.

The report is available on www.treasury.govt.nz/charities
