62 innovative New Zealand businesses have received funding in Round 17 and 18 of the Enterprise Awards Scheme, Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton announced today. This brings the total to well over 500 since the programme began in August 2000.

To date, the Enterprise Awards Scheme has given 522 awards totalling $4.62 million.

The awards will help fund the development of a wide variety of innovative enterprises, ranging from biotechnology to reusable paper products to expansion of the South Island wine market. Additional products include designer textiles, an eco-friendly cleaning solution, free-flow mince and a scallop-shucking machine, among many others.

Jim Anderton was impressed with both the quality and range of businesses represented in the latest rounds of Enterprise Awards.

"The recipients of these awards prove yet again that New Zealand comes up with some of the most interesting, exciting and innovative business ideas in the world.”

“They are a perfect example of the kind of creativity and ingenuity that will ensure New Zealand’s future prosperity.”

"I am committed to creating more jobs in every region of New Zealand, and that's why supporting New Zealand entrepreneurs is so important to me.”

"Hundreds of small Kiwi businesses are better off because of this Coalition Government's jobs machine.”

Round 19 is currently being assessed and will be announced in the coming months.

Businesses interested in applying for an Enterprise Award should contact Industry NZ.
