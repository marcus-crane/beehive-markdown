The United Future parliamentary caucus agrees to provide confidence and supply for the term of this Parliament, to a Labour/Progressive government with the objective of:

Providing stable government over the next term of Parliament, so as to implement a comprehensive policy programme aimed at increasing economic growth, reducing inequality and improving the social and economic well-being of all New Zealanders and their families in a manner which is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.

Good faith and no surprises  
All parties to this agreement will operate on a good faith and no surprises basis for the term of this Parliament.

Policy Programme  
It is agreed that the detail of the policy programme will be based on the manifestos of the government coalition partners and will take account of the policy priorities of the United Future Party.

It is acknowledged that policy initiatives advanced by United Future during this Parliamentary term will be considered by the government and resolved according to the procedures set out in this agreement.

In particular the government will, as immediate priorities, in consultation with the Leader of United Future,  
·By the end of this year develop proposals for a Commission for the Family which will have regard to the United Future policy platform, (attached as Appendix A), and relevant parts of the Labour Manifesto, including the Parenting Council initiative, with a view to implementation in the 2003/04 financial year.  
·Pass, by the end of this year, strong victims rights legislation, including increased support for victims support groups.  
·Ensure that new transport legislation is introduced and passed that includes provisions for alternative funding options to facilitate the accelerated development of new roading infrastructure.

The government will not introduce legislation to change the legal status of cannabis and will implement a comprehensive drug strategy aimed at protecting young people and educating them on the dangers of drug use.

Consultative arrangements  
The government will consult with United Future on a range of issues including:  
·The broad outline of the legislative programme and the priorities within it.  
·Key legislative measures.  
·Major policy issues.  
·Broad budget parameters.

That consultation will occur in a timely fashion so that the views of United Future can be incorporated into final decision making.

Formal consultation will be managed between the Prime Minister’s Office and the Office of the Leader of United Future, and there will be ongoing relationships between relevant portfolio Ministers and United Future spokespeople.

Regular leadership meetings (approximately monthly), will be scheduled between the government and United Future.

Briefings  
It is agreed that relevant spokespeople within United Future will be briefed on significant issues which are likely to be politically sensitive before any public announcements are made.

Confidentiality  
It is agreed that where briefings are provided to United Future, or where United Future is involved in a consultative arrangement with regard to legislation, policy or budgetary matters, all such discussions shall be confidential unless otherwise agreed.

In the event that government papers are provided to United Future in the course of consultation or briefings they shall be treated as confidential and shall not be released or the information used for any public purpose without the express agreement of the relevant Minister.

In the event that Cabinet or Cabinet committee papers are provided to United Future for the purposes of consultation they shall be provided to a designated person within the Office of the Leader who will provide a formal receipt and take responsibility for ensuring they are accorded the appropriate degree of confidentiality.

All papers provided to United Future shall be copied to the Prime Ministers Office

Collective responsibility  
Although United Future will not be bound by collective responsibility on government decisions, where there has been full participation in the development of a policy initiative, and that participation has led to an agreed position, it is expected that all parties to this agreement will publicly support the process and the outcome.

Procedural Motions  
United Future agrees that it will support the government on procedural motions in the House and in Select Committees unless United Future has previously advised that such support is not forthcoming.

The Government agrees that it will operate a no surprises policy in terms of procedural motions it intends to put before the House or a select committee.

Select Committees  
United Future and the Government will develop an agreed position on the makeup and operation of select committees.

Legislative Programme  
Support for particular legislative measures which do not relate to confidence or supply will be negotiated on a case by case basis.
