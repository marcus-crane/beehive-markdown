More evidence that innovative small businesses around New Zealand are growing in partnership with the government…

Another thirty-six of the most innovative new enterprises received a boost today with the release of the twentieth round of Industry New Zealand’s Enterprise Awards.

Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton said the release of the latest round comes at the same time as a survey showing 81 per cent of small businesses expect an increase in profitability over the next six months.

“One of the most common complaints from small businesses is that they get ignored and that there isn’t enough assistance for them. The Government is working to ensure there is support through Industry New Zealand’s BIZ programme, helping businesses to get up and running and to grow,” Jim Anderton said.

“There are thousands of small enterprises around New Zealand with exciting stories to tell. With the release today of another 36 enterprise awards, worth of $383,000, the number of accepted awards has reached 588 since October 2000, worth almost $5 million.

“The Government, through Industry New Zealand, is working in partnership with the most innovative New Zealand businesses that have the highest potential to grow and create new jobs and wealth.”

Entrepreneurs or small to medium sized business owners can receive a maximum of $20,000 from an Industry New Zealand Enterprise Award, which can be used to fund up to 50 percent of the cost of a project.

Small businesses and entrepreneurs interested in Enterprise Awards and other services and support from Industry New Zealand can look at the website www.industrynz.govt.nz.
