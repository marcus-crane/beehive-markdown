This report outlines the Government's present approach to sustainable development and illustrates this by describing a wide range of activities across the government sector.

But as it stands the report is incomplete. While it is a useful step towards a New Zealand Sustainable Development Strategy, it is clear that further work is needed.

The next step in the process is the World Summit in Johannesburg. After the Summit, we will review the Programme of Action and decide whether there are new issues that New Zealand needs to address.

The Government will also need to form a view about priorities. Some of the priorities are already evident in this report - such as economic growth, the implications of international population change for New Zealand, decoupling of economic growth from environmental harm, governance for sustainable development, and implementation of the Local Government Bill. Others may emerge from the World Summit and the process of engagement that follows.

Once a draft strategy has been written there will be a process of consultation and an opportunity for everyone to comment and contribute their ideas.
