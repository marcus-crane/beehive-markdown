Guest accommodation is booming, according to a report released today by Statistics New Zealand. The latest Accommodation Survey shows that all regions recorded more guest nights in June 2002 than in June 2001.

Southland led the way, with a 26% increase in occupancy rates when comparing the two June months. Overall, total guest nights have increased by seven percent.

Economic, Industry and Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton was pleased by these results.

“The regions of New Zealand continue to show positive growth, and both local and overseas tourists are playing a significant part.”

“It’s vital to keep fostering opportunities for growth rates like these in order to solidify New Zealand’s economic recovery.”

The occupancy rate for short-term commercial accommodation in June of this year also showed an increase to 41 percent, up from 39 percent in June 2001.
