Coalition Agreement between the Labour and Progressive Coalition Parties in Parliament

The Labour and Progressive Coalition parties in Parliament agree to form a government with the objective of:

Providing stable government over the next term of Parliament, so as to implement a comprehensive policy programme aimed at increasing economic growth, reducing inequality and improving the social and economic well-being of all New Zealanders and their families in a manner which is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.

Objective  
To provide stable government over the next term of Parliament so as to implement a comprehensive policy programme aimed at increasing economic growth, reducing inequality and improving the social and economic well-being of all New Zealanders and their families in a manner which is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.

Good faith and no surprises  
Both parties to this agreement will operate in government on a good faith and no surprises basis.

Maintaining identity  
The coalition partners will work in good faith to further the objectives of government, while accepting the need for distinctive party political identities within government, especially in relation to the smaller party being able to maintain a separate but responsible identity. Agree to disagree provisions will apply where necessary and in such circumstances the Progressive Coalition will be free to express alternative views publicly and in Parliament.

Cooperation with other parties  
The government will enter into agreements with other parties to secure confidence and supply and to facilitate the implementation of the preferred legislative programme in Parliament.

Policy Programme  
The manifestos of Labour and the Progressive Coalition have much in common with both parties being committed to a progressive social democratic policy programme.  
Reflecting its electoral mandate, Labour will lead the broad policy programme, recognising the Progressive Coalition’s general priorities of employment, support for low income families, health and education and its wish to make specific progress on:

\- ensuring better co-ordination and integration of industry assistance.  
\- implementation of a comprehensive drug strategy aimed at protecting young people and educating them on the dangers of drug use.  
\- policy to promote a better balance of work and family responsibilities.

The detail of the policy programme for this term of Parliament will be set out in the Speech from the Throne

Cabinet Government  
Cabinet positions will be allocated by the Prime Minister after appropriate consultation. The Progressive Coalition will have one Cabinet position. The Cabinet Manual provisions will apply to the cabinet process and decision-making will be by consensus.

It is accepted that because of the relative numbers in the coalition, quorum rules relating to the need to have at least one member from each coalition party present for a quorum will not generally apply.
