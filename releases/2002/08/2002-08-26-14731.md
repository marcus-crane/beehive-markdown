Environment Minister Marian Hobbs says she is happy for certain aspects of the Environmental Risk Management Authority's operations to be reviewed as discussed with the Green Party.

"ERMA's role is crucial to protecting our health and safety in applications for genetic modification research and development," Marian Hobbs said. "I want to ensure the Authority has the capacity to meet the demands placed on it by the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act.

"I will be discussing with the Greens and ERMA the detail of a review."
