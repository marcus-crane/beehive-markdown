Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff has welcomed the arrest of the person who is alleged to have killed New Zealand construction supervisor, Kevin O’Brien.

The suspect gave himself up in Honiara on Friday and has been charged with murder. He is expected to appear in court this Friday.

“Mr O’Brien was stabbed shortly after arriving at work early on 11 February. The suspect reportedly escaped back to his home island of Malaita some days later.

“Since then the New Zealand High Commissioner in Honiara, Heather Riddell, has made constant representations at all levels of the Solomon Islands government, including to Prime Minister Kemakeza, urging that action be taken to bring the alleged killer to justice.

“Mr O’Brien’s partner and child in Honiara and his family in New Zealand have endured a long and frustrating wait for this day. I am pleased for their sake that the arrest has finally been made.

“I am hopeful the alleged killer will now be subject to the due process of the law and that justice will be done,” Mr Goff said.
