ACT police spokesperson Muriel Newman is incorrect and misleading in her claims relating to crime figures released last month, Justice Minister Phil Goff said today.

“Ms Newman alleges in a statement issued today that I and Police Minister George Hawkins ‘refused to release the real crime statistics and instead released misleading figures showing crime was declining.’

“This allegation is completely false and Ms Newman knows it.

“The figures released were exactly those as provided by the New Zealand Police. They were provisional figures for the ten months to 30 April 2002. That they were provisional only was stressed to the media.

“The provisional figures were released because they had been requested under the Official Information Act by ACT MP Rodney Hide. Mr Hide’s request was complied with.

“If Ms Newman is disputing the veracity of the figures released then she is accusing the New Zealand Police of lying. Such a suggestion is scurrilous.

“The only person guilty of misleading anyone is Ms Newman,” Mr Goff said.
