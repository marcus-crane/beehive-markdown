Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff expressed concern at the increased tension between China and Taiwan following remarks made by Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian in a recent speech that threatened to upset the uneasy calm between the two sides.

“A deterioration in relations across the Taiwan Strait would benefit no one and has the potential to destabilise the region. New Zealand therefore takes a close interest in what is happening.

“The issue between China and Taiwan is a matter for the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve. Our hope is that their differences will be settled by peaceful means, and we encourage both sides to resume dialogue as soon as possible.

“New Zealand established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1972 at which time official dealings with Taiwan ceased. Under its “one China” policy, the New Zealand Government recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,” Mr Goff said.
