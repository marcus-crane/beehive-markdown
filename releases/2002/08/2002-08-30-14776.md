Health Minister Annette King said today that Pharmac's post-election  
briefing papers to the incoming government identify the development of  
stronger relationships in the health sector and the continuing challenge of  
managing the pharmaceutical budget.

The papers say the Government's drug-buying agency has strengthened its  
relationships on a number of levels in the past year, through formal  
agreements with all 21 District Health Boards, the development of a Maori  
Responsiveness Strategy, enhanced relations with the pharmaceutical  
industry and meetings with clinicians.

Ms King said she agreed with Pharmac's belief that development of these  
relationships with DHBs and the wider health sector will be crucial in  
working to improve health outcomes for New Zealanders.

"While keeping expenditure within budget, Pharmac has still been able to  
provide new or enhanced access to a number of drugs to treat conditions  
such as arthritis, high cholesterol, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and  
schizophrenia in the past year," she said.

Pharmac's briefing also identifies a number of challenges ahead, including  
continuing to maintain pharmaceutical expenditure within budget, and  
improving access to health information.

The briefing is available on the Pharmac website [www.pharmac.govt.nz](http://www.pharmac.govt.nz)
