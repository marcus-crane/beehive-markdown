“The Ministry of Economic Development and Industry New Zealand post election briefings are an excellent snapshot of what has been achieved in less than three years, and highlight constructive options this Labour Progressive Government has for the next term of office,” Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton said today.

“The Ministry and Industry New Zealand have clearly outlined how to build on work already done and how to continue to address specific economic, industry, regional and business barriers to growth.

“The Ministry of Economic Development advises that the focus in the next three years should be on improving the whole of government approach, and continuing to operate flexible industry, regional and business programmes that can be adapted to changing conditions.

“I am pleased to see that Industry New Zealand has advised a strong commitment to growing a portfolio of world-class New Zealand businesses.

“Building on current assistance measures, the Industry New Zealand briefing calls for the wide range of industry programmes to be simplified into three broad service areas:  
·High growth-high impact potential businesses and projects.  
·Co-ordination and the removal of impediments to development.  
·Services for start-ups, small business and entrepreneurs.

“This makes a start on the Progressive policy of developing a one stop shop for business support and the Government will evaluate this advice in the coming weeks.

“The Ministry of Economic Development is working in partnership with industry and regional communities on a wide range of programmes to deliver the innovation New Zealand needs,” Jim Anderton said.
