Strong and viable public tertiary education is the goal of the Collaborating for Efficiency project, launched today by Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey.

“Tertiary institutions must be able to adapt to the more strategically focused environment in which they have to now operate. Some of our strongest institutions have already recognised that collaboration and co-operation can bring about significant benefits”, Steve Maharey told the inaugural meeting of the Collaborating for Efficiency steering group in Wellington today.

“I want the performance of the whole sector lifted so that all tertiary institutions can contribute effectively to New Zealand’s knowledge economy – individually and collectively”.

The project aims to identify and recognise good practice in tertiary institutions, and to make sure these practices are widely adopted.

“We want to help tertiary institutions to implement good practice and develop collaborative strategies, including considering areas in which shared services will benefit their operation”, said Steve Maharey.

Dr Andrew West, chair designate of the soon to be established Tertiary Education Commission, will also chair the Collaborating for Efficiency steering group.

“The project aims to assist universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and wananga to focus on achieving efficiencies in a range of areas from entrepreneurial activities through to capital costs and capital management.

“I’m pleased the government has set aside $500,000 for this project.

“This will be a key area of work for the Tertiary Education Commission. We’ll be working closely with tertiary education institutions, Crown Research Institutes and industry over the coming months so that we learn from their experiences and share best practice”, said Dr West.

The steering group is expected to report to government in May 2003.

Four sub-groups will support the steering group. They will work on:  
\* staffing costs;  
\* capital costs/capital management;  
\* entrepreneurial activity particularly in the areas of intellectual property and commercialisation; and  
\* sharing of library services.
