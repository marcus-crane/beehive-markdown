Jim Anderton is welcoming a second term of a centre left government.

“This Labour-Progressive government will build on the gains of the last two and a half years.

“This means more building in our regions and more jobs. Figures released today show that unemployment is down to 5.1 per cent, the lowest in 14 years. There has been employment growth for nine consecutive quarters and 115,000 additional jobs have been created since December 1999.

“The new Government will be a centre left coalition continuing to advance the policies of Labour and the Progressives working with other parties in Parliament.

“The four parties involved in the discussions should all gain from the formation of this new Labour-Progressive Government, and both United and the Greens will be involved with the programme over the next three years.

“United Future has committed to a three year term with a guarantee of confidence and supply for the Coalition.

The government will also work positively with the Greens in their key areas.

This will ensure a lively MMP parliament for 2002-5.

“I look forward to working for the Progressive Party’s priorities of employment, health and education, and the commitments made to new Zealand families, particularly children, during the election campaign,” said Jim Anderton.
