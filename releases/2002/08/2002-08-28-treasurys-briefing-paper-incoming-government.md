28 August 2002Media Statement  
Treasury briefing papers released

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today released the Treasury’s briefing papers to the incoming government.

“The Treasury has produced a high quality and pragmatic analysis focussed on two items at the top of the government’s agenda for this term: how to lift economic growth and how to extract maximum value from the public sector.

“This work reflects and builds on the government’s thinking in these areas and will be extremely useful in policy formulation,” Dr Cullen said.

A Guide to the Treasury discusses Treasury’s role and structure. The policy discussion is contained in Growing Higher Living Standards for New Zealanders.

Both documents are available on the Treasury website: www.treasury.govt.nz or from the 13th floor of the Treasury. Out of Wellington media wanting a copy mailed to them should contact Barbara Gibbons: 04-471-5983.

The Treasury is also offering a briefing today at 2pm;13th floor, The Treasury. Anyone interested in attending should contact Elisa Eckford: 04-471-5127.
