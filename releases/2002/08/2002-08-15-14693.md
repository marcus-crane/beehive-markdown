Labour Minister Margaret Wilson has welcomed the Council of Trade Union’s launch of the booklet “Unions, Innovation and Sustainable Development” at its National Affiliates’ Council meeting today.

“It’s good to see unions recognising the importance of economic development and contributing to a wider, ‘big picture’ debate about their role in improving New Zealand’s productivity, growth and social performance.”

In the area of employment relations, the last Government worked to recognise representatives of both workers and employers as social partners to be consulted in the endeavour to produce change both positive and workable at a practicable level.

This approach will continue in the next three-year term of government.

“It is certainly true these groups and the government do not always agree. It is important, though, to identify common ground, and to build on that. The CTU’s booklet rightly identifies the importance of productivity gains through training and technology, as well as through workplace organisation.”

“The Employment Relations Act, to be reviewed in the next three years, shored up unions’ participation in workplaces. The broad discussion in the CTU booklet bodes well for ongoing, constructive dialogue between social partners in this next term of government,” Margaret Wilson said.
