The number of young people taking up Modern Apprenticeships opportunities continues to increase – and has now topped 2,000.

Associate Education (Tertiary Education) Minister Steve Maharey today released figures showing that there were 2,049 Modern Apprentices in training at 31 December 2001, a 25% increase in three months.

“We are well on target to meet, or exceed, our target of 3,000 young people in Modern Apprenticeships training by the middle of this year.

“Over half of the Modern Apprentices (1,198) are 18 or younger when they start their training. I’m happy to see one of our aims for Modern Apprenticeships – getting young people back into industry training – is being so well achieved.

For young Maori, the rate of increase has been even greater, with a 32% increase since September, taking them to 380 Mäori Modern Apprentices.

“As I meet Modern Apprentices and their employers, I’m struck by their enthusiasm and commitment. Both groups comment to me that the structured training path and assistance provided by the Modern Apprenticeships co-ordinators really helps them achieve.

“Feedback from employers indicates the majority would not have been involved in structured industry training without it. It’s good to see these industries working to solve their own skills shortage problems.

“I congratulate everyone involved in building the Modern Apprenticeships success story. This includes the 26 industry groups already involved, the 46 Modern Apprenticeships co-ordinators, Skill New Zealand, and of course the 2,049 young people themselves,” Steve Maharey said.
